Mining frequent patterns without candidate generation,Jiawei Han; Jian Pei; Yiwen Yin,Abstract Mining frequent patterns in transaction databases; time-series databases; andmany other kinds of databases has been studied popularly in data mining research. Most ofthe previous studies adopt an Apriori-like candidate set generation-and-test approach.However; candidate set generation is still costly; especially when there exist prolific patternsand/or long patterns.

E cient and E ective Clustering Methods for Spatial Data Mining,Raymond T Ng; Jiawei Han,Abstract Spatial data mining is the discovery of interesting relationships and characteristicsthat may exist implicitly in spatial databases. In this paper; we explore whether clusteringmethods have a role to play in spatial data mining. To this end; we develop a new clusteringmethod called CLARANS which is based on randomized search. We also develop twospatial data mining algorithms that use CLARANS. Our analysis and experiments show thatwith the assistance of CLARANS; these two algorithms are very e ective and can lead todiscoveries that are di cult to nd with current spatial data mining algorithms. Furthermore;experiments conducted to compare the performance of CLARANS with that of existingclustering methods show that CLARANS is the most e cient.,Proceedings of VLDB,1994,2861

gspan: Graph-based substructure pattern mining,Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han,We investigate new approaches for frequent graph-based pattern mining in graph datasetsand propose a novel algorithm called gSpan (graph-based substructure pattern mining);which discovers frequent substructures without candidate generation. gSpan builds a newlexicographic order among graphs; and maps each graph to a unique minimum DFS codeas its canonical label. Based on this lexicographic order gSpan adopts the depth-first searchstrategy to mine frequent connected subgraphs efficiently.

-A Framework for Clustering Evolving Data Streams,Charu C Aggarwal; S Yu Philip; Jiawei Han; Jianyong Wang,This chapter discusses a framework for clustering evolving data streams. The clusteringproblem is a difficult problem for the data stream domain. This is because the large volumesof data arriving in a stream render most traditional algorithms too inefficient. In recent years;a few one-pass clustering algorithms have been developed for the data stream problem.Although such methods address the scalability issues of the clustering problem; they aregenerally blind to the evolution of the data and do not address the following issues:(1) thequality of the clusters is poor when the data evolves considerably over time.(2) A datastream clustering algorithm requires much greater functionality in discovering and exploringclusters over different portions of the stream. The widely used practice of viewing datastream clustering algorithms as a class of one-pass clustering algorithms is not very …,*,2003,1895
Discovery of multiple-level association rules from large databases,Jiawei Han; Yongjian Fu,Abstract Previous studies on mining association rules find rules at single concept level;however; mining association rules at multiple concept levels may lead to the discovery ofmore specific and concrete knowledge from data. In this study; a top-down progressivedeepening method is developed for mining multiplelevel association rules from largetransaction databases by extension of some existing association rule mining techniques. Agroup of variant algorithms are proposed based on the ways of sharing intermediate results;with the relative performance tested on different kinds of data. Relaxation of the ruleconditions for finding" level-crossing" association rules is also discussed in the paper.,VLDB,1995,1593
CMAR: Accurate and efficient classification based on multiple class-association rules,Wenmin Li; Jiawei Han; Jian Pei,Previous studies propose that associative classification has high classification accuracy andstrong flexibility at handling unstructured data. However; it still suffers from the huge set ofmined rules and sometimes biased classification or overfitting since the classification isbased on only a single high-confidence rule. The authors propose a new associativeclassification method; CMAR; ie; Classification based on Multiple Association Rules. Themethod extends an efficient frequent pattern mining method; FP-growth; constructs a classdistribution-associated FP-tree; and mines large databases efficiently. Moreover; it applies aCR-tree structure to store and retrieve mined association rules efficiently; and prunes ruleseffectively based on confidence; correlation and database coverage.

We train anensemble of classification models; such as C4. 5; RIPPER; naive Beyesian; etc.; fromsequential chunks of the data stream. The classifiers in the ensemble are judiciouslyweighted based on their expected classification accuracy on the test data under the time-evolving environment.

Mining sequential patterns by pattern-growth: The prefixspan approach,Jian Pei; Jiawei Han; Behzad Mortazavi-Asl; Jianyong Wang; Helen Pinto; Qiming Chen; Umeshwar Dayal; Mei-Chun Hsu,Sequential pattern mining is an important data mining problem with broad applications.However; it is also a difficult problem since the mining may have to generate or examine acombinatorially explosive number of intermediate subsequences. Most of the previouslydeveloped sequential pattern mining methods; such as GSP; explore a candidategeneration-and-test approach [R. Agrawal et al.(1994)] to reduce the number of candidatesto be examined. However; this approach may not be efficient in mining large sequencedatabases having numerous patterns and/or long patterns. In this paper; we propose aprojection-based; sequential pattern-growth approach for efficient mining of sequentialpatterns. In this approach; a sequence database is recursively projected into a set of smallerprojected databases; and sequential patterns are grown in each projected database by …,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2004,1252
Maintenance of discovered association rules in large databases: An incremental updating technique,David W Cheung; Jiawei Han; Vincent T Ng; CY Wong,An incremental updating technique is developed for maintenance of the association rulesdiscovered by database mining. There have been many studies on efficient discovery ofassociation rules in large databases. However; it is nontrivial to maintain such discoveredrules in large databases because a database may allow frequent or occasional updates andsuch updates may not only invalidate some existing strong association rules but also turnsome weak rules into strong ones. An incremental updating technique is proposed forefficient maintenance of discovered association rules when new transaction data are addedto a transaction database.,Data Engineering; 1996.

Frequent pattern mining: current status and future directions,Jiawei Han; Hong Cheng; Dong Xin; Xifeng Yan,Abstract Frequent pattern mining has been a focused theme in data mining research for overa decade.

Recent studies have proposed an interesting alternative: miningfrequent closed itemsets and their corresponding rules; which has the same power asassociation mining but substantially reduces the number of rules to be presented. In thispaper; we propose an efficient algorithm; CLOSET; for mining closed itemsets; with thedevelopment of three techniques:(1) applying a compressed; frequent pattern tree FP-treestructure for mining closed itemsets without candidate generation;(2) developing a singleprefix path compression technique to identify frequent closed itemsets quickly; and (3)exploring a partition-based projection mechanism for scalable mining in large databases.Our performance study shows that CLOSET is efficient and scalable over large databases …,ACM SIGMOD workshop on research issues in data mining and knowledge discovery,2000,1198
Trajectory clustering: a partition-and-group framework,Jae-Gil Lee; Jiawei Han; Kyu-Young Whang,Abstract Existing trajectory clustering algorithms group similar trajectories as a whole; thusdiscovering common trajectories. Our key observation is that clustering trajectories as awhole could miss common sub-trajectories. Discovering common sub-trajectories is veryuseful in many applications; especially if we have regions of special interest for analysis. Inthis paper; we propose a new partition-and-group framework for clustering trajectories;which partitions a trajectory into a set of line segments; and then; groups similar linesegments together into a cluster. The primary advantage of this framework is to discovercommon sub-trajectories from a trajectory database. Based on this partition-and-groupframework; we develop a trajectory clustering algorithm TRACLUS. Our algorithm consists oftwo phases: partitioning and grouping. For the first phase; we present a formal trajectory …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,1087

It is also a difficult problem since one may need to examine a combinatoriallyexplosive number of possible subsequence patterns. Most of the previously developedsequential pattern mining methods follow the methodology of Apriori since the Apriori-basedmethod may substantially reduce the number of combinations to be examined.

CloSpan: Mining: Closed sequential patterns in large datasets,Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; Ramin Afshar,Abstract Previous sequential pattern mining algorithms mine the full set of frequentsubsequences satisfying a min-sup threshold in a sequence database. However; since afrequent long sequence contains a combinatorial number of frequent subsequences; suchmining will generate an explosive number of frequent subsequences for long patterns; whichis prohibitively expensive in both time and space. In this paper; we propose an alternativebut equally powerful solution: instead of mining the complete set of frequent subsequences;we mine frequent closed subsequences only; ie; those containing no super-sequence withthe same support (ie; occurrence frequency). By exploring novel global optimizationtechniques; an efficient algorithm; called CloSpan (Clo sed S equential pa tter n mining) isdeveloped; which outperforms the previous work by one order of magnitude.

Graph regularized nonnegative matrix factorization for data representation,Deng Cai; Xiaofei He; Jiawei Han; Thomas S Huang,Matrix factorization techniques have been frequently applied in information retrieval;computer vision; and pattern recognition. Among them; Nonnegative Matrix Factorization(NMF) has received considerable attention due to its psychological and physiologicalinterpretation of naturally occurring data whose representation may be parts based in thehuman brain. On the other hand; from the geometric perspective; the data is usually sampledfrom a low-dimensional manifold embedded in a high-dimensional ambient space. One thenhopes to find a compact representation; which uncovers the hidden semantics andsimultaneously respects the intrinsic geometric structure. In this paper; we propose a novelalgorithm; called Graph Regularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (GNMF); for thispurpose. In GNMF; an affinity graph is constructed to encode the geometrical information …,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,2011,967
CPAR: Classification based on predictive association rules,Xiaoxin Yin; Jiawei Han,Abstract Recent studies in data mining have proposed a new classification approach; calledassociative classification; which; according to several reports; such as [7; 6]; achieves higherclassification accuracy than traditional classification approaches such as C4. 5. However;the approach also suffers from two major deficiencies:(1) it generates a very large number ofassociation rules; which leads to high processing overhead; and (2) its confidence-basedrule evaluation measure may lead to overfitting. In comparison with associativeclassification; traditional rule-based classifiers; such as C4. 5; FOIL and RIPPER; aresubstantially faster but their accuracy; in most cases; may not be as high.

Discovery of spatial association rules in geographic information databases,Krzysztof Koperski; Jiawei Han,Abstract Spatial data mining; ie; discovery of interesting; implicit knowledge in spatialdatabases; is an important task for understanding and use of spatial data-and knowledge-bases. In this paper; an efficient method for mining strong spatial association rules ingeographic information databases is proposed and studied. A spatial association rule is arule indicating certain association relationship among a set of spatial and possibly somenonspatial predicates. A strong rule indicates that the patterns in the rule have relativelyfrequent occurrences in the database and strong implication relationships.

Exploratory mining and pruning optimizations of constrained associations rules,Raymond T Ng; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Jiawei Han; Alex Pang,Abstract From the standpoint of supporting human-centered discovery of knowledge; thepresent-day model of mining association rules suffers from the following seriousshortcomings:(i) lack of user exploration and control;(ii) lack of focus; and (iii) rigid notion ofrelationships. In effect; this model functions as a black-box; admitting little user interaction inbetween. We propose; in this paper; an architecture that opens up the black-box; andsupports constraint-based; human-centered exploratory mining of associations. Thefoundation of this architecture is a rich set of constraint constructs; including domain; class;and SQL-style aggregate constraints; which enable users to clearly specify whatassociations are to be mined. We propose constrained association queries as a means ofspecifying the constraints to be satisfied by the antecedent and consequent of a mined …,ACM Sigmod Record,1998,945
CLARANS: A method for clustering objects for spatial data mining,Raymond T.  Ng; Jiawei Han,Spatial data mining is the discovery of interesting relationships and characteristics that mayexist implicitly in spatial databases. To this end; this paper has three main contributions.First; it proposes a new clustering method called CLARANS; whose aim is to identify spatialstructures that may be present in the data. Experimental results indicate that; whencompared with existing clustering methods; CLARANS is very efficient and effective.Second; the paper investigates how CLARANS can handle not only point objects; but alsopolygon objects efficiently. One of the methods considered; called the IR-approximation; isvery efficient in clustering convex and nonconvex polygon objects. Third; building on top ofCLARANS; the paper develops two spatial data mining algorithms that aim to discoverrelationships between spatial and nonspatial attributes.

Efficient mining of partial periodic patterns in time series database,Jiawei Han; Guozhu Dong; Yiwen Yin,Partial periodicity search; ie; search for partial periodic patterns in time-series databases; isan interesting data mining problem. Previous studies on periodicity search mainly considerfinding full periodic patterns; where every point in time contributes (precisely orapproximately) to the periodicity. However; partial periodicity is very common in practicesince it is more likely that only some of the time episodes may exhibit periodic patterns. Wepresent several algorithms for efficient mining of partial periodic patterns; by exploring someinteresting properties related to partial periodicity such as the Apriori property and the max-subpattern hit set property; and by shared mining of multiple periods. The max-subpattern hitset property is a vital new property which allows us to derive the counts of all frequentpatterns from a relatively small subset of patterns existing in the time series.

Instead of mining all the subgraphs; we propose to mine closed frequent graphpatterns. A graph g is closed in a database if there exists no proper supergraph of g that hasthe same support as g.

Orthogonal laplacianfaces for face recognition,Deng Cai; Xiaofei He; Jiawei Han; H-J Zhang,Following the intuition that the naturally occurring face data may be generated by sampling aprobability distribution that has support on or near a submanifold of ambient space; wepropose an appearance-based face recognition method; called orthogonal Laplacianface.Our algorithm is based on the locality preserving projection (LPP) algorithm; which aims atfinding a linear approximation to the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator on theface manifold. However; LPP is nonorthogonal; and this makes it difficult to reconstruct thedata. The orthogonal locality preserving projection (OLPP) method produces orthogonalbasis functions and can have more locality preserving power than LPP. Since the localitypreserving power is potentially related to the discriminating power; the OLPP is expected tohave more discriminating power than LPP.

Graph indexing: a frequent structure-based approach,Xifeng Yan; Philip S Yu; Jiawei Han,Abstract Graph has become increasingly important in modelling complicated structures andschemaless data such as proteins; chemical compounds; and XML documents. Given agraph query; it is desirable to retrieve graphs quickly from a large database via graph-basedindices. In this paper; we investigate the issues of indexing graphs and propose a novelsolution by applying a graph mining technique. Different from the existing path-basedmethods; our approach; called gIndex; makes use of frequent substructure as the basicindexing feature. Frequent substructures are ideal candidates since they explore the intrinsiccharacteristics of the data and are relatively stable to database updates. To reduce the sizeof index structure; two techniques; size-increasing support constraint and discriminativefragments; are introduced.

Mining frequent patterns in data streams at multiple time granularities,Chris Giannella; Jiawei Han; Jian Pei; Xifeng Yan; Philip S Yu,Abstract: Although frequent-pattern mining has been widely studied and used; it ischallenging to extend it to data streams. Compared to mining from a static transaction dataset; the streaming case has far more information to track and far greater complexity tomanage. Infrequent items can become frequent later on and hence cannot be ignored. Thestorage structure needs to be dynamically adjusted to reflect the evolution of itemsetfrequencies over time. In this paper; we propose computing and maintaining all the frequentpatterns (which is usually more stable and smaller than the streaming data) and dynamicallyupdating them with the incoming data streams. We extended the framework to mine time-sensitive patterns with approximate support guarantee. We incrementally maintain tilted-timewindows for each pattern at multiple time granularities.

The study discloses some interesting relationships between locally large and globallylarge item sets and proposes an interesting distributed association rule mining algorithm;FDM (fast distributed mining of association rules); which generates a small number ofcandidate sets and substantially reduces the number of messages to be passed at miningassociation rules. A performance study shows that FDM has a superior performance over thedirect application of a typical sequential algorithm. Further performance enhancement leadsto a few variations of the algorithm.,Parallel and Distributed Information Systems; 1996.; Fourth International Conference on,1996,670

We note that LDA does not considerpairwise relations between different classes; it rather assumes equal within and between-class scatter matrices. As a result; we present a pairwise discriminant analysis algorithm forlearning class categories. Our pairwise linear discriminant analysis measures theseparability of two classes making use of the class centroids and variances. Our approach isbased upon a novel cost function with unitary constraints based on the aggregation ofpairwise costs for binary classes. We view the minimisation of this cost function as anunconstrained optimisation problem over a Grassmann manifold and solve using aprojected gradient method.

A framework for projected clustering of high dimensional data streams,Charu C Aggarwal; Jiawei Han; Jianyong Wang; Philip S Yu,Abstract The data stream problem has been studied extensively in recent years; because ofthe great ease in collection of stream data. The nature of stream data makes it essential touse algorithms which require only one pass over the data. Recently; single-scan; streamanalysis methods have been proposed in this context. However; a lot of stream data is high-dimensional in nature. High-dimensional data is inherently more complex in clustering;classification; and similarity search. Recent research discusses methods for projectedclustering over high-dimensional data sets. This method is however difficult to generalize todata streams because of the complexity of the method and the large volume of the datastreams. In this paper; we propose a new; high-dimensional; projected data streamclustering method; called HPStream. The method incorporates a fading cluster structure …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,524
Pathsim: Meta path-based top-k similarity search in heterogeneous information networks,Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han; Xifeng Yan; Philip S Yu; Tianyi Wu,ABSTRACT Similarity search is a primitive operation in database and Web search engines.With the advent of large-scale heterogeneous information networks that consist of multi-typed; interconnected objects; such as the bibliographic networks and social medianetworks; it is important to study similarity search in such networks. Intuitively; two objectsare similar if they are linked by many paths in the network. However; most existing similaritymeasures are defined for homogeneous networks. Different semantic meanings behindpaths are not taken into consideration. Thus they cannot be directly applied toheterogeneous networks. In this paper; we study similarity search that is defined among thesame type of objects in heterogeneous networks. Moreover; by considering different linkagepaths in a network; one could derive various similarity semantics. Therefore; we introduce …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,506
H-mine: Hyper-structure mining of frequent patterns in large databases,Jian Pei; Jiawei Han; Hongjun Lu; Shojiro Nishio; Shiwei Tang; Dongqing Yang,Methods for efficient mining of frequent patterns have been studied extensively by manyresearchers. However; the previously proposed methods still encounter some performancebottlenecks when mining databases with different data characteristics; such as dense vs.sparse; long vs. short patterns; memory-based vs. disk-based; etc. In this study; we proposea simple and novel hyper-linked data structure; H-struct and a new mining algorithm; H-mine; which takes advantage of this data structure and dynamically adjusts links in themining process. A distinct feature of this method is that it has very limited and preciselypredictable space overhead and runs really fast in memory-based setting. Moreover it canbe scaled up to very large databases by database partitioning; and when the data setbecomes dense;(conditional) FP-trees can be constructed dynamically as part of the …,Data Mining; 2001.

Mining multiple-level association rules in large databases,Jiawei Han; Yongjian Fu,A top-down progressive deepening method is developed for efficient mining of multiple-levelassociation rules from large transaction databases based on the a priori principle. A group ofvariant algorithms is proposed based on the ways of sharing intermediate results; with therelative performance tested and analyzed. The enforcement of different interestingnessmeasurements to find more interesting rules; and the relaxation of rule conditions for finding"level-crossing" association rules; are also investigated. The study shows that efficientalgorithms can be developed from large databases for the discovery of interesting andstrong multiple-level association rules.,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering,1999,495
Truth discovery with multiple conflicting information providers on the web,Xiaoxin Yin; Jiawei Han; S Yu Philip,The World Wide Web has become the most important information source for most of us.Unfortunately; there is no guarantee for the correctness of information on the Web.Moreover; different websites often provide conflicting information on a subject; such asdifferent specifications for the same product. In this paper; we propose a new problem;called Veracity; ie; conformity to truth; which studies how to find true facts from a largeamount of conflicting information on many subjects that is provided by various websites. Wedesign a general framework for the Veracity problem and invent an algorithm; calledTRUTHFlNDER; which utilizes the relationships between websites and their information; ie;a website is trustworthy if it provides many pieces of true information; and a piece ofinformation is likely to be true if it is provided by many trustworthy websites.

Document clustering using locality preserving indexing,Deng Cai; Xiaofei He; Jiawei Han,We propose a novel document clustering method which aims to cluster the documents intodifferent semantic classes. The document space is generally of high dimensionality andclustering in such a high dimensional space is often infeasible due to the curse ofdimensionality. By using locality preserving indexing (LPI); the documents can be projectedinto a lower-dimensional semantic space in which the documents related to the samesemantics are close to each other. Different from previous document clustering methodsbased on latent semantic indexing (LSI) or nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF); ourmethod tries to discover both the geometric and discriminating structures of the documentspace. Theoretical analysis of our method shows that LPI is an unsupervised approximationof the supervised linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method; which gives the intuitive …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2005,459
DMQL: A data mining query language for relational databases,Jiawei Han; Yongjian Fu; Wei Wang; Krzysztof Koperski; Osmar Zaiane,Abstract The emerging data mining tools and systems lead naturally to the demand of apowerful data mining query language; on top of which many interactive and exible graphicaluser interfaces can be developed. This motivates us to design a data mining querylanguage; DMQL; for mining di erent kinds of knowledge in relational databases. Portions ofthe proposed DMQL language have been implemented in our DBMiner system forinteractive mining of multiple-level knowledge in relational databases.,Proc. 1996 SiGMOD,1996,436
Locality Sensitive Discriminant Analysis.,Deng Cai; Xiaofei He; Kun Zhou; Jiawei Han; Hujun Bao,Abstract Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a popular data-analytic tool for studying theclass relationship between data points. A major disadvantage of LDA is that it fails todiscover the local geometrical structure of the data manifold. In this paper; we introduce anovel linear algorithm for discriminant analysis; called Locality Sensitive DiscriminantAnalysis (LSDA). When there is no sufficient training samples; local structure is generallymore important than global structure for discriminant analysis. By discovering the localmanifold structure; LSDA finds a projection which maximizes the margin between datapoints from different classes at each local area. Specifically; the data points are mapped intoa subspace in which the nearby points with the same label are close to each other while thenearby points with different labels are far apart.

SOBER: statistical model-based bug localization,Chao Liu; Xifeng Yan; Long Fei; Jiawei Han; Samuel P Midkiff,Abstract Automated localization of software bugs is one of the essential issues in debuggingaids. Previous studies indicated that the evaluation history of program predicates maydisclose important clues about underlying bugs. In this paper; we propose a new statisticalmodel-based approach; called SOBER; which localizes software bugs without any priorknowledge of program semantics. Unlike existing statistical debugging approaches thatselect predicates correlated with program failures; SOBER models evaluation patterns ofpredicates in both correct and incorrect runs respectively and regards a predicate as bug-relevant if its evaluation pattern in incorrect runs differs significantly from that in correct ones.SOBER features a principled quantification of the pattern difference that measures the bug-relevance of program predicates. We systematically evaluated our approach under the …,ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes,2005,418
Multi-dimensional regression analysis of time-series data streams,Yixin Chen; Guozhu Dong; Jiawei Han; Benjamin W Wah; Jianyoung Wang,This chapter illustrates methods for online; multidimensional regression analysis of time-series stream data. Real-time production systems and other dynamic environments oftengenerate tremendous (potentially infinite) amount of stream data; the volume of data is toohuge to be stored on disks or scanned multiple times. With years of research anddevelopment of data warehouse and OLAP technology; a large number of data warehousesand data cubes have been successfully constructed and deployed in applications. Datacube has become an essential component in most data warehouse systems and in someextended relational database systems; and has been playing an increasingly important rolein data analysis and intelligent decision support.

Mining frequent itemsets with convertible constraints,Jian Pei; Jiawei Han; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Recent work has highlighted the importance of the constraint based mining paradigm in thecontext of frequent itemsets; associations; correlations; sequential patterns; and many otherinteresting patterns in large databases. The authors study constraints which cannot behandled with existing theory and techniques. For example; avg (S)/spl theta//spl nu/; median(S)/spl theta//spl nu/; sum (S)/spl theta//spl nu/(S can contain items of arbitrary values)(/spltheta//spl isin/{/spl ges/;/spl les/}); are customarily regarded as" tough" constraints in that theycannot be pushed inside an algorithm such as a priori. We develop a notion of convertibleconstraints and systematically analyze; classify; and characterize this class. We alsodevelop techniques which enable them to be readily pushed deep inside the recentlydeveloped FP-growth algorithm for frequent itemset mining. Results from our detailed …,Data Engineering; 2001.

Mining top-n local outliers in large databases,Wen Jin; Anthony KH Tung; Jiawei Han,Abstract Outlier detection is an important task in data mining with numerous applications;including credit card fraud detection; video surveillance; etc. A recent work on outlierdetection has introduced a novel notion of local outlier in which the degree to which anobject is outlying is dependent on the density of its local neighborhood; and each object canbe assigned a Local Outlier Factor (LOF) which represents the likelihood of that object beingan outlier. Although the concept of local outliers is a useful one; the computation of LOFvalues for every data objects requires a large number of &kgr;-nearest neighbors searchesand can be computationally expensive. Since most objects are usually not outliers; it isuseful to provide users with the option of finding only n most outstanding local outliers; ie;the top-n data objects which are most likely to be local outliers according to their LOFs …,Proceedings of the seventh ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2001,384
Discriminative frequent pattern analysis for effective classification,Hong Cheng; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; Chih-Wei Hsu,The application of frequent patterns in classification appeared in sporadic studies andachieved initial success in the classification of relational data; text documents and graphs. Inthis paper; we conduct a systematic exploration of frequent pattern-based classification; andprovide solid reasons supporting this methodology. It was well known that featurecombinations (patterns) could capture more underlying semantics than single features.However; inclusion of infrequent patterns may not significantly improve the accuracy due totheir limited predictive power. By building a connection between pattern frequency anddiscriminative measures such as information gain and Fisher score; we develop a strategy toset minimum support in frequent pattern mining for generating useful patterns. Based on thisstrategy; coupled with a proposed feature selection algorithm; discriminative frequent …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007. IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,370
Warehousing and analyzing massive RFID data sets,Hector Gonzalez; Jiawei Han; Xiaolei Li; Diego Klabjan,Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) applications are set to play an essential role in objecttracking and supply chain management systems. In the near future; it is expected that everymajor retailer will use RFID systems to track the movement of products from suppliers towarehouses; store backrooms and eventually to points of sale. The volume of informationgenerated by such systems can be enormous as each individual item (a pallet; a case; or anSKU) will leave a trail of data as it moves through different locations. As a departure from thetraditional data cube; we propose a new warehousing model that preserves objecttransitions while providing significant compression and path-dependent aggregates; basedon the following observations:(1) items usually move together in large groups through earlystages in the system (eg; distribution centers) and only in later stages (eg; stores) do they …,Data Engineering; 2006.

Ranking-based clustering of heterogeneous information networks with star network schema,Yizhou Sun; Yintao Yu; Jiawei Han,ABSTRACT A heterogeneous information network is an information network composed ofmultiple types of objects. Clustering on such a network may lead to better understanding ofboth hidden structures of the network and the individual role played by every object in eachcluster. However; although clustering on homogeneous networks has been studied overdecades; clustering on heterogeneous networks has not been addressed until recently. Arecent study proposed a new algorithm; RankClus; for clustering on bi-typed heterogeneousnetworks. However; a real-world network may consist of more than two types; and theinteractions among multi-typed objects play a key role at disclosing the rich semantics that anetwork carries. In this paper; we study clustering of multi-typed heterogeneous networkswith a star network schema and propose a novel algorithm; NetClus; that utilizes links …,Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2009,362
GPLAG: detection of software plagiarism by program dependence graph analysis,Chao Liu; Chen Chen; Jiawei Han; Philip S Yu,Abstract Along with the blossom of open source projects comes the convenience forsoftware plagiarism. A company; if less self-disciplined; may be tempted to plagiarize someopen source projects for its own products. Although current plagiarism detection toolsappear sufficient for academic use; they are nevertheless short for fighting against seriousplagiarists. For example; disguises like statement reordering and code insertion caneffectively confuse these tools. In this paper; we develop a new plagiarism detection tool;called GP LAG; which detects plagiarism by mining program dependence graphs (PDGs). APDG is a graphic representation of the data and control dependencies within a procedure.Because PDGs are nearly invariant during plagiarism; GP LAG is more effective than state-of-the-art tools for plagiarism detection. In order to make GP LAG scalable to large programs …,Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2006,349

Recent studies on data mining have extended thescope of data mining from relational and transactional databases to spatial databases. Thispaper summarizes recent works on spatial data mining; from spatial data generalization; tospatial data clustering; mining spatial association rules; etc. It shows that spatial data miningis a promising eld; with fruitful research results and many challenging issues.,Proc.

Mining coherent dense subgraphs across massive biological networks for functional discovery,Haiyan Hu; Xifeng Yan; Yu Huang; Jiawei Han; Xianghong Jasmine Zhou,Abstract Motivation: The rapid accumulation of biological network data translates into anurgent need for computational methods for graph pattern mining. One important problem isto identify recurrent patterns across multiple networks to discover biological modules.However; existing algorithms for frequent pattern mining become very costly in time andspace as the pattern sizes and network numbers increase. Currently; no efficient algorithm isavailable for mining recurrent patterns across large collections of genome-wide networks.Results: We developed a novel algorithm; CODENSE; to efficiently mine frequent coherentdense subgraphs across large numbers of massive graphs. Compared with previousmethods; our approach is scalable in the number and size of the input graphs andadjustable in terms of exact or approximate pattern mining.

Unsupervised disaggregation of low frequency power measurements,Hyungsul Kim; Manish Marwah; Martin Arlitt; Geoff Lyon; Jiawei Han,Abstract Fear of increasing prices and concern about climate change are motivatingresidential power conservation efforts. We investigate the effectiveness of severalunsupervised disaggregation methods on low frequency power measurements collected inreal homes. Specifically; we consider variants of the factorial hidden Markov model. Ourresults indicate that a conditional factorial hidden semi-Markov model; which integratesadditional features related to when and how appliances are used in the home and moreaccurately represents the power use of individual appliances; outperforms the otherunsupervised disaggregation methods. Our results show that unsupervised techniques canprovide perappliance power usage information in a non-invasive manner; which is ideal forenabling power conservation efforts.,*,2011,334
Mining top-k frequent closed patterns without minimum support,Jiawei Han; Jianyong Wang; Ying Lu; Petre Tzvetkov,In this paper; we propose a new mining task: mining top-k frequent closed patterns of lengthno less than min_/spl lscr/; where k is the desired number of frequent closed patterns to bemined; and min_/spl lscr/is the minimal length of each pattern. An efficient algorithm; calledTFP; is developed for mining such patterns without minimum support. Two methods; closed-node-count and descendant-sum are proposed to effectively raise support threshold andprune FP-tree both during and after the construction of FP-tree. During the mining process; anovel top-down and bottom-up combined FP-tree mining strategy is developed to speed-upsupport-raising and closed frequent pattern discovering. In addition; a fast hash-basedclosed pattern verification scheme has been employed to check efficiently if a potentialclosed pattern is really closed.

SRDA: An efficient algorithm for large-scale discriminant analysis,Deng Cai; Xiaofei He; Jiawei Han,Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) has been a popular method for extracting features thatpreserves class separability. The projection functions of LDA are commonly obtained bymaximizing the between-class covariance and simultaneously minimizing the within-classcovariance. It has been widely used in many fields of information processing; such asmachine learning; data mining; information retrieval; and pattern recognition. However; thecomputation of LDA involves dense matrices eigendecomposition; which can becomputationally expensive in both time and memory. Specifically; LDA has O (mnt+ t 3) timecomplexity and requires O (mn+ mt+ nt) memory; where m is the number of samples; n is thenumber of features; and t= min (m; n). When both m and n are large; it is infeasible to applyLDA.

Classifying large data sets using SVMs with hierarchical clusters,Hwanjo Yu; Jiong Yang; Jiawei Han,Abstract Support vector machines (SVMs) have been promising methods for classificationand regression analysis because of their solid mathematical foundations which converyseveral salient properties that other methods hardly provide. However; despite theprominent properties of SVMs; they are not as favored for large-scale data mining as forpattern recognition or machine learning because the training complexity of SVMs is highlydependent on the size of a data set. Many real-world data mining applications involvemillions or billions of data records where even multiple scans of the entire data are tooexpensive to perform. This paper presents a new method; Clustering-Based SVM (CB-SVM);which is specifically designed for handling very large data sets. CB-SVM applies ahierarchical micro-clustering algorithm that scans the entire data set only once to provide …,Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2003,332
Metarule-guided mining of multi-dimensional association rules using data cubes.,Micheline Kamber; Jiawei Han; Jenny Chiang,Abstract In this paper; we employ a novel approach to metarule-guided; multi-dimensionalassociation rule mining which explores a data cube structure. We propose algorithms formetarule-guided mining: given a metarule containing p predicates; we compare mining onan n-dimensional (nD) cube structure (where p< n) with mining on smaller multiplepdimensional cubes. In addition; we propose an efficient method for precomputing the cube;which takes into account the constraints imposed by the given metarule.,KDD,1997,322
Substructure similarity search in graph databases,Xifeng Yan; Philip S Yu; Jiawei Han,Abstract Advanced database systems face a great challenge raised by the emergence ofmassive; complex structural data in bioinformatics; chem-informatics; and many otherapplications. The most fundamental support needed in these applications is the efficientsearch of complex structured data. Since exact matching is often too restrictive; similaritysearch of complex structures becomes a vital operation that must be supported efficiently. Inthis paper; we investigate the issues of substructure similarity search using indexed featuresin graph databases. By transforming the edge relaxation ratio of a query graph into themaximum allowed missing features; our structural filtering algorithm; called Grafil; can filtermany graphs without performing pairwise similarity computations. It is further shown thatusing either too few or too many features can result in poor filtering performance. Thus the …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,318

Usually;sequence patterns are associated with different circumstances; and such circumstancesform a multiple dimensional space. For example; customer purchase sequences areassociated with region; time; customer group; and others. It is interesting and useful to minesequential patterns associated with multi-dimensional information.

Spectral regression for efficient regularized subspace learning,Deng Cai; Xiaofei He; Jiawei Han,Subspace learning based face recognition methods have attracted considerable interests inrecent years; including principal component analysis (PCA); linear discriminant analysis(LDA); locality preserving projection (LPP); neighborhood preserving embedding (NPE) andmarginal Fisher analysis (MFA). However; a disadvantage of all these approaches is thattheir computations involve eigen-decomposition of dense matrices which is expensive inboth time and memory. In this paper; we propose a novel dimensionality reductionframework; called spectral regression (SR); for efficient regularized subspace learning. SRcasts the problem of learning the projective functions into a regression framework; whichavoids eigen-decomposition of dense matrices. Also; with the regression based framework;different kinds of regularizes can be naturally incorporated into our algorithm which …,Computer Vision; 2007. ICCV 2007.

Trajectory outlier detection: A partition-and-detect framework,Jae-Gil Lee; Jiawei Han; Xiaolei Li,Outlier detection has been a popular data mining task. However; there is a lack of seriousstudy on outlier detection for trajectory data. Even worse; an existing trajectory outlierdetection algorithm has limited capability to detect outlying sub-trajectories. In this paper; wepropose a novel partition-and-detect framework for trajectory outlier detection; whichpartitions a trajectory into a set of line segments; and then; detects outlying line segments fortrajectory outliers. The primary advantage of this framework is to detect outlying sub-trajectories from a trajectory database. Based on this partition-and-detect framework; wedevelop a trajectory outlier detection algorithm TRAOD. Our algorithm consists of twophases: partitioning and detection. For the first phase; we propose a two-level trajectorypartitioning strategy that ensures both high quality and high efficiency. For the second …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008.

On demand classification of data streams,Charu C Aggarwal; Jiawei Han; Jianyong Wang; Philip S Yu,Abstract Current models of the classification problem do not effectively handle bursts ofparticular classes coming in at different times. In fact; the current model of the classificationproblem simply concentrates on methods for one-pass classification modeling of very largedata sets. Our model for data stream classification views the data stream classificationproblem from the point of view of a dynamic approach in which simultaneous training andtesting streams are used for dynamic classification of data sets. This model reflects real lifesituations effectively; since it is desirable to classify test streams in real time over an evolvingtraining and test stream. The aim here is to create a classification system in which thetraining model can adapt quickly to the changes of the underlying data stream. In order toachieve this goal; we propose an on-demand classification process which can …,Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2004,312

However;there is no systematic study on constraint-based sequential pattern mining. In this paper; weinvestigate this issue and point out that the framework developed for constrained frequent-pattern mining does not fit our missions well. An extended framework is developed based ona sequential pattern growth methodology. Our study shows that constraints can be effectivelyand efficiently pushed deep into sequential pattern mining under this new framework.Moreover; this framework can be extended to constraint-based structured pattern mining aswell.,Proceedings of the eleventh international conference on Information and knowledge management,2002,303
Rankclus: integrating clustering with ranking for heterogeneous information network analysis,Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han; Peixiang Zhao; Zhijun Yin; Hong Cheng; Tianyi Wu,Abstract As information networks become ubiquitous; extracting knowledge from informationnetworks has become an important task. Both ranking and clustering can provide overallviews on information network data; and each has been a hot topic by itself. However;ranking objects globally without considering which clusters they belong to often leads todumb results; eg; ranking database and computer architecture conferences together may notmake much sense. Similarly; clustering a huge number of objects (eg; thousands of authors)in one huge cluster without distinction is dull as well. In this paper; we address the problemof generating clusters for a specified type of objects; as well as ranking information for alltypes of objects based on these clusters in a multi-typed (ie; heterogeneous) informationnetwork. A novel clustering framework called RankClus is proposed that directly …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,297
Learning a spatially smooth subspace for face recognition,Deng Cai; Xiaofei He; Yuxiao Hu; Jiawei Han; Thomas Huang,Subspace learning based face recognition methods have attracted considerable interests inrecently years; including principal component analysis (PCA); linear discriminant analysis(LDA); locality preserving projection (LPP); neighborhood preserving embedding (NPE);marginal fisher analysis (MFA) and local discriminant embedding (LDE). These methodsconsider an n 1 timesn 2 image as a vector in R n 1 timesn 2 and the pixels of each imageare considered as independent. While an image represented in the plane is intrinsically amatrix. The pixels spatially close to each other may be correlated. Even though we have n 1xn 2 pixels per image; this spatial correlation suggests the real number of freedom is far less.In this paper; we introduce a regularized subspace learning model using a Laplacianpenalty to constrain the coefficients to be spatially smooth.

PEBL: positive example based learning for web page classification using SVM,Hwanjo Yu; Jiawei Han; Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang,Abstract Web page classification is one of the essential techniques for Web mining.Specifically; classifying Web pages of a user-interesting class is the first step of mininginteresting information from the Web. However; constructing a classifier for an interestingclass requires laborious pre-processing such as collecting positive and negative trainingexamples. For instance; in order to construct a" homepage" classifier; one needs to collect asample of homepages (positive examples) and a sample of non-homepages (negativeexamples). In particular; collecting negative training examples requires arduous work andspecial caution to avoid biasing them. We introduce in this paper the Positive ExampleBased Learning (PEBL) framework for Web page classification which eliminates the need formanually collecting negative training examples in pre-processing.

Quotient cube: How to summarize the semantics of a data cube,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Jian Pei; Jiawei Han,Abstract Partitioning a data cube into sets of cells with" similar behavior" often betterexposes the semantics in the cube. Eg; if we find that average boots sales in the West 10thstore of Walmart was the same for winter as for the whole year; it signifies somethinginteresting about the trend of boots sales in that location in that year. In this paper; we areinterested in finding succinct summaries of the data cube; exploiting regularities present inthe cube; with a clear basis. We would like the summary:(i) to be as concise as possible;(ii)to itself form a lattice preserving the rollup/drilldown semantics of the cube; and (iii) to allowthe original cube to be fully recovered. We illustrate the utility of solving this problem anddiscuss the inherent challenges. We develop techniques for partitioning cube cells forobtaining succinct summaries; and introduce the quotient cube.

Co-author relationship prediction in heterogeneous bibliographic networks,Yizhou Sun; Rick Barber; Manish Gupta; Charu C Aggarwal; Jiawei Han,The problem of predicting links or interactions between objects in a network; is an importanttask in network analysis. Along this line; link prediction between co-authors in a co-authornetwork is a frequently studied problem. In most of these studies; authors are considered ina homogeneous network; ie; only one type of objects (author type) and one type of links (co-authorship) exist in the network. However; in a real bibliographic network; there are multipletypes of objects (eg; venues; topics; papers) and multiple types of links among these objects.In this paper; we study the problem of co-author relationship prediction in the heterogeneousbibliographic network; and a new methodology called PathPredict; ie; meta path-basedrelationship prediction model; is proposed to solve this problem. First; meta path-basedtopological features are systematically extracted from the network. Then; a supervised …,Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM); 2011 International Conference on,2011,279
Efficient computation of iceberg cubes with complex measures,Jiawei Han; Jian Pei; Guozhu Dong; Ke Wang,Abstract It is often too expensive to compute and materialize a complete high-dimensionaldata cube. Computing an iceberg cube; which contains only aggregates above certainthresholds; is an effective way to derive nontrivial multi-dimensional aggregations for OLAPand data mining. In this paper; we study efficient methods for computing iceberg cubes withsome popularly used complex measures; such as average; and develop a methodology thatadopts a weaker but anti-monotonic condition for testing and pruning search space. Inparticular; for efficient computation of iceberg cubes with the average measure; we proposea top-k average pruning method and extend two previously studied methods; Apriori andBUC; to Top-k Apriori and Top-k BUC. To further improve the performance; an interestinghypertree structure; called H-tree; is designed and a new iceberg cubing method; called …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2001,278
Non-negative matrix factorization on manifold,Deng Cai; Xiaofei He; Xiaoyun Wu; Jiawei Han,Recently Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) has received a lot of attentions ininformation retrieval; computer vision and pattern recognition. NMF aims to find two non-negative matrices whose product can well approximate the original matrix. The sizes ofthese two matrices are usually smaller than the original matrix. This results in a compressedversion of the original data matrix. The solution of NMF yields a natural parts-basedrepresentation for the data. When NMF is applied for data representation; a majordisadvantage is that it fails to consider the geometric structure in the data. In this paper; wedevelop a graph based approach for parts-based data representation in order to overcomethis limitation. We construct an affinity graph to encode the geometrical information and seeka matrix factorization which respects the graph structure. We demonstrate the success of …,Data Mining; 2008. ICDM'08.

Ranking outliers using symmetric neighborhood relationship,Wen Jin; Anthony KH Tung; Jiawei Han; Wei Wang,Abstract Mining outliers in database is to find exceptional objects that deviate from the rest ofthe data set. Besides classical outlier analysis algorithms; recent studies have focused onmining local outliers; ie; the outliers that have density distribution significantly different fromtheir neighborhood. The estimation of density distribution at the location of an object has sofar been based on the density distribution of its k-nearest neighbors [2; 11]. However; whenoutliers are in the location where the density distributions in the neighborhood aresignificantly different; for example; in the case of objects from a sparse cluster close to adenser cluster; this may result in wrong estimation. To avoid this problem; here we proposea simple but effective measure on local outliers based on a symmetric neighborhoodrelationship. The proposed measure considers both neighbors and reverse neighbors of …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2006,274

Statistical debugging: A hypothesis testing-based approach,Chao Liu; Long Fei; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; Samuel P Midkiff,Manual debugging is tedious; as well as costly. The high cost has motivated thedevelopment of fault localization techniques; which help developers search for faultlocations. In this paper; we propose a new statistical method; called SOBER; whichautomatically localizes software faults without any prior knowledge of the programsemantics. Unlike existing statistical approaches that select predicates correlated withprogram failures; SOBER models the predicate evaluation in both correct and incorrectexecutions and regards a predicate as fault-relevant if its evaluation pattern in incorrectexecutions significantly diverges from that in correct ones. Featuring a rationale similar tothat of hypothesis testing; SOBER quantifies the fault relevance of each predicate in aprincipled way. We systematically evaluate SOBER under the same setting as previous …,IEEE Transactions on software engineering,2006,271
Mining frequent item sets by opportunistic projection,Junqiang Liu; Yunhe Pan; Ke Wang; Jiawei Han,Abstract In this paper; we present a novel algorithm Opportune Project for mining completeset of frequent item sets by projecting databases to grow a frequent item set tree. Ouralgorithm is fundamentally different from those proposed in the past in that itopportunistically chooses between two different structures; array-based or tree-based; torepresent projected transaction subsets; and heuristically decides to build unfiltered pseudoprojection or to make a filtered copy according to features of the subsets. More importantly;we propose novel methods to build tree-based pseudo projections and array-basedunfiltered projections for projected transaction subsets; which makes our algorithm bothCPU time efficient and memory saving. Basically; the algorithm grows the frequent item settree by depth first search; whereas breadth first search is used to build the upper portion …,Proceedings of the eighth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2002,270
Geographical topic discovery and comparison,Zhijun Yin; Liangliang Cao; Jiawei Han; Chengxiang Zhai; Thomas Huang,Abstract This paper studies the problem of discovering and comparing geographical topicsfrom GPS-associated documents. GPS-associated documents become popular with thepervasiveness of location-acquisition technologies. For example; in Flickr; the geo-taggedphotos are associated with tags and GPS locations. In Twitter; the locations of the tweets canbe identified by the GPS locations from smart phones. Many interesting concepts; includingcultures; scenes; and product sales; correspond to specialized geographical distributions. Inthis paper; we are interested in two questions:(1) how to discover different topics of intereststhat are coherent in geographical regions?(2) how to compare several topics across differentgeographical locations? To answer these questions; this paper proposes and comparesthree ways of modeling geographical topics: location-driven model; text-driven model …,Proceedings of the 20th international conference on World wide web,2011,268
TraClass: trajectory classification using hierarchical region-based and trajectory-based clustering,Jae-Gil Lee; Jiawei Han; Xiaolei Li; Hector Gonzalez,Abstract Trajectory classification; ie; model construction for predicting the class labels ofmoving objects based on their trajectories and other features; has many important; real-world applications. A number of methods have been reported in the literature; but due tousing the shapes of whole trajectories for classification; they have limited classificationcapability when discriminative features appear at parts of trajectories or are not relevant tothe shapes of trajectories. These situations are often observed in long trajectories spreadingover large geographic areas. Since an essential task for effective classification is generatingdiscriminative features; a feature generation framework TraClass for trajectory data isproposed in this paper; which generates a hierarchy of features by partitioning trajectoriesand exploring two types of clustering:(1) region-based and (2) trajectory-based.

PEBL: Web page classification without negative examples,Hwanjo Yu; Jiawei Han; KC-C Chang,Web page classification is one of the essential techniques for Web mining becauseclassifying Web pages of an interesting class is often the first step of mining the Web.However; constructing a classifier for an interesting class requires laborious preprocessingsuch as collecting positive and negative training examples. For instance; in order toconstruct a" homepage" classifier; one needs to collect a sample of homepages (positiveexamples) and a sample of nonhomepages (negative examples). In particular; collectingnegative training examples requires arduous work and caution to avoid bias. The paperpresents a framework; called positive example based learning (PEBL); for Web pageclassification which eliminates the need for manually collecting negative training examplesin preprocessing. The PEBL framework applies an algorithm; called mapping …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2004,260
Can we push more constraints into frequent pattern mining?,Jian Pei; Jiawei Han,Abstract Recent studies show that constraint pushing may substantially improve theperformance of frequent pattern mining; and methods have been proposed to incorporateinteresting constraints in frequent pattern mining. However; some popularly encounteredconstraints are still considered as" tough" constraints which cannot be pushed deep into themining process. In this study; we extend our scope to those tough constraints and identify aninteresting class; called convertible constraints; which can be pushed deep into frequentpattern mining. Then we categorize all the constraints into five classes and show that four ofthem can be integrated into the frequent pattern mining process. This covers most of theconstraints popularly encountered and composed by SQL primitives. Moreover; a newconstraintbased frequent pattern mining method; called constrained frequent pattern …,Proceedings of the sixth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2000,260

Clustering moving objects,Yifan Li; Jiawei Han; Jiong Yang,Abstract Due to the advances in positioning technologies; the real time information ofmoving objects becomes increasingly available; which has posed new challenges to thedatabase research. As a long-standing technique to identify overall distribution patterns indata; clustering has achieved brilliant successes in analyzing static datasets. In this paper;we study the problem of clustering moving objects; which could catch interesting patternchanges during the motion process and provide better insight into the essence of the mobiledata points. In order to catch the spatial-temporal regularities of moving objects and handlelarge amounts of data; micro-clustering [20] is employed. Efficient techniques are proposedto keep the moving micro-clusters geographically small. Important events such as thecollisions among moving micro-clusters are also identified. In this way; high quality …,Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2004,252

Mining compressed frequent-pattern sets,Dong Xin; Jiawei Han; Xifeng Yan; Hong Cheng,Abstract A major challenge in frequent-pattern mining is the sheer size of its mining results.In many cases; a high min_sup threshold may discover only commonsense patterns but alow one may generate an explosive number of output patterns; which severely restricts itsusage. In this paper; we study the problem of compressing frequent-pattern sets. Typically;frequent patterns can be clustered with a tightness measure δ (called δ-cluster); and arepresentative pattern can be selected for each cluster. Unfortunately; finding a minimum setof representative patterns is NP-Hard. We develop two greedy methods; RPglobal andRPlocal. The former has the guaranteed compression bound but higher computationalcomplexity. The latter sacrifices the theoretical bounds but is far more efficient. Ourperformance study shows that the compression quality using RPlocal is very close to …,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,250
Mining topic-level influence in heterogeneous networks,Lu Liu; Jie Tang; Jiawei Han; Meng Jiang; Shiqiang Yang,Abstract Influence is a complex and subtle force that governs the dynamics of socialnetworks as well as the behaviors of involved users. Understanding influence can benefitvarious applications such as viral marketing; recommendation; and information retrieval.However; most existing works on social influence analysis have focused on verifying theexistence of social influence. Few works systematically investigate how to mine the strengthof direct and indirect influence between nodes in heterogeneous networks. To address theproblem; we propose a generative graphical model which utilizes the heterogeneous linkinformation and the textual content associated with each node in the network to mine topic-level direct influence. Based on the learned direct influence; a topic-level influencepropagation and aggregation algorithm is proposed to derive the indirect influence …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,249

Spatial clustering in the presence of obstacles,Anthony KH Tung; Jean Hou; Jiawei Han,Clustering in spatial data mining is to group similar objects based on their distance;connectivity; or their relative density in space. In the real world there exist many physicalobstacles such as rivers; lakes and highways; and their presence may affect the result ofclustering substantially. We study the problem of clustering in the presence of obstacles anddefine it as a COD (Clustering with Obstructed Distance) problem. As a solution to thisproblem; we propose a scalable clustering algorithm; called COD-CLARANS. We discussvarious forms of pre-processed information that could enhance the efficiency of COD-CLARANS. In the strictest sense; the COD problem can be treated as a change in distancefunction and thus could be handled by current clustering algorithms by changing thedistance function. However; we show that by pushing the task of handling obstacles into …,Data Engineering; 2001. Proceedings. 17th International Conference on,2001,247
TFP: An efficient algorithm for mining top-k frequent closed itemsets,Jianyong Wang; Jiawei Han; Ying Lu; Petre Tzvetkov,Frequent itemset mining has been studied extensively in literature. Most previous studiesrequire the specification of a min/spl I. bar/support threshold and aim at mining a completeset of frequent itemsets satisfying min/spl I. bar/support. However; in practice; it is difficult forusers to provide an appropriate min/spl I. bar/support threshold. In addition; a complete setof frequent itemsets is much less compact than a set of frequent closed itemsets. In thispaper; we propose an alternative mining task: mining top-k frequent closed itemsets oflength no less than min/spl I. bar/l; where k is the desired number of frequent closed itemsetsto be mined; and min/spl I. bar/l is the minimal length of each itemset. An efficient algorithm;called TFP; is developed for mining such itemsets without mins/spl I. bar/support. Starting atmin/spl I. bar/support= 0 and by making use of the length constraint and the properties of …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2005,246
Classification and novel class detection in concept-drifting data streams under time constraints,Mohammad Masud; Jing Gao; Latifur Khan; Jiawei Han; Bhavani M Thuraisingham,Most existing data stream classification techniques ignore one important aspect of streamdata: arrival of a novel class. We address this issue and propose a data stream classificationtechnique that integrates a novel class detection mechanism into traditional classifiers;enabling automatic detection of novel classes before the true labels of the novel classinstances arrive. Novel class detection problem becomes more challenging in the presenceof concept-drift; when the underlying data distributions evolve in streams. In order todetermine whether an instance belongs to a novel class; the classification model sometimesneeds to wait for more test instances to discover similarities among those instances. Amaximum allowable wait time T c is imposed as a time constraint to classify a test instance.Furthermore; most existing stream classification approaches assume that the true label of …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,245
IncSpan: incremental mining of sequential patterns in large database,Hong Cheng; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Many real life sequence databases grow incrementally. It is undesirable to minesequential patterns from scratch each time when a small set of sequences grow; or whensome new sequences are added into the database. Incremental algorithm should bedeveloped for sequential pattern mining so that mining can be adapted to incrementaldatabase updates. However; it is nontrivial to mine sequential patterns incrementally;especially when the existing sequences grow incrementally because such growth may leadto the generation of many new patterns due to the interactions of the growing subsequenceswith the original ones. In this study; we develop an efficient algorithm; IncSpan; forincremental mining of sequential patterns; by exploring some interesting properties. Ourperformance study shows that IncSpan outperforms some previously proposed …,Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2004,245
Cancer classification using gene expression data,Ying Lu; Jiawei Han,Abstract The classification of different tumor types is of great importance in cancer diagnosisand drug discovery.

The recent advent of DNA microarray technique has madesimultaneous monitoring of thousands of gene expressions possible. With this abundance ofgene expression data; researchers have started to explore the possibilities of cancerclassification using gene expression data.

In this paper; we studymethods for spatial OLAP; by integrating nonspatial OLAP methods with spatial databaseimplementation techniques. A spatial data warehouse model; which consists of both spatialand nonspatial dimensions and measures; is proposed. Methods for the computation ofspatial data cubes and analytical processing on such spatial data cubes are studied; withseveral strategies being proposed; including approximation and selective materialization ofthe spatial objects resulting from spatial OLAP operations.

Adaptive fastest path computation on a road network: a traffic mining approach,Hector Gonzalez; Jiawei Han; Xiaolei Li; Margaret Myslinska; John Paul Sondag,Abstract Efficient fastest path computation in the presence of varying speed conditions on alarge scale road network is an essential problem in modern navigation systems. Factorsaffecting road speed; such as weather; time of day; and vehicle type; need to be consideredin order to select fast routes that match current driving conditions. Most existing systemscompute fastest paths based on road Euclidean distance and a small set of predefined roadspeeds. However;" History is often the best teacher". Historical traffic data or driving patternsare often more useful than the simple Euclidean distance-based computation becausepeople must have good reasons to choose these routes; eg; they may want to avoid thosethat pass through high crime areas at night or that likely encounter accidents; roadconstruction; or traffic jams.

Swarm: Mining relaxed temporal moving object clusters,Zhenhui Li; Bolin Ding; Jiawei Han; Roland Kays,Abstract Recent improvements in positioning technology make massive moving object datawidely available. One important analysis is to find the moving objects that travel together.Existing methods put a strong constraint in defining moving object cluster; that they requirethe moving objects to stick together for consecutive timestamps. Our key observation is thatthe moving objects in a cluster may actually diverge temporarily and congregate at certaintimestamps. Motivated by this; we propose the concept of swarm which captures the movingobjects that move within arbitrary shape of clusters for certain timestamps that are possiblynon-consecutive. The goal of our paper is to find all discriminative swarms; namely closedswarm. While the search space for closed swarms is prohibitively huge; we design amethod; ObjectGrowth; to efficiently retrieve the answer.

Outlier detection for temporal data: A survey,Manish Gupta; Jing Gao; Charu C Aggarwal; Jiawei Han,In the statistics community; outlier detection for time series data has been studied fordecades. Recently; with advances in hardware and software technology; there has been alarge body of work on temporal outlier detection from a computational perspective within thecomputer science community. In particular; advances in hardware technology have enabledthe availability of various forms of temporal data collection mechanisms; and advances insoftware technology have enabled a variety of data management mechanisms. This hasfueled the growth of different kinds of data sets such as data streams; spatio-temporal data;distributed streams; temporal networks; and time series data; generated by a multitude ofapplications.

Constraint-based; multidimensional data mining,Jiawei Han; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Raymond T Ng,Although many data-mining methodologies and systems have been developed in recentyears; the authors contend that by and large; present mining models lack humaninvolvement; particularly in the form of guidance and user control. They believe that datamining is most effective when the computer does what it does best-like searching largedatabases or counting-and users do what they do best; like specifying the current miningsession's focus. This division of labor is best achieved through constraint-based mining; inwhich the user provides restraints that guide a search. Mining can also be improved byemploying a multidimensional; hierarchical view of the data. Current data warehousesystems have provided a fertile ground for systematic development of this multidimensionalmining. Together; constraint-based and multidimensional techniques can provide a more …,Computer,1999,234

It has emerged as one ofthe best ways of associating metadata with web objects. With the increase in the kinds ofweb objects becoming available; collaborative tagging of such objects is also developingalong new dimensions. This popularity has led to a vast literature on social tagging. In thissurvey paper; we would like to summarize different techniques employed to study variousaspects of tagging. Broadly; we would discuss about properties of tag streams; taggingmodels; tag semantics; generating recommendations using tags; visualizations of tags;applications of tags and problems associated with tagging usage.

Knowledge transfer via multiple model local structure mapping,Jing Gao; Wei Fan; Jing Jiang; Jiawei Han,Abstract The effectiveness of knowledge transfer using classification algorithms depends onthe difference between the distribution that generates the training examples and the onefrom which test examples are to be drawn. The task can be especially difficult when thetraining examples are from one or several domains different from the test domain. In thispaper; we propose a locally weighted ensemble framework to combine multiple models fortransfer learning; where the weights are dynamically assigned according to a model'spredictive power on each test example. It can integrate the advantages of various learningalgorithms and the labeled information from multiple training domains into one unifiedclassification model; which can then be applied on a different domain.

TSP: Mining top-k closed sequential patterns,Petre Tzvetkov; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Sequential pattern mining has been studied extensively in the data miningcommunity. Most previous studies require the specification of a min _ support threshold formining a complete set of sequential patterns satisfying the threshold. However; in practice; itis difficult for users to provide an appropriate min _ support threshold. To overcome thisdifficulty; we propose an alternative mining task: mining top-k frequent closed sequentialpatterns of length no less than min _ℓ; where k is the desired number of closed sequentialpatterns to be mined and min _ℓ is the minimal length of each pattern. We mine the set ofclosed patterns because it is a compact representation of the complete set of frequentpatterns. An efficient algorithm; called TSP; is developed for mining such patterns withoutmin _ support.

A bayesian approach to discovering truth from conflicting sources for data integration,Bo Zhao; Benjamin IP Rubinstein; Jim Gemmell; Jiawei Han,Abstract In practical data integration systems; it is common for the data sources beingintegrated to provide conflicting information about the same entity. Consequently; a majorchallenge for data integration is to derive the most complete and accurate integrated recordsfrom diverse and sometimes conflicting sources. We term this challenge the truth findingproblem. We observe that some sources are generally more reliable than others; andtherefore a good model of source quality is the key to solving the truth finding problem. Inthis work; we propose a probabilistic graphical model that can automatically infer truerecords and source quality without any supervision. In contrast to previous methods; ourprincipled approach leverages a generative process of two types of errors (false positive andfalse negative) by modeling two different aspects of source quality. In so doing; ours is …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,222
Summarizing itemset patterns: a profile-based approach,Xifeng Yan; Hong Cheng; Jiawei Han; Dong Xin,Abstract Frequent-pattern mining has been studied extensively on scalable methods formining various kinds of patterns including itemsets; sequences; and graphs. However; thebottleneck of frequent-pattern mining is not at the efficiency but at the interpretability; due tothe huge number of patterns generated by the mining process. In this paper; we examinehow to summarize a collection of itemset patterns using only K representatives; a smallnumber of patterns that a user can handle easily. The K representatives should not onlycover most of the frequent patterns but also approximate their supports. A generative modelis built to extract and profile these representatives; under which the supports of the patternscan be easily recovered without consulting the original dataset. Based on the restorationerror; we propose a quality measure function to determine the optimal value of parameter …,Proceedings of the eleventh ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery in data mining,2005,222
Generalized fisher score for feature selection,Quanquan Gu; Zhenhui Li; Jiawei Han,Abstract: Fisher score is one of the most widely used supervised feature selection methods.However; it selects each feature independently according to their scores under the Fishercriterion; which leads to a suboptimal subset of features. In this paper; we present ageneralized Fisher score to jointly select features. It aims at finding an subset of features;which maximize the lower bound of traditional Fisher score. The resulting feature selectionproblem is a mixed integer programming; which can be reformulated as a quadraticallyconstrained linear programming (QCLP). It is solved by cutting plane algorithm; in eachiteration of which a multiple kernel learning problem is solved alternatively by multivariateridge regression and projected gradient descent. Experiments on benchmark data setsindicate that the proposed method outperforms Fisher score as well as many other state …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1202.3725,2012,220
Optimization of constrained frequent set queries with 2-variable constraints,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Raymond Ng; Jiawei Han; Alex Pang,Abstract Currently; there is tremendous interest in providing ad-hoc mining capabilities indatabase management systems. As a first step towards this goal; in [15] we proposed anarchitecture for supporting constraint-based; human-centered; exploratory mining of variouskinds of rules including associations; introduced the notion of constrained frequent setqueries (CFQs); and developed effective pruning optimizations for CFQs with 1-variable (1-var) constraints. While 1-var constraints are useful for constraining the antecedent andconsequent separately; many natural examples of CFQs illustrate the need for constrainingthe antecedent and consequent jointly; for which 2-variable (2-var) constraints areindispensable. Developing pruning optimizations for CFQs with 2-var constraints is thesubject of this paper. But this is a difficult problem because:(i) in 2-var constraints; both …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1999,220
Multi-view clustering via joint nonnegative matrix factorization,Jialu Liu; Chi Wang; Jing Gao; Jiawei Han,Abstract Many real-world datasets are comprised of different representations or views whichoften provide information complementary to each other. To integrate information frommultiple views in the unsupervised setting; multi-view clustering algorithms have beendeveloped to cluster multiple views simultaneously to derive a solution which uncovers thecommon latent structure shared by multiple views. In this paper; we propose a novel NMF-based multi-view clustering algorithm by searching for a factorization that gives compatibleclustering solutions across multiple views. The key idea is to formulate a joint matrixfactorization process with the constraint that pushes clustering solution of each view towardsa common consensus instead of fixing it directly. The main challenge is how to keepclustering solutions across different views meaningful and comparable. To tackle this …,*,2013,219

With rapiddevelopments of data warehouse and OLAP technologies in database industry; it ispromising to develop OLAP mining mechanisms. With our years of research into datamining; an OLAP-based data mining system; DBMiner; has been developed; where OLAPmining is not only for data characterization but also for other data mining functions; includingassociation; classi cation; prediction; clustering; and sequencing. Such an integrationincreases the exibility of mining and helps users nd desired knowledge.

Direct discriminative pattern mining for effective classification,Hong Cheng; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; S Yu Philip,The application of frequent patterns in classification has demonstrated its power in recentstudies. It often adopts a two-step approach: frequent pattern (or classification rule) miningfollowed by feature selection (or rule ranking). However; this two-step process could becomputationally expensive; especially when the problem scale is large or the minimumsupport is low. It was observed that frequent pattern mining usually produces a huge numberof" patterns" that could not only slow down the mining process but also make featureselection hard to complete. In this paper; we propose a direct discriminative pattern miningapproach; DDPMine; to tackle the efficiency issue arising from the two-step approach.DDPMine performs a branch-and-bound search for directly mining discriminative patternswithout generating the complete pattern set. Instead of selecting best patterns in a batch …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,214

Traffic density-based discovery of hot routes in road networks,Xiaolei Li; Jiawei Han; Jae-Gil Lee; Hector Gonzalez,Abstract Finding hot routes (traffic flow patterns) in a road network is an important problem.They are beneficial to city planners; police departments; real estate developers; and manyothers. Knowing the hot routes allows the city to better direct traffic or analyze congestioncauses. In the past; this problem has largely been addressed with domain knowledge of city.But in recent years; detailed information about vehicles in the road network have becomeavailable. With the development and adoption of RFID and other location sensors; anenormous amount of moving object trajectories are being collected and can be usedtowards finding hot routes. This is a challenging problem due to the complex nature of thedata. If objects traveled in organized clusters; it would be straightforward to use a clusteringalgorithm to find the hot routes. But; in the real world; objects move in unpredictable ways …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2007,212
Discovering complex matchings across web query interfaces: a correlation mining approach,Bin He; Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang; Jiawei Han,Abstract To enable information integration; schema matching is a critical step for discoveringsemantic correspondences of attributes across heterogeneous sources. While complexmatchings are common; because of their far more complex search space; most existingtechniques focus on simple 1: 1 matchings. To tackle this challenge; this paper takes aconceptually novel approach by viewing schema matching as correlation mining; for our taskof matching Web query interfaces to integrate the myriad databases on the Internet. On this"deep Web;" query interfaces generally form complex matchings between attribute groups(eg;[author] corresponds to [first name; last name] in the Books domain). We observe that theco-occurrences patterns across query interfaces often reveal such complex semanticrelationships: grouping attributes (eg;[first name; last name]) tend to be co-present in …,Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2004,212
Constraint-based sequential pattern mining: the pattern-growth methods,Jian Pei; Jiawei Han; Wei Wang,Abstract Constraints are essential for many sequential pattern mining applications. However;there is no systematic study on constraint-based sequential pattern mining. In this paper; weinvestigate this issue and point out that the framework developed for constrained frequent-pattern mining does not fit our mission well. An extended framework is developed based ona sequential pattern growth methodology. Our study shows that constraints can be effectivelyand efficiently pushed deep into the sequential pattern mining under this new framework.Moreover; this framework can be extended to constraint-based structured pattern mining aswell.,Journal of Intelligent Information Systems,2007,211
Constraint-based clustering in large databases,Anthony KH Tung; Jiawei Han; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Constrained clustering—finding clusters that satisfy user-specified constraints—ishighly desirable in many applications. In this paper; we introduce the constrained clusteringproblem and show that traditional clustering algorithms (eg; k-means) cannot handle it. Ascalable constraint-clustering algorithm is developed in this study which starts by finding aninitial solution that satisfies user-specified constraints and then refines the solution byperforming confined object movements under constraints. Our algorithm consists of twophases: pivot movement and deadlock resolution. For both phases; we show that finding theoptimal solution is NP-hard. We then propose several heuristics and show how ouralgorithm can scale up for large data sets using the heuristic of micro-cluster sharing. Byexperiments; we show the effectiveness and efficiency of the heuristics.,International Conference on Database Theory,2001,205
On graph query optimization in large networks,Peixiang Zhao; Jiawei Han,Abstract The dramatic proliferation of sophisticated networks has resulted in a growing needfor supporting effective querying and mining methods over such large-scale graph-structured data. At the core of many advanced network operations lies a common and criticalgraph query primitive: how to search graph structures efficiently within a large network?Unfortunately; the graph query is hard due to the NP-complete nature of subgraphisomorphism. It becomes even challenging when the network examined is large anddiverse. In this paper; we present a high performance graph indexing mechanism; SPath; toaddress the graph query problem on large networks. SPath leverages decomposed shortestpaths around vertex neighborhood as basic indexing units; which prove to be both effectivein graph search space pruning and highly scalable in index construction and deployment …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,204
Mining heterogeneous information networks: principles and methodologies,Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han,Abstract Real-world physical and abstract data objects are interconnected; forming gigantic;interconnected networks. By structuring these data objects and interactions between theseobjects into multiple types; such networks become semi-structured heterogeneousinformation networks. Most real-world applications that handle big data; includinginterconnected social media and social networks; scientific; engineering; or medicalinformation systems; online e-commerce systems; and most database systems; can bestructured into heterogeneous information networks. Therefore; effective analysis of large-scale heterogeneous information networks poses an interesting but critical challenge. In thisbook; we investigate the principles and methodologies of mining heterogeneous informationnetworks.

-Star-Cubing: Computing Iceberg Cubes by Top-Down and Bottom-Up Integration** Work supported in part by US National Science Foundation NSF IIS-02-09199; t...,Dong Xin; Jiawei Han; Xiaolei Li; Benjamin W Wah,Data cube computation is one of the most essential but expensive operations in datawarehousing. Previous studies have developed two major approaches; top-down vs. bottom-up. For efficient cube computation in various data distributions; this chapter proposes aninteresting cube computation method; Star-Cubing; that integrates the strength of both top-down and bottom-up cube computation; and explores a few additional optimizationtechniques. It utilizes a star-tree structure; extends the simultaneous aggregation methods;and enables the pruning of the group-by's that do not satisfy the iceberg condition. Theperformance study shows that Star-Cubing is highly efficient and outperforms all theprevious methods in almost all kinds of data distributions.

Mining long sequential patterns in a noisy environment,Jiong Yang; Wei Wang; Philip S Yu; Jiawei Han,Abstract Pattern discovery in long sequences is of great importance in many applicationsincluding computational biology study; consumer behavior analysis; system performanceanalysis; etc. In a noisy environment; an observed sequence may not accurately reflect theunderlying behavior. For example; in a protein sequence; the amino acid N is likely tomutate to D with little impact to the biological function of the protein. It would be desirable ifthe occurrence of D in the observation can be related to a possible mutation from N in anappropriate manner. Unfortunately; the support measure (ie; the number of occurrences) of apattern does not serve this purpose. In this paper; we introduce the concept of compatibilitymatrix as the means to provide a probabilistic connection from the observation to theunderlying true value. A new metric match is also proposed to capture the" real support" …,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2002,202
Mining periodic behaviors for moving objects,Zhenhui Li; Bolin Ding; Jiawei Han; Roland Kays; Peter Nye,Abstract Periodicity is a frequently happening phenomenon for moving objects. Findingperiodic behaviors is essential to understanding object movements. However; periodicbehaviors could be complicated; involving multiple interleaving periods; partial time span;and spatiotemporal noises and outliers. In this paper; we address the problem of miningperiodic behaviors for moving objects. It involves two sub-problems: how to detect theperiods in complex movement; and how to mine periodic movement behaviors. Our mainassumption is that the observed movement is generated from multiple interleaved periodicbehaviors associated with certain reference locations. Based on this assumption; wepropose a two-stage algorithm; Periodica; to solve the problem. At the first stage; the notionof observation spot is proposed to capture the reference locations.

Efficient mining of intertransaction association rules,Anthony K. H.  Tung; Hongjun Lu; Jiawei Han; Ling Feng,Most of the previous studies on mining association rules are on mining intratransactionassociations; ie; the associations among items within the same transaction. We extend thescope to include multidimensional; intertransaction associations. In a database of stock priceinformation; an example of such an association is" if (company) A's stock goes up on dayone; B's stock will go down on day two but go up on day four:" whether we treat company orday as the unit of transaction; the items belong to different transactions. Moreover; such anintertransaction association can be extended to associate multiple properties in the samerule; so that multidimensional intertransaction associations can also be defined anddiscovered. Mining intertransaction associations pose more challenges on efficientprocessing than mining intratransaction associations because the number of potential …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2003,198
A general framework for mining concept-drifting data streams with skewed distributions,Jing Gao; Wei Fan; Jiawei Han; Philip S Yu,Abstract In recent years; there have been some interesting studies on predictive modeling indata streams. However; most such studies assume relatively balanced and stable datastreams but cannot handle well rather skewed (eg; few positives but lots of negatives) andstochastic distributions; which are typical in many data stream applications. In this paper; wepropose a new approach to mine data streams by estimating reliable posterior probabilitiesusing an ensemble of models to match the distribution over under-samples of negatives andrepeated samples of positives. We formally show some interesting and important propertiesof the proposed framework; eg; reliability of estimated probabilities on skewed positive class;accuracy of estimated probabilities; efficiency and scalability.

Entity linking with a knowledge base: Issues; techniques; and solutions,Wei Shen; Jianyong Wang; Jiawei Han,The large number of potential applications from bridging web data with knowledge baseshave led to an increase in the entity linking research. Entity linking is the task to link entitymentions in text with their corresponding entities in a knowledge base. Potential applicationsinclude information extraction; information retrieval; and knowledge base population.However; this task is challenging due to name variations and entity ambiguity. In this survey;we present a thorough overview and analysis of the main approaches to entity linking; anddiscuss various applications; the evaluation of entity linking systems; and future directions.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,189
Learning a maximum margin subspace for image retrieval,Xiaofei He; Deng Cai; Jiawei Han,One of the fundamental problems in Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) has been thegap between low-level visual features and high-level semantic concepts. To narrow downthis gap; relevance feedback is introduced into image retrieval. With the user-providedinformation; a classifier can be learned to distinguish between positive and negativeexamples. However; in real-world applications; the number of user feedbacks is usually toosmall compared to the dimensionality of the image space. In order to cope with the highdimensionality; we propose a novel semisupervised method for dimensionality reductioncalled Maximum Margin Projection (MMP). MMP aims at maximizing the margin betweenpositive and negative examples at each local neighborhood. Different from traditionaldimensionality reduction algorithms such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2008,189
Stream cube: An architecture for multi-dimensional analysis of data streams,Jiawei Han; Yixin Chen; Guozhu Dong; Jian Pei; Benjamin W Wah; Jianyong Wang; Y Dora Cai,Abstract Real-time surveillance systems; telecommunication systems; and other dynamicenvironments often generate tremendous (potentially infinite) volume of stream data: thevolume is too huge to be scanned multiple times. Much of such data resides at rather lowlevel of abstraction; whereas most analysts are interested in relatively high-level dynamicchanges (such as trends and outliers). To discover such high-level characteristics; one mayneed to perform on-line multi-level; multi-dimensional analytical processing of stream data.In this paper; we propose an architecture; called stream_cube; to facilitate on-line; multi-dimensional; multi-level analysis of stream data. For fast online multi-dimensional analysisof stream data; three important techniques are proposed for efficient and effectivecomputation of stream cubes. First; a tilted time frame model is proposed as a multi …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2005,188

A particle-and-density based evolutionary clustering method for dynamic networks,Min-Soo Kim; Jiawei Han,Abstract Recently; dynamic networks are attracting increasing interest due to their highpotential in capturing natural and social phenomena over time. Discovery of evolutionarycommunities in dynamic networks has become a critical task. The previous evolutionaryclustering methods usually adopt the temporal smoothness framework; which has adesirable feature of controlling the balance between temporal noise and true concept drift ofcommunities. They; however; have some major drawbacks:(1) assuming only a fixednumber of communities over time; and (2) not allowing arbitrary start/stop of community overtime. The forming of new communities and dissolving of existing communities are verycommon phenomena in real dynamic networks.

Beyond intratransaction association analysis: mining multidimensional intertransaction association rules,Hongjun Lu; Ling Feng; Jiawei Han,Abstract In this paper; we extend the scope of mining association rules from traditional single-dimensional intratransaction associations; to multidimensional intertransaction associations.Intratransaction associations are the associations among items with the same transaction;where the notion of the transaction could be the items bought by the same customer; theevents happened on the same day; and so on. However; an intertransaction associationdescribes the association relationships among different transactions; such as “if (company)A's stock goes up on day 1; B's stock will go down on day 2; but go up on day 4.” In this case;whether we treat company or day as the unit of transaction; the associated items belong todifferent transactions. Moreover; such an intertransaction association can be extended toassociate multiple contextual properties in the same rule; so that multidimensional …,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2000,185
Mining frequent itemsets using support constraints,Ke Wang; Yu He; Jiawei Han,Abstract Interesting patterns often occur at varied levels of support. The classic associationmining based on a uniform minimum support; such as Apriori; either misses interestingpatterns of low support or suffers from the bottleneck of itemset generation. A better solutionis to exploit support constraints; which specify what minimum support is required for whatitemsets; so that only necessary itemsets are generated. In this paper; we present aframework of frequent itemset mining in the presence of support constraints. Our approach isto" push" support constraints into the Apriori itemset generation so that the" best" minimumsupport is used for each itemset at run time to preserve the essence of Apriori.,VLDB,2000,183
P-Rank: a comprehensive structural similarity measure over information networks,Peixiang Zhao; Jiawei Han; Yizhou Sun,Abstract With the ubiquity of information networks and their broad applications; the issue ofsimilarity computation between entities of an information network arises and drawsextensive research interests. However; to effectively and comprehensively measure" howsimilar two entities are within an information network" is nontrivial; and the problem becomeseven more challenging when the information network to be examined is massive anddiverse. In this paper; we propose a new similarity measure; P-Rank (Penetrating Rank);toward effectively computing the structural similarities of entities in real information networks.P-Rank enriches the well-known similarity measure; SimRank; by jointly encoding both in-and out-link relationships into structural similarity computation.

Survey on web spam detection: principles and algorithms,Nikita Spirin; Jiawei Han,Abstract Search engines became a de facto place to start information acquisition on theWeb. Though due to web spam phenomenon; search results are not always as good asdesired. Moreover; spam evolves that makes the problem of providing high quality searcheven more challenging. Over the last decade research on adversarial information retrievalhas gained a lot of interest both from academia and industry. In this paper we present asystematic review of web spam detection techniques with the focus on algorithms andunderlying principles. We categorize all existing algorithms into three categories based onthe type of information they use: content-based methods; link-based methods; and methodsbased on non-traditional data such as user behaviour; clicks; HTTP sessions. In turn; weperform a subcategorization of link-based category into five groups based on ideas and …,ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter,2012,181
Mining hidden community in heterogeneous social networks,Deng Cai; Zheng Shao; Xiaofei He; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Social network analysis has attracted much attention in recent years. Communitymining is one of the major directions in social network analysis. Most of the existing methodson community mining assume that there is only one kind of relation in the network; andmoreover; the mining results are independent of the users' needs or preferences. However;in reality; there exist multiple; heterogeneous social networks; each representing a particularkind of relationship; and each kind of relationship may play a distinct role in a particular task.Thus mining networks by assuming only one kind of relation may miss a lot of valuablehidden community information and may not be adaptable to the diverse information needsfrom different users. In this paper; we systematically analyze the problem of mining hiddencommunities on heterogeneous social networks.

When will it happen?: relationship prediction in heterogeneous information networks,Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han; Charu C Aggarwal; Nitesh V Chawla,Abstract Link prediction; ie; predicting links or interactions between objects in a network; isan important task in network analysis. Although the problem has attracted much attentionrecently; there are several challenges that have not been addressed so far. First; mostexisting studies focus only on link prediction in homogeneous networks; where all objectsand links belong to the same type. However; in the real world; heterogeneous networks thatconsist of multi-typed objects and relationships are ubiquitous. Second; most current studiesonly concern the problem of whether a link will appear in the future but seldom pay attentionto the problem of when it will happen. In this paper; we address both issues and study theproblem of predicting when a certain relationship will happen in the scenario ofheterogeneous networks. First; we extend the link prediction problem to the relationship …,Proceedings of the fifth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2012,180
Rectree: An efficient collaborative filtering method,Sonny Han Seng Chee; Jiawei Han; Ke Wang,Abstract Many people rely on the recommendations of trusted friends to find restaurants ormovies; which match their tastes. But; what if your friends have not sampled the item ofinterest? Collaborative filtering (CF) seeks to increase the effectiveness of this process byautomating the derivation of a recommendation; often from a clique of advisors that we haveno prior personal relationship with. CF is a promising tool for dealing with the informationoverload that we face in the networked world. Prior works in CF have dealt with improvingthe accuracy of the predictions. However; it is still challenging to scale these methods tolarge databases. In this study; we develop an efficient collaborative filtering method; calledRecTree (which stands for RECommendation Tree) that addresses the scalability problemwith a divide-and-conquer approach.

On community outliers and their efficient detection in information networks,Jing Gao; Feng Liang; Wei Fan; Chi Wang; Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han,Abstract Linked or networked data are ubiquitous in many applications. Examples includeweb data or hypertext documents connected via hyperlinks; social networks or user profilesconnected via friend links; co-authorship and citation information; blog data; movie reviewsand so on. In these datasets (called" information networks"); closely related objects thatshare the same properties or interests form a community. For example; a community inblogsphere could be users mostly interested in cell phone reviews and news. Outlierdetection in information networks can reveal important anomalous and interesting behaviorsthat are not obvious if community information is ignored. An example could be a low-incomeperson being friends with many rich people even though his income is not anomalously lowwhen considered over the entire population.

Event-based social networks: linking the online and offline social worlds,Xingjie Liu; Qi He; Yuanyuan Tian; Wang-Chien Lee; John McPherson; Jiawei Han,Abstract Newly emerged event-based online social services; such as Meetup and Plancast;have experienced increased popularity and rapid growth. From these services; we observeda new type of social network-event-based social network (EBSN). An EBSN does not onlycontain online social interactions as in other conventional online social networks; but alsoincludes valuable offline social interactions captured in offline activities. By analyzing realdata collected from Meetup; we investigated EBSN properties and discovered many uniqueand interesting characteristics; such as heavy-tailed degree distributions and strong localityof social interactions. We subsequently studied the heterogeneous nature (co-existence ofboth online and offline social interactions) of EBSNs on two challenging problems:community detection and information flow. We found that communities detected in EBSNs …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2012,172

Top down fp-growth for association rule mining,Ke Wang; Liu Tang; Jiawei Han; Junqiang Liu,Abstract In this paper; we propose an efficient algorithm; called TD-FP-Growth (theshorthand for Top-Down FP-Growth); to mine frequent patterns. TD-FP-Growth searches theFP-tree in the top-down order; as opposed to the bottom-up order of previously proposed FP-Growth. The advantage of the top-down search is not generating conditional pattern basesand sub-FP-trees; thus; saving substantial amount of time and space. We extend TD-FP-Growth to mine association rules by applying two new pruning strategies: one is to pushmultiple minimum supports and the other is to push the minimum confidence.

We often depend on the correctworking of software systems. Due to the difficulty and complexity of software systems; bugsand anomalies are prevalent. Bugs have caused billions of dollars loss; in addition toprivacy and security threats. In this work; we address software reliability issues by proposinga novel method to classify software behaviors based on past history or runs. With thetechnique; it is possible to generalize past known errors and mistakes to capture failures andanomalies. Our technique first mines a set of discriminative features capturing repetitiveseries of events from program execution traces. It then performs feature selection to selectthe best features for classification. These features are then used to train a classifier to detectfailures.

Mining closed relational graphs with connectivity constraints,Xifeng Yan; X Zhou; Jiawei Han,Abstract Relational graphs are widely used in modeling large scale networks such asbiological networks and social networks. In this kind of graph; connectivity becomes criticalin identifying highly associated groups and clusters. In this paper; we investigate the issuesof mining closed frequent graphs with connectivity constraints in massive relational graphswhere each graph has around 10K nodes and 1M edges. We adopt the concept of edgeconnectivity and apply the results from graph theory; to speed up the mining process. Twoapproaches are developed to handle different mining requests: CloseCut; a pattern-growthapproach; and splat; a pattern-reduction approach. We have applied these methods inbiological datasets and found the discovered patterns interesting.,Proceedings of the eleventh ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery in data mining,2005,169
On appropriate assumptions to mine data streams: Analysis and practice,Jing Gao; Wei Fan; Jiawei Han,Recent years have witnessed an increasing number of studies in stream mining; which aimat building an accurate model for continuously arriving data. Somehow most existing workmakes the implicit assumption that the training data and the yet-to-come testing data arealways sampled from the" same distribution"; and yet this" same distribution" evolves overtime. We demonstrate that this may not be true; and one actually may never know either"how" or" when" the distribution changes. Thus; a model that fits well on the observeddistribution can have unsatisfactory accuracy on the incoming data. Practically; one can justassume the bare minimum that learning from observed data is better than both randomguessing and always predicting exactly the same class label. Importantly; we formally andexperimentally demonstrate the robustness of a model averaging and simple voting …,Data Mining; 2007. ICDM 2007. Seventh IEEE International Conference on,2007,168
Pathselclus: Integrating meta-path selection with user-guided object clustering in heterogeneous information networks,Yizhou Sun; Brandon Norick; Jiawei Han; Xifeng Yan; Philip S Yu; Xiao Yu,Abstract Real-world; multiple-typed objects are often interconnected; forming heterogeneousinformation networks. A major challenge for link-based clustering in such networks is theirpotential to generate many different results; carrying rather diverse semantic meanings. Inorder to generate desired clustering; we propose to use meta-path; a path that connectsobject types via a sequence of relations; to control clustering with distinct semantics.Nevertheless; it is easier for a user to provide a few examples (seeds) than a weightedcombination of sophisticated meta-paths to specify her clustering preference. Thus; wepropose to integrate meta-path selection with user-guided clustering to cluster objects innetworks; where a user first provides a small set of object seeds for each cluster asguidance. Then the system learns the weight for each meta-path that is consistent with the …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2013,167

Mining advisor-advisee relationships from research publication networks,Chi Wang; Jiawei Han; Yuntao Jia; Jie Tang; Duo Zhang; Yintao Yu; Jingyi Guo,Abstract Information network contains abundant knowledge about relationships amongpeople or entities.

For example; in a researchpublication network; the advisor-advisee relationships among researchers are hidden in thecoauthor network. Discovery of those relationships can benefit many interesting applicationssuch as expert finding and research community analysis. In this paper; we take a computerscience bibliographic network as an example; to analyze the roles of authors and to discoverthe likely advisor-advisee relationships. In particular; we propose a time-constrainedprobabilistic factor graph model (TPFG); which takes a research publication network as inputand models the advisor-advisee relationship mining problem using a jointly likelihood …,Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2010,162
Frequent closed sequence mining without candidate maintenance,Jianyong Wang; Jiawei Han; Chun Li,Previous studies have presented convincing arguments that a frequent pattern miningalgorithm should not mine all frequent patterns but only the closed ones because the latterleads to not only a more compact yet complete result set but also better efficiency. However;most of the previously developed closed pattern mining algorithms work under the candidatemaintenance-and-test paradigm; which is inherently costly in both runtime and space usagewhen the support threshold is low or the patterns become long. In this paper; we presentBIDE; an efficient algorithm for mining frequent closed sequences without candidatemaintenance. It adopts a novel sequence closure checking scheme called Bl-DirectionalExtension and prunes the search space more deeply compared to the previous algorithmsby using the BackScan pruning method.

Such a databaseconsists of multiple relations that are linked together conceptually via entity-relationship linksin the design of relational database schemas. Multi-relational classification can be widelyused in many disciplines including financial decision making and medical research.However; most classification approaches only work on single “flat” data relations. It is usuallydifficult to convert multiple relations into a single flat relation without either introducing huge“universal relation” or losing essential information.

Although classification has been studied extensively; few of the known methodstake serious consideration of efficient induction in large databases and the analysis of dataat multiple abstraction levels. The paper addresses the efficiency and scalability issues byproposing a data classification method which integrates attribute oriented induction;relevance analysis; and the induction of decision trees. Such an integration leads to efficient;high quality; multiple level classification of large amounts of data; the relaxation of therequirement of perfect training sets; and the elegant handling of continuous and noisy data.,Research Issues in Data Engineering; 1997.

Growth and differentiation of C2 myogenic cells are dependent on serum response factor.,Marielle Soulez; CÉCILE GAUTHIER Rouviere; Philippe Chafey; Daniele Hentzen; Marie Vandromme; Nicole Lautredou; Ned Lamb; Axel Kahn; David Tuil,ABSTRACT In order to study to what extent and at which stage serum response factor (SRF)is indispensable for myogenesis; we stably transfected C2 myogenic cells with;successively; a glucocorticoid receptor expression vector and a construct allowing for theexpression of an SRF antisense RNA under the direction of the mouse mammary tumor viruslong terminal repeat. In the clones obtained; SRF synthesis is reversibly down-regulated byinduction of SRF antisense RNA expression by dexamethasone; whose effect isantagonized by the anti-hormone RU486. Two kinds of proliferation and differentiationpatterns have been obtained in the resulting clones. Some clones with a high level ofconstitutive SRF antisense RNA expression are unable to differentiate into myotubes; theirgrowth can be blocked by further induction of SRF antisense RNA expression by …,Molecular and cellular biology,1996,159
LinkClus: efficient clustering via heterogeneous semantic links,Xiaoxin Yin; Jiawei Han; Philip S Yu,Abstract Data objects in a relational database are cross-linked with each other via multi-typed links. Links contain rich semantic information that may indicate important relationshipsamong objects. Most current clustering methods rely only on the properties that belong to theobjects per se. However; the similarities between objects are often indicated by the links;and desirable clusters cannot be generated using only the properties of objects. In thispaper we explore linkage-based clustering; in which the similarity between two objects ismeasured based on the similarities between the objects linked with them. In comparisonwith a previous study (SimRank) that computes links recursively on all pairs of objects; wetake advantage of the power law distribution of links; and develop a hierarchical structurecalled SimTree to represent similarities in multi-granularity manner. This method avoids …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,158
An efficient two-step method for classification of spatial data,Krzysztof Koperski; Jiawei Han; Nebojsa Stefanovic,Abstract Spatial data mining; ie; discovery of interesting; implicit knowledge in spatialdatabases; is a highly demanding field because very large amounts of spatial data havebeen collected in various applications; ranging from remote sensing; to geographicalinformation systems (GIS); computer cartography; environmental assessment and planning;etc. In this paper; an efficient method for building decision trees for the classification ofobjects stored in geographic information databases is proposed and studied. Our approachto spatial classification is based on both (1) non-spatial properties of the classified objectsand (2) attributes; predicates and functions describing spatial relations between classifiedobjects and other features located in the spatial proximity of the classified objects. Severaloptimization techniques are explored; including a two-step spatial computation technique …,proceedings of International Symposium on Spatial Data Handling (SDH’98),1998,158
PET: a statistical model for popular events tracking in social communities,Cindy Xide Lin; Bo Zhao; Qiaozhu Mei; Jiawei Han,Abstract User generated information in online communities has been characterized with themixture of a text stream and a network structure both changing over time. A good example isa web-blogging community with the daily blog posts and a social network of bloggers. Animportant task of analyzing an online community is to observe and track the popular events;or topics that evolve over time in the community. Existing approaches usually focus on eitherthe burstiness of topics or the evolution of networks; but ignoring the interplay betweentextual topics and network structures.,Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2010,156
Community mining from multi-relational networks,Deng Cai; Zheng Shao; Xiaofei He; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Social network analysis has attracted much attention in recent years. Communitymining is one of the major directions in social network analysis. Most of the existing methodson community mining assume that there is only one kind of relation in the network; andmoreover; the mining results are independent of the users' needs or preferences. However;in reality; there exist multiple; heterogeneous social networks; each representing a particularkind of relationship; and each kind of relationship may play a distinct role in a particular task.In this paper; we systematically analyze the problem of mining hidden communities onheterogeneous social networks. Based on the observation that different relations havedifferent importance with respect to a certain query; we propose a new method for learningan optimal linear combination of these relations which can best meet the user's …,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2005,156
Spectral regression: A unified approach for sparse subspace learning,Deng Cai; Xiaofei He; Jiawei Han,Recently the problem of dimensionality reduction (or; subspace learning) has received a lotof interests in many fields of information processing; including data mining; informationretrieval; and pattern recognition. Some popular methods include principal componentanalysis (PCA); linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and locality preserving projection (LPP).However; a disadvantage of all these approaches is that the learned projective functions arelinear combinations of all the original features; thus it is often difficult to interpret the results.In this paper; we propose a novel dimensionality reduction framework; called Unified SparseSubspace Learning (USSL); for learning sparse projections. USSL casts the problem oflearning the projective functions into a regression framework; which facilitates the use ofdifferent kinds of regularizes. By using a L 1-norm regularizer (lasso); the sparse …,Data Mining; 2007. ICDM 2007. Seventh IEEE International Conference on,2007,153
Locally consistent concept factorization for document clustering,Deng Cai; Xiaofei He; Jiawei Han,Previous studies have demonstrated that document clustering performance can be improvedsignificantly in lower dimensional linear subspaces. Recently; matrix factorization-basedtechniques; such as Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Concept Factorization(CF); have yielded impressive results. However; both of them effectively see only the globaleuclidean geometry; whereas the local manifold geometry is not fully considered. In thispaper; we propose a new approach to extract the document concepts which are consistentwith the manifold geometry such that each concept corresponds to a connected component.Central to our approach is a graph model which captures the local geometry of thedocument submanifold. Thus; we call it Locally Consistent Concept Factorization (LCCF).

High-dimensional OLAP: A minimal cubing approach,Xiaolei Li; Jiawei Han; Hector Gonzalez,Abstract Data cube has been playing an essential role in fast OLAP (online analyticalprocessing) in many multi-dimensional data warehouses. However; there exist data sets inapplications like bioinformatics; statistics; and text processing that are characterized by highdimensionality; eg; over 100 dimensions; and moderate size; eg; around 10 6 tuples. Nofeasible data cube can be constructed with such data sets. In this paper we will address theproblem of developing an efficient algorithm to perform OLAP on such data sets. Experiencetells us that although data analysis tasks may involve a high dimensional space; most OLAPoperations are performed only on a small number of dimensions at a time. Based on thisobservation; we propose a novel method that computes a thin layer of the data cubetogether with associated value-list indices. This layer; while being manageable in size …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,150

Modeling hidden topics on document manifold,Deng Cai; Qiaozhu Mei; Jiawei Han; Chengxiang Zhai,Abstract Topic modeling has been a key problem for document analysis. One of thecanonical approaches for topic modeling is Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing; whichmaximizes the joint probability of documents and terms in the corpus. The majordisadvantage of PLSI is that it estimates the probability distribution of each document on thehidden topics independently and the number of parameters in the model grows linearly withthe size of the corpus; which leads to serious problems with overfitting. Latent DirichletAllocation (LDA) is proposed to overcome this problem by treating the probability distributionof each document over topics as a hidden random variable. Both of these two methodsdiscover the hidden topics in the Euclidean space. However; there is no convincingevidence that the document space is Euclidean; or flat. Therefore; it is more natural and …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2008,147

While there are some recent studies on mining data streams; we would like to askthe following essential question: What are the distinct features of mining data streamscompared to mining other kinds of data? In this paper; we take the following position: onlinemining of the changes in data streams is one of the core issues. We propose someinteresting research problems and highlight the inherent challenges.

Graph cube: on warehousing and OLAP multidimensional networks,Peixiang Zhao; Xiaolei Li; Dong Xin; Jiawei Han,Abstract We consider extending decision support facilities toward large sophisticatednetworks; upon which multidimensional attributes are associated with network entities;thereby forming the so-called multidimensional networks. Data warehouses and OLAP(Online Analytical Processing) technology have proven to be effective tools for decisionsupport on relational data. However; they are not well-equipped to handle the new yetimportant multidimensional networks. In this paper; we introduce Graph Cube; a new datawarehousing model that supports OLAP queries effectively on large multidimensionalnetworks. By taking account of both attribute aggregation and structure summarization of thenetworks; Graph Cube goes beyond the traditional data cube model involved solely withnumeric value based group-by's; thus resulting in a more insightful and structure-enriched …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,142
Meta-Rule-Guided Mining of Association Rules in Relational Databases.,Yongjian Fu; Jiawei Han,Abstract A meta-rule-guided data mining approach is proposed and studied which appliesmeta-rules as a guidance at nding multiple-level association rules in large relationaldatabases. A meta-rule is a rule template in the form of\P1^^ Pm! Q1^^ Qn"; in which some ofthe predicates (and/or their variables) in the antecedent and/or consequent of the meta-rulecould be instantiated. The rule template is used to describe what forms of rules are expectedto be found from the database; and such a rule template is used as a guidance or constraintin the data mining process. Note that the predicate variables in a meta-rule can beinstantiated against a database schema; whereas the variables or some high-levelconstants inside a predicate can be bound to multiple (but more speci c) levels of conceptsin the corresponding conceptual hierarchies. The concrete rules at di erent concept levels …,KDOOD/TDOOD,1995,142
Constrained frequent pattern mining: a pattern-growth view,Jian Pei; Jiawei Han,Abstract It has been well recognized that frequent pattern mining plays an essential role inmany important data mining tasks. However; frequent pattern mining often generates a verylarge number of patterns and rules; which reduces not only the efficiency but also theeffectiveness of mining. Recent work has highlighted the importance of the constraint-basedmining paradigm in the context of mining frequent itemsets; associations; correlations;sequential patterns; and many other interesting patterns in large databases. Recently; wedeveloped efficient pattern-growth methods for frequent pattern mining. Interestingly; pattern-growth methods are not only efficient but also effective in mining with various constraints.Many tough constraints which cannot be handled by previous methods can be pushed deepinto the pattern-growth mining process.

Graph OLAP: Towards online analytical processing on graphs,Chen Chen; Xifeng Yan; Feida Zhu; Jiawei Han; S Yu Philip,OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) is an important notion in data analysis. Recently;more and more graph or networked data sources come into being. There exists a similarneed to deploy graph analysis from different perspectives and with multiple granularities.However; traditional OLAP technology cannot handle such demands because it does notconsider the links among individual data tuples. In this paper; we develop a novel graphOLAP framework; which presents a multi-dimensional and multi-level view over graphs. Thecontributions of this work are two-fold. First; starting from basic definitions; ie; what aredimensions and measures in the graph OLAP scenario; we develop a conceptual frameworkfor data cubes on graphs. We also look into different semantics of OLAP operations; andclassify the framework into two major subcases: informational OLAP and topological …,Data Mining; 2008. ICDM'08.

Graph regularized transductive classification on heterogeneous information networks,Ming Ji; Yizhou Sun; Marina Danilevsky; Jiawei Han; Jing Gao,Abstract A heterogeneous information network is a network composed of multiple types ofobjects and links. Recently; it has been recognized that strongly-typed heterogeneousinformation networks are prevalent in the real world. Sometimes; label information isavailable for some objects. Learning from such labeled and unlabeled data via transductiveclassification can lead to good knowledge extraction of the hidden network structure.However; although classification on homogeneous networks has been studied for decades;classification on heterogeneous networks has not been explored until recently. In this paper;we consider the transductive classification problem on heterogeneous networked datawhich share a common topic. Only some objects in the given network are labeled; and weaim to predict labels for all types of the remaining objects.

Most of the previous studies in this category onlyconsider a single relationship type; such as friendships in a social network. In manyscenarios; the entity recommendation problem exists in a heterogeneous informationnetwork environment. Different types of relationships can be potentially used to improve therecommendation quality. In this paper; we study the entity recommendation problem inheterogeneous information networks.

Ranking-based classification of heterogeneous information networks,Ming Ji; Jiawei Han; Marina Danilevsky,Abstract It has been recently recognized that heterogeneous information networkscomposed of multiple types of nodes and links are prevalent in the real world. Bothclassification and ranking of the nodes (or data objects) in such networks are essential fornetwork analysis. However; so far these approaches have generally been performedseparately. In this paper; we combine ranking and classification in order to perform moreaccurate analysis of a heterogeneous information network. Our intuition is that highly rankedobjects within a class should play more important roles in classification. On the other hand;class membership information is important for determining a quality ranking over a dataset.We believe it is therefore beneficial to integrate classification and ranking in a simultaneous;mutually enhancing process; and to this end; propose a novel ranking-based iterative …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2011,137
Direct mining of discriminative and essential frequent patterns via model-based search tree,Wei Fan; Kun Zhang; Hong Cheng; Jing Gao; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; Philip Yu; Olivier Verscheure,Abstract Frequent patterns provide solutions to datasets that do not have well-structuredfeature vectors. However; frequent pattern mining is non-trivial since the number of uniquepatterns is exponential but many are non-discriminative and correlated. Currently; frequentpattern mining is performed in two sequential steps: enumerating a set of frequent patterns;followed by feature selection. Although many methods have been proposed in the past fewyears on how to perform each separate step efficiently; there is still limited success ineventually finding highly compact and discriminative patterns. The culprit is due to theinherent nature of this widely adopted two-step approach. This paper discusses theseproblems and proposes a new and different method. It builds a decision tree that partitionsthe data onto different nodes. Then at each node; it directly discovers a discriminative …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2008,136

Efficient kernel discriminant analysis via spectral regression,Deng Cai; Xiaofei He; Jiawei Han,Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) has been a popular method for extracting features whichpreserve class separability. The projection vectors are commonly obtained by maximizingthe between class covariance and simultaneously minimizing the within class covariance.LDA can be performed either in the original input space or in the reproducing kernel Hilbertspace (RKHS) into which data points are mapped; which leads to Kernel DiscriminantAnalysis (KDA). When the data are highly nonlinear distributed; KDA can achieve betterperformance than LDA. However; computing the projective functions in KDA involves eigen-decomposition of kernel matrix; which is very expensive when a large number of trainingsamples exist. In this paper; we present a new algorithm for kernel discriminant analysis;called spectral regression kernel discriminant analysis (SRKDA). By using spectral graph …,Data Mining; 2007. ICDM 2007.

We investigate the application of discovered knowledge;concept hierarchies; and knowledge discovery tools for intelligent query answering indatabase systems. A knowledge-rich data model is constructed to incorporate discoveredknowledge and knowledge discovery tools. Queries are classified into data queries andknowledge queries. Both types of queries can be answered directly by simple retrieval orintelligently by analyzing the intent of query and providing generalized; neighborhood orassociated information using stored or discovered knowledge. Techniques have beendeveloped for intelligent query answering using discovered knowledge and/or knowledgediscovery tools; which includes generalization; data summarization; concept clustering …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1996,133
A practical approach to classify evolving data streams: Training with limited amount of labeled data,Mohammad M Masud; Jing Gao; Latifur Khan; Jiawei Han; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Recent approaches in classifying evolving data streams are based on supervised learningalgorithms; which can be trained with labeled data only. Manual labeling of data is bothcostly and time consuming. Therefore; in a real streaming environment; where hugevolumes of data appear at a high speed; labeled data may be very scarce. Thus; only alimited amount of training data may be available for building the classification models;leading to poorly trained classifiers. We apply a novel technique to overcome this problemby building a classification model from a training set having both unlabeled and a smallamount of labeled instances. This model is built as micro-clusters using semisupervisedclustering technique and classification is performed with κ-nearest neighbor algorithm. Anensemble of these models is used to classify the unlabeled data. Empirical evaluation on …,Data Mining; 2008. ICDM'08. Eighth IEEE International Conference on,2008,131
Resolving conflicts in heterogeneous data by truth discovery and source reliability estimation,Qi Li; Yaliang Li; Jing Gao; Bo Zhao; Wei Fan; Jiawei Han,Abstract In many applications; one can obtain descriptions about the same objects or eventsfrom a variety of sources. As a result; this will inevitably lead to data or information conflicts.One important problem is to identify the true information (ie; the truths) among conflictingsources of data. It is intuitive to trust reliable sources more when deriving the truths; but it isusually unknown which one is more reliable a priori. Moreover; each source possesses avariety of properties with different data types. An accurate estimation of source reliability hasto be made by modeling multiple properties in a unified model. Existing conflict resolutionwork either does not conduct source reliability estimation; or models multiple propertiesseparately. In this paper; we propose to resolve conflicts among multiple sources ofheterogeneous data types. We model the problem using an optimization framework …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,130
Mining behavior graphs for “backtrace” of noncrashing bugs,Chao Liu; Xifeng Yan; Hwanjo Yu; Jiawei Han; Philip S Yu,Abstract Analyzing the executions of a buggy software program is essentially a data miningprocess. Although many interesting methods have been developed to trace crashing bugs(such as memory violation and core dumps); it is still difficult to analyze noncrashing bugs(such as logical errors). In this paper; we develop a novel method to classify the structuredtraces of program executions using software behavior graphs. By analyzing the correct andincorrect executions; we have made good progress at the isolation of program regions thatmay lead to the faulty executions. The classification framework is built on an integration ofclosed graph mining and SVM classification. More interestingly; suspicious regions areidentified through the capture of the classification accuracy change; which is measuredincrementally during program execution.

The extension to storage and other delay sensitive data typesis straightforward. This paper builds on the necessity of avoiding starvation of the consumer;and the assumption that certain sets of reads lead to a net increase in the number ofsamples buffered; to establish a theoretical framework for studying simultaneous multipleaccess. Our approach allows the possibility of splitting data into sorting sets for the purposeof reducing disk latencies and gives an optimal algorithm for the reduction. It explicitlyhandles both contiguous and noncontiguous file layouts. Lower bounds on read amounts …,Multimedia Systems,1994,125
Fast computation of simrank for static and dynamic information networks,Cuiping Li; Jiawei Han; Guoming He; Xin Jin; Yizhou Sun; Yintao Yu; Tianyi Wu,Abstract Information networks are ubiquitous in many applications and analysis on suchnetworks has attracted significant attention in the academic communities. One of the mostimportant aspects of information network analysis is to measure similarity between nodes ina network. SimRank is a simple and influential measure of this kind; based on a solidtheoretical" random surfer" model. Existing work computes SimRank similarity scores in aniterative mode. We argue that the iterative method can be infeasible and inefficient when; asin many real-world scenarios; the networks change dynamically and frequently. We envisionnon-iterative method to bridge the gap. It allows users not only to update the similarity scoresincrementally; but also to derive similarity scores for an arbitrary subset of nodes. To enablethe non-iterative computation; we propose to rewrite the SimRank equation into a non …,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2010,124
Isometric projection,Deng Cai; Xiaofei He; Jiawei Han,Abstract Recently the problem of dimensionality reduction has received a lot of interests inmany fields of information processing. We consider the case where data is sampled from alow dimensional manifold which is embedded in high dimensional Euclidean space. Themost popular manifold learning algorithms include Locally Linear Embedding; ISOMAP; andLaplacian Eigenmap. However; these algorithms are nonlinear and only provide theembedding results of training samples. In this paper; we propose a novel lineardimensionality reduction algorithm; called Isometric Projection. Isometric Projectionconstructs a weighted data graph where the weights are discrete approximations of thegeodesic distances on the data manifold. A linear subspace is then obtained by preservingthe pairwise distances. In this way; Isometric Projection can be defined everywhere …,AAAI,2007,124
Extracting redundancy-aware top-k patterns,Dong Xin; Hong Cheng; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Observed in many applications; there is a potential need of extracting a small set offrequent patterns having not only high significance but also low redundancy. Thesignificance is usually defined by the context of applications. Previous studies have beenconcentrating on how to compute top-k significant patterns or how to remove redundancyamong patterns separately. There is limited work on finding those top-k patterns whichdemonstrate high-significance and low-redundancy simultaneously. In this paper; we studythe problem of extracting redundancy-aware top-k patterns from a large collection offrequent patterns. We first examine the evaluation functions for measuring the combinedsignificance of a pattern set and propose the MMS (Maximal Marginal Significance) as theproblem formulation. The problem is known as NP-hard. We further present a greedy …,Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2006,124
CETR: content extraction via tag ratios,Tim Weninger; William H Hsu; Jiawei Han,Abstract We present Content Extraction via Tag Ratios (CETR)-a method to extract contenttext from diverse webpages by using the HTML document's tag ratios. We describe how tocompute tag ratios on a line-by-line basis and then cluster the resulting histogram intocontent and non-content areas. Initially; we find that the tag ratio histogram is not easilyclustered because of its one-dimensionality; therefore we extend the original approach inorder to model the data in two dimensions. Next; we present a tailored clustering techniquewhich operates on the two-dimensional model; and then evaluate our approach against alarge set of alternative methods using standard accuracy; precision and recall metrics on alarge and varied Web corpus.

A framework for on-demand classification of evolving data streams,Charu C Aggarwal; Jiawei Han; Jianyong Wang; Philip S Yu,Current models of the classification problem do not effectively handle bursts of particularclasses coming in at different times. In fact; the current model of the classification problemsimply concentrates on methods for one-pass classification modeling of very large data sets.Our model for data stream classification views the data stream classification problem fromthe point of view of a dynamic approach in which simultaneous training and test streams areused for dynamic classification of data sets. This model reflects real-life situations effectively;since it is desirable to classify test streams in real time over an evolving training and teststream. The aim here is to create a classification system in which the training model canadapt quickly to the changes of the underlying data stream. In order to achieve this goal; wepropose an on-demand classification process which can dynamically select the …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2006,123

The wisdom of social multimedia: using flickr for prediction and forecast,Xin Jin; Andrew Gallagher; Liangliang Cao; Jiebo Luo; Jiawei Han,Abstract Social multimedia hosting and sharing websites; such as Flickr; Facebook;Youtube; Picasa; ImageShack and Photobucket; are increasingly popular around the globe.A major trend in the current studies on social multimedia is using the social media sites as asource of huge amount of labeled data for solving large scale computer science problems incomputer vision; data mining and multimedia. In this paper; we take a new path to explorethe global trends and sentiments that can be drawn by analyzing the sharing patterns ofuploaded and downloaded social multimedia. In a sense; each time an image or video isuploaded or viewed; it constitutes an implicit vote for (or against) the subject of the image.This vote carries along with it a rich set of associated data including time and (often) locationinformation.

Breaking the barrier of transactions: Mining inter-transaction association rules,Anthony KH Tung; Hongjun Lu; Jiawei Han; Ling Feng,Abstract Most of the previous studies on mining association rules are on mining intro-transaction associations; ie; the associations among items within the same transaction;where the notion of the transaction could be the items bought by the same customer; theevents happened on the same day; etc. In this study; we break the barrier of transactionsand extend the scope of mining association rules from traditional intratransactionassociations to inter-transaction associations. Mining inter-transaction associations posesmore challenges on efficient processing than mining intra-transaction associations becausethe number of potential association rules becomes extremely large after the boundary oftransactions is broken.

On exploiting transient social contact patterns for data forwarding in delay-tolerant networks,Wei Gao; Guohong Cao; Tom La Porta; Jiawei Han,Unpredictable node mobility; low node density; and lack of global information make itchallenging to achieve effective data forwarding in Delay-Tolerant Networks (DTNs). Most ofthe current data forwarding schemes choose the nodes with the best cumulative capability ofcontacting others as relays to carry and forward data; but these nodes may not be the bestrelay choices within a short time period due to the heterogeneity of transient node contactcharacteristics. In this paper; we propose a novel approach to improve the performance ofdata forwarding with a short time constraint in DTNs by exploiting the transient social contactpatterns. These patterns represent the transient characteristics of contact distribution;network connectivity and social community structure in DTNs; and we provide analyticalformulations on these patterns based on experimental studies of realistic DTN traces.

Speed up kernel discriminant analysis,Deng Cai; Xiaofei He; Jiawei Han,Abstract Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) has been a popular method for dimensionalityreduction; which preserves class separability. The projection vectors are commonly obtainedby maximizing the between-class covariance and simultaneously minimizing the within-class covariance. LDA can be performed either in the original input space or in thereproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) into which data points are mapped; which leads tokernel discriminant analysis (KDA). When the data are highly nonlinear distributed; KDA canachieve better performance than LDA. However; computing the projective functions in KDAinvolves eigen-decomposition of kernel matrix; which is very expensive when a largenumber of training samples exist. In this paper; we present a new algorithm for kerneldiscriminant analysis; called Spectral Regression Kernel Discriminant Analysis (SRKDA) …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2011,117
itopicmodel: Information network-integrated topic modeling,Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han; Jing Gao; Yintao Yu,Document networks; ie; networks associated with text information; are becomingincreasingly popular due to the ubiquity of Web documents; blogs; and various kinds ofonline data. In this paper; we propose a novel topic modeling framework for documentnetworks; which builds a unified generative topic model that is able to consider both text andstructure information for documents. A graphical model is proposed to describe thegenerative model. On the top layer of this graphical model; we define a novel multivariateMarkov Random Field for topic distribution random variables for each document; to modelthe dependency relationships among documents over the network structure. On the bottomlayer; we follow the traditional topic model to model the generation of text for eachdocument. A joint distribution function for both the text and structure of the documents is …,Data Mining; 2009. ICDM'09. Ninth IEEE International Conference on,2009,117
Graph indexing based on discriminative frequent structure analysis,Xifeng Yan; Philip S Yu; Jiawei Han,Abstract Graphs have become increasingly important in modelling complicated structuresand schemaless data such as chemical compounds; proteins; and XML documents. Given agraph query; it is desirable to retrieve graphs quickly from a large database via indices. Inthis article; we investigate the issues of indexing graphs and propose a novel indexingmodel based on discriminative frequent structures that are identified through a graph miningprocess. We show that the compact index built under this model can achieve betterperformance in processing graph queries. Since discriminative frequent structures capturethe intrinsic characteristics of the data; they are relatively stable to database updates; thusfacilitating sampling-based feature extraction and incremental index maintenance. Ourapproach not only provides an elegant solution to the graph indexing problem; but also …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2005,117
Flowcube: constructing RFID flowcubes for multi-dimensional analysis of commodity flows,Hector Gonzalez; Jiawei Han; Xiaolei Li,Abstract With the advent of RFID (Radio Frequency Identication) technology; manufacturers;distributors; and retailers will be able to track the movement of individual objects throughoutthe supply chain. The volume of data generated by a typical RFID application will beenormous as each item will generate a complete history of all the individual locations that itoccupied at every point in time; possibly from a specific production line at a given factory;passing through multiple warehouses; and all the way to a particular checkout counter in astore. The movement trails of such RFID data form gigantic commodity flowgraphrepresenting the locations and durations of the path stages traversed by each item. Thiscommodity flow contains rich multi-dimensional information on the characteristics; trends;changes and outliers of commodity movements.

Emerging scientific applications in data mining,Jiawei Han; Russ B Altman; Vipin Kumar; Heikki Mannila; Daryl Pregibon,Biology is in the midst of a revolution; with an unprecedented flood of data forcing biologists torethink their approach to scientific discovery. First; large-scale data-collection techniques haveemerged for a number of data sources limited by throughput; or the amount of availabledata. Examples of the data glut include: systematic genome DNA sequencing of organisms;high-throughput determination of small molecule structures; as well as large macromolecularstructures (such as proteins; RNA; and DNA); large-scale measurements of molecularinteractions; and simultaneous measurement of the expression level of all genes (thousandsto tens of thousands) in a population of cells.

Dustminer: troubleshooting interactive complexity bugs in sensor networks,Mohammad Maifi Hasan Khan; Hieu Khac Le; Hossein Ahmadi; Tarek F Abdelzaher; Jiawei Han,Abstract This paper presents a tool for uncovering bugs due to interactive complexity innetworked sensing applications. Such bugs are not localized to one component that is faulty;but rather result from complex and unexpected interactions between multiple oftenindividually non-faulty components. Moreover; the manifestations of these bugs are often notrepeatable; making them particularly hard to find; as the particular sequence of events thatinvokes the bug may not be easy to reconstruct. Because of the distributed nature of failurescenarios; our tool looks for sequences of events that may be responsible for faulty behavior;as opposed to localized bugs such as a bad pointer in a module. An extensible framework isdeveloped where a front-end collects runtime data logs of the system being debugged andan offline back-end uses frequent discriminative pattern mining to uncover likely causes …,Proceedings of the 6th ACM conference on Embedded network sensor systems,2008,114
CoMine: Efficient Mining of Correlated Patterns.,Young-Koo Lee; Won-Young Kim; Y Dora Cai; Jiawei Han,Abstract Association rule mining often generates a huge number of rules; but a majority ofthem either are redundant or do not reflect the true correlation relationship among dataobjects. In this paper; we re-examine this problem and show that two interesting measures;all confidence (denoted as α) and coherence (denoted as γ); both disclose genuinecorrelation relationships and can be computed efficiently. Moreover; we propose twointeresting algorithms; CoMine (α) and CoMine (γ); based on extensions of a pattern-growthmethodology. Our performance study shows that the CoMine algorithms have highperformance in comparison with their Apriori-based counterpart algorithms.,ICDM,2003,114
Mining knowledge at multiple concept levels,Jiawei Han,Abstract Most studies on data mining have been focused at mining rules at single conceptlevels; ie;; either at the primitive level or at a rather high concept level. However; it is oftendesirable to discover knowledge at multiple concept levels. Mining knowledge at multiplelevels may help database users find some interesting rules which are difficult to bediscovered otherwise and view database contents at different abstraction levels and fromdifferent angles. Methods for mining knowledge at multiple concept levels can often bedeveloped by extension of existing data mining techniques. Moreover; for eficientprocessing and interactive mining of multiple-level rules; it is often necessary to adopttechniques such as step-by-step generalization/specialization or progressive deepening of aknowledge mining process. Other issues; such as visual representation of knowledge at …,Proceedings of the fourth international conference on Information and knowledge management,1995,113
Failure proximity: a fault localization-based approach,Chao Liu; Jiawei Han,Abstract Recent software systems usually feature an automated failure reporting system;with which a huge number of failing traces are collected every day. In order to prioritize faultdiagnosis; failing traces due to the same fault are expected to be grouped together. Previousmethods; by hypothesizing that similar failing traces imply the same fault; cluster failingtraces based on the literal trace similarity; which we call trace proximity. However; since afault can be triggered in many ways; failing traces due to the same fault can be quitedifferent. Therefore; previous methods actually group together traces exhibiting similarbehaviors; like similar branch coverage; rather than traces due to the same fault. In thispaper; we propose a new type of failure proximity; called RP roximity; which regards twofailing traces as similar if they suggest roughly the same fault location. The fault location …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGSOFT international symposium on Foundations of software engineering,2006,112
Probabilistic topic models with biased propagation on heterogeneous information networks,Hongbo Deng; Jiawei Han; Bo Zhao; Yintao Yu; Cindy Xide Lin,Abstract With the development of Web applications; textual documents are not only gettingricher; but also ubiquitously interconnected with users and other objects in various ways;which brings about text-rich heterogeneous information networks. Topic models have beenproposed and shown to be useful for document analysis; and the interactions among multi-typed objects play a key role at disclosing the rich semantics of the network. However; mostof topic models only consider the textual information while ignore the network structures orcan merely integrate with homogeneous networks. None of them can handle heterogeneousinformation network well. In this paper; we propose a novel topic model with biasedpropagation (TMBP) algorithm to directly incorporate heterogeneous information networkwith topic modeling in a unified way. The underlying intuition is that multi-typed objects …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2011,110
Joint feature selection and subspace learning,Quanquan Gu; Zhenhui Li; Jiawei Han,Abstract Dimensionality reduction is a very important topic in machine learning. It can begenerally classified into two categories: feature selection and subspace learning. In the pastdecades; many methods have been proposed for dimensionality reduction. However; mostof these works study feature selection and subspace learning independently. In this paper;we present a framework for joint feature selection and subspace learning. We reformulatethe subspace learning problem and use L2; 1-norm on the projection matrix to achieverowsparsity; which leads to selecting relevant features and learning transformationsimultaneously. We discuss two situations of the proposed framework; and present theiroptimization algorithms. Experiments on benchmark face recognition data sets illustrate thatthe proposed framework outperforms the state of the art methods overwhelmingly.,IJCAI Proceedings-International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2011,110
Pushing convertible constraints in frequent itemset mining,Jian Pei; Jiawei Han; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Recent work has highlighted the importance of the constraint-based miningparadigm in the context of frequent itemsets; associations; correlations; sequential patterns;and many other interesting patterns in large databases. Constraint pushing techniques havebeen developed for mining frequent patterns and associations with antimonotonic;monotonic; and succinct constraints. In this paper; we study constraints which cannot behandled with existing theory and techniques in frequent pattern mining. For example; avg (S)θ v; median (S) θ v; sum (S) θ v (S can contain items of arbitrary values; θ∈{<;<;≤;≥} and vis a real number.) are customarily regarded as “tough” constraints in that they cannot bepushed inside an algorithm such as Apriori. We develop a notion of convertible constraintsand systematically analyze; classify; and characterize this class. We also develop …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2004,110
Shrink: a structural clustering algorithm for detecting hierarchical communities in networks,Jianbin Huang; Heli Sun; Jiawei Han; Hongbo Deng; Yizhou Sun; Yaguang Liu,Abstract Community detection is an important task for mining the structure and function ofcomplex networks. Generally; there are several different kinds of nodes in a network whichare cluster nodes densely connected within communities; as well as some special nodeslike hubs bridging multiple communities and outliers marginally connected with acommunity. In addition; it has been shown that there is a hierarchical structure in complexnetworks with communities embedded within other communities. Therefore; a goodalgorithm is desirable to be able to not only detect hierarchical communities; but also identifyhubs and outliers. In this paper; we propose a parameter-free hierarchical network clusteringalgorithm SHRINK by combining the advantages of density-based clustering and modularityoptimization methods. Based on the structural connectivity information; the proposed …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,109
Efficient mining of closed repetitive gapped subsequences from a sequence database,Bolin Ding; David Lo; Jiawei Han; Siau-Cheng Khoo,There is a huge wealth of sequence data available; for example; customer purchasehistories; program execution traces; DNA; and protein sequences. Analyzing this wealth ofdata to mine important knowledge is certainly a worthwhile goal. In this paper; as a stepforward to analyzing patterns in sequences; we introduce the problem of mining closedrepetitive gapped subsequences and propose efficient solutions. Given a database ofsequences where each sequence is an ordered list of events; the pattern we would like tomine is called repetitive gapped subsequence; which is a subsequence (possibly with gapsbetween two successive events within it) of some sequences in the database. We introducethe concept of repetitive support to measure how frequently a pattern repeats in thedatabase. Different from the sequential pattern mining problem; repetitive support …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,109
Incremental clustering for trajectories,Zhenhui Li; Jae-Gil Lee; Xiaolei Li; Jiawei Han,Abstract Trajectory clustering has played a crucial role in data analysis since it revealsunderlying trends of moving objects. Due to their sequential nature; trajectory data are oftenreceived incrementally; eg; continuous new points reported by GPS system. However; sinceexisting trajectory clustering algorithms are developed for static datasets; they are notsuitable for incremental clustering with the following two requirements. First; clusteringshould be processed efficiently since it can be frequently requested. Second; huge amountsof trajectory data must be accommodated; as they will accumulate constantly. Anincremental clustering framework for trajectories is proposed in this paper. It contains twoparts: online micro-cluster maintenance and offline macro-cluster creation. For online part;when a new bunch of trajectories arrives; each trajectory is simplified into a set of directed …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,108

Exploring social tagging graph for web object classification,Zhijun Yin; Rui Li; Qiaozhu Mei; Jiawei Han,Abstract This paper studies web object classification problem with the novel exploration ofsocial tags. Automatically classifying web objects into manageable semantic categories haslong been a fundamental preprocess for indexing; browsing; searching; and mining theseobjects. The explosive growth of heterogeneous web objects; especially non-textual objectssuch as products; pictures; and videos; has made the problem of web classificationincreasingly challenging. Such objects often suffer from a lack of easy-extractable featureswith semantic information; interconnections between each other; as well as trainingexamples with category labels. In this paper; we explore the social tagging data to bridgethis gap. We cast web object classification problem as an optimization problem on a graph ofobjects and tags.

Generalization-based data mining in object-oriented databases using an object cube model,Jiawei Han; Shojiro Nishio; Hiroyuki Kawano; Wei Wang,Abstract Data mining is the discovery of knowledge and useful information from the largeamounts of data stored in databases. With the increasing popularity of object-orienteddatabase systems in advanced database applications; it is important to study the datamining methods for object-oriented databases because mining knowledge from suchdatabases may improve understanding; organization; and utilization of the data stored there.In this paper; issues on generalization-based data mining in object-oriented databases areinvestigated in three aspects:(1) generalization of complex objects;(2) class-basedgeneralization; and (3) extraction of different kinds of rules. An object cube model isproposed for class-based generalization; on-line analytical processing; and data mining.The study shows that (i) a set of sophisticated generalization operators can be …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,1998,107
Roam: Rule-and motif-based anomaly detection in massive moving object data sets,Xiaolei Li; Jiawei Han; Sangkyum Kim; Hector Gonzalez,Abstract With recent advances in sensory and mobile computing technology; enormousamounts of data about moving objects are being collected. One important application withsuch data is automated identification of suspicious movements. Due to the sheer volume ofdata associated with moving objects; it is challenging to develop a method that canefficiently and effectively detect anomalies. The problem is exacerbated by the fact thatanomalies may occur at arbitrary levels of abstraction and be associated with multiplegranularity of spatiotemporal features. In this study; we propose a new framework namedROAM (R ule-and M o tif-based A nomaly Detection in M oving Objects). In ROAM; objecttrajectories are expressed using discrete pattern fragments called motifs. Associatedfeatures are extracted to form a hierarchical feature space; which facilitates a multi …,*,2007,106
Laplacian regularized gaussian mixture model for data clustering,Xiaofei He; Deng Cai; Yuanlong Shao; Hujun Bao; Jiawei Han,Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are among the most statistically mature methods forclustering. Each cluster is represented by a Gaussian distribution. The clustering processthereby turns to estimate the parameters of the Gaussian mixture; usually by the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. In this paper; we consider the case where the probability distributionthat generates the data is supported on a submanifold of the ambient space. It is natural toassume that if two points are close in the intrinsic geometry of the probability distribution;then their conditional probability distributions are similar. Specifically; we introduce aregularized probabilistic model based on manifold structure for data clustering; calledLaplacian regularized Gaussian Mixture Model (LapGMM).

Text cube: Computing ir measures for multidimensional text database analysis,Cindy Xide Lin; Bolin Ding; Jiawei Han; Feida Zhu; Bo Zhao,Since Jim Gray introduced the concept of” data cube” in 1997; data cube; associated withonline analytical processing (OLAP); has become a driving engine in data warehouseindustry. Because the boom of Internet has given rise to an ever increasing amount of textdata associated with other multidimensional information; it is natural to propose a data cubemodel that integrates the power of traditional OLAP and IR techniques for text. In this paper;we propose a Text-Cube model on multidimensional text database and study effective OLAPover such data. Two kinds of hierarchies are distinguishable inside: dimensional hierarchyand term hierarchy. By incorporating these hierarchies; we conduct systematic studies onefficient text-cube implementation; OLAP execution and query processing.

Mining scale-free networks using geodesic clustering,Andrew Y Wu; Michael Garland; Jiawei Han,Abstract Many real-world graphs have been shown to be scale-free---vertex degrees followpower law distributions; vertices tend to cluster; and the average length of all shortest pathsis small. We present a new model for understanding scale-free networks based on multilevelgeodesic approximation; using a new data structure called a multilevel mesh. Using thismultilevel framework; we propose a new kind of graph clustering for data reduction of verylarge graph systems such as social; biological; or electronic networks. Finally; we apply ouralgorithms to real-world social networks and protein interaction graphs to show that they canreveal knowledge embedded in underlying graph structures. We also demonstrate how ourdata structures can be used to quickly answer approximate distance and shortest pathqueries on scale-free networks.,Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2004,105

Topic cube: Topic modeling for olap on multidimensional text databases,Duo Zhang; Chengxiang Zhai; Jiawei Han,Abstract As the amount of textual information grows explosively in various kinds of businesssystems; it becomes more and more desirable to analyze both structured data records andunstructured text data simultaneously. While online analytical processing (OLAP) techniqueshave been proven very useful for analyzing and mining structured data; they face challengesin handling text data. On the other hand; probabilistic topic models are among the mosteffective approaches to latent topic analysis and mining on text data. In this paper; wepropose a new data model called topic cube to combine OLAP with probabilistic topicmodeling and enable OLAP on the dimension of text data in a multidimensional textdatabase.

A unified framework for link recommendation using random walks,Zhijun Yin; Manish Gupta; Tim Weninger; Jiawei Han,The phenomenal success of social networking sites; such as Facebook; Twitter andLinkedIn; has revolutionized the way people communicate. This paradigm has attracted theattention of researchers that wish to study the corresponding social and technologicalproblems. Link recommendation is a critical task that not only helps increase the linkageinside the network and also improves the user experience. In an effective linkrecommendation algorithm it is essential to identify the factors that influence link creation.This paper enumerates several of these intuitive criteria and proposes an approach whichsatisfies these factors. This approach estimates link relevance by using random walkalgorithm on an augmented social graph with both attribute and structure information.

Near-optimal supervised feature selection among frequent subgraphs,Marisa Thoma; Hong Cheng; Arthur Gretton; Jiawei Han; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Alex Smola; Le Song; Philip S Yu; Xifeng Yan; Karsten Borgwardt,Abstract Graph classification is an increasingly important step in numerous applicationdomains; such as function prediction of molecules and proteins; computerised sceneanalysis; and anomaly detection in program flows. Among the various approaches proposedin the literature; graph classification based on frequent subgraphs is a popular branch:Graphs are represented as (usually binary) vectors; with components indicating whether agraph contains a particular subgraph that is frequent across the dataset. On large graphs;however; one faces the enormous problem that the number of these frequent subgraphsmay grow exponentially with the size of the graphs; but only few of them possess enoughdiscriminative power to make them useful for graph classification. Efficient and discriminativefeature selection among frequent subgraphs is hence a key challenge for graph mining …,*,2009,103
Mining recurrent items in multimedia with progressive resolution refinement,Osmar R Zaiane; Jiawei Han; Hua Zhu,Despite the overwhelming amounts of multimedia data recently generated and thesignificance of such data; very few people have systematically investigated multimedia datamining. With our previous studies on content-based retrieval of visual artifacts; we study inthis paper the methods for mining content-based associations with recurrent items and withspatial relationships from large visual data repositories. A progressive resolution refinementapproach is proposed in which frequent item-sets at rough resolution levels are mined; andprogressively; finer resolutions are mined only on the candidate frequent items-sets derivedfrom mining rough resolution levels. Such a multi-resolution mining strategy substantiallyreduces the overall data mining cost without loss of the quality and completeness of theresults.,Data Engineering; 2000.

In this study; we investigate a novel mining approach called pattern-fusion to efficiently find a good approximation to the colossal patterns. With Pattern-Fusion; acolossal pattern is discovered by fusing its small core patterns in one step; whereas theincremental pattern-growth mining strategies; such as those adopted in Apriori and FP-growth; have to examine a large number of mid-sized ones.

It is a nontrivial task to distinguish those objects; especiallywhen there is only very limited information associated with each of them. In this paper; wedevelop a general object distinction methodology called DISTINCT; which combines twocomplementary measures for relational similarity: set resemblance of neighbor tuples andrandom walk probability; and uses SVM to weigh different types of linkages without manuallylabeled training data. Experiments show that DISTINCT can accurately distinguish differentobjects with identical names in real databases.,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007. IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,102
On discovery of traveling companions from streaming trajectories,Lu-An Tang; Yu Zheng; Jing Yuan; Jiawei Han; Alice Leung; Chih-Chieh Hung; Wen-Chih Peng,The advance of object tracking technologies leads to huge volumes of spatio-temporal datacollected in the form of trajectory data stream. In this study; we investigate the problem ofdiscovering object groups that travel together (ie; traveling companions) from trajectorystream. Such technique has broad applications in the areas of scientific study; transportationmanagement and military surveillance. To discover traveling companions; the monitoringsystem should cluster the objects of each snapshot and intersect the clustering results toretrieve moving-together objects. Since both clustering and intersection steps involve highcomputational overhead; the key issue of companion discovery is to improve the algorithm'sefficiency.

Differentially private data cubes: optimizing noise sources and consistency,Bolin Ding; Marianne Winslett; Jiawei Han; Zhenhui Li,Abstract Data cubes play an essential role in data analysis and decision support. In a datacube; data from a fact table is aggregated on subsets of the table's dimensions; forming acollection of smaller tables called cuboids. When the fact table includes sensitive data suchas salary or diagnosis; publishing even a subset of its cuboids may compromise individuals'privacy. In this paper; we address this problem using differential privacy (DP); whichprovides provable privacy guarantees for individuals by adding noise to query answers. Wechoose an initial subset of cuboids to compute directly from the fact table; injecting DP noiseas usual; and then compute the remaining cuboids from the initial set. Given a fixed privacyguarantee; we show that it is NP-hard to choose the initial set of cuboids so that the maximalnoise over all published cuboids is minimized; or so that the number of cuboids with noise …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,101

Addressing concept-evolution in concept-drifting data streams,Mohammad M Masud; Qing Chen; Latifur Khan; Charu Aggarwal; Jing Gao; Jiawei Han; Bhavani Thuraisingham,The problem of data stream classification is challenging because of many practical aspectsassociated with efficient processing and temporal behavior of the stream. Two such wellstudied aspects are infinite length and concept-drift. Since a data stream may be considereda continuous process; which is theoretically infinite in length; it is impractical to store and useall the historical data for training. Data streams also frequently experience concept-drift as aresult of changes in the underlying concepts. However; another important characteristic ofdata streams; namely; concept-evolution is rarely addressed in the literature. Concept-evolution occurs as a result of new classes evolving in the stream.

Graph-based consensus maximization among multiple supervised and unsupervised models,Jing Gao; Feng Liang; Wei Fan; Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han,Abstract Little work has been done to directly combine the outputs of multiple supervisedand unsupervised models. However; it can increase the accuracy and applicability ofensemble methods. First; we can boost the diversity of classification ensemble byincorporating multiple clustering outputs; each of which provides grouping constraints for thejoint label predictions of a set of related objects. Secondly; ensemble of supervised modelsis limited in applications which have no access to raw data but to the meta-level modeloutputs. In this paper; we aim at calculating a consolidated classification solution for a set ofobjects by maximizing the consensus among both supervised predictions and unsupervisedgrouping constraints. We seek a global optimal label assignment for the target objects;which is different from the result of traditional majority voting and model combination …,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,2009,100
Locality Preserving Nonnegative Matrix Factorization.,Deng Cai; Xiaofei He; Xuanhui Wang; Hujun Bao; Jiawei Han,Abstract Matrix factorization techniques have been frequently applied in informationprocessing tasks. Among them; Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) have receivedconsiderable attentions due to its psychological and physiological interpretation of naturallyoccurring data whose representation may be parts-based in human brain. On the otherhand; from geometric perspective the data is usually sampled from a low dimensionalmanifold embedded in high dimensional ambient space. One hopes then to find a compactrepresentation which uncovers the hidden topics and simultaneously respects the intrinsicgeometric structure. In this paper; we propose a novel algorithm; called Locality PreservingNon-negative Matrix Factorization (LPNMF); for this purpose. For two data points; we use KL-divergence to evaluate their similarity on the hidden topics. The optimal maps are …,IJCAI,2009,99
Parallel mining of closed sequential patterns,Shengnan Cong; Jiawei Han; David Padua,Abstract Discovery of sequential patterns is an essential data mining task with broadapplications. Among several variations of sequential patterns; closed sequential pattern isthe most useful one since it retains all the information of the complete pattern set but is oftenmuch more compact than it. Unfortunately; there is no parallel closed sequential patternmining method proposed yet. In this paper we develop an algorithm; called Par-CSP(Parallel Closed Sequential Pattern mining); to conduct parallel mining of closed sequentialpatterns on a distributed memory system. Par-CSP partitions the work among the processorsby exploiting the divide-and-conquer property so that the overhead of interprocessorcommunication is minimized. Par-CSP applies dynamic scheduling to avoid processoridling. Moreover; it employs a technique; called selective sampling to address the load …,Proceedings of the eleventh ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery in data mining,2005,99
Evaluating event credibility on twitter,Manish Gupta; Peixiang Zhao; Jiawei Han,Abstract Though Twitter acts realtime news source with people acting as sensors andsending event updates from all over the world; rumors spread via Twitter have been noted tocause considerable damage. Given a set of popular Twitter events along with related usersand tweets; we study the problem of automatically assessing the credibility of such events.We propose a credibility analysis approach enhanced with event graph-based optimizationto solve the problem. First we experiment by performing PageRank-like credibilitypropagation on a multi-typed network consisting of events; tweets; and users. Further; withineach iteration; we enhance the basic trust analysis by updating event credibility scores usingregularization on a new graph of events. Our experiments using events extracted from twotweet feed datasets; each with millions of tweets show that our event graph optimization …,*,2012,98
Re-examination of interestingness measures in pattern mining: a unified framework,Tianyi Wu; Yuguo Chen; Jiawei Han,Abstract Numerous interestingness measures have been proposed in statistics and datamining to assess object relationships. This is especially important in recent studies ofassociation or correlation pattern mining. However; it is still not clear whether there is anyintrinsic relationship among many proposed measures; and which one is truly effective atgauging object relationships in large data sets. Recent studies have identified a criticalproperty; null-(transaction) invariance; for measuring associations among events in largedata sets; but many measures do not have this property. In this study; we re-examine a set ofnull-invariant interestingness measures and find that they can be expressed as thegeneralized mathematical mean; leading to a total ordering of them. Such a unifiedframework provides insights into the underlying philosophy of the measures and helps us …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2010,98
Aworldwide tourism recommendation system based on geotaggedweb photos,Liangliang Cao; Jiebo Luo; Andrew Gallagher; Xin Jin; Jiawei Han; Thomas S Huang,This work aims to build a system to suggest tourist destinations based on visual matchingand minimal user input. A user can provide either a photo of the desired scenary or akeyword describing the place of interest; and the system will look into its database for placesthat share the visual characteristics. To that end; we first cluster a large-scale geotaggedweb photo collection into groups by location and then find the representative images foreach group. Tourist destination recommendations are produced by comparing the queryagainst the representative tags or representative images under the premise of” if you likethat place; you may also like these places “.,Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP); 2010 IEEE International Conference on,2010,98
Towards graph containment search and indexing,Chen Chen; Xifeng Yan; Philip S Yu; Jiawei Han; Dong-Qing Zhang; Xiaohui Gu,Abstract Given a set of model graphs D and a query graph q; containment search aims tofind all model graphs g ε D such that q contains g (q⊇ g). Due to the wide adoption of graphmodels; fast containment search of graph data finds many applications in various domains.In comparison to traditional graph search that retrieves all the graphs containing q (q⊆ g);containment search has its own indexing characteristics that have not yet been examined. Inthis paper; we perform a systematic study on these characteristics and propose a contrastsubgraph-based indexing model; called cIndex. Contrast subgraphs capture the structuredifferences between model graphs and query graphs; and are thus perfect for indexing dueto their high selectivity. Using a redundancy-aware feature selection process; cIndex cansort out a set of significant and distinctive contrast subgraphs and maximize its indexing …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,97
Outlier detection for temporal data,Manish Gupta; Jing Gao; Charu Aggarwal; Jiawei Han,Abstract Download Free Sample Outlier (or anomaly) detection is a very broad field whichhas been studied in the context of a large number of research areas like statistics; datamining; sensor networks; environmental science; distributed systems; spatio-temporalmining; etc. Initial research in outlier detection focused on time series-based outliers (instatistics). Since then; outlier detection has been studied on a large variety of data typesincluding high-dimensional data; uncertain data; stream data; network data; time series data;spatial data; and spatio-temporal data. While there have been many tutorials and surveys forgeneral outlier detection; we focus on outlier detection for temporal data in this book. A largenumber of applications generate temporal datasets. For example; in our everyday life;various kinds of records like credit; personnel; financial; judicial; medical; etc.; are all …,Synthesis Lectures on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2014,96
Relation strength-aware clustering of heterogeneous information networks with incomplete attributes,Yizhou Sun; Charu C Aggarwal; Jiawei Han,Abstract With the rapid development of online social media; online shopping sites and cyber-physical systems; heterogeneous information networks have become increasingly popularand content-rich over time. In many cases; such networks contain multiple types of objectsand links; as well as different kinds of attributes. The clustering of these objects can provideuseful insights in many applications. However; the clustering of such networks can bechallenging since (a) the attribute values of objects are often incomplete; which implies thatan object may carry only partial attributes or even no attributes to correctly label itself; and(b) the links of different types may carry different kinds of semantic meanings; and it is adifficult task to determine the nature of their relative importance in helping the clustering for agiven purpose. In this paper; we address these challenges by proposing a model-based …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,96
Mining compressed commodity workflows from massive RFID data sets,Hector Gonzalez; Jiawei Han; Xiaolei Li,Abstract Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology is fast becoming a prevalent toolin tracking commodities in supply chain management applications. The movement ofcommodities through the supply chain forms a gigantic workflow that can be mined for thediscovery of trends; flow correlations and outlier paths; that in turn can be valuable inunderstanding and optimizing business processes. In this paper; we propose a method toconstruct compressed probabilistic workflows that capture the movement trends andsignificant exceptions of the overall data sets; but with a size that is substantially smallerthan that of the complete RFID workflow. Compression is achieved based on the followingobservations:(1) only a relatively small minority of items deviate from the general trend;(2)only truly non-redundant deviations; ie; those that substantially deviate from the …,Proceedings of the 15th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2006,96
Fault-Tolerant Frequent Pattern Mining: Problems and Challenges.,Jian Pei; Anthony KH Tung; Jiawei Han,Abstract Real-world data tends to be dirty. Discovering knowledge over large real-world datacalls for fault-tolerant data mining; which is a fruitful direction for future data mining research.Fault-tolerant extensions of data mining techniques would gain useful insights into the data.In this paper; we introduce the problem of faulttolerant frequent pattern mining. With fault-tolerant frequent pattern mining; many kinds of novel; interesting and practically usefulknowledge can be discovered. For example; one can discover the following fault-tolerantassociation rules: 85% of students doing well in three out of the four courses:" datastructure";" algorithm";" artificial intelligence"; and" database"; will receive high grades in"data mining". We extend Apriori and develop FT-Apriori for efficient fault-tolerant frequentpattern mining. Our experimental results show that FT-Apriori is a solid step towards fault …,DMKD,2001,96
Ranking objects based on relationships,Kaushik Chakrabarti; Venkatesh Ganti; Jiawei Han; Dong Xin,Abstract In many document collections; documents are related to objects such as documentauthors; products described in the document; or persons referred to in the document. Inmany applications; the goal is to find these objects that best match a set of keywords.However; the keywords may not necessarily occur in the target objects; they occur only inthe documents. For example; in a product review database; a user might search for names ofproducts (say; laptops) using keywords like" lightweight" and" business use" that occur onlyin the reviews but not in the names of laptops. In order to answer these queries; we need toexploit relationships between documents containing the keywords and the target objectsrelated to those documents. Current keyword query paradigms do not exploit theserelationships effectively and hence are inefficient for these queries.

Efficient classification across multiple database relations: A crossmine approach,Xiaoxin Yin; Jiawei Han; Jiong Yang; Philip S Yu,Relational databases are the most popular repository for structured data; and is thus one ofthe richest sources of knowledge in the world. In a relational database; multiple relations arelinked together via entity-relationship links. Multirelational classification is the procedure ofbuilding a classifier based on information stored in multiple relations and making predictionswith it. Existing approaches of inductive logic programming (recently; also known asrelational mining) have proven effective with high accuracy in multirelational classification.Unfortunately; most of them suffer from scalability problems with regard to the number ofrelations in databases. In this paper; we propose a new approach; called CrossMine; whichincludes a set of novel and powerful methods for multirelational classification; including 1)tuple ID propagation; an efficient and flexible method for virtually joining relations; which …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2006,92
Pushing support constraints into association rules mining,Ke Wang; Yu He; Jiawei Han,Interesting patterns often occur at varied levels of support. The classic association miningbased on a uniform minimum support; such as Apriori; either misses interesting patterns oflow support or suffers from the bottleneck of itemset generation caused by a low minimumsupport. A better solution lies in exploiting support constraints; which specify what minimumsupport is required for what itemsets; so that only the necessary itemsets are generated. Wepresent a framework of frequent itemset mining in the presence of support constraints. Ourapproach is to" push" support constraints into the Apriori itemset generation so that the" best"minimum support is determined for each itemset at runtime to preserve the essence ofApriori. This strategy is called Adaptive Apriori. Experiments show that Adapative Apriori ishighly effective in dealing with the bottleneck of itemset generation.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2003,92
An attribute-oriented approach for learning classification rules from relational databases,Yandong Cai; Nick Cercone; Jiawei Han,A classification rule is a rule which characterizes the properties that distinguish one classfrom other classes. An attribute-oriented induction algorithm which extracts classificationrules from relational databases is developed. The algorithm adopts the artificial intelligencelearning from examples paradigm and applies an attribute-oriented concept tree ascendingtechnique in the learning process. The technique integrates database operations with thelearning process and provides a simple and efficient way of learning from large databases.The algorithm learns both conjunctive rules and restricted forms of disjunctive rules. Usingdatabase statistics; learning can be performed on databases containing noisy data andexceptions. An analysis and comparison with other algorithms show that attribute-orientedinduction substantially reduces the complexity of database learning processes.,Data Engineering; 1990. Proceedings.

Regularized locality preserving indexing via spectral regression,Deng Cai; Xiaofei He; Wei Vivian Zhang; Jiawei Han,Abstract We consider the problem of document indexing and representation. Recently;Locality Preserving Indexing (LPI) was proposed for learning a compact documentsubspace. Different from Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) which is optimal in the sense ofglobal Euclidean structure; LPI is optimal in the sense of local manifold structure. However;LPI is not efficient in time and memory which makes it difficult to be applied to very large dataset. Specifically; the computation of LPI involves eigen-decompositions of two densematrices which is expensive. In this paper; we propose a new algorithm called RegularizedLocality Preserving Indexing (RLPI). Benefit from recent progresses on spectral graphanalysis; we cast the original LPI algorithm into a regression framework which enable us toavoid eigen-decomposition of dense matrices. Also; with the regression based framework …,Proceedings of the sixteenth ACM conference on Conference on information and knowledge management,2007,90
gPrune: a constraint pushing framework for graph pattern mining,Feida Zhu; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; S Yu Philip,Abstract In graph mining applications; there has been an increasingly strong urge forimposing user-specified constraints on the mining results. However; unlike most traditionalitemset constraints; structural constraints; such as density and diameter of a graph; are veryhard to be pushed deep into the mining process. In this paper; we give the firstcomprehensive study on the pruning properties of both traditional and structural constraintsaiming to reduce not only the pattern search space but the data search space as well. A newgeneral framework; called gPrune; is proposed to incorporate all the constraints in such away that they recursively reinforce each other through the entire mining process. A newconcept; Pattern-inseparable Data-antimonotonicity; is proposed to handle the structuralconstraints unique in the context of graph; which; combined with known pruning …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2007,89
A survey on truth discovery,Yaliang Li; Jing Gao; Chuishi Meng; Qi Li; Lu Su; Bo Zhao; Wei Fan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Thanks to information explosion; data for the objects of interest can be collectedfrom increasingly more sources. However; for the same object; there usually exist conflictsamong the collected multi-source information. To tackle this challenge; truth discovery;which integrates multi-source noisy information by estimating the reliability of each source;has emerged as a hot topic. Several truth discovery methods have been proposed forvarious scenarios; and they have been successfully applied in diverse application domains.In this survey; we focus on providing a comprehensive overview of truth discovery methods;and summarizing them from different aspects. We also discuss some future directions of truthdiscovery research. We hope that this survey will promote a better understanding of thecurrent progress on truth discovery; and offer some guidelines on how to apply these …,ACM Sigkdd Explorations Newsletter,2016,88
Integrating novel class detection with classification for concept-drifting data streams,Mohammad M Masud; Jing Gao; Latifur Khan; Jiawei Han; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract In a typical data stream classification task; it is assumed that the total number ofclasses are fixed. This assumption may not be valid in a real streaming environment; wherenew classes may evolve. Traditional data stream classification techniques are not capable ofrecognizing novel class instances until the appearance of the novel class is manuallyidentified; and labeled instances of that class are presented to the learning algorithm fortraining. The problem becomes more challenging in the presence of concept-drift; when theunderlying data distribution changes over time. We propose a novel and efficient techniquethat can automatically detect the emergence of a novel class in the presence of concept-driftby quantifying cohesion among unlabeled test instances; and separation of the testinstances from training instances. Our approach is non-parametric; meaning; it does not …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2009,88
Scalable topical phrase mining from text corpora,Ahmed El-Kishky; Yanglei Song; Chi Wang; Clare R Voss; Jiawei Han,Abstract While most topic modeling algorithms model text corpora with unigrams; humaninterpretation often relies on inherent grouping of terms into phrases. As such; we considerthe problem of discovering topical phrases of mixed lengths. Existing work either performspost processing to the results of unigram-based topic models; or utilizes complex n-gram-discovery topic models. These methods generally produce low-quality topical phrases orsuffer from poor scalability on even moderately-sized datasets. We propose a differentapproach that is both computationally efficient and effective. Our solution combines a novelphrase mining framework to segment a document into single and multi-word phrases; and anew topic model that operates on the induced document partition. Our approach discovershigh quality topical phrases with negligible extra cost to the bag-of-words topic model in a …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,87
Diversified trajectory pattern ranking in geo-tagged social media,Zhijun Yin; Liangliang Cao; Jiawei Han; Jiebo Luo; Thomas Huang,Abstract Social media such as those residing in the popular photo sharing websites isattracting increasing attention in recent years. As a type of user-generated data; wisdom ofthe crowd is embedded inside such social media. In particular; millions of users upload toFlickr their photos; many associated with temporal and geographical information. In thispaper; we investigate how to rank the trajectory patterns mined from the uploaded photoswith geotags and timestamps. The main objective is to reveal the collective wisdom recordedin the seemingly isolated photos and the individual travel sequences reflected by the geo-tagged photos. Instead of focusing on mining frequent trajectory patterns from geo-taggedsocial media; we put more effort into ranking the mined trajectory patterns and diversifyingthe ranking results.

Linkrec: a unified framework for link recommendation with user attributes and graph structure,Zhijun Yin; Manish Gupta; Tim Weninger; Jiawei Han,Abstract With the phenomenal success of networking sites (eg; Facebook; Twitter andLinkedIn); social networks have drawn substantial attention. On online social networkingsites; link recommendation is a critical task that not only helps improve user experience butalso plays an essential role in network growth. In this paper we propose several linkrecommendation criteria; based on both user attributes and graph structure. To discover thecandidates that satisfy these criteria; link relevance is estimated using a random walkalgorithm on an augmented social graph with both attribute and structure information. Theglobal and local influence of the attributes is leveraged in the framework as well.

Towards robust indexing for ranked queries,Dong Xin; Chen Chen; Jiawei Han,Abstract Top-k query asks for k tuples ordered according to a specific ranking function thatcombines the values from multiple participating attributes. The combined score function isusually linear. To efficiently answer top-k queries; preprocessing and indexing the data havebeen used to speed up the run time performance. Many indexing methods allow the onlinequery algorithms progressively retrieve the data and stop at a certain point. However; inmany cases; the number of data accesses is sensitive to the query parameters (ie; linearweights in the score functions). In this paper; we study the sequentially layered indexingproblem where tuples are put into multiple consecutive layers and any top-k query can beanswered by at most k layers of tuples. We propose a new criterion for building the layeredindex. A layered index is robust if for any k; the number of tuples in the top k layers is …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,87
A confidence-aware approach for truth discovery on long-tail data,Qi Li; Yaliang Li; Jing Gao; Lu Su; Bo Zhao; Murat Demirbas; Wei Fan; Jiawei Han,Abstract In many real world applications; the same item may be described by multiplesources. As a consequence; conflicts among these sources are inevitable; which leads to animportant task: how to identify which piece of information is trustworthy; ie; the truth discoverytask. Intuitively; if the piece of information is from a reliable source; then it is moretrustworthy; and the source that provides trustworthy information is more reliable. Based onthis principle; truth discovery approaches have been proposed to infer source reliabilitydegrees and the most trustworthy information (ie; the truth) simultaneously. However;existing approaches overlook the ubiquitous long-tail phenomenon in the tasks; ie; mostsources only provide a few claims and only a few sources make plenty of claims; whichcauses the source reliability estimation for small sources to be unreasonable.

Due to inherent noise or data diversity; it iscrucial to address the issue of approximation; if one wants to mine patterns that arepotentially interesting with tolerable variations.

Mining thick skylines over large databases,Wen Jin; Jiawei Han; Martin Ester,Abstract People recently are interested in a new operator; called skyline [3]; which returnsthe objects that are not dominated by any other objects with regard to certain measures in amulti-dimensional space. Recent work on the skyline operator [3; 15; 8; 13; 2] focuses onefficient computation of skylines in large databases. However; such work gives users onlythin skylines; ie; single objects; which may not be desirable in some real applications. In thispaper; we propose a novel concept; called thick skyline; which recommends not only skylineobjects but also their nearby neighbors within ε-distance.

Integrating community matching and outlier detection for mining evolutionary community outliers,Manish Gupta; Jing Gao; Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han,Abstract Temporal datasets; in which data evolves continuously; exist in a wide variety ofapplications; and identifying anomalous or outlying objects from temporal datasets is animportant and challenging task. Different from traditional outlier detection; which detectsobjects that have quite different behavior compared with the other objects; temporal outlierdetection tries to identify objects that have different evolutionary behavior compared withother objects. Usually objects form multiple communities; and most of the objects belongingto the same community follow similar patterns of evolution. However; there are some objectswhich evolve in a very different way relative to other community members; and we definesuch objects as evolutionary community outliers. This definition represents a novel type ofoutliers considering both temporal dimension and community patterns.

Object matching for information integration: A profiler-based approach,AnHai Doan Ying Lu Yoonkyong Lee; Jiawei Han,Abstract Object matching is a fundamental problem that arises in numerous informationintegration scenarios. Virtually all existing solutions to this problem have assumed that theobjects to be matched share the same set of attributes; and that they can be matched bycomparing the similarities of the attributes. We consider the more general problem where theobjects can also have disjoint attributes; such as matching tuples that come from relationaltables with schemas (age; name) and (name; salary); respectively. We describe PROM; asolution that also exploits the disjoint attributes to improve matching accuracy. In the aboveexample; PROM begins by matching any two given tuples based on the shared attributename. Then it applies a set of profilers; each of which contains some knowledge about whatconstitutes a typical person. The profilers examine the tuple pair to see if it can plausibly …,*,2003,84
On computing condensed frequent pattern bases,Jian Pei; Guozhu Dong; Wei Zou; Jiawei Han,Frequent pattern mining has been studied extensively. However; the effectiveness andefficiency of this mining is often limited; since the number of frequent patterns generated isoften too large. In many applications it is sufficient to generate and examine only frequentpatterns with support frequency in close-enough approximation instead of in full precision.Such a compact but close-enough frequent pattern base is called a condensed frequentpatterns-base. In this paper we propose and examine several alternatives at the design;representation; and implementation of such condensed frequent pattern-bases. A fewalgorithms for computing such pattern-bases are proposed. Their effectiveness at patterncompression and their efficient computation methods are investigated.

Classification and adaptive novel class detection of feature-evolving data streams,Mohammad M Masud; Qing Chen; Latifur Khan; Charu C Aggarwal; Jing Gao; Jiawei Han; Ashok Srivastava; Nikunj C Oza,Data stream classification poses many challenges to the data mining community. In thispaper; we address four such major challenges; namely; infinite length; concept-drift; concept-evolution; and feature-evolution. Since a data stream is theoretically infinite in length; it isimpractical to store and use all the historical data for training. Concept-drift is a commonphenomenon in data streams; which occurs as a result of changes in the underlyingconcepts. Concept-evolution occurs as a result of new classes evolving in the stream.Feature-evolution is a frequently occurring process in many streams; such as text streams; inwhich new features (ie; words or phrases) appear as the stream progresses. Most existingdata stream classification techniques address only the first two challenges; and ignore thelatter two. In this paper; we propose an ensemble classification framework; where each …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2013,82
Mining discriminative patterns for classifying trajectories on road networks,Jae-Gil Lee; Jiawei Han; Xiaolei Li; Hong Cheng,Classification has been used for modeling many kinds of data sets; including sets of items;text documents; graphs; and networks. However; there is a lack of study on a new kind ofdata; trajectories on road networks. Modeling such data is useful with the emerging GPS andRFID technologies and is important for effective transportation and traffic planning. In thiswork; we study methods for classifying trajectories on road networks. By analyzing thebehavior of trajectories on road networks; we observe that; in addition to the locations wherevehicles have visited; the order of these visited locations is crucial for improvingclassification accuracy. Based on our analysis; we contend that (frequent) sequentialpatterns are good feature candidates since they preserve this order information.Furthermore; when mining sequential patterns; we propose to confine the length of …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,82
Community evolution detection in dynamic heterogeneous information networks,Yizhou Sun; Jie Tang; Jiawei Han; Manish Gupta; Bo Zhao,Abstract As the rapid development of all kinds of online databases; huge heterogeneousinformation networks thus derived are ubiquitous. Detecting evolutionary communities inthese networks can help people better understand the structural evolution of the networks.However; most of the current community evolution analysis is based on the homogeneousnetworks; while a real community usually involves different types of objects in aheterogeneous network. For example; when referring to a research community; it contains aset of authors; a set of conferences or journals and a set of terms. In this paper; we study theproblem of detecting evolutionary multi-typed communities defined as net-clusters indynamic heterogeneous networks.

Progressive and selective merge: computing top-k with ad-hoc ranking functions,Dong Xin; Jiawei Han; Kevin C Chang,Abstract The family of threshold algorithm (ie; TA) has been widely studied for efficientlycomputing top-k queries. TA uses a sort-merge framework that assumes data lists are pre-sorted; and the ranking functions are monotone. However; in many database applications;attribute values are indexed by tree-structured indices (eg; B-tree; R-tree); and the rankingfunctions are not necessarily monotone. To answer top-k queries with ad-hoc rankingfunctions; this paper studies anindex-merge paradigm that performs progressive search overthe space of joint states composed by multiple index nodes. We address two challenges forefficient query processing. First; to minimize the search complexity; we present a double-heap algorithm which supports not only progressive state search but also progressive stategeneration.

Join index hierarchies for supporting efficient navigations in object-oriented databases,Zhaohui Xie; Jiawei Han,Abstract A join index hierarchy method is proposed to handle the" goto's on disk" problem inobjectoriented query processing. The method constructs a hierarchy ofjoin indices andtransforms a sequence of pointer chasing operations into a simple search in an appropriatejoin index file; and thus accelerates navigation in object-oriented databases. The methodextends the join index structure studied in relational and spatial databases; supports bothforward and backward navigations among objects and classes; and localizes updatepropagations in the hierarchy. Our performance study shows that partial join index hierarchyoutperforms several other indexing mechanisms in object-oriented query processing.,VLDB,1994,79
Mining multi-dimensional constrained gradients in data cubes,Guozhu Dong; Jiawei Han; Joyce Lam; Jian Pei; Ke Wang,Abstract Constrained gradient analysis (similar to the “cubegrade” problem posed byImielinski; et al.[9]) is to extract pairs of similar cell characteristics associated with bigchanges in measure in a data cube. Cells are considered similar if they are related by roll-up; drill-down; or 1-dimensional mutation operation. Constrained gradient queries areexpressive; capable of capturing trends in data and answering “what-if” questions.

Tru-alarm: Trustworthiness analysis of sensor networks in cyber-physical systems,Lu-An Tang; Xiao Yu; Sangkyum Kim; Jiawei Han; Chih-Chieh Hung; Wen-Chih Peng,A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) integrates physical devices (eg; sensors; cameras) withcyber (or informational) components to form a situation-integrated analytical system thatresponds intelligently to dynamic changes of the real-world scenarios. One key issue in CPSresearch is trustworthiness analysis of the observed data: Due to technology limitations andenvironmental influences; the CPS data are inherently noisy that may trigger many falsealarms. It is highly desirable to sift meaningful information from a large volume of noisy data.In this paper; we propose a method called Tru-Alarm which finds out trustworthy alarms andincreases the feasibility of CPS. Tru-Alarm estimates the locations of objects causing alarms;constructs an object-alarm graph and carries out trustworthiness inferences based on linkedinformation in the graph. Extensive experiments show that Tru-Alarm filters out noises and …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2010 IEEE 10th International Conference on,2010,77
Predicting links in multi-relational and heterogeneous networks,Yang Yang; Nitesh Chawla; Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Hani,Link prediction is an important task in network analysis; benefiting researchers andorganizations in a variety of fields. Many networks in the real world; for example socialnetworks; are heterogeneous; having multiple types of links and complex dependencystructures. Link prediction in such networks must model the influence propagating betweenheterogeneous relationships to achieve better link prediction performance than inhomogeneous networks. In this paper; we introduce Multi-Relational Influence Propagation(MRIP); a novel probabilistic method for heterogeneous networks. We demonstrate thatMRIP is useful for predicting links in sparse networks; which present a significant challengedue to the severe disproportion of the number of potential links to the number of real formedlinks. We also explore some factors that can inform the task of classification yet remain …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on,2012,76
Facing the reality of data stream classification: coping with scarcity of labeled data,Mohammad M Masud; Clay Woolam; Jing Gao; Latifur Khan; Jiawei Han; Kevin W Hamlen; Nikunj C Oza,Abstract Recent approaches for classifying data streams are mostly based on supervisedlearning algorithms; which can only be trained with labeled data. Manual labeling of data isboth costly and time consuming. Therefore; in a real streaming environment where largevolumes of data appear at a high speed; only a small fraction of the data can be labeled.Thus; only a limited number of instances will be available for training and updating theclassification models; leading to poorly trained classifiers. We apply a novel technique toovercome this problem by utilizing both unlabeled and labeled instances to train and updatethe classification model. Each classification model is built as a collection of micro-clustersusing semi-supervised clustering; and an ensemble of these models is used to classifyunlabeled data. Empirical evaluation of both synthetic and real data reveals that our …,Knowledge and information systems,2012,76
Mining heterogeneous information networks by exploring the power of links,Jiawei Han,Abstract Knowledge is power but for interrelated data; knowledge is often hidden in massivelinks in heterogeneous information networks. We explore the power of links at miningheterogeneous information networks with several interesting tasks; including link-basedobject distinction; veracity analysis; multidimensional online analytical processing ofheterogeneous information networks; and rank-based clustering. Some recent results of ourresearch that explore the crucial information hidden in links will be introduced; including (1)Distinct for object distinction analysis;(2) TruthFinder for veracity analysis;(3) Infonet-OLAPfor online analytical processing of information networks; and (4) RankClus for integratedranking-based clustering. We also discuss some of our on-going studies in this direction.,International Conference on Discovery Science,2009,76
Cost-conscious cleaning of massive RFID data sets,Hector Gonzalez; Jiawei Han; Xuehua Shen,Efficient and accurate data cleaning is an essential task for the successful deployment ofRFID systems. Although important advances have been made in tag detection rates; it is stillcommon to see a large number of lost readings due to radio frequency (RF) interference andtag-reader configurations. Existing cleaning techniques have focused on the development ofaccurate methods that work well under a wide set of conditions; but have disregarded thevery high cost of cleaning in a real application that may have thousands of readers andmillions of tags. In this paper; we propose a cleaning framework that takes an RFID data setand a collection of cleaning methods; with associated costs; and induces a cleaning planthat optimizes the overall accuracy-adjusted cleaning costs by determining the conditionsunder which inexpensive methods are appropriate; and those under which more …,Data Engineering; 2007.

Citation prediction in heterogeneous bibliographic networks,Xiao Yu; Quanquan Gu; Mianwei Zhou; Jiawei Han,Abstract To reveal information hiding in link space of bibliographical networks; link analysishas been studied from different perspectives in recent years. In this paper; we address anovel problem namely citation prediction; that is: given information about authors; topics;target publication venues as well as time of certain research paper; finding and predictingthe citation relationship between a query paper and a set of previous papers. Consideringthe gigantic size of relevant papers; the loosely connected citation network structure as wellas the highly skewed citation relation distribution; citation prediction is more challengingthan other link prediction problems which have been studied before. By building a meta-pathbased prediction model on a topic discriminative search space; we here propose a two-phase citation probability learning approach; in order to predict citation relationship …,*,2012,75
Mining preferences from superior and inferior examples,Bin Jiang; Jian Pei; Xuemin Lin; David W Cheung; Jiawei Han,Abstract Mining user preferences plays a critical role in many important applications such ascustomer relationship management (CRM); product and service recommendation; andmarketing campaigns. In this paper; we identify an interesting and practical problem ofmining user preferences: in a multidimensional space where the user preferences on somecategorical attributes are unknown; from some superior and inferior examples provided by auser; can we learn about the user's preferences on those categorical attributes? We modelthe problem systematically and show that mining user preferences from superior and inferiorexamples is challenging. Although the problem has great potential in practice; to the best ofour knowledge; it has not been explored systematically before. As the first attempt to tacklethe problem; we propose a greedy method and show that our method is practical using …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2008,75
Clustered support vector machines,Quanquan Gu; Jiawei Han,Abstract In many problems of machine learning; the data are distributed nonlinearly. Oneway to address this kind of data is training a nonlinear classifier such as kernel supportvector machine (kernel SVM). However; the computational burden of kernel SVM limits itsapplication to large scale datasets. In this paper; we propose a Clustered Support VectorMachine (CSVM); which tackles the data in a divide and conquer manner. More specifically;CSVM groups the data into several clusters; followed which it trains a linear support vectormachine in each cluster to separate the data locally. Meanwhile; CSVM has an additionalglobal regularization; which requires the weight vector of each local linear SVM aligning witha global weight vector. The global regularization leverages the information from one clusterto another; and avoids over-fitting in each cluster. We derive a data-dependent …,Artificial Intelligence and Statistics,2013,74
Link mining: Models; algorithms; and applications,S Yu Philip; Jiawei Han; Christos Faloutsos,With the recent flourishing research activities on Web search and mining; social networkanalysis; information network analysis; information retrieval; link analysis; and structural datamining; research on link mining has been rapidly growing; forming a new field of datamining. Traditional data mining focuses on “flat” or “isolated” data in which each data objectis represented as an independent attribute vector. However; many real-world data sets areinter-connected; much richer in structure; involving objects of heterogeneous types andcomplex links. Hence; the study of link mining will have a high impact on various importantapplications such as Web and text mining; social network analysis; collaborative filtering;and bioinformatics. As an emerging research field; there are currently no books focusing onthe theory and techniques as well as the related applications for link mining; especially …,*,2010,73
Methods for mining frequent items in data streams: an overview,Hongyan Liu; Yuan Lin; Jiawei Han,Abstract In many real-world applications; information such as web click data; stock tickerdata; sensor network data; phone call records; and traffic monitoring data appear in the formof data streams. Online monitoring of data streams has emerged as an important researchundertaking. Estimating the frequency of the items on these streams is an importantaggregation and summary technique for both stream mining and data management systemswith a broad range of applications. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art progress onmethods of identifying frequent items from data streams. It describes different kinds ofmodels for frequent items mining task. For general models such as cash register andTurnstile; we classify existing algorithms into sampling-based; counting-based; and hashing-based categories.

Privacy-aware regression modeling of participatory sensing data,Hossein Ahmadi; Nam Pham; Raghu Ganti; Tarek Abdelzaher; Suman Nath; Jiawei Han,Abstract Many participatory sensing applications use data collected by participants toconstruct a public model of a system or phenomenon. For example; a health applicationmight compute a model relating exercise and diet to amount of weight loss. While theultimately computed model could be public; the individual input and output data traces usedto construct it may be private data of participants (eg; their individual food intake; lifestylechoices; and resulting weight). This paper proposes and experimentally studies a techniquethat attempts to keep such input and output data traces private; while allowing accuratemodel construction. This is significantly different from perturbation-based techniques in thatno noise is added. The main contribution of the paper is to show a certain datatransformation at the client side that helps keeping the client data private while not …,Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems,2010,72
Mining evidences for named entity disambiguation,Yang Li; Chi Wang; Fangqiu Han; Jiawei Han; Dan Roth; Xifeng Yan,Abstract Named entity disambiguation is the task of disambiguating named entity mentionsin natural language text and link them to their corresponding entries in a knowledge basesuch as Wikipedia. Such disambiguation can help enhance readability and add semantics toplain text. It is also a central step in constructing high-quality information network orknowledge graph from unstructured text. Previous research has tackled this problem bymaking use of various textual and structural features from a knowledge base. Most of theproposed algorithms assume that a knowledge base can provide enough explicit and usefulinformation to help disambiguate a mention to the right entity. However; the existingknowledge bases are rarely complete (likely will never be); thus leading to poorperformance on short queries with not well-known contexts. In such cases; we need to …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2013,70
Classification and novel class detection of data streams in a dynamic feature space,Mohammad M Masud; Qing Chen; Jing Gao; Latifur Khan; Jiawei Han; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract Data stream classification poses many challenges; most of which are not addressedby the state-of-the-art. We present DXMiner; which addresses four major challenges to datastream classification; namely; infinite length; concept-drift; concept-evolution; and feature-evolution. Data streams are assumed to be infinite in length; which necessitates single-passincremental learning techniques. Concept-drift occurs in a data stream when the underlyingconcept changes over time. Most existing data stream classification techniques address onlythe infinite length and concept-drift problems. However; concept-evolution and feature-evolution are also major challenges; and these are ignored by most of the existingapproaches. Concept-evolution occurs in the stream when novel classes arrive; and feature-evolution occurs when new features emerge in the stream.

Answering top-k queries with multi-dimensional selections: The ranking cube approach,Dong Xin; Jiawei Han; Hong Cheng; Xiaolei Li,Abstract Observed in many real applications; a top-k query often consists of two componentsto reflect a user's preference: a selection condition and a ranking function. A user may notonly propose ad hoc ranking functions; but also use different interesting subsets of the data.In many cases; a user may want to have a thorough study of the data by initiating a multi-dimensional analysis of the top-k query results. Previous work on top-k query processingmainly focuses on optimizing data access according to the ranking function only. Theproblem of efficient answering top-k queries with multi-dimensional selections has not beenwell addressed yet. This paper proposes a new computational model; called ranking cube;for efficient answering top-k queries with multi-dimensional selections. We define a rank-aware measure for the cube; capturing our goal of responding to multi-dimensional …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,70
Using graph model for face analysis,Deng Cai; Xiaofei He; Jiawei Han,Previous work has demonstrated that the image variations of many objects (human faces inparticular) under variable lighting can be effectively modelled by low dimensional linearspaces. The typical methods for learning a face subspace include Principal ComponentAnalysis (PCA); Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA); and Locality Preserving Projection(LPP). Theoretical analysis shows that all these three methods can be obtained fromdifferent graph models which correspond to different geometrical structures. In this paper; wesystematically analyze the relationship between these three subspace methods. We showsthat LPP provides a more general framework for subspace learning and a natural solution tothe small sample issue in LDA.

Text classification from positive and unlabeled documents,Hwanjo Yu; ChengXiang Zhai; Jiawei Han,Abstract Most existing studies of text classification assume that the training data arecompletely labeled. In reality; however; many information retrieval problems can be moreaccurately described as learning a binary classifier from a set of incompletely labeledexamples; where we typically have a small number of labeled positive examples and a verylarge number of unlabeled examples. In this paper; we study such a problem of performingText Classification WithOut labeled Negative data TC-WON). In this paper; we explore anefficient extension of the standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach; called SVMC(Support Vector Mapping Convergence)[17] for the TC-WON tasks.

Spectral regression: A unified subspace learning framework for content-based image retrieval,Deng Cai; Xiaofei He; Jiawei Han,Abstract Relevance feedback is a well established and effective framework for narrowingdown the gap between low-level visual features and high-level semantic concepts in content-based image retrieval. In most of traditional implementations of relevance feedback; adistance metric or a classifier is usually learned from user's provided negative and positiveexamples. However; due to the limitation of the user's feedbacks and the high dimensionalityof the feature space; one is often confront with the issue of the curse of the dimensionality.Recently; several researchers have considered manifold ways to address this issue; such asLocality Preserving Projections; Augmented Relation Embedding; and Semantic SubspaceProjection.

From sequential pattern mining to structured pattern mining: a pattern-growth approach,Jia-Wei Han; Jian Pei; Xi-Feng Yan,Abstract Sequential pattern mining is an important data mining problem with broadapplications. However; it is also a challenging problem since the mining may have togenerate or examine a combinatorially explosive number of intermediate subsequences.Recent studies have developed two major classes of sequential pattern mining methods:(1)a candidate generation-and-test approach; represented by (i) GSP; a horizontal format-based sequential pattern mining method; and (ii) SPADE; a vertical format-based method;and (2) a pattern-growth method; represented by PrefixSpan and its further extensions; suchas gSpan for mining structured patterns. In this study; we perform a systematic introductionand presentation of the pattern-growth methodology and study its principles and extensions.We first introduce two interesting pattern-growth algorithms; FreeSpan and PrefixSpan; for …,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2004,69
Mining collective intelligence in diverse groups,Guo-Jun Qi; Charu C Aggarwal; Jiawei Han; Thomas Huang,Abstract Collective intelligence; which aggregates the shared information from large crowds;is often negatively impacted by unreliable information sources with the low quality data. Thisbecomes a barrier to the effective use of collective intelligence in a variety of applications. Inorder to address this issue; we propose a probabilistic model to jointly assess the reliabilityof sources and find the true data. We observe that different sources are often notindependent of each other. Instead; sources are prone to be mutually influenced; whichmakes them dependent when sharing information with each other. High dependencybetween sources makes collective intelligence vulnerable to the overuse of redundant (andpossibly incorrect) information from the dependent sources. Thus; we reveal the latent groupstructure among dependent sources; and aggregate the information at the group level …,Proceedings of the 22nd international conference on World Wide Web,2013,68
C-cubing: Efficient computation of closed cubes by aggregation-based checking,Dong Xin; Zheng Shao; Jiawei Han; Hongyan Liu,It is well recognized that data cubing often produces huge outputs. Two popular effortsdevoted to this problem are (1) iceberg cube; where only significant cells are kept; and (2)closed cube; where a group of cells which preserve roll-up/drill-down semantics arelosslessly compressed to one cell. Due to its usability and importance; efficient computationof closed cubes still warrants a thorough study. In this paper; we propose a new measure;called closedness; for efficient closed data cubing. We show that closedness is an algebraicmeasure and can be computed efficiently and incrementally. Based on closedness measure;we develop an an aggregation-based approach; called C-Cubing (ie; Closed-Cubing); andintegrate it into two successful iceberg cubing algorithms: MM-Cubing and Star-Cubing.

Searching substructures with superimposed distance,Xifeng Yan; Feida Zhu; Jiawei Han; Philip S Yu,Efficient indexing techniques have been developed for the exact and approximatesubstructure search in large scale graph databases. Unfortunately; the retrieval problem ofstructures with categorical or geometric distance constraints is not solved yet. In this paper;we develop a method called PIS (Partition-based Graph Index and Search) to supportsimilarity search on substructures with superimposed distance constraints. PIS selectsdiscriminative fragments in a query graph and uses an index to prune the graphs that violatethe distance constraints. We identify a criterion to distinguish the selectivity of fragments inmultiple graphs and develop a partition method to obtain a set of highly selective fragments;which is able to improve the pruning performance. Experimental results show that PIS iseffective in processing real graph queries.,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06. Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on,2006,68

Latent community topic analysis: Integration of community discovery with topic modeling,Zhijun Yin; Liangliang Cao; Quanquan Gu; Jiawei Han,Abstract This article studies the problem of latent community topic analysis in text-associatedgraphs. With the development of social media; a lot of user-generated content is availablewith user networks. Along with rich information in networks; user graphs can be extendedwith text information associated with nodes. Topic modeling is a classic problem in textmining and it is interesting to discover the latent topics in text-associated graphs. Differentfrom traditional topic modeling methods considering links; we incorporate communitydiscovery into topic analysis in text-associated graphs to guarantee the topical coherence inthe communities so that users in the same community are closely linked to each other andshare common latent topics.

Efficient polygon amalgamation methods for spatial OLAP and spatial data mining,Xiaofang Zhou; David Truffet; Jiawei Han,Abstract The polygon amalgamation operation computes the boundary of the union of a setof polygons. This is an important operation for spatial on-line analytical processing andspatial data mining; where polygons representing different spatial objects often need to beamalgamated by varying criteria when the user wants to aggregate or reclassify theseobjects. The processing cost of this operation can be very high for a large number ofpolygons. Based on the observation that not all polygons to be amalgamated contribute tothe boundary; we investigate in this paper efficient polygon amalgamation methods byexcluding those internal polygons without retrieving them from the database. Two novelalgorithms; adjacency-based and occupancy-based; are proposed. While both algorithmscan reduce the amalgamation cost significantly; the occupancy-based algorithm is …,International Symposium on Spatial Databases,1999,67
Association mining in large databases: A re-examination of its measures,Tianyi Wu; Yuguo Chen; Jiawei Han,Abstract In the literature of data mining and statistics; numerous interestingness measureshave been proposed to disclose succinct object relationships of association patterns.However; it is still not clear when a measure is truly effective in large data sets. Recentstudies have identified a critical property; null-(transaction) invariance; for measuring eventassociations in large data sets; but many existing measures do not have this property. Wethus re-examine the null-invariant measures and find interestingly that they can beexpressed as a generalized mathematical mean; and there exists a total ordering of them.This ordering provides insights into the underlying philosophy of the measures and helps usunderstand and select the proper measure for different applications.,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2007,65
Generating semantic annotations for frequent patterns with context analysis,Qiaozhu Mei; Dong Xin; Hong Cheng; Jiawei Han; ChengXiang Zhai,Abstract As a fundamental data mining task; frequent pattern mining has widespreadapplications in many different domains. Research in frequent pattern mining has so farmostly focused on developing efficient algorithms to discover various kinds of frequentpatterns; but little attention has been paid to the important nextstep-interpreting thediscovered frequent patterns. Although some recent work has studied the compression andsummarization of frequent patterns; the proposed techniques can only annotate a frequentpattern with non-semantical information (eg support); which provides only limited help for auser to understand the patterns. In this paper; we propose the novel problem of generatingsemantic annotations for frequent patterns.

Making SVMs scalable to large data sets using hierarchical cluster indexing,Hwanjo Yu; Jiong Yang; Jiawei Han; Xiaolei Li,Abstract Support vector machines (SVMs) have been promising methods for classificationand regression analysis due to their solid mathematical foundations; which include twodesirable properties: margin maximization and nonlinear classification using kernels.However; despite these prominent properties; SVMs are usually not chosen for large-scaledata mining problems because their training complexity is highly dependent on the data setsize. Unlike traditional pattern recognition and machine learning; real-world data miningapplications often involve huge numbers of data records. Thus it is too expensive to performmultiple scans on the entire data set; and it is also infeasible to put the data set in memory.This paper presents a method; Clustering-Based SVM (CB-SVM); that maximizes the SVMperformance for very large data sets given a limited amount of resource; eg; memory.

A probabilistic model for estimating real-valued truth from conflicting sources,Bo Zhao; Jiawei Han,ABSTRACT One important task in data integration is to identify truth from noisy andconflicting data records collected from multiple sources; ie; the truth finding problem.Previously; several methods have been proposed to solve this problem by simultaneouslylearning the quality of sources and the truth. However; all those methods are mainlydesigned for handling categorical data but not numerical data. While in practice; numericaldata is not only ubiquitous but also of high value; eg price; weather; census; polls; economicstatistics; etc. Quality issues on numerical data can also be even more common and severethan categorical data due to its characteristics. Therefore; in this work we propose a newtruth-finding method specially designed for handling numerical data.

The joint inference of topic diffusion and evolution in social communities,Cindy Xide Lin; Qiaozhu Mei; Jiawei Han; Yunliang Jiang; Marina Danilevsky,The prevalence of Web 2.0 techniques has led to the boom of various online communities;where topics spread ubiquitously among user-generated documents. Working together withthis diffusion process is the evolution of topic content; where novel contents are introducedby documents which adopt the topic. Unlike explicit user behavior (eg; buying a DVD); boththe diffusion paths and the evolutionary process of a topic are implicit; making theirdiscovery challenging. In this paper; we track the evolution of an arbitrary topic and revealthe latent diffusion paths of that topic in a social community.

Mining quality phrases from massive text corpora,Jialu Liu; Jingbo Shang; Chi Wang; Xiang Ren; Jiawei Han,Abstract Text data are ubiquitous and play an essential role in big data applications.However; text data are mostly unstructured. Transforming unstructured text into structuredunits (eg; semantically meaningful phrases) will substantially reduce semantic ambiguityand enhance the power and efficiency at manipulating such data using databasetechnology. Thus mining quality phrases is a critical research problem in the field ofdatabases. In this paper; we propose a new framework that extracts quality phrases from textcorpora integrated with phrasal segmentation.

Stream sequential pattern mining with precise error bounds,Luiz F Mendes; Bolin Ding; Jiawei Han,Sequential pattern mining is an interesting data mining problem with many real-worldapplications. This problem has been studied extensively in static databases. However; inrecent years; emerging applications have introduced a new form of data called data stream.In a data stream; new elements are generated continuously. This poses additionalconstraints on the methods used for mining such data: memory usage is restricted; theinfinitely flowing original dataset cannot be scanned multiple times; and current resultsshould be available on demand. This paper introduces two effective methods for miningsequential patterns from data streams: the SS-BE method and the SS-MB method. Theproposed methods break the stream into batches and only process each batch once. Thetwo methods use different pruning strategies that restrict the memory usage but can still …,Data Mining; 2008.

The multi-relational skyline operator,Wen Jin; Martin Ester; Zengjian Hu; Jiawei Han,Most of the existing work on skyline query has been extensively used in decision support;recommending systems etc; and mainly focuses on the efficiency issue for a single table.However the data retrieved by users for the targeting skylines may often be stored in multipletables; thus require to perform join operations among tables. As a result; the cost oncomputing skylines on the joined table will be increased dramatically due to its potentiallyincreasing cardinality and dimensionality. In this paper; we systematically study the skylineoperator on multi-relational databases; and propose solutions aiming to seamlesslyintegrating state-of-the-art join methods into skyline computation. Our experiments not onlydemonstrate that the proposed methods are efficient; but also show the promisingapplicability of extending skyline operator to other typical database operators such as join …,Data Engineering; 2007.

H-Mine: Fast and space-preserving frequent pattern mining in large databases,Jian Pei; Jiawei Han; Hongjun Lu; Shojiro Nishio; Shiwei Tang; Dongqing Yang,In this study; we propose a simple and novel data structure using hyper-links; H-struct; and anew mining algorithm; H-mine; which takes advantage of this data structure and dynamicallyadjusts links in the mining process. A distinct feature of this method is that it has a verylimited and precisely predictable main memory cost and runs very quickly in memory-basedsettings. Moreover; it can be scaled up to very large databases using database partitioning.When the data set becomes dense;(conditional) FP-trees can be constructed dynamically aspart of the mining process. Our study shows that H-mine has an excellent performance forvarious kinds of data; outperforms currently available algorithms in different settings; and ishighly scalable to mining large databases.

Feature-based similarity search in graph structures,Xifeng Yan; Feida Zhu; Philip S Yu; Jiawei Han,Abstract Similarity search of complex structures is an important operation in graph-relatedapplications since exact matching is often too restrictive. In this article; we investigate theissues of substructure similarity search using indexed features in graph databases. Bytransforming the edge relaxation ratio of a query graph into the maximum allowed featuremisses; our structural filtering algorithm can filter graphs without performing pairwisesimilarity computation. It is further shown that using either too few or too many features canresult in poor filtering performance. Thus the challenge is to design an effective feature setselection strategy that could maximize the filtering capability. We prove that the complexity ofoptimal feature set selection is Ω (2 m) in the worst case; where m is the number of featuresfor selection. In practice; we identify several criteria to build effective feature sets for …,ACM Transactions on Database systems (TODS),2006,61
Discovering interesting patterns through user's interactive feedback,Dong Xin; Xuehua Shen; Qiaozhu Mei; Jiawei Han,Abstract In this paper; we study the problem of discovering interesting patterns throughuser's interactive feedback. We assume a set of candidate patterns (ie; frequent patterns)has already been mined. Our goal is to help a particular user effectively discover interestingpatterns according to his specific interest. Without requiring a user to explicitly construct aprior knowledge to measure the interestingness of patterns; we learn the user's priorknowledge from his interactive feedback. We propose two models to represent a user's prior:the log linear model and biased belief model. The former is designed for item-set patterns;whereas the latter is also applicable to sequential and structural patterns. To learn thesemodels; we present a two-stage approach; progressive shrinking and clustering; to selectsample patterns for feedback.

Cross-relational clustering with user's guidance,Xiaoxin Yin; Jiawei Han; Philip S Yu,Abstract Clustering is an essential data mining task with numerous applications. However;data in most real-life applications are high-dimensional in nature; and the relatedinformation often spreads across multiple relations. To ensure effective and efficient high-dimensional; cross-relational clustering; we propose a new approach; called CrossClus;which performs cross-relational clustering with user's guidance. We believe that user'sguidance; even likely in very simple forms; could be essential for effective high-dimensionalclustering since a user knows well the application requirements and data semantics.CrossClus is carried out as follows: A user specifies a clustering task and selects one or asmall set of features pertinent to the task. CrossClus extracts the set of highly relevantfeatures in multiple relations connected via linkages defined in the database schema …,Proceedings of the eleventh ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery in data mining,2005,61
On high dimensional projected clustering of data streams,Charu C Aggarwal; Jiawei Han; Jianyong Wang; S Yu Philip,Abstract The data stream problem has been studied extensively in recent years; because ofthe great ease in collection of stream data. The nature of stream data makes it essential touse algorithms which require only one pass over the data. Recently; single-scan; streamanalysis methods have been proposed in this context. However; a lot of stream data is high-dimensional in nature. High-dimensional data is inherently more complex in clustering;classification; and similarity search. Recent research discusses methods for projectedclustering over high-dimensional data sets. This method is however difficult to generalize todata streams because of the complexity of the method and the large volume of the datastreams. In this paper; we propose a new; high-dimensional; projected data streamclustering method; called HPStream. The method incorporates a fading cluster structure …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2005,60

Modeling massive RFID data sets: a gateway-based movement graph approach,Hector Gonzalez; Jiawei Han; Hong Cheng; Xiaolei Li; Diego Klabjan; Tianyi Wu,Massive radio frequency identification (RFID) data sets are expected to becomecommonplace in supply chain management systems. Warehousing and mining this data isan essential problem with great potential benefits for inventory management; object tracking;and product procurement processes. Since RFID tags can be used to identify eachindividual item; enormous amounts of location-tracking data are generated. With such data;object movements can be modeled by movement graphs; where nodes correspond tolocations and edges record the history of item transitions between locations. In this study; wedevelop a movement graph model as a compact representation of RFID data sets. Sincespatiotemporal as well as item information can be associated with the objects in such amodel; the movement graph can be huge; complex; and multidimensional in nature.

Mining top-k large structural patterns in a massive network,Feida Zhu; Qiang Qu; David Lo; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; Philip S Yu,ABSTRACT With ever-growing popularity of social networks; web and bio-networks; mininglarge frequent patterns from a single huge network has become increasingly important. Yetthe existing pattern mining methods cannot offer the efficiency desirable for large patterndiscovery. We propose Spider-Mine; a novel algorithm to efficiently mine top-K largestfrequent patterns from a single massive network with any user-specified probability of 1− ϵ.Deviating from the existing edge-by-edge (ie; incremental) pattern-growth framework;SpiderMine achieves its efficiency by unleashing the power of small patterns of a boundeddiameter; which we call “spiders”. With the spider structure; our approach adopts aprobabilistic mining framework to find the top-k largest patterns by (i) identifying anaffordable set of promising growth paths toward large patterns;(ii) generating large …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,56
Mining graph patterns efficiently via randomized summaries,Chen Chen; Cindy X Lin; Matt Fredrikson; Mihai Christodorescu; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Graphs are prevalent in many domains such as Bioinformatics; social networks;Web and cyber-security. Graph pattern mining has become an important tool in themanagement and analysis of complexly structured data; where example applicationsinclude indexing; clustering and classification. Existing graph mining algorithms haveachieved great success by exploiting various properties in the pattern space. Unfortunately;due to the fundamental role subgraph isomorphism plays in these methods; they may allenter into a pitfall when the cost to enumerate a huge set of isomorphic embeddings blowsup; especially in large graphs. The solution we propose for this problem resorts to reductionon the data space. For each graph; we build a summary of it and mine this shrunk graphinstead.

Warehousing and mining massive RFID data sets,Jiawei Han; Hector Gonzalez; Xiaolei Li; Diego Klabjan,Abstract Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) applications are set to play an essential rolein object tracking and supply chain management systems. In the near future; it is expectedthat every major retailer will use RFID systems to track the movement of products fromsuppliers to warehouses; store backrooms and eventually to points of sale. The volume ofinformation generated by such systems can be enormous as each individual item (a pallet; acase; or an SKU) will leave a trail of data as it moves through different locations. We proposetwo data models for the management of this data. The first is a path cube that preservesobject transition information while allowing muti-dimensional analysis of path dependentaggregates.

Spectral regression for dimensionality reduction,Deng Cai; Xiaofei He; Jiawei Han,Spectral methods have recently emerged as a powerful tool for dimensionality reduction andmanifold learning. These methods use information contained in the eigenvectors of a dataaffinity (\ie; item-item similarity) matrix to reveal low dimensional structure in highdimensional data. The most popular manifold learning algorithms include Locally LinearEmbedding; Isomap; and Laplacian Eigenmap. However; these algorithms only provide theembedding results of training samples. There are many extensions of these approacheswhich try to solve the out-of-sample extension problem by seeking an embedding function inreproducing kernel Hilbert space. However; a disadvantage of all these approaches is thattheir computations usually involve eigen-decomposition of dense matrices which isexpensive in both time and memory.

Regression cubes with lossless compression and aggregation,Yixin Chen; Guozhu Dong; Jiawei Han; Jian Pei; Benjamin W Wah; Jianyong Wang,As OLAP engines are widely used to support multidimensional data analysis; it is desirableto support in data cubes advanced statistical measures; such as regression and filtering; inaddition to the traditional simple measures such as count and average. Such new measuresallow users to model; smooth; and predict the trends and patterns of data. Existingalgorithms for simple distributive and algebraic measures are inadequate for efficientcomputation of statistical measures in a multidimensional space. In this paper; we propose afundamentally new class of measures; compressible measures; in order to support efficientcomputation of the statistical models. For compressible measures; we compress each cellinto an auxiliary matrix with a size independent of the number of tuples.

MM-Cubing: Computing iceberg cubes by factorizing the lattice space,Zheng Shao; Jiawei Han; Dong Xin,The data cube and iceberg cube computation problem has been studied by manyresearchers. There are three major approaches developed in this direction:(1) top-downcomputation; represented by MultiWay array aggregation (Zhao et. al.; 1997) which utilizesshared computation and performs well on dense data sets;(2) bottom-up computation;represented by BUC (Beyer and Ramakrishnan; 1999); which takes advantage of AprioriPruning and performs well on sparse data sets; and (3) integrated top-down and bottom-upcomputation; represented by Star-Cubing (Xin; et. al.; 2003); which takes advantages of bothand has high performance in most cases.

Revealing density-based clustering structure from the core-connected tree of a network,Jianbin Huang; Heli Sun; Qinbao Song; Hongbo Deng; Jiawei Han,Clustering is an important technique for mining the intrinsic community structures innetworks. The density-based network clustering method is able to not only detectcommunities of arbitrary size and shape; but also identify hubs and outliers. However; itrequires manual parameter specification to define clusters; and is sensitive to the parameterof density threshold which is difficult to determine. Furthermore; many real-world networksexhibit a hierarchical structure with communities embedded within other communities.Therefore; the clustering result of a global parameter setting cannot always describe theintrinsic clustering structure accurately. In this paper; we introduce a novel density-basednetwork clustering method; called graph-skeleton-based clustering (gSkeletonClu).

Many pervious approaches are difficult to detect communities with arbitrary sizeand shape; and are unable to identify hubs and outliers. A recently proposed networkclustering algorithm; SCAN; is effective and can overcome this difficulty. However; itdepends on a sensitive parameter: minimum similarity threshold $\varepsilon $; but providesno automated way to find it. In this paper; we propose a novel density-based networkclustering algorithm; called gSkeletonClu (graph-skeleton based clustering). By projecting anetwork to its Core-Connected Maximal Spanning Tree (CCMST); the network clusteringproblem is converted to finding core-connected components in the CCMST.

Mining constrained gradients in large databases,Guozhu Dong; Jiawei Han; JWM Lam; Jian Pei; K Wangm; Wei Zou,Many data analysis tasks can be viewed as search or mining in a multidimensional space(MDS). In such MDSs; dimensions capture potentially important factors for givenapplications; and cells represent combinations of values for the factors. To systematicallyanalyze data in MDS; an interesting notion; called" cubegrade" was recently introduced byImielinski et al.[2002]; which focuses on the notable changes in measures in MDS bycomparing a cell (which we refer to as probe cell) with its gradient cells; namely; itsancestors; descendants; and siblings. We call such queries gradient analysis queries (GQs).Since an MDS can contain billions of cells; it is important to answer GQs efficiently. We focuson developing efficient methods for mining GQs constrained by certain (weakly)antimonotone constraints.

The most important challenge forthis task is to estimate source reliability and select answers that are provided by high-qualitysources. Existing work solves this problem by simultaneously estimating sources' reliabilityand inferring questions' true answers (ie; the truths). However; these methods assume that asource has the same reliability degree on all the questions; but ignore the fact that sources'reliability may vary significantly among different topics.

In this study; we investigate the problem ofdiscovering object groups that travel together (ie; traveling companions) from trajectory datastreams. Such technique has broad applications in the areas of scientific study;transportation management; and military surveillance. To discover traveling companions; themonitoring system should cluster the objects of each snapshot and intersect the clusteringresults to retrieve moving-together objects. Since both clustering and intersection stepsinvolve high computational overhead; the key issue of companion discovery is to improvethe efficiency of algorithms.

On bayesian interpretation of fact-finding in information networks,Dong Wang; Tarek Abdelzaher; Hossein Ahmadi; Jeff Pasternack; Dan Roth; Manish Gupta; Jiawei Han; Omid Fatemieh; Hieu Le; Charu C Aggarwal,When information sources are unreliable; information networks have been used in datamining literature to uncover facts from large numbers of complex relations between noisyvariables. The approach relies on topology analysis of graphs; where nodes representpieces of (unreliable) information and links represent abstract relations. Such topologyanalysis was often empirically shown to be quite powerful in extracting useful conclusionsfrom large amounts of poor-quality information. However; no systematic analysis wasproposed for quantifying the accuracy of such conclusions.

With such data; it becomespossible to automatically identify suspicious behavior in object movements. Anomalydetection in massive sets of moving objects has many important applications; especially insurveillance; law enforcement; and homeland security. Due to the sheer volume ofspatiotemporal and non-spatial data (such as weather and object type) associated withmoving objects; it is challenging to develop a method that can efficiently and effectivelydetect anomalies in complex scenarios. The problem is further complicated by the fact thatanomalies may occur at various levels of abstraction and be associated with different timeand location granularities.

A multi-partition multi-chunk ensemble technique to classify concept-drifting data streams,Mohammad M Masud; Jing Gao; Latifur Khan; Jiawei Han; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract We propose a multi-partition; multi-chunk ensemble classifier based data miningtechnique to classify concept-drifting data streams. Existing ensemble techniques inclassifying concept-drifting data streams follow a single-partition; single-chunk approach; inwhich a single data chunk is used to train one classifier. In our approach; we train acollection of v classifiers from r consecutive data chunks using v-fold partitioning of the data;and build an ensemble of such classifiers. By introducing this multi-partition; multi-chunkensemble technique; we significantly reduce classification error compared to the single-partition; single-chunk ensemble approaches.

T-OLAP operations generate new networks from theoriginal ones by rolling up a subset of nodes chosen by certain constraint criteria. The keychallenge is to efficiently compute measures for the newly generated networks and handleuser queries with varied constraints. Two effective computational techniques; T-Distributiveness and T-Monotonicity are proposed to achieve efficient query processing andcube materialization. We also provide a T-OLAP query processing framework into whichthese techniques are weaved. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first work to give aframework study for topological OLAP on information networks.

Mining approximate top-k subspace anomalies in multi-dimensional time-series data,Xiaolei Li; Jiawei Han,Abstract Market analysis is a representative data analysis process with many applications. Insuch an analysis; critical numerical measures; such as profit and sales; fluctuate over timeand form time-series data. Moreover; the time series data correspond to market segments;which are described by a set of attributes; such as age; gender; education; income level; andproduct-category; that form a multi-dimensional structure. To better understand marketdynamics and predict future trends; it is crucial to study the dynamics of time-series in multi-dimensional market segments. This is a topic that has been largely ignored in time seriesand data cube research. In this study; we examine the issues of anomaly detection in multi-dimensional time-series data. We propose time-series data cube to capture the multi-dimensional space formed by the attribute structure. This facilitates the detection of …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,49
Computing iceberg cubes by top-down and bottom-up integration: The starcubing approach,Dong Xin; Jiawei Han; Xiaolei Li; Zheng Shao; Benjamin W Wah,Data cube computation is one of the most essential but expensive operations in datawarehousing. Previous studies have developed two major approaches; top-down versusbottom-up. The former; represented by the multiway array cube (called the multiway)algorithm; aggregates simultaneously on multiple dimensions; however; it cannot takeadvantage of a priori pruning when computing iceberg cubes (cubes that contain onlyaggregate cells whose measure values satisfy a threshold; called the iceberg condition).The latter; represented by BUC; computes the iceberg cube bottom-up and facilitates a prioripruning. BUC explores fast sorting and partitioning techniques; however; it does not fullyexplore multidimensional simultaneous aggregation. In this paper; we present a newmethod; star-cubing; that integrates the strengths of the previous two algorithms and …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2007,49
A template model for multidimensional inter-transactional association rules,Ling Feng; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hongjun Lu; Jiawei Han,Abstract. Multidimensional inter-transactional association rules extend the traditionalassociation rules to describe more general associations among items with multipleproperties across transactions.“After McDonald and Burger King open branches; KFC willopen a branch two months later and one mile away” is an example of such rules. Since thenumber of potential inter-transactional association rules tends to be extremely large; mininginter-transactional associations poses more challenges on efficient processing than miningtraditional intra-transactional associations. In order to make such association rule miningtruly practical and computationally tractable; in this study we present a template model tohelp users declare the interesting multidimensional inter-transactional associations to bemined. With the guidance of templates; several optimization techniques; ie; joining …,The VLDB Journal,2002,49
Knowledge discovery in object-oriented and active databases,Jiawei Han; Shojiro Nishio; Hiroyuki Kawano,Abstract Knowledge discovery in databases (or data mining); which extracts interestingknowledge from large databases; represents an important direction in the development ofdata-and knowledge-base systems. With fruitful research results on knowledge discovery inrelational databases and the emerging trend in the development of object-oriented andactive database systems; it is natural to investigate knowledge discovery in object-orientedand active databases. This paper overviews the mechanisms for knowledge discovery inobject-oriented and active database systems; with an emphasis on the techniques forgeneralization of complex data objects; methods; class hierarchies and dynamicallyevolving data; and on the integration of knowledge discovery mechanisms with productioncontrol processes.,*,1994,49
Learning online discussion structures by conditional random fields,Hongning Wang; Chi Wang; ChengXiang Zhai; Jiawei Han,Abstract Online forum discussions are emerging as valuable information repository; whereknowledge is accumulated by the interaction among users; leading to multiple threads withstructures. Such replying structure in each thread conveys important information about thediscussion content. Unfortunately; not all the online forum sites would explicitly record suchreplying relationship; making it hard to for both users and computers to digest theinformation buried in a thread discussion. In this paper; we propose a probabilistic model inthe Conditional Random Fields framework to predict the replying structure for a threadedonline discussion. Different from previous thread reconstruction methods; most of which failto consider dependency between the posts; we cast the problem as a supervised structurelearning problem to incorporate the features describing the structural dependency among …,Proceedings of the 34th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in Information Retrieval,2011,48
Graphminer: a structural pattern-mining system for large disk-based graph databases and its applications,Wei Wang; Chen Wang; Yongtai Zhu; Baile Shi; Jian Pei; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Mining frequent structural patterns from graph databases is an important researchproblem with broad applications. Recently; we developed an effective index structure; ADI;and efficient algorithms for mining frequent patterns from large; disk-based graph databases[5]; as well as constraint-based mining techniques. The techniques have been integratedinto a research prototype system---GraphMiner. In this paper; we describe a demo ofGraphMiner which showcases the technical details of the index structure and the miningalgorithms including their efficient implementation; the mining performance and thecomparison with some state-of-the-art methods; the constraint-based graph-pattern miningtechniques and the procedure of constrained graph mining; as well as mining real data setsin novel applications.,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,48
CCMine: Efficient mining of confidence-closed correlated patterns,Won-Young Kim; Young-Koo Lee; Jiawei Han,Abstract Correlated pattern mining has become increasingly important recently as analternative or an augmentation of association rule mining. Though correlated pattern miningdiscloses the correlation relationships among data objects and reduces significantly thenumber of patterns produced by the association mining; it still generates quite a largenumber of patterns. In this paper; we propose closed correlated pattern mining to reduce thenumber of the correlated patterns produced without information loss. We first propose a newnotion of the confidence-closed correlated patterns; and then present an efficient algorithm;called CCMine; for mining those patterns. Our performance study shows that confidence-closed pattern mining reduces the number of patterns by at least an order of magnitude. Italso shows that CCMine outperforms a simple method making use of the the traditional …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2004,48
Efficient rule-based attribute-oriented induction for data mining,David W Cheung; HY Hwang; Ada W Fu; Jiawei Han,Abstract Data mining has become an important technique which has tremendous potential inmany commercial and industrial applications. Attribute-oriented induction is a powerfulmining technique and has been successfully implemented in the data mining systemDBMiner (Han et al. Proc. 1996 Int'l Conf. on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery(KDD'96); Portland; Oregon; 1996). However; its induction capability is limited by theunconditional concept generalization. In this paper; we extend the concept generalization torule-based concept hierarchy; which enhances greatly its induction power. When previouslyproposed induction algorithm is applied to the more general rule-based case; a problem ofinduction anomaly occurs which impacts its efficiency. We have developed an efficientalgorithm to facilitate induction on the rule-based case which can avoid the anomaly …,Journal of Intelligent Information Systems,2000,48
Exploratory mining via constrained frequent set queries,Raymond Ng; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Jiawei Han; Teresa Mah,Abstract Although there have been many studies on data mining; to date there have beenfew research prototypes or commercial systems supporting comprehensive query-drivenmining; which encourages interactive exploration of the data. Our thesis is that constraintconstructs and the optimization they induce play a pivotal role in mining queries; thussubstantially enhancing the usefulness and performance of the mining system. This is basedon the analogy of declarative query languages like SQL and query optimization which havemade relational databases so successful. To this end; our proposed demo is not yet anotherdata mining system; but of a new paradigm in data mining-mining with constraints; as theimportant first step towards supporting ad-hoc mining in DBMS.

Detecting recurring and novel classes in concept-drifting data streams,Mohammad M Masud; Tahseen M Al-Khateeb; Latifur Khan; Charu Aggarwal; Jing Gao; Jiawei Han; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Concept-evolution is one of the major challenges in data stream classification; which occurswhen a new class evolves in the stream. This problem remains unaddressed by most state-of-the-art techniques. A recurring class is a special case of concept-evolution. This specialcase takes place when a class appears in the stream; then disappears for a long time; andagain appears. Existing data stream classification techniques that address the concept-evolution problem; wrongly detect the recurring classes as novel class. This creates twomain problems. First; much resource is wasted in detecting a recurring class as novel class;because novel class detection is much more computationally-and memory-intensive; ascompared to simply recognizing an existing class. Second; when a novel class is identified;human experts are involved in collecting and labeling the instances of that class for future …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on,2011,47
Mining frequent patterns from very high dimensional data: A top-down row enumeration approach,Hongyan Liu; Jiawei Han; Dong Xin; Zheng Shao,Abstract Data sets of very high dimensionality; such as microarray data; pose greatchallenges on efficient processing to most existing data mining algorithms. Recently; therecomes a row-enumeration method that performs a bottom-up search of row combinationspace to find corresponding frequent patterns. Due to a limited number of rows in microarraydata; this method is more efficient than column enumerationbased algorithms. However; thebottom-up search strategy cannot take an advantage of user-specified minimum supportthreshold to effectively prune search space; and therefore leads to long runtime and muchmemory overhead. In this paper we propose a new search strategy; top-down mining;integrated with a novel rowenumeration tree; which makes full use of the pruning power ofthe minimum support threshold to cut down search space dramatically.

Learning relevance from heterogeneous social network and its application in online targeting,Chi Wang; Rajat Raina; David Fong; Ding Zhou; Jiawei Han; Greg Badros,Abstract The rise of social networking services in recent years presents new researchchallenges for matching users with interesting content. While the content-rich nature of thesesocial networks offers many cues on" interests" of a user such as text in user-generatedcontent; the links in the network; and user demographic information; there is a lack ofsuccessful methods for combining such heterogeneous data to model interest andrelevance. This paper proposes a new method for modeling user interest fromheterogeneous data sources with distinct but unknown importance. The model leverageslinks in the social graph by integrating the conceptual representation of a user's linkedobjects.

Topic modeling for OLAP on multidimensional text databases: topic cube and its applications,Duo Zhang; ChengXiang Zhai; Jiawei Han; Ashok Srivastava; Nikunj Oza,Abstract As the amount of textual information grows explosively in various kinds of businesssystems; it becomes more and more desirable to analyze both structured data records andunstructured text data simultaneously. Although online analytical processing (OLAP)techniques have been proven very useful for analyzing and mining structured data; they facechallenges in handling text data. On the other hand; probabilistic topic models are amongthe most effective approaches to latent topic analysis and mining on text data. In this paper;we study a new data model called topic cube to combine OLAP with probabilistic topicmodeling and enable OLAP on the dimension of text data in a multidimensional textdatabase.

Support tensor machines for text categorization,Deng Cai; Xiaofei He; Ji-Rong Wen; Jiawei Han; Wei-Ying Ma,We consider the problem of text representation and categorization. Conventionally; a textdocument is represented by a vector in high dimensional space. Some learning algorithmsare then applied in such a vector space for text categorization. Particularly; Support VectorMachine (SVM) has received a lot of attentions due to its effectiveness. In this paper; wepropose a new classification algorithm called {\bf Support Tensor Machine}(STM). STM uses{\bf Tensor Space Model} to represent documents. It considers a document as the secondorder tensor in\mathcal {R}^{n_1}\otimes\mathcal {R}^{n_2} $; where $\mathcal {R}^{n_1} $and $\mathcal {R}^{n_2} $ are two vector spaces. With tensor representation; the number ofparameters estimated by STM is much less than the number of parameters estimated bySVM. Therefore; our algorithm is especially suitable for small sample cases. We …,*,2006,46
A sampling-based framework for parallel data mining,Shengnan Cong; Jiawei Han; Jay Hoeflinger; David Padua,Abstract The goal of data mining algorithm is to discover useful information embedded inlarge databases. Frequent itemset mining and sequential pattern mining are two importantdata mining problems with broad applications. Perhaps the most efficient way to solve theseproblems sequentially is to apply a pattern-growth algorithm; which is a divide-and-conqueralgorithm [9; 10]. In this paper; we present a framework for parallel mining frequent itemsetsand sequential patterns based on the divide-and-conquer strategy of pattern growth. Then;we discuss the load balancing problem and introduce a sampling technique; called selectivesampling; to address this problem. We implemented parallel versions of both frequentitemsets and sequential pattern mining algorithms following our framework. Theexperimental results show that our parallel algorithms usually achieve excellent …,Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGPLAN symposium on Principles and practice of parallel programming,2005,46
Mining periodic behaviors of object movements for animal and biological sustainability studies,Zhenhui Li; Jiawei Han; Bolin Ding; Roland Kays,Abstract Periodicity is one of the most frequently occurring phenomena for moving objects.Animals usually have periodic movement behaviors; such as daily foraging behaviors oryearly migration behaviors. Such periodic behaviors are the keys to understand animalmovement and they also reflect the seasonal; climate; or environmental changes of theecosystem. However; periodic behaviors could be complicated; involving multipleinterleaving periods; partial time span; and spatiotemporal noises and outliers. In this paper;we address the problem of mining periodic behaviors for moving objects. It involves two sub-problems: how to detect the periods in complex movements; and how to mine periodicbehaviors. A period is usually a single value; such as 24 h. And a periodic behavior is astatistical description of the periodic movement for one specific period. For example; we …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2012,45
Videomule: a consensus learning approach to multi-label classification from noisy user-generated videos,Chandrasekar Ramachandran; Rahul Malik; Xin Jin; Jing Gao; Klara Nahrstedt; Jiawei Han,Abstract With the growing proliferation of conversational media and devices for generatingmultimedia content; the Internet has seen an expansion in websites catering to user-generated media. Most of the user-generated content is multimodal in nature as it hasvideos; audio; text (in the form of tags); comments and so on. Content analysis is achallenging problem on this type of media since it is noisy; unstructured and unreliable. Inthis paper we propose VideoMule; a consensus learning approach for multi-label videoclassification from noisy user-generated videos. In our scheme; we train classification andclustering algorithms on individual modes of information such as user comments; tags; videofeatures and so on. We then combine the results of trained classifiers and clusteringalgorithms using a novel heuristic consensus learning algorithm which as a whole …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM international conference on Multimedia,2009,45
Continuous k-nearest neighbor search for moving objects,Yifan Li; Jiong Yang; Jiawei Han,The paper describes a new method of continuously monitoring the k nearest neighbors of agiven object in the mobile environment. Instead of monitoring all k nearest neighbors; wechoose to monitor the k-th (nearest) neighbor since the necessary condition of changes inthe KNN is the change of the k-th neighbor. In addition; rather than in the original space; weconsider the moving objects in a transformed time-distance (TD) space; where each object isrepresented by a curve. A beach-line algorithm is developed to monitor the change of the k-th neighbor; which enables us to maintain the KNN incrementally. An extensive empiricalstudy shows that the beach-line algorithm outperforms the most efficient existing algorithmby a wide margin; especially when k or n (the total number of objects) is large.,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2004.

A concept tree ascension technique is applied inconcept generalization. In this paper; we extend the background knowledge representationfrom an unconditional non-rule-based concept hierarchy to a rule-based concept hierarchy;which enhances greatly its representation power.

An attribute-oriented rough set approach for knowledge discovery in databases,Xiaohua Hu; Nick Cercone; Jiawei Han,Abstract In this paper we present an attribute-oriented rough set approach for knowledgediscovery in databases. The method integrates machine learning paradigm; especiallylearning-from-examples techniques; with rough-set techniques. An attribute-orientedconcept tree ascension technique is first applied in generalization; which substantiallyreduces the computational complexity of database learning processes. Then the cause-effect relationship among the attributes in the database is analyzed using rough settechniques and the unimportant or irrelevant attributes are eliminated. Thus concise andstrong rules with little or no redundant information can be learned efficiently. Our studyshows that attribute-oriented induction combined with the rough set technique provides anefficient and effective mechanism for knowledge discovery in database systems.,*,1994,45

This paper develops a method of compiling and optimizingcomplex function-free linear recursions using a variable connection graph; the V-graph. Itshows that a function-free recursion consisting of a linear recursive rule and one or morenonrecursive rules can be compiled to (1) a bounded recursion; in which recursion can beeliminated from the program; or (2) an n-chain recursion; whose compiled formula consistsof one chain; when n= 1; or n synchronized compiled chains; when n> 1.

On the discovery of evolving truth,Yaliang Li; Qi Li; Jing Gao; Lu Su; Bo Zhao; Wei Fan; Jiawei Han,Abstract In the era of big data; information regarding the same objects can be collected fromincreasingly more sources. Unfortunately; there usually exist conflicts among the informationcoming from different sources. To tackle this challenge; truth discovery; ie; to integrate multi-source noisy information by estimating the reliability of each source; has emerged as a hottopic. In many real world applications; however; the information may come sequentially; andas a consequence; the truth of objects as well as the reliability of sources may bedynamically evolving. Existing truth discovery methods; unfortunately; cannot handle suchscenarios. To address this problem; we investigate the temporal relations among both objecttruths and source reliability; and propose an incremental truth discovery framework that candynamically update object truths and source weights upon the arrival of new data …,Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2015,44

Heterogeneous network-based trust analysis: a survey,Manish Gupta; Jiawei Han,Abstract Different information sources publish information with different degrees ofcorrectness and originality. False information can often result in considerable damage.Hence; trustworthinessof information is an important issue in this datadriven world economy.Reputation of different agents in a network has been studied earlier in a variety of domainslike e-commerce; social sciences; sensor networks; and P2P networks. Recently there hasbeen work in the data mining community on performing trust analysis based on the dataprovided by multiple information providers for different objects; and such agents and theirprovided information about data objects form a multi-typed heterogeneous network.

Tensor space model for document analysis,Deng Cai; Xiaofei He; Jiawei Han,Abstract Vector Space Model (VSM) has been at the core of information retrieval for the pastdecades. VSM considers the documents as vectors in high dimensional space. In such avector space; techniques like Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI); Support Vector Machines(SVM); Naive Bayes; etc.; can be then applied for indexing and classification. However; insome cases; the dimensionality of the document space might be extremely large; whichmakes these techniques infeasible due to the curse of dimensionality. In this paper; wepropose a novel Tensor Space Model for document analysis. We represent documents asthe second order tensors; or matrices. Correspondingly; a novel indexing algorithm calledTensor Latent Semantic Indexing (TensorLSI) is developed in the tensor space.

A variance minimization criterion to active learning on graphs,Ming Ji; Jiawei Han,Abstract We consider the problem of active learning over the vertices in a graph; withoutfeature representation. Our study is based on the common graph smoothness assumption;which is formulated in a Gaussian random field model. We analyze the probabilitydistribution over the unlabeled vertices conditioned on the label information; which is amultivariate normal with the mean being the harmonic solution over the field. Then we selectthe nodes to label such that the total variance of the distribution on the unlabeled data; aswell as the expected prediction error; is minimized. In this way; the classifier we obtain istheoretically more robust. Compared with existing methods; our algorithm has the advantageof selecting data in a batch offline mode with solid theoretical support. We show improvedperformance over existing label selection criteria on several real world data sets.,Artificial Intelligence and Statistics,2012,43
Density-based shrinkage for revealing hierarchical and overlapping community structure in networks,Jianbin Huang; Heli Sun; Jiawei Han; Boqin Feng,Abstract The investigation of community structure in networks is an important issue in manydisciplines; which still remains a challenging task. First; complex networks often show ahierarchical structure with communities embedded within other communities. Moreover;communities in the network may overlap and have noise; eg; some nodes belonging tomultiple communities and some nodes marginally connected with the communities; whichare called hub and outlier; respectively. Therefore; a good algorithm is desirable to be ableto not only detect hierarchical communities; but also to identify hubs and outliers. In thispaper; we propose a parameter-free hierarchical network clustering algorithm DenShrink.

Approximate frequent itemset mining in the presence of random noise,Hong Cheng; S Yu Philip; Jiawei Han,Frequent itemset mining has been a focused theme in data mining research and animportant first step in the analysis of data arising in a broad range of applications. Thetraditional exact model for frequent itemset requires that every item occur in each supportingtransaction. However; real application data is usually subject to random noise ormeasurement error; which poses new challenges for the efficient discovery of frequentitemset from the noisy data. Mining approximate frequent itemset in the presence of noiseinvolves two key issues: the definition of a noise-tolerant mining model and the design of anefficient mining algorithm. In this chapter; we will give an overview of the approximateitemset mining algorithms in the presence of random noise and examine several noise-tolerant mining approaches.

Learning with tensor representation,Deng Cai; Xiaofei He; Jiawei Han,Most of the existing learning algorithms take vectors as their input data. A function is thenlearned in such a vector space for classification; clustering; or dimensionality reduction.However; in some situations; there is reason to consider data as tensors. For example; animage can be considered as a second order tensor and a video can be considered as a thirdorder tensor. In this paper; we propose two novel algorithms called {\bf Support TensorMachines}(STM) and {\bf Tensor Least Square}(TLS). These two algorithms operate in thetesnor space. Specifically; we represent data as the second order tensors (or; matrices)in\mathcal {R}^{n_1}\otimes\mathcal {R}^{n_2}; where\mathcal {R}^{n_1} and\mathcal{R}^{n_2} are two vector spaces.

Image clustering with tensor representation,Xiaofei He; Deng Cai; Haifeng Liu; Jiawei Han,Abstract We consider the problem of image representation and clustering. Traditionally; an n1 xn 2 image is represented by a vector in the Euclidean space &Ropf; n1 x n2. Somelearning algorithms are then applied to these vectors in such a high dimensional space fordimensionality reduction; classification; and clustering. However; an image is intrinsically amatrix; or the second order tensor. The vector representation of the images ignores thespatial relationships between the pixels in an image. In this paper; we introduce a tensorframework for image analysis. We represent the images as points in the tensor space R n1mathcal R n2 which is a tensor product of two vector spaces. Based on the tensorrepresentation; we propose a novel image representation and clustering algorithm whichexplicitly considers the manifold structure of the tensor space.

User guided entity similarity search using meta-path selection in heterogeneous information networks,Xiao Yu; Yizhou Sun; Brandon Norick; Tiancheng Mao; Jiawei Han,Abstract With the emergence of web-based social and information applications; entitysimilarity search in information networks; aiming to find entities with high similarity to a givenquery entity; has gained wide attention. However; due to the diverse semantic meanings inheterogeneous information networks; which contain multi-typed entities and relationships;similarity measurement can be ambiguous without context. In this paper; we investigateentity similarity search and the resulting ambiguity problems in heterogeneous informationnetworks.

Modeling and exploiting heterogeneous bibliographic networks for expertise ranking,Hongbo Deng; Jiawei Han; Michael R Lyu; Irwin King,Abstract Recently expertise retrieval has received increasing interests in both academia andindustry. Finding experts with demonstrated expertise for a given query is a nontrivial taskespecially from a large-scale Web 2.0 systems; such as question answering andbibliography data; where users are actively publishing useful content online; interacting witheach other; and forming social networks in various ways; leading to heterogeneousnetworks in addition to the large amounts of textual content information. Many approacheshave been proposed and shown to be useful for expertise ranking. However; most of thesemethods only consider the textual documents while ignoring heterogeneous networkstructures or can merely integrate with one additional kind of information. None of them canfully exploit the characteristics of heterogeneous networks. In this paper; we propose a …,Proceedings of the 12th ACM/IEEE-CS joint conference on Digital Libraries,2012,42
Retrieving k-nearest neighboring trajectories by a set of point locations,Lu-An Tang; Yu Zheng; Xing Xie; Jing Yuan; Xiao Yu; Jiawei Han,Abstract The advance of object tracking technologies leads to huge volumes of spatio-temporal data accumulated in the form of location trajectories. Such data bring us newopportunities and challenges in efficient trajectory retrieval. In this paper; we study a newtype of query that finds the k Nearest Neighboring Trajectories (k-NNT) with the minimumaggregated distance to a set of query points. Such queries; though have a broad range ofapplications like trip planning and moving object study; cannot be handled by traditional k-NN query processing techniques that only find the neighboring points of an object. Tofacilitate scalable; flexible and effective query execution; we propose ak-NN trajectoryretrieval algorithm using a candidate-generation-and-verification strategy.

Discriminative frequent subgraph mining with optimality guarantees,Marisa Thoma; Hong Cheng; Arthur Gretton; Jiawei Han; Hans‐Peter Kriegel; Alex Smola; Le Song; Philip S Yu; Xifeng Yan; Karsten M Borgwardt,Abstract The goal of frequent subgraph mining is to detect subgraphs that frequently occur ina dataset of graphs. In classification settings; one is often interested in discoveringdiscriminative frequent subgraphs; whose presence or absence is indicative of the classmembership of a graph. In this article; we propose an approach to feature selection onfrequent subgraphs; called CORK; that combines two central advantages. First; it optimizes asubmodular quality criterion; which means that we can yield a near-optimal solution usinggreedy feature selection. Second; our submodular quality function criterion can beintegrated into gSpan; the state-of-the-art tool for frequent subgraph mining; and help toprune the search space for discriminative frequent subgraphs even during frequentsubgraph mining.

Mining knowledge from databases: an information network analysis approach,Jiawei Han; Yizhou Sun; Xifeng Yan; Philip S Yu,Abstract Most people consider a database is merely a data repository that supports datastorage and retrieval. Actually; a database contains rich; inter-related; multi-typed data andinformation; forming one or a set of gigantic; interconnected; heterogeneous informationnetworks. Much knowledge can be derived from such information networks if wesystematically develop an effective and scalable database-oriented information networkanalysis technology. In this tutorial; we introduce database-oriented information networkanalysis methods and demonstrate how information networks can be used to improve dataquality and consistency; facilitate data integration; and generate interesting knowledge.

Heterogeneous source consensus learning via decision propagation and negotiation,Jing Gao; Wei Fan; Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han,Abstract Nowadays; enormous amounts of data are continuously generated not only inmassive scale; but also from different; sometimes conflicting; views. Therefore; it is importantto consolidate different concepts for intelligent decision making. For example; to predict theresearch areas of some people; the best results are usually achieved by combining andconsolidating predictions obtained from the publication network; co-authorship network andthe textual content of their publications. Multiple supervised and unsupervised hypothesescan be drawn from these information sources; and negotiating their differences andconsolidating decisions usually yields a much more accurate model due to the diversity andheterogeneity of these models. In this paper; we address the problem of" consensuslearning" among competing hypotheses; which either rely on outside knowledge …,Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2009,42
CrossClus: user-guided multi-relational clustering,Xiaoxin Yin; Jiawei Han; S Yu Philip,Abstract Most structured data in real-life applications are stored in relational databasescontaining multiple semantically linked relations. Unlike clustering in a single table; whenclustering objects in relational databases there are usually a large number of featuresconveying very different semantic information; and using all features indiscriminately isunlikely to generate meaningful results. Because the user knows her goal of clustering; wepropose a new approach called C ross C lus; which performs multi-relational clusteringunder user's guidance. Unlike semi-supervised clustering which requires the user to providea training set; we minimize the user's effort by using a very simple form of user guidance.The user is only required to select one or a small set of features that are pertinent to theclustering goal; and C ross C lus searches for other pertinent features in multiple relations …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2007,42
Mining condensed frequent-pattern bases,Jian Pei; Guozhu Dong; Wei Zou; Jiawei Han,Abstract Frequent-pattern mining has been studied extensively and has many usefulapplications. However; frequent-pattern mining often generates too many patterns to be trulyefficient or effective. In many applications; it is sufficient to generate and examine frequentpatterns with a sufficiently good approximation of the support frequency instead of in fullprecision. Such a compact but “close-enough” frequent-pattern base is called a condensedfrequent-pattern base. In this paper; we propose and examine several alternatives for thedesign; representation; and implementation of such condensed frequent-pattern bases.Several algorithms for computing such pattern bases are proposed. Their effectiveness atpattern compression and methods for efficiently computing them are investigated. Asystematic performance study is conducted on different kinds of databases; and …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2004,42
Some performance results on recursive query processing in relational database systems,Jiawei Han; Hongjun Lu,The processing of recursive queries in relational database systems poses a great challengein research on expert database systems. This paper uses both analytical and experimentalmethods to investigate the performance of several different algorithms in processing arecursive query in first-order recursive databases. The analytical method estimated the I/Oand CPU cost and the storage needed in processing recursive queries. The experimentaltests were performed on a synthetic relational database built on top of WISS (WisconsinStorage System) on VAX 11/750. Both analytical and experimental results indicate that forefficient recursive database processing it is important to apply the following heuristics:performing selection first; making use of wavefront relations; and grouping those joins whichreduce the size of intermediate results.

Mining event periodicity from incomplete observations,Zhenhui Li; Jingjing Wang; Jiawei Han,Abstract Advanced technology in GPS and sensors enables us to track physical events; suchas human movements and facility usage. Periodicity analysis from the recorded data is animportant data mining task which provides useful insights into the physical events andenables us to report outliers and predict future behaviors. To mine periodicity in an event; wehave to face real-world challenges of inherently complicated periodic behaviors andimperfect data collection problem. Specifically; the hidden temporal periodic behaviors couldbe oscillating and noisy; and the observations of the event could be incomplete. In thispaper; we propose a novel probabilistic measure for periodicity and design a practicalmethod to detect periods. Our method has thoroughly considered the uncertainties andnoises in periodic behaviors and is provably robust to incomplete observations …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2012,41
Classification and novel class detection in data streams with active mining,Mohammad M Masud; Jing Gao; Latifur Khan; Jiawei Han; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract We present ActMiner; which addresses four major challenges to data streamclassification; namely; infinite length; concept-drift; concept-evolution; and limited labeleddata. Most of the existing data stream classification techniques address only the infinitelength and concept-drift problems. Our previous work; MineClass; addresses the concept-evolution problem in addition to addressing the infinite length and concept-drift problems.Concept-evolution occurs in the stream when novel classes arrive. However; most of theexisting data stream classification techniques; including MineClass; require that all theinstances in a data stream be labeled by human experts and become available for training.This assumption is impractical; since data labeling is both time consuming and costly.Therefore; it is impossible to label a majority of the data points in a high-speed data …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2010,41

We integrate IE and truth-finding research and present a novelunsupervised multi-dimensional truth finding framework which incorporates signals frommultiple sources; multiple systems and multiple pieces of evidence by knowledge graphconstruction through multi-layer deep linguistic analysis.

Evolutionary clustering and analysis of bibliographic networks,Manish Gupta; Charu C Aggarwal; Jiawei Han; Yizhou Sun,In this paper; we study the problem of evolutionary clustering of multi-typed objects in aheterogeneous bibliographic network. The traditional methods of homogeneous clusteringmethods do not result in a good typed-clustering. The design of heterogeneous methods forclustering can help us better understand the evolution of each of the types apart from theevolution of the network as a whole. In fact; the problem of clustering and evolutiondiagnosis are closely related because of the ability of the clustering process to summarizethe network and provide insights into the changes in the objects over time. We present sucha tightly integrated method for clustering and evolution diagnosis of heterogeneousbibliographic information networks.

Handling redundancy in the processing of recursive database queries,Jiawei Han; Lawrence J Henschen,Abstract Redundancy may exist in the processing of recursive database queries at fourdifferent levels precompilation level; iteration level; tuple processing level and file accessinglevel. Techniques for reducing redundant work at each level are studied. In theprecompilation level; the optimization techniques include removing redundant parts in a rulecluster; simplifying recursive clusters and sharing common subexpressions among rules. Atthe iteration level; the techniques discussed are the use of frontier relations and the countingmethod. At the tuple processing level; we use merging and filtering methods to excludeprocessed drivers from database reaccessing. Finally; at the file accessing level; I/O cost canbe further reduced by level relaxation. We conclude that even for complex recursion;redundant database processing can be considerably reduced or eliminated by …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1987,40
A probabilistic model for linking named entities in web text with heterogeneous information networks,Wei Shen; Jiawei Han; Jianyong Wang,Abstract Heterogeneous information networks that consist of multi-type; interconnectedobjects are becoming ubiquitous and increasingly popular; such as social media networksand bibliographic networks. The task to link named entity mentions detected from theunstructured Web text with their corresponding entities existing in a heterogeneousinformation network is of practical importance for the problem of information networkpopulation and enrichment. This task is challenging due to name ambiguity and limitedknowledge existing in the information network. Most existing entity linking methods focus onlinking entities with Wikipedia or Wikipedia-derived knowledge bases (eg; YAGO); and arelargely dependent on the special features associated with Wikipedia (eg; Wikipedia articlesor Wikipedia-based relatedness measures).

Ac-close: Efficiently mining approximate closed itemsets by core pattern recovery,Hong Cheng; Philip S Yu; Jiawei Han,Recent studies have proposed methods to discover approximate frequent itemsets in thepresence of random noise. By relaxing the rigid requirement of exact frequent patternmining; some interesting patterns; which would previously be fragmented by exact patternmining methods due to the random noise or measurement error; are successfully recovered.Unfortunately; a large number of" uninteresting" candidates are explored as well during themining process; as a result of the relaxed pattern mining methodology. This severely slowsdown the mining process. Even worse; it is hard for an end user to distinguish the recoveredinteresting patterns from these uninteresting ones. In this paper; we propose an efficientalgorithm AC-Close to recover the approximate closed itemsets from" core patterns". Byfocusing on the so-called core patterns; integrated with a top-down mining and several …,Data Mining; 2006. ICDM'06. Sixth International Conference on,2006,39
Towards efficient induction mechanisms in database systems,Jiawei Han,Abstract With the wide availability of huge amounts of data in database systems; theextraction of knowledge in databases by efficient and powerful induction or knowledgediscovery mechanisms has become an important issue in the construction of new generationdatabase and knowledge-base systems. In this article; an attribute-oriented inductionmethod for knowledge discovery in databases is investigated; which provides an efficient;set-oriented induction mechanism for extraction of different kinds of knowledge rules; suchas characteristic rules; discriminant rules; data evolution regularities and high leveldependency rules in large relational databases. Our study shows that the method is robustin the existence of noise and database updates; is extensible to knowledge discovery inadvanced and/or special purpose databases; such as object-oriented databases; active …,Theoretical Computer Science,1994,39
Linear discriminant dimensionality reduction,Quanquan Gu; Zhenhui Li; Jiawei Han,Abstract Fisher criterion has achieved great success in dimensionality reduction. Tworepresentative methods based on Fisher criterion are Fisher Score and Linear DiscriminantAnalysis (LDA). The former is developed for feature selection while the latter is designed forsubspace learning. In the past decade; these two approaches are often studiedindependently. In this paper; based on the observation that Fisher score and LDA arecomplementary; we propose to integrate Fisher score and LDA in a unified framework;namely Linear Discriminant Dimensionality Reduction (LDDR). We aim at finding a subset offeatures; based on which the learnt linear transformation via LDA maximizes the Fishercriterion. LDDR inherits the advantages of Fisher score and LDA and is able to do featureselection and subspace learning simultaneously. Both Fisher score and LDA can be seen …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2011,38
Dynamic social influence analysis through time-dependent factor graphs,Chi Wang; Jie Tang; Jimeng Sun; Jiawei Han,Social influence; the phenomenon that the actions of a user can induce her/his friends tobehave in a similar way; plays a key role in many (online) social systems. For example; acompany wants to market a new product through the effect of" word of mouth''in the socialnetwork. It wishes to find and convince a small number of influential users to adopt theproduct; and the goal is to trigger a large cascade of further adoptions. Fundamentally; weneed to answer the following question: how to quantify the influence between two users in alarge social network? To address this question; we propose a pair wise factor graph (PFG)model to model the social influence in social networks. An efficient algorithm is designed tolearn the model and make inference. We further propose a dynamic factor graph (DFG)model to incorporate the time information.

This paper introduces the tele-diagnostic powertracer; an in-situ troubleshooting tool that uses external power measurements to determine the internalhealth condition of an unresponsive host and the most likely cause of its failure. Wedeveloped our own low-cost power meter with low-bandwidth radio to report powermeasurements and findings; hence allowing remote (ie; tele-) diagnosis. The tool wasdeployed and tested in a remote solar-powered sensing network for acoustic and visualenvironmental monitoring. It was shown to successfully distinguish between severalcategories of failures that cause unresponsive behavior including energy depletion; antennadamage; radio disconnection; system crashes; and anomalous reboots.

Progressive clustering of networks using structure-connected order of traversal,Dustin Bortner; Jiawei Han,Network clustering enables us to view a complex network at the macro level; by grouping itsnodes into units whose characteristics and interrelationships are easier to analyze andunderstand. State-of-the-art network partitioning methods are unable to identify hubs andoutliers. A recently proposed algorithm; SCAN; overcomes this difficulty. However; it requiresa minimum similarity parameter ɛ but provides no automated way to find it. Thus; it must bererun for each ɛ value and does not capture the variety or hierarchy of clusters. We proposea new algorithm; SCOT (or Structure-Connected Order of Traversal); that produces a lengthn sequence containing all possible ɛ-clusterings. We propose a new algorithm; HintClus (orHierarchy-Induced Network Clustering); to hierarchically cluster the network by finding onlybest cluster boundaries (not agglomerative).

An efficient multi-relational Naïve Bayesian classifier based on semantic relationship graph,Hongyan Liu; Xiaoxin Yin; Jiawei Han,Abstract Classification is one of the most popular data mining tasks with a wide range ofapplications; and lots of algorithms have been proposed to build accurate and scalableclassifiers. Most of these algorithms only take a single table as input; whereas in the realworld most data are stored in multiple tables and managed by relational database systems.As transferring data from multiple tables into a single one usually causes many problems;development of multi-relational classification algorithms becomes important and attractsmany researchers' interests. Existing works about extending Naïve Bayes to deal with multi-relational data either have to transform data stored in tables to main-memory Prolog facts; orlimit the search space to only a small subset of real world applications. In this work; we aimat solving these problems and building an efficient; accurate Naïve Bayesian classifier to …,Proceedings of the 4th international workshop on Multi-relational mining,2005,38

Then we introduce recent studies onmining various types of graph patterns; including significant; representative and densesubgraph patterns. We also discuss the mining tasks in new problem settings such as agraph stream and an uncertain graph model.

Stream Classification with Recurring and Novel Class Detection Using Class-Based Ensemble.,Tahseen Al-Khateeb; Mohammad M Masud; Latifur Khan; Charu C Aggarwal; Jiawei Han; Bhavani M Thuraisingham,Abstract—Concept-evolution has recently received a lot of attention in the context of miningdata streams. Conceptevolution occurs when a new class evolves in the stream. Althoughmany recent studies address this issue; most of them do not consider the scenario ofrecurring classes in the stream. A class is called recurring if it appears in the stream;disappears for a while; and then reappears again. Existing data stream classificationtechniques either misclassify the recurring class instances as another class; or falselyidentify the recurring classes as novel. This increases the prediction error of the classifiers;and in some cases causes unnecessary waste in memory and computational resources. Inthis paper we address the recurring class issue by proposing a novel “class-based”ensemble technique; which substitutes the traditional “chunk-based” ensemble …,ICDM,2012,37
Topic initiator detection on the world wide web,Xin Jin; Scott Spangler; Rui Ma; Jiawei Han,Abstract In this paper we introduce a new Web mining and search technique-Topic InitiatorDetection (TID) on the Web. Given a topic query on the Internet and the resulting collectionof time-stamped web documents which contain the query keywords; the task of TID is toautomatically return which web document (or its author) initiated the topic or was the first todiscuss about the topic. To deal with the TID problem; we design a system framework andpropose algorithm InitRank (Initiator Ranking) to rank the web documents by their possibilityto be the topic initiator. We first extract features from the web documents and design severaltopic initiator indicators. Then; we propose a TCL graph which integrates the Time; Contentand Link information and design an optimization framework over the graph to computeInitRank.

On efficient processing of subspace skyline queries on high dimensional data,Wen Jin; Anthony KH Tung; Martin Ester; Jiawei Han,Recent studies on efficiently answering subspace skyline queries can be separated into twoapproaches. The first focused on pre-materializing a set of skylines points in varioussubspaces while the second focus on dynamically answering the queries by using a set ofanchors to prune off skyline points through spatial reasoning. Despite effort to compress thepre-materialized subspace skylines through removal of redundancy; the storage space forthe first approach remain exponential in the number of dimensions. The query time for thesecond approach on the other hand also grow substantially for data with higherdimensionality where the pruning power of anchors become much weaker. In this paper; wepropose methods for answering subspace skyline query on high dimensional data such thatboth prematerialization storage and query time can be moderated.

Geoburst: Real-time local event detection in geo-tagged tweet streams,Chao Zhang; Guangyu Zhou; Quan Yuan; Honglei Zhuang; Yu Zheng; Lance Kaplan; Shaowen Wang; Jiawei Han,Abstract The real-time discovery of local events (eg; protests; crimes; disasters) is of greatimportance to various applications; such as crime monitoring; disaster alarming; and activityrecommendation. While this task was nearly impossible years ago due to the lack of timelyand reliable data sources; the recent explosive growth in geo-tagged tweet data brings newopportunities to it. That said; how to extract quality local events from geo-tagged tweetstreams in real time remains largely unsolved so far. We propose GeoBurst; a method thatenables effective and real-time local event detection from geo-tagged tweet streams. With anovel authority measure that captures the geo-topic correlations among tweets; GeoBurstfirst identifies several pivots in the query window. Such pivots serve as representative tweetsfor potential local events and naturally attract similar tweets to form candidate events.

Cluscite: Effective citation recommendation by information network-based clustering,Xiang Ren; Jialu Liu; Xiao Yu; Urvashi Khandelwal; Quanquan Gu; Lidan Wang; Jiawei Han,Abstract Citation recommendation is an interesting but challenging research problem. Mostexisting studies assume that all papers adopt the same criterion and follow the samebehavioral pattern in deciding relevance and authority of a paper. However; in reality;papers have distinct citation behavioral patterns when looking for different references;depending on paper content; authors and target venues. In this study; we investigate theproblem in the context of heterogeneous bibliographic networks and propose a novel cluster-based citation recommendation framework; called ClusCite; which explores the principlethat citations tend to be softly clustered into interest groups based on multiple types ofrelationships in the network.

Trustworthiness analysis of sensor data in cyber-physical systems,Lu-An Tang; Xiao Yu; Sangkyum Kim; Quanquan Gu; Jiawei Han; Alice Leung; Thomas La Porta,Abstract A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is an integration of sensor networks withinformational devices. CPS can be used for many promising applications; such as trafficobservation; battlefield surveillance; and sensor-network-based monitoring. One key issuein CPS research is trustworthiness analysis of sensor data. Due to technology limitationsand environmental influences; the sensor data collected by CPS are inherently noisy andmay trigger many false alarms. It is highly desirable to sift meaningful information from alarge volume of noisy data. In this study; we propose a method called Tru-Alarm; whichincreases the capability of a CPS to recognize trustworthy alarms. Tru-Alarm estimates thelocations of objects causing alarms; constructs an object-alarm graph and carries outtrustworthiness inference based on the graph links.

Towards feature selection in network,Quanquan Gu; Jiawei Han,Abstract Traditional feature selection methods assume that the data are independent andidentically distributed (iid). However; in real world; there are tremendous amount of datawhich are distributing in a network. Existing features selection methods are not suited fornetworked data because the iid assumption no longer holds. This motivates us to studyfeature selection in a network. In this paper; we present a supervised feature selectionmethod based on Laplacian Regularized Least Squares (LapRLS) for networked data. Indetail; we use linear regression to utilize the content information; and adopt graphregularization to consider the link information. The proposed feature selection method aimsat selecting a subset of features such that the empirical error of LapRLS is minimized.

Modeling probabilistic measurement correlations for problem determination in large-scale distributed systems,Jing Gao; Guofei Jiang; Haifeng Chen; Jiawei Han,With the growing complexity in computer systems; it has been a real challenge to detect anddiagnose problems in today's large-scale distributed systems. Usually; the correlationsbetween measurements collected across the distributed system contain rich informationabout the system behaviors; and thus a reasonable model to describe such correlations iscrucially important in detecting and locating system problems. In this paper; we propose atransition probability model based on markov properties to characterize pair-wisemeasurement correlations. The proposed method can discover both the spatial (acrosssystem measurements) and temporal (across observation time) correlations; and thus such amodel can successfully represent the system normal profiles.

Cloud-based malware detection for evolving data streams,Mohammad M Masud; Tahseen M Al-Khateeb; Kevin W Hamlen; Jing Gao; Latifur Khan; Jiawei Han; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract Data stream classification for intrusion detection poses at least three majorchallenges. First; these data streams are typically infinite-length; making traditionalmultipass learning algorithms inapplicable. Second; they exhibit significant concept-drift asattackers react and adapt to defenses. Third; for data streams that do not have any fixedfeature set; such as text streams; an additional feature extraction and selection task must beperformed. If the number of candidate features is too large; then traditional feature extractiontechniques fail. In order to address the first two challenges; this article proposes amultipartition; multichunk ensemble classifier in which a collection of v classifiers is trainedfrom r consecutive data chunks using v-fold partitioning of the data; yielding an ensemble ofsuch classifiers.

An overview of clustering methods in geographic data analysis,Jiawei Han; Jae-Gil Lee; Micheline Kamber,Clustering is the process of grouping a set of physical or abstract objects into classes ofsimilar objects. A cluster is a collection of data objects that are similar to one another withinthe same cluster and are dissimilar to the objects in other clusters. Although classification isan effective means for distinguishing groups or classes of objects; it often requires costlycollection and labeling of a large set of training tuples or patterns; which the classifier usesto model each group. In contrast; clustering does not require such labeling at all. Clusteranalysis has been widely used in numerous applications; including market research; patternrecognition; data analysis; and image processing. In business; clustering can help marketersdiscover distinct groups in their customer bases and characterize customer groups based onpurchasing patterns. In biology; it can be used to derive plant and animal taxonomies …,Geographic data mining and knowledge discovery,2009,35
Sampling cube: a framework for statistical olap over sampling data,Xiaolei Li; Jiawei Han; Zhijun Yin; Jae-Gil Lee; Yizhou Sun,Abstract Sampling is a popular method of data collection when it is impossible or too costlyto reach the entire population. For example; television show ratings in the United States aregathered from a sample of roughly 5;000 households. To use the results effectively; thesamples are further partitioned in a multidimensional space based on multiple attributevalues. This naturally leads to the desirability of OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) oversampling data. However; unlike traditional data; sampling data is inherently uncertain; ie; notrepresenting the full data in the population. Thus; it is desirable to return not only queryresults but also the confidence intervals indicating the reliability of the results. Moreover; acertain segment in a multidimensional space may contain none or too few samples. Thisrequires some additional analysis to return trustable results. In this paper we propose a …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,35
Efficient discovery of frequent approximate sequential patterns,Feida Zhu; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; S Yu Philip,We propose an efficient algorithm for mining frequent approximate sequential patterns underthe Hamming distance model. Our algorithm gains its efficiency by adopting a" break-down-and-build-up" methodology. The" breakdown" is based on the observation that alloccurrences of a frequent pattern can be classified into groups; which we call strands. Wedeveloped efficient algorithms to quickly mine out all strands by iterative growth. In the" build-up" stage; these strands are grouped up to form the support sets from which all approximatepatterns would be identified. A salient feature of our algorithm is its ability to grow thefrequent patterns by iteratively assembling building blocks of significant sizes in a localsearch fashion. By avoiding incremental growth and global search; we achieve greaterefficiency without losing the completeness of the mining result. Our experimental studies …,Data Mining; 2007. ICDM 2007.

On compressing frequent patterns,Dong Xin; Jiawei Han; Xifeng Yan; Hong Cheng,Abstract A major challenge in frequent-pattern mining is the sheer size of its mining results.To compress the frequent patterns; we propose to cluster frequent patterns with a tightnessmeasure δ (called δ-cluster); and select a representative pattern for each cluster. Theproblem of finding a minimum set of representative patterns is shown NP-Hard. We developtwo greedy methods; RPglobal and RPlocal. The former has the guaranteed compressionbound but higher computational complexity. The latter sacrifices the theoretical bounds butis far more efficient. Our performance study shows that the compression quality usingRPlocal is very close to RPglobal; and both can reduce the number of closed frequentpatterns by almost two orders of magnitude. Furthermore; RPlocal mines even faster thanFPClose [G. Grahne; J. Zhu; Efficiently using prefix-trees in mining frequent itemsets; in …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2007,35

Learning a Kernel for Multi-Task Clustering.,Quanquan Gu; Zhenhui Li; Jiawei Han,Abstract Multi-task learning has received increasing attention in the past decade. Manysupervised multi-task learning methods have been proposed; while unsupervised multitasklearning is still a rarely studied problem. In this paper; we propose to learn a kernel for multi-task clustering. Our goal is to learn a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space; in which thegeometric structure of the data in each task is preserved; while the data distributions of anytwo tasks are as close as possible. This is formulated as a unified kernel learning framework;under which we study two types of kernel learning: nonparametric kernel learning andspectral kernel design. Both types of kernel learning can be solved by linear programming.Experiments on several cross-domain text data sets demonstrate that kernel k-means on thelearned kernel can achieve better clustering results than traditional single-task clustering …,AAAI,2011,34
A survey of RFID data processing,Charu C Aggarwal; Jiawei Han,Abstract Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a new technology which allows a sensor(reader) to read; from a distance; and without line of sight; a unique product identificationcode (EPC) associated with a tag. Such tags are very useful in inventory management andlogistics; because they can be used in order to track the movement and locations of largevolumes of items in a cost effective way. This leads to massive streams of noisy data; whichcan be used in the context of a variety of data management and event processingalgorithms. The use of RFID also has a number of privacy challenges associated with it;because a tag on an item being carried by a person; also becomes a unique location tag forthat person. Therefore; methods need to to be designed to increase the privacy and securityof RFID technology. This chapter will provide a broad overview and survey of a variety of …,*,2013,33
Mining control flow abnormality for logic error isolation,Chao Liu; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Analyzing the executions of a buggy program is essentially a data mining process:Tracing the data generated during program executions may disclose important patterns andoutliers that could eventually reveal the location of software errors. In this paper; weinvestigate program logic errors; which rarely incur memory access violations but generateincorrect outputs. We show that through mining program control flow abnormality; we couldisolate many logic errors without knowing the program semantics. In order to detect thecontrol abnormality; we propose a hypothesis testing-like approach that statistically contraststhe evaluation probability of condition statements between correct and incorrect executions.Based on this contrast; we develop two algorithms that effectively rank functions with respectto their likelihood of containing the hidden error. We evaluated these two algorithms on a …,*,2006,33
Scalable construction of topic directory with nonparametric closed termset mining,Hwanjo Yu; Duane Searsmith; Xiaolei Li; Jiawei Han,A topic directory; eg; Yahoo directory; provides a view of a document set at different levels ofabstraction and is ideal for the interactive exploration and visualization of the document set.We present a method that dynamically generates a topic directory from a document set usinga frequent closed termset mining algorithm.

Asynchronous chain recursions,Jiawei Han; Wenyu Lu,The authors study the compilation and efficient processing of asynchronous chainrecursions and show that many complex function-free recursions; which may contain singleor multiple linear recursive rules; nonlinear recursive rules; mutually recursive rules; andmultiple-level recursions; can be compiled to asynchronous chain recursions. The study onthe compilation methods; the simplification of compiled formulas; and the query-processingtechniques shows that asynchronous chain recursions can be compiled to relatively simplecompiled formulas and processed efficiently using transitive closure query-processingmethods.,IEEE transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1989,33
Mining knowledge from interconnected data: a heterogeneous information network analysis approach,Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han; Xifeng Yan; Philip S Yu,Abstract Most objects and data in the real world are interconnected; forming complex;heterogeneous but often semi-structured information networks. However; most peopleconsider a database merely as a data repository that supports data storage and retrievalrather than one or a set of heterogeneous information networks that contain rich; inter-related; multi-typed data and information. Most network science researchers only studyhomogeneous networks; without distinguishing the different types of objects and links in thenetworks. In this tutorial; we view database and other interconnected data as heterogeneousinformation networks; and study how to leverage the rich semantic meaning of types ofobjects and links in the networks. We systematically introduce the technologies that caneffectively and efficiently mine useful knowledge from such information networks.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,32
Predicting future popularity trend of events in microblogging platforms,Manish Gupta; Jing Gao; ChengXiang Zhai; Jiawei Han,Abstract The fast information sharing on Twitter from millions of users all over the worldleads to almost real-time reporting of events. It is extremely important for business andadministrative decision makers to learn events' popularity as quickly as possible; as it canbuy extra precious time for them to make informed decisions. Therefore; we introduce theproblem of predicting future popularity trend of events on microblogging platforms.Traditionally; trend prediction has been performed by using time series analysis of pastpopularity to forecast the future popularity changes. As we can encode the rich Twitterdynamics using a rich variety of features from microblogging data; we explore regression;classification and hybrid approaches; using a large set of popularity; social and eventfeatures; to predict event popularity.

Learning search tasks in queries and web pages via graph regularization,Ming Ji; Jun Yan; Siyu Gu; Jiawei Han; Xiaofei He; Wei Vivian Zhang; Zheng Chen,Abstract As the Internet grows explosively; search engines play a more and more importantrole for users in effectively accessing online information. Recently; it has been recognizedthat a query is often triggered by a search task that the user wants to accomplish. Similarly;many web pages are specifically designed to help accomplish a certain task. Therefore;learning hidden tasks behind queries and web pages can help search engines return themost useful web pages to users by task matching. For instance; the search task that triggersquery" thinkpad T410 broken" is to maintain a computer; and it is desirable for a searchengine to return the Lenovo troubleshooting page on the top of the list. However; existingsearch engine technologies mainly focus on topic detection or relevance ranking; which arenot able to predict the task that triggers a query and the task a web page can accomplish …,Proceedings of the 34th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in Information Retrieval,2011,32
Top-down mining of frequent closed patterns from very high dimensional data,Hongyan Liu; Xiaoyu Wang; Jun He; Jiawei Han; Dong Xin; Zheng Shao,Abstract Frequent pattern mining is an essential theme in data mining. Existing algorithmsusually use a bottom-up search strategy. However; for very high dimensional data; thisstrategy cannot fully utilize the minimum support constraint to prune the rowset searchspace. In this paper; we propose a new method called top-down mining together with anovel row enumeration tree to make full use of the pruning power of the minimum supportconstraint. Furthermore; to efficiently check if a rowset is closed; we develop a method calledthe trace-based method. Based on these methods; an algorithm called TD-Close isdesigned for mining a complete set of frequent closed patterns. To enhance its performancefurther; we improve it by using new pruning strategies and new data structures that lead to anew algorithm TTD-Close. Our performance study shows that the top-down strategy is …,Information Sciences,2009,32
Mining frequent itemsets over arbitrary time intervals in data streams,Chris Giannella; Jiawei Han; Edward Robertson; Chao Liu,Abstract Mining frequent itemsets over a stream of transactions presents difficult newchallenges over traditional mining in static transaction databases. Stream transactions canonly be looked at once and streams have a much richer frequent itemset structure due totheir inherent temporal nature. We examine a novel data structure; an FP-stream; formaintaining information about itemset frequency histories. At any time; requests for itemsetsfrequent over user-defined time intervals can be serviced by scanning the maintained FP-stream producing an approximate answer with error guaranteed to be no worse than a user-specified frequency and temporal threshold. We develop an algorithm for constructing andupdating an FP-stream structure and present experiments illustrating the time and spacerequired for maintenance.,Bericht; Indiana University,2003,32
Text Classification with Heterogeneous Information Network Kernels.,Chenguang Wang; Yangqiu Song; Haoran Li; Ming Zhang; Jiawei Han,Abstract Text classification is an important problem with many applications. Traditionalapproaches represent text as a bagof-words and build classifiers based on thisrepresentation. Rather than words; entity phrases; the relations between the entities; as wellas the types of the entities and relations carry much more information to represent the texts.This paper presents a novel text as network classification framework; which introduces 1) astructured and typed heterogeneous information networks (HINs) representation of texts;and 2) a meta-path based approach to link texts. We show that with the new representationand links of texts; the structured and typed information of entities and relations can beincorporated into kernels. Particularly; we develop both simple linear kernel and indefinitekernel based on metapaths in the HIN representation of texts; where we call them HIN …,AAAI,2016,31
Modeling truth existence in truth discovery,Shi Zhi; Bo Zhao; Wenzhu Tong; Jing Gao; Dian Yu; Heng Ji; Jiawei Han,Abstract When integrating information from multiple sources; it is common to encounterconflicting answers to the same question. Truth discovery is to infer the most accurate andcomplete integrated answers from conflicting sources. In some cases; there exist questionsfor which the true answers are excluded from the candidate answers provided by allsources. Without any prior knowledge; these questions; named no-truth questions; aredifficult to be distinguished from the questions that have true answers; named has-truthquestions. In particular; these no-truth questions degrade the precision of the answerintegration system. We address such a challenge by introducing source quality; which ismade up of three fine-grained measures: silent rate; false spoken rate and true spoken rate.By incorporating these three measures; we propose a probabilistic graphical model …,Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2015,31
Etm: Entity topic models for mining documents associated with entities,Hyungsul Kim; Yizhou Sun; Julia Hockenmaier; Jiawei Han,Topic models; which factor each document into different topics and represent each topic as adistribution of terms; have been widely and successfully used to better understandcollections of text documents. However; documents are also associated with furtherinformation; such as the set of real-world entities mentioned in them. For example; newsarticles are usually related to several people; organizations; countries or locations. Sincethose associated entities carry rich information; it is highly desirable to build moreexpressive; entity-based topic models; which can capture the term distributions for eachtopic; each entity; as well as each topic-entity pair. In this paper; we therefore introduce anovel Entity Topic Model (ETM) for documents that are associated with a set of entities.

Trust analysis with clustering,Manish Gupta; Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han,Abstract Web provides rich information about a variety of objects. Trustability is a majorconcern on the web. Truth establishment is an important task so as to provide the rightinformation to the user from the most trustworthy source. Trustworthiness of informationprovider and the confidence of the facts it provides are inter-dependent on each other andhence can be expressed iteratively in terms of each other. However; a single informationprovider may not be the most trustworthy for all kinds of information. Every informationprovider has its own area of competence where it can perform better than others. We derivea model that can evaluate trustability on objects and information providers based on clusters(groups). We propose a method which groups the set of objects for which similar set ofproviders provide" good" facts; and provides better accuracy in addition to high quality …,Proceedings of the 20th international conference companion on World wide web,2011,31
Mining inter-transaction associations with templates,Ling Feng; Hongjun Lu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Jiawei Han,Abstract Multi-dimensional; inter-transaction association rules extend the traditionalassociation rules to describe more general associations among items with multipleproperties cross transactions.“After McDonald and Burger King open branches; KFC willopen a branch two months later and one mile away” is an example of such rules. Since thenumber of potential inter-transaction association rules tends to be extremely large; mininginter-transaction associations poses more challenges on efficient processing than miningintra-transaction associations. In order to make such association mining truly practical andcomputationally tractable; in this study; we present a template model to help users declarethe interesting inter-transaction associations to be mined. With the guidance of templates;several optimization techniques are devised to speed up the discovery of inter-transaction …,Proceedings of the eighth international conference on Information and knowledge management,1999,31
Indexing in spatial databases,Beng Chin Ooi; Ron Sacks-Davis; Jiawei Han,Abstract Spatial information processing has been a focus of research in the past decade. Inspatial databases; data are associated with spatial coordinates and extents; and areretrieved based on spatial proximity. A formidable number of spatial indexes have beenproposed to facilitate spatial data retrieval. In this paper; we examine various spatial indexesproposed in the literature and present a taxonomy on them. Each class of indexingstructures is reviewed in two steps: first; the index structure is described; second; thestrengths and weaknesses are identified. The paper may be used as a guideline indesigning new indexing structures and serves as a basis in determining the suitability of aparticular class of indexes for specific applications.,Unpublished/Technical Papers,1993,31
Automatic construction and ranking of topical keyphrases on collections of short documents,Marina Danilevsky; Chi Wang; Nihit Desai; Xiang Ren; Jingyi Guo; Jiawei Han,Abstract We introduce a framework for topical keyphrase generation and ranking; based onthe output of a topic model run on a collection of short documents. By shifting from theunigramcentric traditional methods of keyphrase extraction and ranking to a phrase-centricapproach; we are able to directly compare and rank phrases of different lengths. Our methoddefines a function to rank topical keyphrases so that more highly ranked keyphrases areconsidered to be more representative phrases for that topic. We study the performance ofour framework on multiple real world document collections; and also show that it is morescalable than comparable phrase-generating models.,*,2014,30

The method adopts the artificialintelligence “learning-from-examples” paradigm and applies in the learning process anattribute-oriented concept tree ascending technique which integrates database operationswith the learning process and provides a simple and efficient way of learning fromdatabases.

The processing and evaluation of transitive closure queries,Jiawei Han; Ghassen Qadah; Chinying Chaou,Abstract A transitive closure operator will be an important new operator in future deductivedatabase systems. We discuss the compilation of recursive rule clusters into formulascontaining transitive closure operations and study three promising algorithms for theprocessing of transitive closure queries: the wavefront algorithm; the δ-wavefront algorithmand the level-relaxed δ-wavefront algorithm. The relative processing efficiency of thesealgorithms are analyzed and compared based on different database structures andaccessing methods. Our study shows that the δ-wavefront algorithm performs consistentlybetter than the wavefront algorithm; and the level-relaxed δ-wavefront algorithm has highpotential of further reducing I/O accessing cost on the databases with clustered derivationpaths.

Inferring human mobility patterns from taxicab location traces,Raghu Ganti; Mudhakar Srivatsa; Anand Ranganathan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Taxicabs equipped with real-time location sensing devices are increasinglybecoming popular. Such location traces are a rich source of information and can be used forcongestion pricing; taxicab placement; and improved city planning. An important problem toenable these application is to identify human mobility patterns from the taxicab traces; whichtranslates to being able to identify pickup and dropoff points for a particular trip. In this paper;we show that while past approaches are effective in detecting hotspots using location traces;they are largely ineffective in identifying trips (pairs of pickup and dropoff points). Wepropose the use of a graph theory concept-stretch factor in a novel manner to identify trip (s)made by a taxicab and show that a Hidden Markov Model based algorithm can identify trips(using real datasets from taxicab deployments in Shanghai and partially simulated …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM international joint conference on Pervasive and ubiquitous computing,2013,29
Large-scale spectral clustering on graphs,Jialu Liu; Chi Wang; Marina Danilevsky; Jiawei Han,Abstract Graph clustering has received growing attention in recent years as an importantanalytical technique; both due to the prevalence of graph data; and the usefulness of graphstructures for exploiting intrinsic data characteristics. However; as graph data grows in scale;it becomes increasingly more challenging to identify clusters. In this paper we propose anefficient clustering algorithm for large-scale graph data using spectral methods. The key ideais to repeatedly generate a small number of" supernodes" connected to the regular nodes; inorder to compress the original graph into a sparse bipartite graph. By clustering the bipartitegraph using spectral methods; we are able to greatly improve efficiency without losingconsiderable clustering power. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness and efficiencyof our approach.,Proceedings of the Twenty-Third international joint conference on Artificial Intelligence,2013,29
Shattering and compressing networks for betweenness centrality,Ahmet Erdem Sariyüce; Erik Saule; Kamer Kaya; Ümit V Çatalyürek,Abstract The betweenness metric has always been intriguing and used in many analyses.Yet; it is one of the most computationally expensive kernels in graph mining. For that reason;making betweenness centrality computations faster is an important and well-studiedproblem. In this work; we propose the framework; BADIOS; which compresses a network andshatters it into pieces so that the centrality computation can be handled independently foreach piece. Although BADIOS is designed and tuned for betweenness centrality; it caneasily be adapted for other centrality metrics. Experimental results show that the proposedtechniques can be a great arsenal to reduce the centrality computation time for various typesand sizes of networks. In particular; it reduces the computation time of a 4.6 million edgesgraph from more than 5 days to less than 16 hours.,*,2013,29
Tweet ranking based on heterogeneous networks,Hongzhao Huang; Arkaitz Zubiaga; Heng Ji; Hongbo Deng; Dong Wang; Hieu Le; Tarek Abdelzaher; Jiawei Han; Alice Leung; John Hancock; Clare Voss,Abstract Ranking tweets is a fundamental task to make it easier to distill the vast amounts ofinformation shared by users. In this paper; we explore the novel idea of ranking tweets on atopic using heterogeneous networks. We construct heterogeneous networks by harnessingcross-genre linkages between tweets and semantically-related web documents from formalgenres; and inferring implicit links between tweets and users. To rank tweets effectively bycapturing the semantics and importance of different linkages; we introduce Tri-HITS; a modelto iteratively propagate ranking scores across heterogeneous networks. We show thatintegrating both formal genre and inferred social networks with tweet networks produces ahigher-quality ranking than the tweet networks alone. 1,Proceedings of COLING 2012,2012,29
Extracting general lists from web documents: A hybrid approach,Fabio Fumarola; Tim Weninger; Rick Barber; Donato Malerba; Jiawei Han,Abstract The problem of extracting structured data (ie lists; record sets; tables; etc.) from theWeb has been traditionally approached by taking into account either the underlying markupstructure of a Web page or the visual structure of the Web page. However; empirical resultsshow that considering the HTML structure and visual cues of a Web page independently donot generalize well. We propose a new hybrid method to extract general lists from the Web. Itemploys both general assumptions on the visual rendering of lists; and the structuralrepresentation of items contained in them.

On effective presentation of graph patterns: a structural representative approach,Chen Chen; Cindy Xide Lin; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han,Abstract In the past; quite a few fast algorithms have been developed to mine frequentpatterns over graph data; with the large spectrum covering many variants of the problem.However; the real bottleneck for knowledge discovery on graphs is neither efficiency norscalability; but the usability of patterns that are mined out. Currently; what the state-of-arttechniques give is a lengthy list of exact patterns; which are undesirable in the following twoaspects:(1) on the micro side; due to various inherent noises or data diversity; exact patternsare usually not too useful in many real applications; and (2) on the macro side; the rigidstructural requirement being posed often generates an excessive amount of patterns that areonly slightly different from each other; which easily overwhelm the users.

Training linear discriminant analysis in linear time,Deng Cai; Xiaofei He; Jiawei Han,Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) has been a popular method for extracting features whichpreserve class separability. It has been widely used in many fields of information processing;such as machine learning; data mining; information retrieval; and pattern recognition.However; the computation of LDA involves dense matrices eigen-decomposition which canbe computationally expensive both in time and memory. Specifically; LDA has O (mnt+ t 3)time complexity and requires O (mn+ mt+ nt) memory; where m is the number of samples; nis the number of features and t= min (m; n). When both m and n are large; it is infeasible toapply LDA. In this paper; we propose a novel algorithm for discriminant analysis; calledSpectral Regression Discriminant Analysis (SRDA).

To build effectiveindices; a novel method; called SeqIndex; is proposed; in which the selection of indices isbased on the analysis of discriminative; frequent sequential patterns mined from largesequence databases. Such an analysis leads to the construction of compact and effectiveindexing structures. Furthermore; we eliminate the requirement of setting an optimal supportthreshold beforehand; which is difficult for users to provide in practice.

Efficient multi-relational classification by tuple id propagation,Xiaoxin Yin; Jiawei Han; Jiong Yang,Abstract. Most of today's structured data is stored in relational databases. In contrast; mostclassification approaches only apply on single “flat” data relations. And it is usually difficult toconvert multiple relations into a single flat relation without losing essential information.Inductive Logic Programming approaches have proven effective with high accuracy in multi-relational classification. Unfortunately; they usually suffer from poor scalability with respect tothe number of relations and the number of attributes in the database. In this paper wepropose CrossMine; an efficient and scalable approach for multirelational classification. Ituses a novel method tuple ID propagation to perform virtual joins; so as to achieve highclassification accuracy and high efficiency on databases with complex schemas. We presentexperimental results on two real datasets to show the performance of our approach.,Proceedings of the KDD-2003 Workshop on Multi-Relational Data Mining,2003,29

Traditional approaches that target similar problems only take as input thediscrete label information from individual sensors that observe the same events. Differentfrom them; our proposed GDA framework is able to take advantage of the confidenceinformation of each sensor about its decision; and thus achieves higher decision accuracy.Targeting generalized problem domains; our framework can naturally handle the scenarioswhere different sensor nodes observe different sets of events whose numbers of possibleclasses may also be different.

Meta-path-based search and mining in heterogeneous information networks,Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han,Information networks that can be extracted from many domains are widely studied recently.Different functions for mining these networks are proposed and developed; such as ranking;community detection; and link prediction. Most existing network studies are onhomogeneous networks; where nodes and links are assumed from one single type. Inreality; however; heterogeneous information networks can better model the real-worldsystems; which are typically semi-structured and typed; following a network schema. In orderto mine these heterogeneous information networks directly; we propose to explore the metastructure of the information network; ie; the network schema. The concepts of meta-paths areproposed to systematically capture numerous semantic relationships across multiple typesof objects; which are defined as a path over the graph of network schema.

Locally discriminative coclustering,Lijun Zhang; Chun Chen; Jiajun Bu; Zhengguang Chen; Deng Cai; Jiawei Han,Different from traditional one-sided clustering techniques; coclustering makes use of theduality between samples and features to partition them simultaneously. Most of the existingco-clustering algorithms focus on modeling the relationship between samples and features;whereas the intersample and interfeature relationships are ignored. In this paper; wepropose a novel coclustering algorithm named Locally Discriminative Coclustering (LDCC)to explore the relationship between samples and features as well as the intersample andinterfeature relationships. Specifically; the sample-feature relationship is modeled by abipartite graph between samples and features. And we apply local linear regression todiscovering the intrinsic discriminative structures of both sample space and feature space.For each local patch in the sample and feature spaces; a local linear function is estimated …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,28

Unfortunately the existing implementationof aggregation operations on relational databases does not guarantee superior performancein network space; especially when it involves edge traversals and joins of gigantic tables. Inthis paper; we investigate the neighborhood aggregation queries: Find nodes that have top-k highest aggregate values over their h-hop neighbors. While these basic queries arecommon in a wide range of search and recommendation tasks; surprisingly they have notbeen studied systematically. We developed a Local Neighborhood Aggregation …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,28
On clustering massive data streams: a summarization paradigm,Charu C Aggarwal; Jiawei Han; Jianyong Wang; S Yu Philip,Abstract In recent years; data streams have become ubiquitous because of the large numberof applications which generate huge volumes of data in an automated way. Many existingdata mining methods cannot be applied directly on data streams because of the fact that thedata needs to be mined in one pass. Furthermore; data streams show a considerableamount of temporal locality because of which a direct application of the existing methodsmay lead to misleading results. In this paper; we develop an efficient and effective approachfor mining fast evolving data streams; which integrates the micro-clustering technique withthe high-level data mining process; and discovers data evolution regularities as well. Ouranalysis and experiments demonstrate two important data mining problems; namely streamclustering and stream classification; can be performed effectively using this approach …,*,2007,28
Classification of recursive formulas in deductive databases,Cheong Youn; Lawrence J Henschen; Jiawei Han,Abstract In this paper; we present results on the classification of linear recursive formulas indeductive databases and apply those results to the compilation and optimization of recursivequeries. We also introduce compiled formulas and query evaluation plans for arepresentative query for each of these classes. To explain general recursive formulas; weuse a graph model that shows the connectivity between variables. The connecticity betweenvariables is the most critical part in processing recursive formulas. We demonstrate thatbased on such a graph model all the linear recursive formulas can be classified into severalclasses and each class shares some common characteristics in compilation and queryprocessing. The compiled formulas and the corresponding query evaluation plans can bederived based on the study of the compilation of each class.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1988,28
Semantic query optimization in recursive databases,Sanggoo Lee; Jiawei Han,Semantic query optimization is the process of using semantic knowledge expressed in theform of integrity constraints to transform a query into a semantically equivalent one; one thatis thought to be less expensive to process. The authors analyze the possibilities of semanticoptimization in a deductive database that includes recursive relations and; consequently;integrity constraints that include recursive literals. They propose a compiled approach toutilizing semantic knowledge in recursive query processing; assuming recursive queries areprocessed using compiled iterative methods. Also; a method of residue propagation forobtaining implied constraints that are often useful in optimization is presented.,Data Engineering; 1988. Proceedings.

Label noise reduction in entity typing by heterogeneous partial-label embedding,Xiang Ren; Wenqi He; Meng Qu; Clare R Voss; Heng Ji; Jiawei Han,Abstract Current systems of fine-grained entity typing use distant supervision in conjunctionwith existing knowledge bases to assign categories (type labels) to entity mentions.However; the type labels so obtained from knowledge bases are often noisy (ie; incorrect forthe entity mention's local context). We define a new task; Label Noise Reduction in EntityTyping (LNR); to be the automatic identification of correct type labels (type-paths) for trainingexamples; given the set of candidate type labels obtained by distant supervision with a giventype hierarchy. The unknown type labels for individual entity mentions and the semanticsimilarity between entity types pose unique challenges for solving the LNR task. We proposea general framework; called PLE; to jointly embed entity mentions; text features and entitytypes into the same low-dimensional space where; in that space; objects whose types are …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2016,27
Incorporating world knowledge to document clustering via heterogeneous information networks,Chenguang Wang; Yangqiu Song; Ahmed El-Kishky; Dan Roth; Ming Zhang; Jiawei Han,Abstract One of the key obstacles in making learning protocols realistic in applications is theneed to supervise them; a costly process that often requires hiring domain experts. Weconsider the framework to use the world knowledge as indirect supervision. Worldknowledge is general-purpose knowledge; which is not designed for any specific domain.Then the key challenges are how to adapt the world knowledge to domains and how torepresent it for learning. In this paper; we provide an example of using world knowledge fordomain dependent document clustering. We provide three ways to specify the worldknowledge to domains by resolving the ambiguity of the entities and their types; andrepresent the data with world knowledge as a heterogeneous information network. Then wepropose a clustering algorithm that can cluster multiple types and incorporate the sub …,Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2015,27
Co-evolution of multi-typed objects in dynamic star networks,Yizhou Sun; Jie Tang; Jiawei Han; Cheng Chen; Manish Gupta,Mining network evolution has emerged as an intriguing research topic in many domainssuch as data mining; social networks; and machine learning. While a bulk of research hasfocused on mining evolutionary patterns of homogeneous networks (eg; networks of friends);however; most real-world networks are heterogeneous; containing objects of different types;such as authors; papers; venues; and terms in a bibliographic network. Modeling co-evolution of multityped objects can capture richer information than that on single-typedobjects alone. For example; studying co-evolution of authors; venues; and terms in abibliographic network can tell better the evolution of research areas than just examining co-author network or term network alone. In this paper; we study mining co-evolution ofmultityped objects in a special type of heterogeneous networks; called star networks; and …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,27
Patent maintenance recommendation with patent information network model,Xin Jin; Scott Spangler; Ying Chen; Keke Cai; Rui Ma; Li Zhang; Xian Wu; Jiawei Han,Patents are of crucial importance for businesses; because they provide legal protection forthe invented techniques; processes or products. A patent can be held for up to 20 years.However; large maintenance fees need to be paid to keep it enforceable. If the patent isdeemed not valuable; the owner may decide to abandon it by stopping paying themaintenance fees to reduce the cost. For large companies or organizations; making suchdecisions is difficult because too many patents need to be investigated. In this paper; weintroduce the new patent mining problem of automatic patent maintenance prediction; andpropose a systematic solution to analyze patents for recommending patent maintenancedecision. We model the patents as a heterogeneous time-evolving information network andpropose new patent features to build model for a ranked prediction on whether to …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on,2011,27
On link-based similarity join,Liwen Sun; CK Cheng; Xiang Li; DWL Cheung; Jiawei Han,Graphs can be found in applications like social networks; bibliographic networks; andbiological databases. Understanding the relationship; or links; among graph nodes enablesapplications such as link prediction; recommendation; and spam detection. In this paper; wepropose link-based similarity join (LS-join); which extends the similarity join operator to link-based measures. Given two sets of nodes in a graph; the LS-join returns all pairs of nodesthat are highly similar to each other; with respect to an e-function. The e-function generalizescommon measures like Personalized PageRank (PPR) and SimRank (SR). We study anefficient LS-join algorithm on a large graph. We further improve our solutions for PPR andSR; which involve expensive randomwalk operations. We validate our solutions byperforming extensive experiments on three real graph datasets.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,27
An overview of social tagging and applications,Manish Gupta; Rui Li; Zhijun Yin; Jiawei Han,Abstract Social tagging on online portals has become a trend now. It has emerged as one ofthe best ways of associating metadata with web objects. With the increase in the kinds ofweb objects becoming available; collaborative tagging of such objects is also developingalong new dimensions. This popularity has led to a vast literature on social tagging. In thissurvey paper; we would like to summarize different techniques employed to study variousaspects of tagging. Broadly; we would discuss about properties of tag streams; taggingmodels; tag semantics; generating recommendations using tags; visualizations of tags;applications of tags; integration of different tagging systems and problems associated withtagging usage. We would discuss topics like why people tag; what influences the choice oftags; how to model the tagging process; kinds of tags; different power laws observed in …,*,2011,27
Ndpmine: Efficiently mining discriminative numerical features for pattern-based classification,Hyungsul Kim; Sangkyum Kim; Tim Weninger; Jiawei Han; Tarek Abdelzaher,Abstract Pattern-based classification has demonstrated its power in recent studies; butbecause the cost of mining discriminative patterns as features in classification is veryexpensive; several efficient algorithms have been proposed to rectify this problem. Thesealgorithms assume that feature values of the mined patterns are binary; ie; a pattern eitherexists or not. In some problems; however; the number of times a pattern appears is moreinformative than whether a pattern appears or not. To resolve these deficiencies; wepropose a mathematical programming method that directly mines discriminative patterns asnumerical features for classification. We also propose a novel search space shrinkingtechnique which addresses the inefficiencies in iterative pattern mining algorithms. Finally;we show that our method is an order of magnitude faster; significantly more memory …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2010,27

Collaborative filtering with entity similarity regularization in heterogeneous information networks,Xiao Yu; Xiang Ren; Quanquan Gu; Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han,Abstract Researchers have been studying hybrid recommender systems which combineuser-item rating data with external information in recent years. Some studies suggest that byleveraging additional user and/or item relations; eg; social network; the performance of therecommendation models can be improved. These studies; nevertheless; mostly utilize asingle type of external relationship. Considering the heterogeneity of real-world applications;we propose to position the well-studied recommendation problem in a heterogeneousinformation network context and attempt to incorporate different recommendation factors. Wediscuss how heterogeneous information network can benefit recommender systems andthen propose a matrix factorization based unified recommendation model to take advantageof both rating data and the related information network.

Authorship classification: a discriminative syntactic tree mining approach,Sangkyum Kim; Hyungsul Kim; Tim Weninger; Jiawei Han; Hyun Duk Kim,Abstract In the past; there have been dozens of studies on automatic authorshipclassification; and many of these studies concluded that the writing style is one of the bestindicators for original authorship. From among the hundreds of features which weredeveloped; syntactic features were best able to reflect an author's writing style. However;due to the high computational complexity for extracting and computing syntactic features;only simple variations of basic syntactic features such as function words; POS (Part ofSpeech) tags; and rewrite rules were considered. In this paper; we propose a new featureset of k-embedded-edge subtree patterns that holds more syntactic information thanprevious feature sets. We also propose a novel approach to directly mining them from agiven set of syntactic trees. We show that this approach reduces the computational …,Proceedings of the 34th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in Information Retrieval,2011,26
A systematic study of failure proximity,Chao Liu; Xiangyu Zhang; Jiawei Han,Software end-users are the best testers; who keep revealing bugs in software that hasundergone rigorous in-house testing. In order to leverage their testing efforts; failurereporting components have been widely deployed in released software. Many utilities of thecollected failure data depend on an effective failure indexing technique; which; at theoptimal case; would index all failures due to the same bug together. Unfortunately; theproblem of failure proximity; which underpins the effectiveness of an indexing technique; hasnot been systematically studied. This article presents the first systematic study of failureproximity. A failure proximity consists of two components: a fingerprinting function thatextracts signatures from failures; and a distance function that calculates the likelihood of twofailures being due to the same bug. By considering different instantiations of the two …,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,2008,26
Bibnetminer: mining bibliographic information networks,Yizhou Sun; Tianyi Wu; Zhijun Yin; Hong Cheng; Jiawei Han; Xiaoxin Yin; Peixiang Zhao,Abstract Online bibliographic databases; such as DBLP in computer science and PubMed inmedical sciences; contain abundant information about research publications in differentfields. Each such database forms a gigantic information network (hence called BibNet);connecting in complex ways research papers; authors; conferences/journals; and possiblycitation information as well; and provides a fertile land for information network analysis.

CISpan: comprehensive incremental mining algorithms of closed sequential patterns for multi-versional software mining,Ding Yuan; Kyuhyung Lee; Hong Cheng; Gopal Krishna; Zhenmin Li; Xiao Ma; Yuanyuan Zhou; Jiawei Han,Abstract Recently; frequent sequential pattern mining algorithms have been widely used insoftware engineering field to mine various source code or specification patterns. In practice;software evolves from one version to another in its life span. The effort of mining frequentsequential patterns across multiple versions of a software can be substantially reduced byefficient incremental mining. This problem is challenging in this domain since the databasesare usually updated in all kinds of manners including insertion; various modifications as wellas removal of sequences. Also; different mining tools may have various mining constraints;such as low minimum support. None of the existing work can be applied effectively due tovarious limitations of such work. For example; our recent work; IncSpan; failed solving theproblem because it could neither handle low minimum support nor removal of sequences …,*,2008,26

How bayesians debug,Chao Liu; Zeng Lian; Jiawei Han,Manual debugging is expensive. And the high cost has motivated extensive research onautomated fault localization in both software engineering and data mining communities.Fault localization aims at automatically locating likely fault locations; and hence assistsmanual debugging. A number of fault localization algorithms have been developed in recentyears; which prove effective when multiple failing and passing cases are available.However; we notice what is more commonly encountered in practice is the two-sampledebugging problem; where only one failing and one passing cases are available. Thisproblem has been either overlooked or insufficiently tackled in previous studies. In thispaper; we develop a new fault localization algorithm; named BayesDebug; which simulatessome manual debugging principles through a Bayesian approach.

Olap mining: an Integration of olap with data mining,Jiawei Han,Abstract OLAP mining is a mechanism which integrates on-line analytical processing(OLAP) with data mining so that mining can be performed in different portions of databasesor data warehouses and at different levels of abstraction at user's finger tips. With rapiddevelopments of data warehouse and OLAP technologies in database industry; it ispromising to develop OLAP mining mechanisms. With our years of research into datamining; an OLAP-based data mining system; DBMiner; has been developed; where OLAPmining is not only for data characterization but also for other data mining functions; includingassociation; classification; prediction; clustering; and sequencing. Such an integrationincreases the flexibility of mining and helps users find desired knowledge. In this paper; weintroduce the concept of OLAP mining and discuss how OLAP mining should be …,*,1998,26
Network a/b testing: From sampling to estimation,Huan Gui; Ya Xu; Anmol Bhasin; Jiawei Han,Abstract A/B testing; also known as bucket testing; split testing; or controlled experiment; is astandard way to evaluate user engagement or satisfaction from a new service; feature; orproduct. It is widely used in online websites; including social network sites such asFacebook; LinkedIn; and Twitter to make data-driven decisions. The goal of A/B testing is toestimate the treatment effect of a new change; which becomes intricate when users areinteracting; ie; the treatment effect of a user may spill over to other users via underlyingsocial connections. When conducting these online controlled experiments; it is a commonpractice to make the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) that each individual'sresponse is affected by their own treatment only. Though this assumption simplifies theestimation of treatment effect; it does not hold when network interference is present; and …,Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web,2015,25
Community distribution outlier detection in heterogeneous information networks,Manish Gupta; Jing Gao; Jiawei Han,Abstract Heterogeneous networks are ubiquitous. For example; bibliographic data; socialdata; medical records; movie data and many more can be modeled as heterogeneousnetworks. Rich information associated with multi-typed nodes in heterogeneous networksmotivates us to propose a new definition of outliers; which is different from those defined forhomogeneous networks. In this paper; we propose the novel concept of CommunityDistribution Outliers (CDOutliers) for heterogeneous information networks; which are definedas objects whose community distribution does not follow any of the popular communitydistribution patterns. We extract such outliers using a type-aware joint analysis of multipletypes of objects. Given community membership matrices for all types of objects; we follow aniterative two-stage approach which performs pattern discovery and outlier detection in a …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2013,25

In this paper; we aim tosupport keyword search in a data cube with text-rich dimension (s)(so-called text cube).Each document is associated with structural dimensions. A cell in the text cube aggregates aset of documents with matching dimension values on a subset of dimensions. Given akeyword query; our goal is to find the top-k most relevant cells in the text cube. We propose arelevance scoring model and efficient ranking algorithms.

Semantic annotation of frequent patterns,Qiaozhu Mei; Dong Xin; Hong Cheng; Jiawei Han; Chengxiang Zhai,Abstract Using frequent patterns to analyze data has been one of the fundamentalapproaches in many data mining applications. Research in frequent pattern mining has sofar mostly focused on developing efficient algorithms to discover various kinds of frequentpatterns; but little attention has been paid to the important next step—interpreting thediscovered frequent patterns. Although the compression and summarization of frequentpatterns has been studied in some recent work; the proposed techniques there can onlyannotate a frequent pattern with nonsemantical information (eg; support); which providesonly limited help for a user to understand the patterns.

Inferring the diffusion and evolution of topics in social communities,C Lin; Qiaozhu Mei; Yunliang Jiang; Jiawei Han; Shanxiang Qi,ABSTRACT The prevailing of Web 2.0 techniques has led to the boom of various onlinecommunities; where topics are spreading ubiquitously among user-generated documents.Together with this diffusion process is the content evolution of the topics; where novelcontents are introduced in by documents which adopt the topic. Unlike an explicit userbehavior (eg; buying a DVD); both the diffusion paths and the evolutionary process of a topicare implicit; making them much more challenging to be discovered. In this paper; we aim tosimultaneously track the evolution of any arbitrary topic and reveal the latent diffusion pathsof that topic in a social community. A novel and principled probabilistic model is proposedwhich casts our task as an joint inference problem; taking into consideration of textualdocuments; social influences; and topic evolution in a unified way.

Arcube: supporting ranking aggregate queries in partially materialized data cubes,Tianyi Wu; Dong Xin; Jiawei Han,Abstract Supporting ranking queries in database systems has been a popular research topicrecently. However; there is a lack of study on supporting ranking queries in data warehouseswhere ranking is on multidimensional aggregates instead of on measures of base facts. Toaddress this problem; we propose a query execution model to answer different types ofranking aggregate queries based on a unified; partial cube structure; ARCube. The queryexecution model follows a candidate generation and verification framework; where the mostpromising candidate cells are generated using a set of high-level guiding cells. We alsoidentify a bounding principle for effective pruning: once a guiding cell is pruned; all of itschildren candidate cells can be pruned.

Our method applies anattribute-oriented generalization technique which utilizes the knowledge about dataconcepts; integrates a data classification process with relational operations; and provides anefficient way for classification of data in relational databases. The characteristics of eachclass can be extracted automatically in the classification process. Moreover; quantitativeinformation can be registered in the generalization process to assist the classification of …,1991 AAAI Workshop on Knowledge Discovery in Databases,1991,24
Gmove: Group-level mobility modeling using geo-tagged social media,Chao Zhang; Keyang Zhang; Quan Yuan; Luming Zhang; Tim Hanratty; Jiawei Han,Abstract Understanding human mobility is of great importance to various applications; suchas urban planning; traffic scheduling; and location prediction. While there has been fruitfulresearch on modeling human mobility using tracking data (eg; GPS traces); the recentgrowth of geo-tagged social media (GeoSM) brings new opportunities to this task because ofits sheer size and multi-dimensional nature. Nevertheless; how to obtain quality mobilitymodels from the highly sparse and complex GeoSM data remains a challenge that cannotbe readily addressed by existing techniques.

Knowsim: A document similarity measure on structured heterogeneous information networks,Chenguang Wang; Yangqiu Song; Haoran Li; Ming Zhang; Jiawei Han,As a fundamental task; document similarity measure has broad impact to document-basedclassification; clustering and ranking. Traditional approaches represent documents as bag-of-words and compute document similarities using measures like cosine; Jaccard; and dice.However; entity phrases rather than single words in documents can be critical for evaluatingdocument relatedness. Moreover; types of entities and links between entities/words are alsoinformative. We propose a method to represent a document as a typed heterogeneousinformation network (HIN); where the entities and relations are annotated with types. Multipledocuments can be linked by the words and entities in the HIN. Consequently; we convert thedocument similarity problem to a graph distance problem. Intuitively; there could be multiplepaths between a pair of documents. We propose to use the meta-path defined in HIN to …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,23
Disiclass: discriminative frequent pattern-based image classification,Sangkyum Kim; Xin Jin; Jiawei Han,Abstract Owing to the rapid mounting of massive image data; image classification hasattracted lots of research efforts. Several diverse research disciplines have been confluenton this important theme; looking for more powerful solutions. In this paper; we propose anovel image representation method B2S (Bag to Set) that keeps all frequency informationand is more discriminative than traditional histogram based bag representation. Based onB2S; we construct two different image classification approaches. First; we apply B2S to astate-of-the-art image classification algorithm SPM in computer vision. Second; we design aframework DisIClass (Discriminative Frequent Pattern-Based Image Classification) to utilizedata mining algorithms to classify images; which was hardly done before due to the intrinsicdifferences between the data of computer vision and data mining fields.

Using data cubes for metarule-guided mining of multi-dimensional association rules,Micheline Kamber; Jiawei Han; Jenny Y Chiang,Abstract Metarule-guided mining is an interactive approach to data mining; where usersprobe the data under analysis by specifying hypotheses in the form of metarules; or patterntemplates. Previous methods for metarule-guided mining of association rules have primarilyused a transaction/relation table-based structure. Such approaches require costly; multiplescans of the data in order to nd all the large itemsets. In this paper; we employ a novelapproach to metaruleguided; multi-dimensional association rule mining which explores adata cube structure. We propose algorithms for metarule-guided mining using di erent cubestructures: given a metarule containing p predicates; we compare mining on an n-dimensional cube structure (where p< n) with mining on smaller multiple p-dimensionalcubes. In addition; we propose an e cient method for precomputing the cube; which takes …,Techical Report CS-TR,1997,23
Index nesting–an efficient approach to indexing in object-oriented databases,Beng Chin Ooi; Jiawei Han; Hongjun Lu; Kian Lee Tan,Abstract. In object-oriented database systems where the concept of the superclass-subclassis supported; an instance of a subclass is also an instance of its superclass. Consequently;the access scope of a query against a class in general includes the access scope of all itssubclasses; unless specified otherwise. An index to support superclass-subclassrelationship efficiently must provide efficient associative retrievals of objects from a singleclass or from several classes in a class hierarchy. This paper presents an efficient indexcalled the hierarchical tree (the H-tree). For each class; an H-tree is maintained; allowingefficient search on a single class. These H-trees are appropriately linked to capture thesuperclass-subclass relationships; thus allowing efficient retrievals of instances from a classhierarchy. Both experimental and analytical results indicate that the H-tree is an efficient …,The VLDB Journal,1996,23
Classification and compilation of linear recursive queries in deductive databases,Cheong Youn; H-J Kim; Lawrence J.  Henschen; Jiawei Han,The authors present a graph model which is powerful in classifying and compiling linearrecursive formulas in deductive databases. The graph model consists of two kinds of graphs:I-graph and resolution graph. Essential properties of a recursive formula can be extractedfrom its I-graph; and the compiled formula and the query evaluation plan of the recursiveformulas can be determined from its resolution graph. It is demonstrated that based on thegraph model all the linear recursive formulas can be classified into a taxonomy of classesand each class shares common characteristics in query compilation and query processing.The compiled formulas and the corresponding query evaluation plans can be derived basedon the study of the compilation of each class.,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,1992,23
Constraint-based reasoning in deductive databases,Jiawei Han,Constraint-based reasoning in deductive databases is studied; with the focus on set-oriented; constraint-based processing of functional linear recursions. A technique isdeveloped which compiles a functional linear recursion into chain or bounded forms andanalyzes efficient processing of the compiled chains based on different kinds of constraints.It is shown that rule constraints should be compiled together with the rectified recursions;finiteness constraints and monotonicity constraints should be used in the analysis of finiteevaluability and termination; and query constraints should be pushed into the compiledchains; when possible; for efficient set-oriented evaluation. Constraint-based processing canbe enhanced by dynamic constraint enforcement in query evaluation. The method isillustrated using a typical traversal recursion problem. It is concluded that the principles …,Data Engineering; 1991. Proceedings. Seventh International Conference on,1991,23
Regions; periods; activities: Uncovering urban dynamics via cross-modal representation learning,Chao Zhang; Keyang Zhang; Quan Yuan; Haoruo Peng; Yu Zheng; Tim Hanratty; Shaowen Wang; Jiawei Han,Abstract With the ever-increasing urbanization process; systematically modeling people'sactivities in the urban space is being recognized as a crucial socioeconomic task. This taskwas nearly impossible years ago due to the lack of reliable data sources; yet the emergenceof geo-tagged social media (GTSM) data sheds new light on it. Recently; there have beenfruitful studies on discovering geographical topics from GTSM data. However; their highcomputational costs and strong distributional assumptions about the latent topics hinderthem from fully unleashing the power of GTSM. To bridge the gap; we present CrossMap; anovel cross-modal representation learning method that uncovers urban dynamics withmassive GTSM data. CrossMap first employs an accelerated mode seeking procedure todetect spatiotemporal hotspots underlying people's activities.

Mining trajectory data and geotagged data in social media for road map inference,Jun Li; Qiming Qin; Jiawei Han; Lu‐An Tang; Kin Hou Lei,Abstract As mapping is costly and labor-intensive work; government mapping agencies areless and less willing to absorb these costs. In order to reduce the updating cycle and cost;researchers have started to use user generated content (UGC) for updating road maps;however; the existing methods either rely heavily on manual labor or cannot extract enoughinformation for road maps. In view of the above problems; this article proposes a UGC-basedautomatic road map inference method. In this method; data mining techniques and naturallanguage processing tools are applied to trajectory data and geotagged data in social mediato extract not only spatial information–the location of the road network–but also attributeinformation–road class and road name–in an effort to create a complete road map.

Towards active learning on graphs: An error bound minimization approach,Quanquan Gu; Jiawei Han,Active learning on graphs has received increasing interest in the past years. In this paper;we propose a\textit {nonadaptive} active learning approach on graphs; based ongeneralization error bound minimization. In particular; we present a data-dependent errorbound for a graph-based learning method; namely learning with local and globalconsistency (LLGC). We show that the empirical transductive Rademacher complexity of thefunction class for LLGC provides a natural criterion for active learning. The resulting activelearning approach is to select a subset of nodes on a graph such that the empiricaltransductive Rademacher complexity of LLGC is minimized. We propose a simple yeteffective sequential optimization algorithm to solve it.

A simple algorithm for semi-supervised learning with improved generalization error bound,Ming Ji; Tianbao Yang; Binbin Lin; Rong Jin; Jiawei Han,Abstract: In this work; we develop a simple algorithm for semi-supervised regression. Thekey idea is to use the top eigenfunctions of integral operator derived from both labeled andunlabeled examples as the basis functions and learn the prediction function by a simplelinear regression. We show that under appropriate assumptions about the integral operator;this approach is able to achieve an improved regression error bound better than existingbounds of supervised learning. We also verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm byan empirical study.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1206.6412,2012,22
Hierarchical aggregate classification with limited supervision for data reduction in wireless sensor networks,Lu Su; Jing Gao; Yong Yang; Tarek F Abdelzaher; Bolin Ding; Jiawei Han,Abstract The main challenge of designing classification algorithms for sensor networks is thelack of labeled sensory data; due to the high cost of manual labeling in the harsh localeswhere a sensor network is normally deployed. Moreover; delivering all the sensory data tothe sink would cost enormous energy. Therefore; although some classification techniquescan deal with limited label information; they cannot be directly applied to sensor networkssince they are designed for centralized databases. To address these challenges; wepropose a hierarchical aggregate classification (HAC) protocol which can reduce theamount of data sent by each node while achieving accurate classification in the face ofinsufficient label information. In this protocol; each sensor node locally makes clusteranalysis and forwards only its decision to the parent node. The decisions are aggregated …,Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems,2011,22
Collection-based sparse label propagation and its application on social group suggestion from photos,Jie Yu; Xin Jin; Jiawei Han; Jiebo Luo,Abstract Online social network services pose great opportunities and challenges for manyresearch areas. In multimedia content analysis; automatic social group recommendation forimages holds the promise to expand one's social network through media sharing. However;most existing techniques cannot generate satisfactory social group suggestions when theimages are classified independently. In this article; we present novel methods to produceaccurate suggestions of suitable social groups from a user's personal photo collection. First;an automatic clustering process is designed to estimate the group similarities; select theoptimal number of clusters and categorize the social groups. Both visual content and textualannotations are integrated to generate initial predictions of the group categories for theimages. Next; the relationship among images in a user's collection is modeled as a …,ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST),2011,22
Filtering and refinement: A two-stage approach for efficient and effective anomaly detection,Xiao Yu; Lu An Tang; Jiawei Han,Anomaly detection is an important data mining task. Most existing methods treat anomaliesas inconsistencies and spend the majority amount of time on modeling normal instances. Arecently proposed; sampling-based approach may substantially boost the efficiency inanomaly detection but may also lead to weaker accuracy and robustness. In this study; wepropose a two-stage approach to find anomalies in complex datasets with high accuracy aswell as low time complexity and space cost. Instead of analyzing normal instances; ouralgorithm first employs an efficient deterministic space partition algorithm to eliminateobvious normal instances and generates a small set of anomaly candidates with a singlescan of the dataset. It then checks each candidate with density-based multiple criteria todetermine the final results. This two-stage framework also detects anomalies of different …,Data Mining; 2009. ICDM'09.

Peer to peer botnet detection for cyber-security: a data mining approach,Mohammad M Masud; Jing Gao; Latifur Khan; Jiawei Han; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract Botnet is a network of compromised hosts or bots; under the control of a humanattacker known as the botmaster [7; 8]. Botnets are used to perform malicious actions; suchas launching DDoS attacks; sending spam or phishing emails and so on. Thus; botnets haveemerged as a threat to internet community. Peer to Peer (P2P) is a relatively newarchitecture of botnets [4]. These botnets are distributed; and small. So; they are difficult tolocate and destroy. Most of the recent works in P2P botnet are in the analysis phase [4; 5; 6].On the contrary; our work is aimed at detecting P2P botnets using network traffic mining.Network traffic can be considered as an infinite data stream. So; our data mining approach isspecialized for mining stream data. There are two major problems related to stream dataclassification.

P-cube: Answering preference queries in multi-dimensional space,Dong Xin; Jiawei Han,Many new applications that involve decision making need online (ie; OLAP-styled)preference analysis with multi-dimensional boolean selections. Typical preference queriesincludes top-k queries and skyline queries. An analytical query often comes with a set ofboolean predicates that constrain a target subset of data; which; may also vary incrementallyby drilling/rolling operators. To efficiently support preference queries with multiple booleanpredicates; neither boolean-then-preference nor preference-then-boolean approach issatisfactory. To integrate boolean pruning and preference pruning in a unified framework;we propose signature; a new materialization measure for multi-dimensional group-bys.Based on this; we propose P-Cube (ie; data cube for preference queries) and study itscomplete life cycle; including signature generation; compression; decomposition …,Data Engineering; 2008.

Discovery of data evolution regularities in large databases,Jiawei Han; Yandong Cai; Nick Cercone; Yue Huang,Abstract. A large volume of concrete data may change over time in a database. It is importantto catch the general trend of such changes and find data evolution (changing) regularities indatabases in many applications. Because of the large volume of data; data evolutionregularity cannot be simply expressed by enumeration of actual data. Machine learningtechnology should be adopted to extract such regularities in databases. This paperdescribes an attribute-oriented induction technique for discovery of data evolutionregularities in relational databases. The technique extracts characteristic rules; discriminantrules; and the trends of data evolution in an evolving database; where a characteristic rulesummarizes the characteristics of a set of evolving data; a discriminant rule distinguishes thegeneral properties of a set of evolving data from a set of contrasting data; and the third …,Journal of Computer and Software Engineering (a special issue on methodologies and tools for intelligent information systems);(to appear),1993,22
Efficient access methods in deductive and object-oriented databases,Chee Chin Low; Hongjun Lu; Beng Chin Ooi; Jiawei Han,Abstract Recently; a new access method; the Hierarchical-Tree (H-tree) was proposed as anefficient access method for object-oriented database that supports superclass-subclassrelationship. We show that; the H-tree indexing scheme is indeed a general access methodfor the new generation DBMS that most probably will support the object-oriented conceptand have the deductive capability. The simplest form of the H-tree; like the widely used B+-tree; can be used to index simple objects for efficient associative search. Its nestingcapability provides efficient support to different types of queries that reference objects insuperclass-subclass hierarchy. Furthermore; by dynamically nesting the indexes to theobjects generated iteratively during recursive query processing; it also supports the leastfixed point computation in object-oriented database with deductive capability.

Local learning for mining outlier subgraphs from network datasets,Manish Gupta; Arun Mallya; Subhro Roy; Jason HD Cho; Jiawei Han,Abstract In the real world; various systems can be modeled using entity-relationship graphs.Given such a graph; one may be interested in identifying suspicious or anomaloussubgraphs. Specifically; a user may want to identify suspicious subgraphs matching a querytemplate. A subgraph can be defined as anomalous based on the connectivity structurewithin itself as well as with its neighborhood. For example for a co-authorship network; givena subgraph containing three authors; one expects all three authors to be say data miningauthors. Also; one expects the neighborhood to mostly consist of data mining authors. But a3-author clique of data mining authors with all theory authors in the neighborhood clearlyseems interesting. Similarly; having one of the authors in the clique as a theory author whenall other authors (both in the clique and neighborhood) are data mining authors; is also …,*,2014,21
Heterogeneous graph-based intent learning with queries; web pages and wikipedia concepts,Xiang Ren; Yujing Wang; Xiao Yu; Jun Yan; Zheng Chen; Jiawei Han,Abstract The problem of learning user search intents has attracted intensive attention fromboth industry and academia. However; state-of-the-art intent learning algorithms suffer fromdifferent drawbacks when only using a single type of data source. For example; query texthas difficulty in distinguishing ambiguous queries; search log is bias to the order of searchresults and users' noisy click behaviors. In this work; we for the first time leverage three typesof objects; namely queries; web pages and Wikipedia concepts collaboratively for learninggeneric search intents and construct a heterogeneous graph to represent multiple types ofrelationships between them. A novel unsupervised method called heterogeneous graph-based soft-clustering is developed to derive an intent indicator for each object based on theconstructed heterogeneous graph.

Mining flipping correlations from large datasets with taxonomies,Marina Barsky; Sangkyum Kim; Tim Weninger; Jiawei Han,Abstract In this paper we introduce a new type of pattern--a flipping correlation pattern. Theflipping patterns are obtained from contrasting the correlations between items at differentlevels of abstraction. They represent surprising correlations; both positive and negative;which are specific for a given abstraction level; and which" flip" from positive to negative andvice versa when items are generalized to a higher level of abstraction. We design anefficient algorithm for finding flipping correlations; the Flipper algorithm; which outperformsnaïve pattern mining methods by several orders of magnitude. We apply Flipper to real-lifedatasets and show that the discovered patterns are non-redundant; surprising andactionable. Flipper finds strong contrasting correlations in itemsets with low-to-mediumsupport; while existing techniques cannot handle the pattern discovery in this frequency …,Proceedings of the VLDB endowment,2011,21

Participatory sensing; whereusers proactively document and share their observations; has received significant attentionin recent years as a paradigm for crowd-sourcing observation tasks. However; it posesinteresting challenges in assessing confidence in the information received. By borrowingclustering and ranking tools from data mining literature; we show how to group data into sets(or claims); corroborating specific events or observations; then iteratively assess both claimand source credibility; ultimately leading to a ranking of described claims by their like-lihooldof occurrence.

Sparse Projections over Graph.,Deng Cai; Xiaofei He; Jiawei Han,Abstract Recent study has shown that canonical algorithms such as Principal ComponentAnalysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) can be obtained from graph baseddimensionality reduction framework. However; these algorithms yield projective maps whichare linear combination of all the original features. The results are difficult to be interpretedpsychologically and physiologically. This paper presents a novel technique for learning asparse projection over graphs. The data in the reduced subspace is represented as a linearcombination of a subset of the most relevant features. Comparing to PCA and LDA; theresults obtained by sparse projection are often easier to be interpreted.

Online analytical processing stream data: Is it feasible?,Yixin Chen; Guozhu Dong; Jiawei Han; Jian Pei; Benjamin W Wah; Jianyong Wang,ABSTRACT Real-time surveillance systems and other dynamic environments often generatetremendous (potentially infinite) volume of stream data: the volume is too huge to bescanned multiple times. However; much of such data resides at rather low level ofabstraction; whereas most analysts are interested in dynamic changes (such as trends andoutliers) at relatively high levels of abstraction. To discover such high level characteristics;one may need to perform on-line multi-level analysis of stream data; similar to OLAP (on-lineanalytical processing) of relational or data warehouse data.

Heterogeneous learner for Web page classification,Hwanjo Yu; KC-C Chang; Jiawei Han,Classification of an interesting class of Web pages has been an interesting problem. Typicalmachine learning algorithms for this problem require two classes of data for training: positiveand negative training examples. However in application to Web page classification;gathering an unbiased sample of negative examples appears to be difficult. We propose aheterogeneous learning framework for classifying Web pages; which (1) eliminates the needfor negative training data; and (2) increases classification accuracy by using twoheterogeneous learners.

A major challenge for buildingcooperative information systems is the semantic heterogeneity problem. Methods forschema analysis; transformation; and integration have been investigated for providing agood tool to handle this problem. However; schema level analysis may sometimes be toogeneral to solve the problem. Data level analysis; ie; the analysis of database contents;should be taken into serious consideration.

Multi-way counting method,Jiawei Han,Abstract Multi-way counting method represents a group of counting algorithms whichgeneralize the counting method to:(1) complex linear recursions; and (2) versatile recursivequeries. Since the counting method has been recognized as one of the best performingalgorithms in the processing of “simple” recursive queries on “simple” linear recursions; itsgeneralizations to versatile queries on complex linear recursions may have great potential tooutperform other algorithms. In this study; the generalization to complex linear recursions isperformed by compilation. Many complex linear recursions can be compiled to multi-chainrecursions to which counting algorithms are applicable. The generalization to versatilequeries is performed by a quad-state variable binding analysis method.

K-medoids clustering,Xin Jin; Jiawei Han,The K-means clustering algorithm is sensitive to outliers; because a mean is easily influencedby extreme values. K-medoids clustering is a variance of K-means but more robust to noisesand outliers (Han et al. 2011). Instead of using the mean point as the center of a cluster; K-medoidsuse an actual point in the cluster to represent it. Medoid is the most centrally located object ofthe cluster; with minimum sum of distances to other points. Figure 1 shows the difference betweenmean and medoid in a 2D example. The group of points in the right form a cluster; while the rightmostpoint is an outlier.

Constructing topical hierarchies in heterogeneous information networks,Chi Wang; Jialu Liu; Nihit Desai; Marina Danilevsky; Jiawei Han,Abstract Many digital documentary data collections (eg; scientific publications; enterprisereports; news articles; and social media) can be modeled as a heterogeneous informationnetwork; linking text with multiple types of entities. Constructing high-quality hierarchies thatcan represent topics at multiple granularities benefits tasks such as search; informationbrowsing; and pattern mining. In this work; we present an algorithm for recursivelyconstructing multi-typed topical hierarchies. Contrary to traditional text-based topicmodeling; our approach handles both textual phrases and multiple types of entities by anewly designed clustering and ranking algorithm for heterogeneous network data; as well asmining and ranking topical patterns of different types.

On detecting association-based clique outliers in heterogeneous information networks,Manish Gupta; Jing Gao; Xifeng Yan; Hasan Cam; Jiawei Han,Abstract In the real world; various systems can be modeled using heterogeneous networkswhich consist of entities of different types. People like to discover groups (or cliques) ofentities linked to each other with rare and surprising associations from such networks. Wedefine such anomalous cliques as< u> A</u> ssociation-< u> B</u> ased< u> C</u> liqueOutliers (ABCOutliers) for heterogeneous information networks; and design effectiveapproaches to detect them. The need to find such outlier cliques from networks can beformulated as a conjunctive select query consisting of a set of (type; predicate) pairs.Answering such conjunctive queries efficiently involves two main challenges:(1) computingall matching cliques which satisfy the query and (2) ranking such results based on the rarityand the interestingness of the associations among entities in the cliques.

Unexpected results in automatic list extraction on the web,Tim Weninger; Fabio Fumarola; Rick Barber; Jiawei Han; Donato Malerba,Abstract The discovery and extraction of general lists on the Web continues to be animportant problem facing theWeb mining community. There have been numerous studiesthat claim to automatically extract structured data (ie lists; record sets; tables; etc.) from theWeb for various purposes. Our own recent experiences have shown that the list-findingmethods used as part of these larger frameworks do not generalize well and therefore oughtto be reevaluated. This paper briefly describes some of the current approaches; and teststhem on various list-pages. Based on our findings; we conclude that analyzing aWeb page'sDOM-structure is not sufficient for the general list finding task.,ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter,2011,20
Automatic generation of compiled forms for linear recursions,Jiawei Han; Kangsheng Zeng,Abstract This article presents a graph-matrix expansion-based compilation technique whichcompiles complex linear recursions into highly regular compiled forms. The technique usesa variable connection graph-matrix; the V-matrix; to simulate recursion expansions anddiscover the expansion regularity of complex linear recursions. Our study shows that linearrecursions can be compiled into highly regular compiled forms by the V-matrix expansiontechnique and such compiled forms can be generated automatically. The compilation oflinear recursions into compiled forms not only captures the bindings which are difficult tocapture otherwise but also facilitates the development of powerful query analysis andevaluation techniques for complex linear recursions in deductive databases.,Information Systems,1992,20
The level-cycle merging method,Jiawei Han; Lawrence J Henschen,ABSTRACT Counting method is an efficient algorithm in the processing of linear recursivequeries in acyclic databases. Level-Cycle Merging (LCM) method is an extension of thecounting method to process linear recursive queries in both cyclic and acyclic databases.The method precompiles databases to extract self level-cycle information; uses level-cyclesets to register level recurrence sequences in both up-chain and down-chain processing;and extracts answers by level matching analysis. To improve performance; golden cycleoptimization is also proposed. Our analysis shows that the method has the same asymptoticrunning time as the counting method and a reasonable cost on EDB compilation andupdates. Our study shows that Level-Cycle Merging compares favorably with other recentlydeveloped cyclic counting techniques.,*,1990,20
Expectation maximization clustering,Xin Jin; Jiawei Han,An agent acting in a world makes observations; takes actions; and receives rewards for theactions taken. Given a history of such interactions; the agent must make the next choice ofaction so as to maximize the long-term sum of rewards. To do this well; an agent may takesuboptimal actions which allow it to gather the information necessary to later take optimal ornear-optimal actions with respect to maximizing the long-term sum of rewards. Teseinformation gathering actions are generally considered exploration actions.,*,2011,19
iRIN: image retrieval in image-rich information networks,Xin Jin; Jiebo Luo; Jie Yu; Gang Wang; Dhiraj Joshi; Jiawei Han,Abstract In this demo; we present a system called iRIN designed for performing imageretrieval in image-rich information networks. We first introduce MoK-SimRank to significantlyimprove the speed of SimRank; one of the most popular algorithms for computing nodesimilarity in information networks. Next; we propose an algorithm called SimLearn to (1)extend MoK-SimRank to heterogeneous image-rich information network; and (2) account forboth link-based and content-based similarities by seamlessly integrating reinforcementlearning with feature learning.,Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web,2010,19
Region-based online promotion analysis,Tianyi Wu; Yizhou Sun; Cuiping Li; Jiawei Han,Abstract This paper addresses a fundamental and challenging problem with broadapplications: efficient processing of region-based promotion queries; ie; to discover the top-kmost interesting regions for effective promotion of an object (eg; a product or a person) givenby user; where a region is defined over continuous ranged dimensions. In our problemcontext; the object can be promoted in a region when it is top-ranked in it. Such type ofpromotion queries involves an exponentially large search space and expensive aggregationoperations. For efficient query processing; we study a fresh; principled framework calledregion-based promotion cube (RepCube). Grounded on a solid cost analysis; we firstdevelop a partial materialization strategy to yield the provably maximum online pruningpower given a storage budget. Then; cell relaxation is performed to further reduce the …,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2010,19
Mining concept-drifting data stream to detect peer to peer botnet traffic,Mohammad M Masud; Jing Gao; Latifur Khan; Jiawei Han; Bhavani Thuraisingham,ABSTRACT We propose a novel stream data classification technique to detect Peer to Peerbotnet. Botnet traffic can be considered as stream data having two important properties:infinite length and drifting concept. Thus; stream data classification technique is moreappealing to botnet detection than simple classification technique. However; no other botnetdetection approaches so far have applied stream data classification technique. We proposea multi-chunk; multi-level ensemble classifier based data mining technique to classifyconcept-drifting stream data. Previous ensemble techniques in classifying concept-driftingstream data use a single data chunk to train a classifier. In our approach; we train anensemble of v classifiers from r consecutive data chunks. K of these v-classifier ensemblesare used to build another level of ensemble. By introducing this multi-chunk; multi-level …,Univ. of Texas at Dallas Tech. Report# UTDCS-05-08 (http://www. utdallas. edu/mmm058000/reports/UTDCS-05-08. pdf),2008,19

An important goal of miningbiosequences is to find sequence or repeating patterns hidden in DNA; or other bio-data inlarge databases. Previous studies have been using various techniques; including statisticalanalysis; machine learning; minimum description length (MDL) principle; etc. with fruitfulresults.

Chain-split evaluation in deductive databases,Jaiwei Han,Many popularly studied recursions in deductive databases can be compiled into one or a setof highly regular chain generating paths; each of which consists of one or a set of connectedpredicates. Previous studies on chain-based query evaluation in deductive databases take achain generating path as an inseparable unit in the evaluation. However; some recursions;especially many functional recursions whose compiled chain consists of infinitely evaluablefunction (s); should be evaluated by chain-split evaluation; which splits a chain generatingpath into two portions in the evaluation: an immediately evaluable portion and a delayed-evaluation portion. The necessity of chain-split evaluation is examined from the points ofview of both efficiency and finite evaluation; and three chain-split evaluation techniques:magic sets; buffered evaluation; and partial evaluation are developed.

adaqac: Adaptive query auto-completion via implicit negative feedback,Aston Zhang; Amit Goyal; Weize Kong; Hongbo Deng; Anlei Dong; Yi Chang; Carl A Gunter; Jiawei Han,Abstract Query auto-completion (QAC) facilitates user query composition by suggestingqueries given query prefix inputs. In 2014; global users of Yahoo! Search saved more than50% keystrokes when submitting English queries by selecting suggestions of QAC. Users'preference of queries can be inferred during user-QAC interactions; such as dwelling onsuggestion lists for a long time without selecting query suggestions ranked at the top.However; the wealth of such implicit negative feedback has not been exploited for designingQAC models. Most existing QAC models rank suggested queries for given prefixes based oncertain relevance scores. We take the initiative towards studying implicit negative feed-backduring user-QAC interactions. This motivates re-designing QAC in the more general"(static)relevance"(adaptive) implicit negative feedback? framework.

Batch-mode active learning via error bound minimization,Quanquan Gu; Tong Zhang; Jiawei Han,Abstract Active learning has been proven to be quite effective in reducing the humanlabeling efforts by actively selecting the most informative examples to label. In this paper; wepresent a batch-mode active learning method based on logistic regression. Our keymotivation is an out-of-sample bound on the estimation error of class distribution in logisticregression conditioned on any fixed training sample. It is different from a typical PAC-stylepassive learning error bound; that relies on the iid assumption of example-label pairs. Inaddition; it does not contain the class labels of the training sample. Therefore; it can beimmediately used to design an active learning algorithm by minimizing this bound iteratively.We also discuss the connections between the proposed method and some existing activelearning approaches.

In this paper we aim to solve a new problem of resolving entity morphs to their realtargets. We exploit temporal constraints to collect crosssource comparable corpora relevantto any given morph query and identify target candidates. Then we propose various novelsimilarity measurements including surface features; meta-path based semantic features andsocial correlation features and combine them in a learning-to-rank framework.

Quality of information based data selection and transmission in wireless sensor networks,Lu Su; Shaohan Hu; Shen Li; Feng Liang; Jing Gao; Tarek F Abdelzaher; Jiawei Han,In this paper; we provide a quality of information (QoI) based data selection andtransmission service for classification missions in sensor networks. We first identify the twoaspects of QoI; data reliability and data redundancy; and then propose metrics to estimatethem. In particular; reliability implies the degree to which a sensor node contributes to theclassification mission; and can be estimated through exploring the agreement between thisnode and the majority of others. On the other hand; redundancy represents the informationoverlap among different sensor nodes; and can be measured via investigating the similarityof their clustering results. Based on the proposed QoI metrics; we formulate an optimizationproblem that aims at maximizing the reliability of sensory data while eliminating theirredundancies under the constraint of network resources. We decompose this problem …,Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS); 2012 IEEE 33rd,2012,18
Mining knowledge from data: An information network analysis approach,Jiawei Han; Yizhou Sun; Xifeng Yan; S Yu Philip,Most objects and data in the real world are interconnected; forming complex; heterogeneousbut often semistructured information networks. However; many database researchersconsider a database merely as a data repository that supports storage and retrieval ratherthan an information-rich; inter-related and multi-typed information network that supportscomprehensive data analysis; whereas many network researchers focus on homogeneousnetworks. Departing from both; we view interconnected; semi-structured datasets asheterogeneous; information-rich networks and study how to uncover hidden knowledge insuch networks. For example; a university database can be viewed as a heterogeneousinformation network; where objects of multiple types; such as students; professors; courses;departments; and multiple typed relationships; such as teach and advise are intertwined …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,18

One important research topic in CPS is about the atypical eventanalysis; ie; retrieving the events from large amount of data and analyzing them with spatial;temporal and other multi-dimensional information. Many traditional approaches are notfeasible for such analysis since they use numeric measures and cannot describe thecomplex atypical events.

Such an approach isuseful in applications in which it is an objective to determine a set of actions to be taken inorder to guide the data mining application towards a desired solution. This system can beused for a variety of decision support applications which have pre-determined task criteria.We will show that the inverse classification problem is a powerful and general model whichencompasses a number of different criteria.

Regularized regression on image manifold for retrieval,Deng Cai; Xiaofei He; Jiawei Han,Abstract Recently; there have been considerable interests in geometric-based methods forimage retrieval. These methods consider the image space as a smooth manifold and applymanifold learning techniques to find a Euclidean embedding. Thus; the Euclidean distancesin the embedding space can be used as approximations to the geodesic distances on themanifold. A main advantage of these methods is that the relevance feedbacks duringretrieval can be naturally incorporated into the system as prior information. In this paper; weconsider the retrieval problem as a classification problem on manifold. Instead of learning adistance measure; we aim to learn a classification function on the image manifold.Considering efficiency is a key issue in image retrieval; especially on the Webscale; wepropose a novel approach for image retrieval on manifold. This approach is based on a …,Proceedings of the international workshop on Workshop on multimedia information retrieval,2007,18
Error-adaptive and time-aware maintenance of frequency counts over data streams,Hongyan Liu; Ying Lu; Jiawei Han; Jun He,Abstract Maintaining frequency counts for items over data stream has a wide range ofapplications such as web advertisement fraud detection. Study of this problem has attractedgreat attention from both researchers and practitioners. Many algorithms have beenproposed. In this paper; we propose a new method; error-adaptive pruning method; tomaintain frequency more accurately. We also propose a method called fractionization torecord time information together with the frequency information. Using these two methods;we design three algorithms for finding frequent items and top-k frequent items. Experimentalresults show these methods are effective in terms of improving the maintenance accuracy.,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2006,18
Determination of mean flow stress and friction coefficient by the modified two-specimen method in cold rolling,Han Han,Abstract The aim of the study is to investigate the possibility of determining the on-lineaccurate mean value of both friction coefficient and flow stress for anisotropic materialsduring cold rolling. For this purpose; the rolling process was carried out by FE-simulationsinstead of by experiments. In the FEM; elastic flattening of work-rolls and material anisotropyhave been taken into account. Based on the rolling data obtained from the FE-simulations;the influence of elastic flattening on estimation of the friction coefficient has been verified byforward slip method. Also the best combination of rolling force models together withequations describing the radius of flattened work-rolls has been selected by means of themodified two-specimen method (MTSM).

We incorporate symbolic (eg;Abstract Meaning Representation) and distributional semantics to detect and representevent structures and adopt a joint typing framework to simultaneously extract event typesand argument roles and discover an event schema. Experiments on general and specificdomains demonstrate that this framework can construct high-quality schemas with manyevent and argument role types; covering a high proportion of event types and argumentroles in manually defined schemas. We show that extraction performance using discoveredschemas is comparable to supervised models trained from a large amount of data labeledaccording to predefined event types.

Chronicle: A two-stage density-based clustering algorithm for dynamic networks,Min-Soo Kim; Jiawei Han,Abstract Information networks; such as social networks and that extracted from bibliographicdata; are changing dynamically over time. It is crucial to discover time-evolving communitiesin dynamic networks. In this paper; we study the problem of finding time-evolvingcommunities such that each community freely forms; evolves; and dissolves for any timeperiod. Although the previous t-partite graph based methods are quite effective fordiscovering such communities from large-scale dynamic networks; they have some weakpoints such as finding only stable clusters of single path type and not being scalable wrt thetime period. We propose CHRONICLE; an efficient clustering algorithm that discovers notonly clusters of single path type but also clusters of path group type. In order to find clustersof both types and also control the dynamicity of clusters; CHRONICLE performs the two …,International Conference on Discovery Science,2009,17
Top-down mining of interesting patterns from very high dimensional data,Hongyan Liu; Jiawei Han; Dong Xin; Zheng Shao,Many real world applications deal with transactional data; characterized by a huge numberof transactions (tuples) with a small number of dimensions (attributes). However; there aresome other applications that involve rather high dimensional data with a small number oftuples. Examples of such applications include bioinformatics; survey-based statisticalanalysis; text processing; and so on. High dimensional data pose great challenges to mostexisting data mining algorithms. Although there are numerous algorithms dealing withtransactional data sets; there are few algorithms oriented to very high dimensional data setswith a relatively small number of tuples.,Data Engineering; 2006.

Divide-and-approximate: A novel constraint push strategy for iceberg cube mining,Ke Wang; Yuelong Jiang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Guozhu Dong; Jiawei Han,The iceberg cube mining computes all cells v; corresponding to GROUP BY partitions; thatsatisfy a given constraint on aggregated behaviors of the tuples in a GROUP BY partition.The number of cells often is so large that the result cannot be realistically searched withoutpushing the constraint into the search. Previous works have pushed antimonotone andmonotone constraints. However; many useful constraints are neither antimonotone normonotone. We consider a general class of aggregate constraints of the form f (v)/spltheta//spl sigma/; where f is an arithmetic function of SQL-like aggregates and/spl theta/isone of<;/spl les/;/spl ges/>.

Mining complex matchings across web query interfaces,Bin He; Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang; Jiawei Han,Abstract To enable information integration; schema matching is a critical step for discoveringsemantic correspondences of attributes across heterogeneous sourcess. As a new attempt;this paper studies such matching as a data mining problem. Specifically; while complexmatchings are common; because of their far more complex search space; most existingtechniques focus on simple 1: 1 matchings. To tackle this challenge; this paper takes aconceptually novel approach by viewing schema matching as correlation mining; for our taskof matching Web query interfaces to integrate the myriad databases on the Internet. On this"deep Web;" query interfaces generally form complex matchings between attribute groups(eg;{author} corresponds to {first name; last name} in the Books domain).

Data mining tasks and methods: Rule discovery: characteristic rules,Jiawei Han,Abstract Descriptive data mining is the description of a set of data in a concise and summarymanner and the presentation of the general properties of the data. Mining characteristicrules and discriminant rules from the data are two essential components in descriptive datamining. In contrast to online analytical processing; data description puts more emphasis on(1) automated processing; helping users determine which dimensions (or attributes) shouldbe included in the analysis and to what abstraction level the data set should be generalizedin order to obtain interesting summarization; and (2) handling complex data types. Miningdata characteristics and discriminant descriptions can be implemented based on a datacube method or an attribute-oriented induction method.

Geo-spatial Clustering with User-Specified Constraints,Anthony KH Tung; Raymond T Ng; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Capturing application semantics and allowing a human analyst to express his focusin mining have been the motivation for several recent studies on constrained mining. In thispaper; we introduce and study the problem of constrained clustering—finding clusters thatsatisfy certain user-specified constraints. We argue that this problem arises naturally inpractice. Two types of constraints are discussed in this paper. The first type of constraints areimposed by physical obstacles that exist in the region of clustering. The second type ofconstraints are SQL constraints which every cluster must satisfy. We provide a prelimaryintroduction to both types of constraints and discuss some techniques for solving them.,Proceedings of the First International Conference on Multimedia Data Mining,2000,17

Approaches for pattern discovery using sequential data mining,Manish Gupta; Jiawei Han,Abstract In this chapter we first introduce sequence data. We then discuss differentapproaches for mining of patterns from sequence data; studied in literature. Apriori basedmethods and the pattern growth methods are the earliest and the most influential methodsfor sequential pattern mining. There is also a vertical format based method which works on adual representation of the sequence database. Work has also been done for mining patternswith constraints; mining closed patterns; mining patterns from multi-dimensional databases;mining closed repetitive gapped subsequences; and other forms of sequential patternmining. Some works also focus on mining incremental patterns and mining from stream data.We present at least one method of each of these types and discuss their advantages anddisadvantages. We conclude with a summary of the work.,*,2013,16
Document-topic hierarchies from document graphs,Tim Weninger; Yonatan Bisk; Jiawei Han,Abstract Topic taxonomies present a multi-level view of a document collection; wheregeneral topics live towards the top of the taxonomy and more specific topics live towards thebottom. Topic taxonomies allow users to quickly drill down into their topic of interest to finddocuments. We show that hierarchies of documents; where documents live at the innernodes of the hierarchy-tree can also be inferred by combining document text with inter-document links. We present a Bayesian generative model by which an explicit hierarchy ofdocuments is created. Experiments on three document-graph data sets shows that thegenerated document hierarchies are able to fit the observed data; and that the levels in theconstructed document hierarchy represent practical groupings.,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,16

Efficient keyword-based search for top-k cells in text cube,Bolin Ding; Bo Zhao; Cindy Xide Lin; Jiawei Han; Chengxiang Zhai; Asok Srivastava; Nikunj C Oza,Previous studies on supporting free-form keyword queries over RDBMSs provide users withlinked structures (eg; a set of joined tuples) that are relevant to a given keyword query. Mostof them focus on ranking individual tuples from one table or joins of multiple tablescontaining a set of keywords. In this paper; we study the problem of keyword search in adata cube with text-rich dimension (s)(so-called text cube). The text cube is built on amultidimensional text database; where each row is associated with some text data (adocument) and other structural dimensions (attributes). A cell in the text cube aggregates aset of documents with matching attribute values in a subset of dimensions. We define akeyword-based query language and an IR-style relevance model for scoring/ranking cells inthe text cube. Given a keyword query; our goal is to find the top-k most relevant cells.

The recent VisualRank algorithm [4] employs visual similarity to represent thelink structure in a graph so that the classic PageRank algorithm can be applied to select themost relevant images. However; measuring visual similarity is difficult when there existdiversified semantics in the image collection; and the results from VisualRank cannot supplygood visual summarization with diversity. This paper proposes to rank the images in astructural fashion; which aims to discover the diverse structure embedded in photocollections; and rank the images according to their similarity among local neighborhoodsinstead of across the entire photo collection.

CoType: Joint extraction of typed entities and relations with knowledge bases,Xiang Ren; Zeqiu Wu; Wenqi He; Meng Qu; Clare R Voss; Heng Ji; Tarek F Abdelzaher; Jiawei Han,Abstract Extracting entities and relations for types of interest from text is important forunderstanding massive text corpora. Traditionally; systems of entity relation extraction haverelied on human-annotated corpora for training and adopted an incremental pipeline. Suchsystems require additional human expertise to be ported to a new domain; and arevulnerable to errors cascading down the pipeline. In this paper; we investigate jointextraction of typed entities and relations with labeled data heuristically obtained fromknowledge bases (ie; distant supervision).

A unifying framework of mining trajectory patterns of various temporal tightness,Jae-Gil Lee; Jiawei Han; Xiaolei Li,Discovering trajectory patterns is shown to be very useful in learning interactions betweenmoving objects. Many types of trajectory patterns have been proposed in the literature; butprevious methods were developed for only a specific type of trajectory patterns. Thislimitation could make pattern discovery tedious and inefficient since users typically do notknow which types of trajectory patterns are hidden in their data sets. Our main observation isthat many trajectory patterns can be arranged according to the strength of temporalconstraints. In this paper; we propose a unifying framework of mining trajectory patterns ofvarious temporal tightness; which we call unifying trajectory patterns (UT-patterns). Thisframework consists of two phases: initial pattern discovery and granularity adjustment. A setof initial patterns are discovered in the first phase; and their granularities (ie; levels of …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,15
Modeling topic diffusion in multi-relational bibliographic information networks,Huan Gui; Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han; George Brova,Abstract Information diffusion has been widely studied in networks; aiming to model thespread of information among objects when they are connected with each other. Most of thecurrent research assumes the underlying network is homogeneous; ie; objects are of thesame type and they are connected by links with the same semantic meanings. However; inthe real word; objects are connected via different types of relationships; forming multi-relational heterogeneous information networks. In this paper; we propose to modelinformation diffusion in such multi-relational networks; by distinguishing the power inpassing information around for different types of relationships.

Exploring and inferring user–user pseudo‐friendship for sentiment analysis with heterogeneous networks,Hongbo Deng; Jiawei Han; Hao Li; Heng Ji; Hongning Wang; Yue Lu,Abstract With the development of social media and social networks; user-generated content;such as forums; blogs and comments; are not only getting richer; but also ubiquitouslyinterconnected with many other objects and entities; forming a heterogeneous informationnetwork between them. Sentiment analysis on such kinds of data can no longer ignore theinformation network; since it carries a lot of rich and valuable information; explicitly orimplicitly; where some of them can be observed while others are not. However; most existingmethods may heavily rely on the observed user–user friendship or similarity betweenobjects; and can only handle a subgraph associated with a single topic. None of them takesinto account the hidden and implicit dissimilarity; opposite opinions; and foe relationship. Inthis paper; we propose a novel information network-based framework which can infer …,Statistical Analysis and Data Mining: The ASA Data Science Journal,2014,15
Content coverage maximization on word networks for hierarchical topic summarization,Chi Wang; Xiao Yu; Yanen Li; Chengxiang Zhai; Jiawei Han,Abstract This paper studies text summarization by extracting hierarchical topics from a givencollection of documents. We propose a new approach of text modeling via network analysis.We convert documents into a word influence network; and find the words summarizing themajor topics with an efficient influence maximization algorithm. Besides; the influencecapability of the topic words on other words in the network reveal the relations among thetopic words. Then we cluster the words and build hierarchies for the topics. Experiments onlarge collections of Web documents show that a simple method based on the influenceanalysis is effective; compared with existing generative topic modeling and random walkbased ranking.,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Information & Knowledge Management,2013,15

giceberg: Towards iceberg analysis in large graphs,Nan Li; Ziyu Guan; Lijie Ren; Jian Wu; Jiawei Han; Xifeng Yan,Traditional multi-dimensional data analysis techniques such as iceberg cube cannot bedirectly applied to graphs for finding interesting or anomalous vertices due to the lack ofdimensionality in graphs. In this paper; we introduce the concept of graph icebergs that referto vertices for which the concentration (aggregation) of an attribute in their vicinities isabnormally high. Intuitively; these vertices shall be “close” to the attribute of interest in thegraph space. Based on this intuition; we propose a novel framework; called gIceberg; whichperforms aggregation using random walks; rather than traditional SUM and AVG aggregatefunctions. This proposed framework scores vertices by their different levels ofinterestingness and finds important vertices that meet a user-specified threshold. To improvescalability; two aggregation strategies; forward and backward aggregation; are proposed …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,15

Finding symbolic bug patterns in sensor networks,Mohammad Maifi Hasan Khan; Tarek Abdelzaher; Jiawei Han; Hossein Ahmadi,Abstract This paper presents a failure diagnosis algorithm for summarizing and generalizingpatterns that lead to instances of anomalous behavior in sensor networks. Often multipleseemingly different event patterns lead to the same type of failure manifestation. A hiddenrelationship exists; in those patterns; among event attributes that is somehow responsible forthe failure. For example; in some system; a message might always get corrupted if thesender is more than two hops away from the receiver (which is a distance relationship)irrespective of the senderId and receiverId. To uncover such failure-causing relationships;we present a new symbolic pattern extraction technique that identifies and symbolicallyexpresses relationships correlated with anomalous behavior. Symbolic pattern extraction isa new concept in sensor network debugging that is unique in its ability to generalize over …,International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems,2009,15
Efficiently identifying max-gap clusters in pairwise genome comparison,Xu Ling; Xin He; Dong Xin; Jiawei Han,The spatial clustering of genes across different genomes has been used to study importantproblems in comparative genomics; from identification of operons to detection ofhomologous regions. A set of formal models and algorithms of so-called max-gap clustershave been proposed recently. These algorithms guarantee the completeness of the results;and the simplicity of the model enables a rigorous statistical test of significance. Thesefeatures overcome the weakness of many previous methods; which are often heuristic innature. We developed a very efficient algorithm to compute max-gap clusters in pairwisegenome comparison. Our algorithm is an order-of-magnitude faster than the previousalgorithm based on the same model under a number of different settings. In our evaluationon two bacterial genomes; we showed that our method could identify known operons as …,Journal of Computational Biology,2008,15

Closed constrained gradient mining in retail databases,Jianyong Wang; Jiawei Han; Jian Pei,Incorporating constraints into frequent itemset mining not only improves data miningefficiency; but also leads to concise and meaningful results. In this paper; a framework forclosed constrained gradient itemset mining in retail databases is proposed by introducingthe concept of gradient constraint into closed itemset mining. A tailored version of CLOSET+;LCLOSET; is first briefly introduced; which is designed for efficient closed itemset miningfrom sparse databases. Then; a newly proposed weaker but antimonotone measure; top-Xaverage measure; is proposed and can be adopted to prune search space effectively.Experiments show that a combination of LCLOSET and the top-X average pruning providesan efficient approach to mining frequent closed gradient itemsets,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2006,15
Efficient classification from multiple heterogeneous databases,Xiaoxin Yin; Jiawei Han,Abstract With the fast expansion of computer networks; it is inevitable to study data miningon heterogeneous databases. In this paper we propose MDBM; an accurate and efficientapproach for classification on multiple heterogeneous databases. We propose a regression-based method for predicting the usefulness of inter-database links that serve as bridges forinformation transfer; because such links are automatically detected and may or may not beuseful or even valid. Because of the high cost of inter-database communication; MDBMemploys a new strategy for cross-database classification; which finds and performs actionswith high benefit-to-cost ratios. The experiments show that MDBM achieves high accuracy incross-database classification; with much higher efficiency than previous approaches.,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2005,15
The validity of mathematical models evaluated by two-specimen method under the unknown coefficient of friction and flow stress,Han Han,Abstract A modified two-specimen method (MTSM) has been derived from an objectivefunction of two-specimen according to the inverse method. Its principle is that the flow stressfor a given material is specimen geometry-independent; while the flow resistance dependson it. This method not only can evaluate the validity of a selected mathematical model whenboth the coefficient of friction and the flow stress are unknown for a given process; but also itcan estimate the on-line coefficient of friction and flow stress when the mathematical modelselected is valid. The method has been verified by experiments of cylinder; Rastegaevspecimen upsetting and plane strain compression test with an annealed aluminum alloyAA6082 (Al-Si 1 Mg 0.9 Mn 0.1). The flow stress and the coefficient of friction obtained fromthe method have been examined by finite element method (FEM) simulations and the ring …,Journal of materials processing technology,2002,15

Knowledge discovery in object-oriented databases: The first step,Shojiro Nishio; Hiroyuki Kawano; Jiawei Han,Abstract Object-oriented database system has become increasingly popular and influentialin the development of new generation database systems. This motivates the investigation ofmechanisms for data mining in object-oriented databases. In this paper; we propose our firststep towards knowledge discovery in object-oriented databases by extension of the attribute-oriented induction technique from relational databases to object-oriented databases. By thedevelopment of sophisticated generalization operators and generalization controlmechanisms; attribute-oriented induction method can be successfully extended toknowledge discovery in object-oriented databases. Furthermore; we show that knowledgediscovery will substantially enhance the power and flexibility of querying data andknowledge in object-oriented databases.,Proc.

Privacy Risk in Anonymized Heterogeneous Information Networks.,Aston Zhang; Xing Xie; Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang; Carl A Gunter; Jiawei Han; XiaoFeng Wang,ABSTRACT Anonymized user datasets are often released for research or industryapplications. As an example; t. qq. com released its anonymized users' profile; socialinteraction; and recommendation log data in KDD Cup 2012 to call for recommendationalgorithms. Since the entities (users and so on) and edges (links among entities) are ofmultiple types; the released social network is a heterogeneous information network. Priorwork has shown how privacy can be compromised in homogeneous information networks bythe use of specific types of graph patterns. We show how the extra information derived fromheterogeneity can be used to relax these assumptions. To characterize and demonstrate thisadded threat; we formally define privacy risk in an anonymized heterogeneous informationnetwork to identify the vulnerability in the possible way such data are released; and …,EDBT,2014,14
Ranking-based name matching for author disambiguation in bibliographic data,Jialu Liu; Kin Hou Lei; Jeffery Yufei Liu; Chi Wang; Jiawei Han,Abstract Author name ambiguity is a frequently encountered problem in digital publicationlibraries such as Microsoft Academic Search. The cause of this problem mostly is thatdifferent authors may publish under the same name; while the same author could publishunder various names due to abbreviations; nicknames; etc. Author disambiguation is exactlythe goal of the Track II of KDD Cup Data Mining Contest 2013. In this paper we introduce ourranking-based name matching algorithm and system called RankMatch. One importantfeature of our solution is using heterogeneous meta-paths to evaluate the similarity betweentwo potential duplicate authors whose names are compatible. We participated under teamname" SmallData" and our final solution achieved a Mean F 1 score of 99.157%; ranking inthe second place in the contest.,Proceedings of the 2013 KDD Cup 2013 Workshop,2013,14
RankCompete: Simultaneous ranking and clustering of information networks,Liangliang Cao; Xin Jin; Zhijun Yin; Andrey Del Pozo; Jiebo Luo; Jiawei Han; Thomas S Huang,Abstract Random walk was first introduced by Karl Pearson in 1905 and has inspired manyresearch works in different fields. In recent years; random walk has been adopted ininformation network research; for example; ranking and similarity estimation. In this paper;we introduce a new model called RankCompete; which allows multiple random walkers inthe same network (existing work mostly focus on random walks of a single category). Byintroducing the “competition” concept into the random walk framework; our method can fulfillboth clustering and ranking tasks simultaneously and thus provide an effective analysis toolfor networks. Compared with the traditional network ranking approaches; our new methodfocuses more on the structure of specialized clusters. Compared with the traditional graphclustering approaches; our new method provides a faster and more intuitive way to group …,Neurocomputing,2012,14
Selective labeling via error bound minimization,Quanquan Gu; Tong Zhang; Jiawei Han; Chris H Ding,Abstract In many practical machine learning problems; the acquisition of labeled data isoften expensive and/or time consuming. This motivates us to study a problem as follows:given a label budget; how to select data points to label such that the learning performance isoptimized. We propose a selective labeling method by analyzing the generalization error ofLaplacian regularized Least Squares (LapRLS). In particular; we derive a deterministicgeneralization error bound for LapRLS trained on subsampled data; and propose to select asubset of data points to label by minimizing this upper bound. Since the minimization is acombinational problem; we relax it into continuous domain and solve it by projected gradientdescent. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperformsthe state-of-the-art methods.,Advances in neural information processing systems,2012,14
Link prediction in heterogeneous networks: Influence and time matters,Yang Yang; Nitesh V Chawla; Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han,Abstract—Link prediction is an important task in network analysis; benefiting researchersand organizations in a variety of fields. Many networks in the real world; for example socialnetworks; are heterogeneous; having multiple types of links and complex dependencestructures. Link prediction in such networks must model the influence propagating betweenheterogeneous relationships to achieve better link prediction performance than inhomogeneous networks. In this paper; we introduce Multi-Relational Influence Propagation(MRIP); a novel probabilistic method for heterogeneous networks. We demonstrate thatMRIP is useful for predicting links in sparse networks; which present a significant challengedue to the severe disproportion of the number of potential links to the number of real formedlinks. We also explore the impact of time in the process of link formation. We use of the …,Proceedings of The 12th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining; Brussels; Belgium,2012,14
TEXplorer: keyword-based object search and exploration in multidimensional text databases,Bo Zhao; Xide Lin; Bolin Ding; Jiawei Han,Abstract We propose a novel system TEXplorer that integrates keyword-based objectranking with the aggregation and exploration power of OLAP in a text database with richstructured attributes available; eg; a product review database. TEXplorer can beimplemented within a multi-dimensional text database; where each row is associated withstructural dimensions (attributes) and text data (eg; a document).

Multidimensional data mining of traffic anomalies on large-scale road networks,Hector Gonzalez; Jiawei Han; Yanfeng Ouyang; Sebastian Seith,The identification and characterization of traffic anomalies on massive road networks is avital component of traffic monitoring and control. Anomaly identification can be used toreduce congestion; increase safety; and provide transportation engineers with betterinformation for traffic forecasting and road network design. However; because of the size;complexity; and dynamics of transportation networks; automating such a process ischallenging. A multidimensional mining framework is proposed; it can be used to identify aconcise set of anomalies from massive traffic monitoring data and then overlay; contrast; andexplore such anomalies in multidimensional space. The framework is based on thedevelopment of two novel methods:(1) efficient anomaly mining stemming from the discoveryof the atypical fragment (a compact representation of a set of abnormal traffic patterns …,Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board,2011,14
Efficient mining of top correlated patterns based on null-invariant measures,Sangkyum Kim; Marina Barsky; Jiawei Han,Abstract Mining strong correlations from transactional databases often leads to moremeaningful results than mining association rules. In such mining; null (transaction)-invariance is an important property of the correlation measures. Unfortunately; some usefulnull-invariant measures such as Kulczynski and Cosine; which can discover correlationseven for the very unbalanced cases; lack the (anti)-monotonicity property. Thus; they couldonly be applied to frequent itemsets as the post-evaluation step. For large datasets and forlow supports; this approach is computationally prohibitive. This paper presents newproperties for all known null-invariant measures. Based on these properties; we developefficient pruning techniques and design the Apriori-like algorithm NICoMiner for miningstrongly correlated patterns directly. We develop both the threshold-bounded and the top …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2011,14
Finding top-k shortest path distance changes in an evolutionary network,Manish Gupta; Charu C Aggarwal; Jiawei Han,Abstract Networks can be represented as evolutionary graphs in a variety of spatio-temporalapplications. Changes in the nodes and edges over time may also result in correspondingchanges in structural garph properties such as shortest path distances. In this paper; westudy the problem of detecting the top-k most significant shortest-path distance changesbetween two snapshots of an evolving graph. While the problem is solvable with twoapplications of the all-pairs shortest path algorithm; such a solution would be extremely slowand impractical for very large graphs. This is because when a graph may contain millions ofnodes; even the storage of distances between all node pairs can become inefficient inpractice. Therefore; it is desirable to design algorithms which can directly determine thesignificant changes in shortest path distances; without materializing the distances in …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2011,14
Consensus extraction from heterogeneous detectors to improve performance over network traffic anomaly detection,Jing Gao; Wei Fan; Deepak Turaga; Olivier Verscheure; Xiaoqiao Meng; Lu Su; Jiawei Han,Network operators are continuously confronted with malicious events; such as port scans;denial-of-service attacks; and spreading of worms. Due to the detrimental effects caused bythese anomalies; it is critical to detect them promptly and effectively. There have beennumerous softwares; algorithms; or rules developed to conduct anomaly detection overtraffic data. However; each of them only has limited descriptions of the anomalies; and thussuffers from high false positive/false negative rates. In contrast; the combination of multipleatomic detectors can provide a more powerful anomaly capturing capability when the basedetectors complement each other. In this paper; we propose to infer a discriminative modelby reaching consensus among multiple atomic anomaly detectors in an unsupervisedmanner when there are very few or even no known anomalous events for training.

Selection of processing strategies for different recursive queries,Jiawei Han,Abstract Logic database queries are often inquired in different ways; which in turn mayrequire different processing strategies. We study the possible strategies of processingrecursive queries and the methods of selecting such strategies. Recursive query processingstrategies are classified into four classes: non-recursive; total closure; query closure andexistence checking; which can be further divided into binary and unary algorithms. A methodis developed for selecting appropriate strategies based on IDB compilation results; variableinstantiations and inquiries of query predicates; and database statistics. Primitive single-andmulti-chain recursions are taken as typical examples in our analysis; however; the principlesdiscussed here are applicable to more complex recursions as well.,*,1988,14

Consequently; conflicts among sources become inevitable. To resolve the conflictsand achieve high quality data; truth discovery and crowdsourcing aggregation have beenstudied intensively. However; although these two topics have a lot in common; they arestudied separately and are applied to different domains. To answer the need of a systematicintroduction and comparison of the two topics; we present an organized picture on truthdiscovery and crowdsourcing aggregation in this tutorial.

Robust tensor decomposition with gross corruption,Quanquan Gu; Huan Gui; Jiawei Han,Abstract In this paper; we study the statistical performance of robust tensor decompositionwith gross corruption. The observations are noisy realization of the superposition of a low-rank tensor $\mathcal {W}^* $ and an entrywise sparse corruption tensor $\mathcal {V}^* $.Unlike conventional noise with bounded variance in previous convex tensor decompositionanalysis; the magnitude of the gross corruption can be arbitrary large. We show that undercertain conditions; the true low-rank tensor as well as the sparse corruption tensor can berecovered simultaneously. Our theory yields nonasymptotic Frobenius-norm estimation errorbounds for each tensor separately. We show through numerical experiments that our theorycan precisely predict the scaling behavior in practice.,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,2014,13

In this paperwe study a generic form of relationship along which objects can form a treelike structure; apervasive structure in various domains. We formalize the problem of uncovering hierarchicalrelationships in a supervised setting. In general; local features of object attributes; theirinteraction patterns; as well as rules and constraints for knowledge propagation can be usedto infer such relationships.

A spectral framework for detecting inconsistency across multi-source object relationships,Jing Gao; Wei Fan; Deepak Turaga; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Jiawei Han,In this paper; we propose to conduct anomaly detection across multiple sources to identifyobjects that have inconsistent behavior across these sources. We assume that a set ofobjects can be described from various perspectives (multiple information sources). Theunderlying clustering structure of normal objects is usually shared by multiple sources.However; anomalous objects belong to different clusters when considering different aspects.For example; there exist movies that are expected to be liked by kids by genre; but are likedby grown-ups based on user viewing history. To identify such objects; we propose tocompute the distance between different eigen decomposition results of the same object withrespect to different sources as its anomalous score. We also give interpretations from theperspectives of constrained spectral clustering and random walks over graph …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on,2011,13
Authorship classification: a syntactic tree mining approach,Sangkyum Kim; Hyungsul Kim; Tim Weninger; Jiawei Han,Abstract In the past; there have been dozens of studies on automatic authorshipclassification; and many of these studies concluded that the writing style is one of the bestindicators of original authorship. From among the hundreds of features which weredeveloped; syntactic features were best able to reflect an author's writing style. However;due to the high computational complexity of extracting and computing syntactic features;only simple variations of basic syntactic features of function words and part-of-speech tagswere considered. In this paper; we propose a novel approach to mining discriminative k-embedded-edge subtree patterns from a given set of syntactic trees that reduces thecomputational burden of using complex syntactic structures as a feature set.

Many powerful systems (eg OCTOPUS [4];Mesa [3]) use extracted web tables as a fundamental component. In the databasevernacular; a table is defined as a set of tuples which have the same attributes. Similarly; aweb table is defined as a set of rows (corresponding to database tuples) which have thesame column headers (corresponding to database attributes). Therefore; to extract a webtable is to extract a relation on the web. In databases; tables often contain foreign keys whichrefer to other tables. Therefore; it follows that hyperlinks inside a web table sometimes …,Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web,2010,13
Mining personal image collection for social group suggestion,Jie Yu; Xin Jin; Jiawei Han; Jiebo Luo,Popular photo-sharing sites have attracted millions of people and helped construct massivesocial networks in cyberspace. Different from traditional social relationship; users activelyinteract within groups where common interests are shared on certain types of events ortopics captured by photos and videos. Contributing images to a group would greatly promotethe interactions between users and expand their social networks. In this work; we intend toproduce accurate predictions of suitable photo-sharing groups from a user's images bymining images both on the Web and in the user's personal collection. To this end; wedesigned a new approach to cluster popular groups into categories by analyzing thesimilarity of groups via SimRank. Both visual content and its annotations are integrated tounderstand the events or topics depicted in the images. Experiments on real user images …,Data Mining Workshops; 2009. ICDMW'09.

Sparclus: Spatial relationship pattern-based hierarchical clustering,Sangkyum Kim; Xin Jin; Jiawei Han,Abstract For the past decade; the need of multimedia mining has increased tremendously;especially in image data due to inexpensive digital technologies and fast mounting of imagedata. In this paper; we; first; show an algorithm; SpIBag (Sp atial I tem Bag Mining); whichdiscovers frequent spatial patterns in images. Due to the properties of image data; SpIBagconsiders a bag of items together with a spatial information as a pattern which persists overgeometrical transformations; such as scaling; translation; and rotation. Then; based onSpIBag; we propose SpaRClus (Spa tial R elationship Pattern-Based Hierarchical Clustering) to cluster image data. Our performance study shows that the method is effective andefficient.,*,2008,13

Constraint-based query evaluation in deductive databases,Jiawei Han,Constraints play an important role in the efficient query evaluation in deductive databases.Constraint-based query evaluation in deductive databases is investigated; with emphasis onlinear recursions with function symbols. Constraints are grouped into three classes: ruleconstraints; integrity constraints; and query constraints. Techniques are developed for themaximal use of different kinds of constraints in rule compilation and query evaluation. Thestudy on the roles of different classes of constraints in set-oriented evaluation of linearrecursions shows the following: rule constraints should be integrated with theircorresponding deduction rules in the compilation of recursions; integrity constraints;including finiteness constraints and monotonicity constraints; should be used in the analysisof finite evaluability and termination for specific queries; and query constraints; which are …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,1994,13
Pattern-based and knowledge-directed query compilation for recursive data bases (expert; systems; reductive; logic),Jiawei Han,Abstract Expert database systems (EDS's) comprise an interesting class of computersystems which represent a confluence of research in artificial intelligence; logic; anddatabase management systems. They involve knowledge-directed processing of largevolumes of shared information and constitute a new generation of knowledge managementsystems. Our research is on the deductive augmentation of relational database systems;especially on the efficient realization of recursion. We study the compilation and processingof recursive rules in relational database systems; investigating two related approaches:pattern-based recursive rule compilation and knowledge-directed recursive rule compilationand planning.,*,1985,13
PRED: Periodic region detection for mobility modeling of social media users,Quan Yuan; Wei Zhang; Chao Zhang; Xinhe Geng; Gao Cong; Jiawei Han,Abstract The availability of massive geo-annotated social media data sheds light on studyinghuman mobility patterns. Among them; periodic pattern;\ie an individual visiting ageographical region with some specific time interval; has been recognized as one of themost important. Mining periodic patterns has a variety of applications; such as locationprediction; anomaly detection; and location-and time-aware recommendation. However; it isa challenging task: the regions of a person and the periods of each region are bothunknown. The interdependency between them makes the task even harder. Hence; existingmethods are far from satisfactory for detecting periodic patterns from the low-sampling andnoisy social media data. We propose a Bayesian non-parametric model; named\textbf {P}eriodic\textbf {RE} gion\textbf {D} etection (PRED); to discover periodic mobility patterns …,Proceedings of the Tenth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2017,12
AFET: Automatic fine-grained entity typing by hierarchical partial-label embedding,Xiang Ren; Wenqi He; Meng Qu; Lifu Huang; Heng Ji; Jiawei Han,Abstract Distant supervision has been widely used in current systems of fine-grained entitytyping to automatically assign categories (entity types) to entity mentions. However; the typesso obtained from knowledge bases are often incorrect for the entity mention's local context.This paper proposes a novel embedding method to separately model “clean” and “noisy”mentions; and incorporates the given type hierarchy to induce loss functions. We formulate ajoint optimization problem to learn embeddings for mentions and typepaths; and develop aniterative algorithm to solve the problem. Experiments on three public datasets demonstratethe effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method; with an average 15%improvement in accuracy over the next best compared method1.,Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2016,12
Regularized ℓ1-Graph for Data Clustering,Yingzhen Yang; Zhangyang Wang; Jianchao Yang; Jiawei Han; Thomas S Huang,Abstract ℓ1-Graph has been proven to be effective in data clustering; which partitions thedata space by using the sparse representation of the data as the similarity measure.However; the sparse representation is performed for each datum independently withouttaking into account the geometric structure of the data. Motivated by ℓ1-Graph and manifoldleaning; we propose Regularized ℓ1-Graph (Rℓ1-Graph) for data clustering. Compared to ℓ1-Graph; the sparse representations of Rℓ1-Graph are regularized by the geometricinformation of the data. In accordance with the manifold assumption; the sparserepresentations vary smoothly along the geodesics of the data manifold through the graphLaplacian constructed by the sparse codes. Experimental results on various data setsdemonstrate the superiority of our algorithm compared to ℓ1-Graph and other competing …,Proceedings of the British Machine Vision Conference,2014,12
Spatiotemporal periodical pattern mining in traffic data,Tanvi Jindal; Prasanna Giridhar; Lu-An Tang; Jun Li; Jiawei Han,Abstract The widespread use of road sensors has generated huge amount of traffic data;which can be mined and put to various different uses. Finding frequent trajectories from theroad network of a big city helps in summarizing the way the traffic behaves in the city. It canbe very useful in city planning and traffic routing mechanisms; and may be used to suggestthe best routes given the region; road; time of day; day of week; season; weather; and eventsetc. Other than the frequent patterns; even the events that are not so frequent; such as thoseobserved when there is heavy snowfall; other extreme weather conditions; long traffic jams;accidents; etc. might actually follow a periodic occurrence; and hence might be useful tomine. This problem of mining the frequent patterns from road traffic data has beenaddressed in previous works using the context knowledge of the road network of the city …,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM SIGKDD International Workshop on Urban Computing,2013,12
Selective sampling on graphs for classification,Quanquan Gu; Charu Aggarwal; Jialu Liu; Jiawei Han,Abstract Selective sampling is an active variant of online learning in which the learner isallowed to adaptively query the label of an observed example. The goal of selectivesampling is to achieve a good trade-off between prediction performance and the number ofqueried labels. Existing selective sampling algorithms are designed for vector-based data. Inthis paper; motivated by the ubiquity of graph representations in real-world applications; wepropose to study selective sampling on graphs. We first present an online version of the well-known Learning with Local and Global Consistency method (OLLGC). It is essentially asecond-order online learning algorithm; and can be seen as an online ridge regression inthe Hilbert space of functions defined on graphs. We prove its regret bound in terms of thestructural property (cut size) of a graph. Based on OLLGC; we present a selective …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2013,12

The CPS has wide applications in scenariossuch as environment monitoring; battlefield surveillance and traffic control. One key researchproblem of CPS is called" mining lines in the sand". With a large number of sensors (sand)deployed in a designated area; the CPS is required to discover all the trajectories (lines) ofpassing intruders in real time. There are two crucial challenges that need to beaddressed:(1) the collected sensor data are not trustworthy;(2) the intruders do not send outany identification information.

By shifting from the unigram-centric traditionalmethods of unsupervised keyphrase extraction to a phrase-centric approach; we are able todirectly compare and rank phrases of different lengths. We construct a topical keyphraseranking function which implements the four criteria that represent high quality topicalkeyphrases (coverage; purity; phraseness; and completeness).

Mc-minh: Metagenome clustering using minwise based hashing,Zeehasham Rasheed; Huzefa Rangwala,Abstract Current bio-technologies allow sequencing of genomes from multiple organisms;that co-exist as communities within ecological environments. This collective genomicprocess (called metagenomics) has spurred the development of several computational toolsfor the quantification of abundance; diversity and role of different species within differentcommunities. Unsupervised clustering algorithms (also called binning algorithms) havebeen developed to group similar metagenome sequences. We have developed an algorithmcalled MC-MinH that uses the min-wise hashing approach; along with a greedy clusteringalgorithm to group 16S and whole metagenomic sequences. We represent unequal lengthsequences using contiguous subsequences or k-mers; and then approximate thecomputation of pairwise similarity using independent min-wise hashing.

Mining diversity on social media networks,Lu Liu; Feida Zhu; Meng Jiang; Jiawei Han; Lifeng Sun; Shiqiang Yang,Abstract The fast development of multimedia technology and increasing availability ofnetwork bandwidth has given rise to an abundance of network data as a result of all the ever-booming social media and social websites in recent years; eg; Flickr; Youtube; MySpace;Facebook; etc. Social network analysis has therefore become a critical problem attractingenthusiasm from both academia and industry. However; an important measure that capturesa participant's diversity in the network has been largely neglected in previous studies.Namely; diversity characterizes how diverse a given node connects with its peers. In thispaper; we give a comprehensive study of this concept. We first lay out two criteria thatcapture the semantic meaning of diversity; and then propose a compliant definition which issimple enough to embed the idea. Based on the approach; we can measure not only a …,Multimedia Tools and Applications,2012,12
Is objective function the silver bullet? A case study of community detection algorithms on social networks,Yang Yang; Yizhou Sun; Saurav Pandit; Nitesh V Chawla; Jiawei Han,Community detection or cluster detection in networks is a well-studied; albeit hard; problem.Given the scale and complexity of modern day social networks; detecting``reasonable''communities is an even harder problem. Since the first use of k-means algorithm in 1960s;many community detection algorithms have been invented-most of which are developedwith specific goals in mind and the idea of detecting``meaningful''communities varies widelyfrom one algorithm to another. With the increasing number of community detectionalgorithms; there has been an advent of a number of evaluation measures and objectivefunctions such as modularity and internal density. In this paper we divide methods ofmeasurements in to two categories; according to whether they rely on ground-truth or not.Our work is aiming to answer whether these general used objective functions are well …,Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM); 2011 International Conference on,2011,12
Plan Mining by Divide-and-Conquer.,Jiawei Han; Qiang Yang; Edward Kim,Abstract Plans or sequences of actions are an important form of data. With the proliferation ofdatabase technology; plan databases (or planbases) are increasingly common. E cientdiscovery of important patterns of actions in plan databases presents a challenge to datamining. In this paper; we present a method for mining signi cant patterns of successfulactions in a large planbase using a divide-andconquer strategy. The method exploits multi-dimensional generalization of sequences of actions and extracts the inherent hierarchicalstructure and sequential patterns of plans at di erent levels of abstraction. These patterns areused in turn to subsequently narrow down the search for more speci c patterns. The processis analogous to the use of divide-and-conquer methods in hierarchical planning.

Automated phrase mining from massive text corpora,Jingbo Shang; Jialu Liu; Meng Jiang; Xiang Ren; Clare R Voss; Jiawei Han,Abstract: As one of the fundamental tasks in text analysis; phrase mining aims at extractingquality phrases from a text corpus. Phrase mining is important in various tasks includingautomatic term recognition; document indexing; keyphrase extraction; and topic modeling.Most existing methods rely on complex; trained linguistic analyzers; and thus likely haveunsatisfactory performance on text corpora of new domains and genres without extra butexpensive adaption. Recently; a few data-driven methods have been developedsuccessfully for extraction of phrases from massive domain-specific text. However; none ofthe state-of-the-art models is fully automated because they require human experts fordesigning rules or labeling phrases.

Collaborative Multi-Level Embedding Learning from Reviews for Rating Prediction.,Wei Zhang; Quan Yuan; Jiawei Han; Jianyong Wang,Abstract We investigate the problem of personalized reviewbased rating prediction whichaims at predicting users' ratings for items that they have not evaluated by using theirhistorical reviews and ratings. Most of existing methods solve this problem by integratingtopic model and latent factor model to learn interpretable user and items factors. However;these methods cannot utilize word local context information of reviews. Moreover; it simplyrestricts user and item representations equivalent to their review representations; which maybring some irrelevant information in review text and harm the accuracy of rating prediction. Inthis paper; we propose a novel Collaborative Multi-Level Embedding (CMLE) model toaddress these limitations. The main technical contribution of CMLE is to integrate wordembedding model with standard matrix factorization model through a projection level …,IJCAI,2016,11
Towards scalable critical alert mining,Bo Zong; Yinghui Wu; Jie Song; Ambuj K Singh; Hasan Cam; Jiawei Han; Xifeng Yan,Abstract Performance monitor software for data centers typically generates a great numberof alert sequences. These alert sequences indicate abnormal network events. Given a set ofobserved alert sequences; it is important to identify the most critical alerts that are potentiallythe causes of others. While the need for mining critical alerts over large scale alertsequences is evident; most alert analysis techniques stop at modeling and mining thecausal relations among the alerts. This paper studies the critical alert mining problem: Givena set of alert sequences; we aim to find a set of k critical alerts such that the number of alertspotentially triggered by them is maximized. We show that the problem is intractable;therefore; we resort to approximation and heuristic algorithms.

Thedata embed rich information about the relationships among moving objects and haveapplications in many fields; eg; in ecological study and human behavioral study. Previously;we have proposed a system MoveMine that integrates several start-of-art movement miningmethods. However; it does not include recent methods on relationship pattern mining. Thus;we propose to extend MoveMine to MoveMine 2.0 by adding substantial new methods inmining dynamic relationship patterns.

Mining periodicity from dynamic and incomplete spatiotemporal data,Zhenhui Li; Jiawei Han,Abstract As spatiotemporal data becomes widely available; mining and understanding suchdata have gained a lot of attention recently. Among all important patterns; periodicity isarguably the most frequently happening one for moving objects. Finding periodic behaviorsis essential to understanding the activities of objects; and to predict future movements anddetect anomalies in trajectories. However; periodic behaviors in spatiotemporal data couldbe complicated; involvingmultiple interleaving periods; partial time span; and spatiotemporalnoises and outliers. Even worse; due to the limitations of positioning technology or itsvarious kinds of deployments; real movement data is often highly incomplete and sparse. Inthis chapter; we discuss existing techniques to mine periodic behaviors from spatiotemporaldata; with a focus on tackling the aforementioned difficulties risen in real applications. In …,*,2014,11

Multidimensional sensor data analysis in cyber-physical system: an atypical cube approach,Lu-An Tang; Xiao Yu; Sangkyum Kim; Jiawei Han; Wen-Chih Peng; Yizhou Sun; Alice Leung; Thomas La Porta,Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is an integration of distributed sensor networks withcomputational devices. CPS claims many promising applications; such as traffic observation;battlefield surveillance; and sensor-network-based monitoring. One important topic in CPSresearch is about the atypical event analysis; that is; retrieving the events from massivesensor data and analyzing them with spatial; temporal; and other multidimensionalinformation. Many traditional methods are not feasible for such analysis since they cannotdescribe the complex atypical events.

Mining significant time intervals for relationship detection,Zhenhui Li; Cindy Xide Lin; Bolin Ding; Jiawei Han,Abstract Spatio-temporal data collected from GPS have become an important resource tostudy the relationships of moving objects. While previous studies focus on mining objectsbeing together for a long time; discovering real-world relationships; such as friends orcolleagues in human trajectory data; is a fundamentally different challenge. For example; itis possible that two individuals are friends but do not spend a lot of time being together everyday. However; spending just one or two hours together at a location away from work on aSaturday night could be a strong indicator of friend relationship. Based on the aboveobservations; in this paper we aim to analyze and detect semantically meaningfulrelationships in a supervised way. That is; with an interested relationship in mind; a user canlabel some object pairs with and without such relationship.

Exploring the power of heuristics and links in multi-relational data mining,Xiaoxin Yin; Jiawei Han,Abstract Relational databases are the most popular repository for structured data; and arethus one of the richest sources of knowledge in the world. Because of the complexity ofrelational data; it is a challenging task to design efficient and scalable data miningapproaches in relational databases. In this paper we discuss two methodologies to addressthis issue. The first methodology is to use heuristics to guide the data mining procedure; inorder to avoid aimless; exhaustive search in relational databases. The second methodologyis to assign certain property to each object in the database; and let different objects interactwith each other along the links. Experiments show that both approaches achieve highefficiency and accuracy in real applications.,International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems,2008,11

There are lots of algorithms proposed to enhance the performance ofthese algorithms; whereas not much effort has been made to make use of hierarchicalinformation held by items in data stream. In this paper; we try to improve the accuracy offinding frequent items using hierarchical information in taxonomy. To do that; we propose amethod called Merge. According to the strategy; we design and implement an algorithm;named FISHMerge. In order to evaluate the performance of the algorithm; we propose threenew measures for testing; and develop a hierarchical stream data generator.

Discovery of frequent substructures,Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han,Graphs become increasingly important in modeling complicated structures; such as circuits;images; chemical compounds; protein structures; biological networks; the Web; work flows;and XML documents. We have witnessed many graph-related algorithms developed inchemical informatics [3; 4; 26; 27]; computer vision [29]; video indexing [25]; and text retrieval[19]. Among various kinds of graph patterns; frequent substructures are very basic ones thatcan be discovered in a set of graphs. They are useful at characterizing graph sets;discriminating different groups of graphs; classifying and clustering graphs; and buildinggraph indices. Borgelt and Berthold [6] illustrated the discovery of active chemical structuresin a dataset that screened for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by contrasting thesupport of frequent graphs between different classes.

Searching for Related Objects in Relational Databases.,Xiaoxin Yin; Jiawei Han; Jiong Yang,Abstract To discover knowledge or retrieve information from a relational database; a useroften needs to find objects related to certain source objects. There are two main challengesin building an effective object search system: the huge amount of objects in the databaseand the large number of different relationships between objects. In this paper we introduceRoss; an efficient and accurate relational object search system. Ross accepts complexqueries that enable users to specify the relationships among objects. To measure therelationships of join paths; Ross considers the different semantics of different joins; andcombines both selectivity and lengths of join paths to measure their strengths. A novelapproach is used to find the best join paths between relations; which converts the databaseschema into a graph; so that the shortest paths in the graph correspond to best join paths …,SSDBM,2005,11
Pushing aggregate constraints by divide-and-approximate,Ke Wang; Yuelong Jiang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Guozhu Dong; Jiawei Han,Iceberg-cube mining is to compute the GROUP BY partitions; for all GROUP BY dimensionlists; that satisfy a given aggregate constraint. Previous works have pushed anti-monotoneconstraints into iceberg-cube mining. However; many useful constraints are not anti-monotone. We propose a novel strategy for pushing general aggregate constraints; calleddivide-and-approximate. This strategy divides the search space and approximates theconstraint in subspaces by a pushable constraint. As the strategy is recursively applied; theapproximation approaches the given constraint and the pruning tights up. We show that allconstraints defined by SQL aggregates; arithmetic operators and comparison operators canbe pushed by divide-and-approximate.

Discovering spatial associations in images,Osmar R Zaiane; Jiawei Han,In this paper; our focus in data mining is concerned with the discovery of spatial associationswithin images. Our work concentrates on the problem of finding associations between visualcontent in large image databases. Discovering association rules has been the focus of manystudies in the last few years. However; for multimedia data such as images or video frames;the algorithms proposed in the literature are not sufficient since they miss relevant frequentitem-sets due to the peculiarity of visual data; like repetition of features; resolution levels; etc.We present in this paper an approach for mining spatial relationships from large visual datarepositories. The approach proceeds in three steps: feature localization; spatial relationshipabstraction; and spatial association discovery.

Efficient evaluation of multiple linear recursions,Jiawei Han; Ling Liu,The authors study the efficient evaluation of side-coherent multiple linear recursions; whichcan be further classified into three types: multiple one-sided; multiple balanced k-sided; andmultiple mixed k-sided. New techniques are developed by integrating the existing single-linear recursive query evaluation methods with the idea of side-relation unioned processing;which leads to a set of efficient query evaluation algorithms such as a side-relation unionedtransitive closure algorithm for the processing of Type I ML recursions and a generalizedside-relation unioned magic sets method for the processing of Types II and III ML recursions.The authors describe the processing of single-probe queries on side-coherent MLrecursions. They outline the processing of complex queries on ML recursions.,IEEE transactions on software engineering,1991,11

Large-scale embedding learning in heterogeneous event data,Huan Gui; Jialu Liu; Fangbo Tao; Meng Jiang; Brandon Norick; Jiawei Han,Heterogeneous events; which are defined as events connecting strongly-typed objects; areubiquitous in the real world. We propose a HyperEdge-Based Embedding (Hebe) frameworkfor heterogeneous event data; where a hyperedge represents the interaction among a set ofinvolving objects in an event. The Hebe framework models the proximity among objects inan event by predicting a target object given the other participating objects in the event(hyperedge). Since each hyperedge encapsulates more information on a given event; Hebeis robust to data sparseness. In addition; Hebe is scalable when the data size spirals.Extensive experiments on large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy androbustness of Hebe.,Data Mining (ICDM); 2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on,2016,10
Mining multi-aspect reflection of news events in twitter: Discovery; linking and presentation,Jingjing Wang; Wenzhu Tong; Hongkun Yu; Min Li; Xiuli Ma; Haoyan Cai; Tim Hanratty; Jiawei Han,A major event often has repercussions on both news media and microblogging sites such asTwitter. Reports from mainstream news agencies and discussions from Twitter complementeach other to form a complete picture. An event can have multiple aspects (sub-events)describing it from multiple angles; each of which attracts opinions/comments posted onTwitter. Mining such reflections is interesting to both policy makers and ordinary peopleseeking information. In this paper; we propose a unified framework to mine multi-aspectreflections of news events in Twitter. We propose a novel and efficient dynamic hierarchicalentity-aware event discovery model to learn news events and their multiple aspects. Theaspects of an event are linked to their reflections in Twitter by a bootstrapped datalessclassification scheme; which elegantly handles the challenges of selecting informative …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,10
Assembler: Efficient discovery of spatial co-evolving patterns in massive geo-sensory data,Chao Zhang; Yu Zheng; Xiuli Ma; Jiawei Han,Abstract Recent years have witnessed the wide proliferation of geo-sensory applicationswherein a bundle of sensors are deployed at different locations to cooperatively monitor thetarget condition. Given massive geo-sensory data; we study the problem of mining spatial co-evolving patterns (SCPs); ie; groups of sensors that are spatially correlated and co-evolvefrequently in their readings. SCP mining is of great importance to various real-worldapplications; yet it is challenging because (1) the truly interesting evolutions are oftenflooded by numerous trivial fluctuations in the geo-sensory time series; and (2) the patternsearch space is extremely large due to the spatiotemporal combinatorial nature of SCP. Inthis paper; we propose a two-stage method called Assember. In the first stage; Assemberfilters trivial fluctuations using wavelet transform and detects frequent evolutions for …,Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2015,10
Constrained Information-Theoretic Tripartite Graph Clustering to Identify Semantically Similar Relations.,Chenguang Wang; Yangqiu Song; Dan Roth; Chi Wang; Jiawei Han; Heng Ji; Ming Zhang,Abstract In knowledge bases or information extraction results; differently expressed relationscan be semantically similar (eg;(X; wrote; Y) and (X;'s written work; Y)). Therefore; groupingsemantically similar relations into clusters would facilitate and improve many applications;including knowledge base completion; information extraction; information retrieval; andmore. This paper formulates relation clustering as a constrained tripartite graph clusteringproblem; presents an efficient clustering algorithm and exhibits the advantage of theconstrained framework. We introduce several ways that provide side information via must-link and cannotlink constraints to improve the clustering results. Different from traditionalsemi-supervised learning approaches; we propose to use the similarity of relationexpressions and the knowledge of entity types to automatically construct the constraints …,IJCAI,2015,10
Graph regularized meta-path based transductive regression in heterogeneous information network,Mengting Wan; Yunbo Ouyang; Lance Kaplan; Jiawei Han,Abstract A number of real-world networks are heterogeneous information networks; whichare composed of different types of nodes and links. Numerical prediction in heterogeneousinformation networks is a challenging but significant area because network basedinformation for unlabeled objects is usually limited to make precise estimations. In thispaper; we consider a graph regularized meta-path based transductive regression model(Grempt); which combines the principal philosophies of typical graph-based transductiveclassification methods and transductive regression models designed for homogeneousnetworks. The computation of our method is time and space efficient and the precision of ourmodel can be verified by numerical experiments.,*,2015,10

Troubleshooting interactive complexity bugs in wireless sensor networks using data mining techniques,Mohammad Maifi Hasan Khan; Hieu Khac Le; Hossein Ahmadi; Tarek F Abdelzaher; Jiawei Han,Abstract This article presents a tool for uncovering bugs due to interactive complexity innetworked sensing applications. Such bugs are not localized to one component that is faulty;but rather result from complex and unexpected interactions between multiple oftenindividually nonfaulty components. Moreover; the manifestations of these bugs are often notrepeatable; making them particularly hard to find; as the particular sequence of events thatinvokes the bug may not be easy to reconstruct. Because of the distributed nature of failurescenarios; our tool looks for sequences of events that may be responsible for faulty behavior;as opposed to localized bugs such as a bad pointer in a module. We identified severalchallenges in applying discriminative sequence mining for root cause analysis when thesystem fails to perform as expected and presented our solutions to those challenges.

However; it is also a challenging problem since the mining may have togenerate or examine a combinatorially explosive number of intermediate subsequences.Abundant literature has been dedicated to this research and tremendous progress has beenmade so far.

As the body of medical literature expands rapidly; keeping this knowledge up-to-date becomes a challenge for medical professionals. One question is that for a givendisease how can we find the most influential treatments currently available from onlinemedical publications? In this paper we propose MedRank; a new network-based algorithmthat ranks heterogeneous objects in a medical information network. The network is extractedfrom MEDLINE; a large collection of semi-structured medical literature.

Locality preserving feature learning,Quanquan Gu; Marina Danilevsky; Zhenhui Li; Jiawei Han,Abstract Locality Preserving Indexing (LPI) has been quite successful in tackling documentanalysis problems; such as clustering or classification. The approach relies on the LocalityPreserving Criterion; which preserves the locality of the data points. However; LPI takesevery word in a data corpus into account; even though many words may not be useful fordocument clustering. To overcome this problem; we propose an approach called LocalityPreserving Feature Learning (LPFL); which incorporates feature selection into LPI.Specifically; we aim to find a subset of features; and learn a linear transformation to optimizethe Locality Preserving Criterion based on these features. The resulting optimizationproblem is a mixed integer programming problem; which we relax into a constrainedFrobenius norm minimization problem; and solve using a variation of Alternating Direction …,Artificial Intelligence and Statistics,2012,10

Survivable distributed storage with progressive decoding,Yunghsiang S Han; Soji Omiwade; Rong Zheng,We propose a storage-optimal and computation efficient primitive to spread information froma single data source to a set of storage nodes; to allow recovery from both crash-stop andByzantine failures. A progressive data retrieval scheme is employed; which retrievesminimal amount of data from live storage nodes. The scheme adapts the cost of successfuldata retrieval to the degree of errors in the system. Implementation and evaluation studiesdemonstrate comparable performance to that of a genie-aid decoding process.,INFOCOM; 2010 Proceedings IEEE,2010,10
Semi-supervised regression using spectral techniques,Deng Cai; Xiaofei He; Jiawei Han,Graph-based approaches for semi-supervised learning have received increasing amount ofinterest in recent years. Despite their good performance; many pure graph based algorithmsdo not have explicit functions and can not predict the label of unseen data. Graphregularization is a recently proposed framework which incorporates the intrinsic geometricalstructure as a regularization term. It can be performed as semi-supervised learning whenunlabeled samples are available. However; our theoretical analysis shows that suchapproach may not be optimal for multi-class problems. In this paper; we propose a novelmethod; called {\bf Spectral Regression}(SR). By using spectral techniques; we first computea set of responses for each sample which respects both the label information andgeometrical structure. Once the responses are obtained; the ordinary ridge regression …,*,2006,10

Query evaluation and optimization in deductive and object-oriented spatial databases,Wei Lu; Jiawei Han,Abstract A deductive and object-oriented spatial (DOOS) database system enhances aspatial database system with deductive and object-oriented features. Two major kinds ofcomputations co-exist in a DOOS database system:(1) spatial reasoning based on spatialrelationships specified by spatial (deduction) rules; and (2) spatial computation based oncomputationally intensive geometric algorithms (methods). The impedance mismatchbetween set-oriented spatial query evaluation and tuple-oriented spatial algorithmiccomputation poses a major challenge in the implementation of such a system. This studyattacks this problem in the following three aspects:(1) deduction rule compilation and high-level; relational and geo-relational algebraic simplification;(2) query plan generation bydynamic connection graph analysis and access path selection; and (3) set-oriented …,Information and Software Technology,1995,10
Relsim: relation similarity search in schema-rich heterogeneous information networks,Chenguang Wang; Yizhou Sun; Yanglei Song; Jiawei Han; Yangqiu Song; Lidan Wang; Ming Zhang,Abstract Recent studies have demonstrated the power of modeling real world data asheterogeneous information networks (HINs) consisting of multiple types of entities andrelations. Unfortunately; most of such studies (eg; similarity search) confine discussions onthe networks with only a few entity and relationship types; such as DBLP. In the real world;however; the network schema can be rather complex; such as Freebase. In such HINs withrich schema; it is often too much burden to ask users to provide explicit guidance in selectingrelations for similarity search. In this paper; we study the problem of relation similarity searchin schema-rich HINs. Under our problem setting; users are only asked to provide somesimple relation instance examples (eg;〈 Barack Obama; John Kerry〉 and〈 George W.Bush; Condoleezza Rice〉) as a query; and we automatically detect the latent semantic …,*,2016,9
Entity disambiguation with linkless knowledge bases,Yang Li; Shulong Tan; Huan Sun; Jiawei Han; Dan Roth; Xifeng Yan,Abstract Named Entity Disambiguation is the task of disambiguating named entity mentionsin natural language text and link them to their corresponding entries in a referenceknowledge base (eg Wikipedia). Such disambiguation can help add semantics to plain textand distinguish homonymous entities. Previous research has tackled this problem bymaking use of two types of context-aware features derived from the reference knowledgebase; namely; the context similarity and the semantic relatedness. Both features heavily relyon the cross-document hyperlinks within the knowledge base: the semantic relatednessfeature is directly measured via those hyperlinks; while the context similarity feature implicitlymakes use of those hyperlinks to expand entity candidates' descriptions and then comparesthem against the query context. Unfortunately; cross-document hyperlinks are rarely …,Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web,2016,9
Classification with active learning and meta-paths in heterogeneous information networks,Chang Wan; Xiang Li; Ben Kao; Xiao Yu; Quanquan Gu; David Cheung; Jiawei Han,Abstract A heterogeneous information network (HIN) is used to model objects of differenttypes and their relationships. Meta-paths are sequences of object types. They are used torepresent complex relationships between objects beyond what links in a homogeneousnetwork capture. We study the problem of classifying objects in an HIN. We propose class-level meta-paths and study how they can be used to (1) build more accurate classifiers and(2) improve active learning in identifying objects for which training labels should beobtained. We show that class-level meta-paths and object classification exhibit interestingsynergy. Our experimental results show that the use of class-level meta-paths results in veryeffective active learning and good classification performance in HINs.,Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2015,9

Debiasing crowdsourced batches,Honglei Zhuang; Aditya Parameswaran; Dan Roth; Jiawei Han,Abstract Crowdsourcing is the de-facto standard for gathering annotated data. While; intheory; data annotation tasks are assumed to be attempted by workers independently; inpractice; data annotation tasks are often grouped into batches to be presented andannotated by workers together; in order to save on the time or cost overhead of providinginstructions or necessary background. Thus; even though independence is usually assumedbetween annotations on data items within the same batch; in most cases; a worker'sjudgment on a data item can still be affected by other data items within the batch; leading toadditional errors in collected labels. In this paper; we study the data annotation bias whendata items are presented as batches to be judged by workers simultaneously.

The parallel path framework for entity discovery on the web,Tim Weninger; Thomas J Johnston; Jiawei Han,Abstract It has been a dream of the database and Web communities to reconcile theunstructured nature of the World Wide Web with the neat; structured schemas of thedatabase paradigm. Even though databases are currently used to generate Web content insome sites; the schemas of these databases are rarely consistent across a domain. Thismakes the comparison and aggregation of information from different domains difficult. Weaim to make an important step towards resolving this disparity by using the structural andrelational information on the Web to (1) extract Web lists;(2) find entity-pages;(3) map entity-pages to a database; and (4) extract attributes of the entities. Specifically; given a Web siteand an entity-page (eg; university department and faculty member home page) we seek tofind all of the entity-pages of the same type (eg; all faculty members in the department); as …,ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB),2013,9

Mapping web pages to database records via link paths,Tim Weninger; Fabio Fumarola; Jiawei Han; Donato Malerba,Abstract In this paper we propose a new knowledge management task which aims to mapWeb pages to their corresponding records in a structured database. For example; the DBLPdatabase contains records for many computer scientists; and most of these persons havepublic Web pages; if we can map the database record with the appropriate Web page thenthe new information could be used to further describe the person's database record. Toaccomplish this goal we employ link paths which contain anchor texts from multiple pathsthrough the Web ending at the Web page in question. We hypothesize that the informationfrom these link paths can be used to generate an accurate Web page to database recordmapping.

Efficient processing of ranked queries with sweeping selection,Wen Jin; Martin Ester; Jiawei Han,Abstract Existing methods for top-k ranked query employ techniques including sorting;updating thresholds and materializing views. In this paper; we propose two novel index-based techniques for top-k ranked query:(1) indexing the layered skyline; and (2) indexingmicroclusters of objects into a grid structure. We also develop efficient algorithms for rankedquery by locating the answer points during the sweeping of the line/hyperplane of the scorefunction over the indexed objects. Both methods can be easily plugged into typical multi-dimensional database indexes. The comprehensive experiments not only demonstrate thatour methods outperform the existing ones; but also illustrate that the application of datamining technique (microclustering) is a useful and effective solution for database queryprocessing.,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2005,9
Discovering an Evolutionary Classifier over a High-speed Nonstatic Stream,Jiong Yang; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; Wei Wang,Summary With the emergence of large-volume and high-speed streaming data; mining datastreams has become a focus of increasing interest. The major new challenges in streamingdata mining are as follows: since streams may flow in and out indefinitely and at fast speed;it is usually expected that a stream-mining process can only scan a data stream once; andsince the characteristics of the data may evolve over time; it is desirable to incorporate theevolving features of data streams. This paper investigates the issues of developing a high-speed classification method for streaming data with concept drifts. Among several popularclassification techniques; the naïve Bayesian classifier is chosen due to its low constructioncost; ease of incremental maintenance; and high accuracy.

Conflicts to harmony: A framework for resolving conflicts in heterogeneous data by truth discovery,Yaliang Li; Qi Li; Jing Gao; Lu Su; Bo Zhao; Wei Fan; Jiawei Han,In many applications; one can obtain descriptions about the same objects or events from avariety of sources. As a result; this will inevitably lead to data or information conflicts. Oneimportant problem is to identify the true information (ie; the truths) among conflicting sourcesof data. It is intuitive to trust reliable sources more when deriving the truths; but it is usuallyunknown which one is more reliable a priori. Moreover; each source possesses a variety ofproperties with different data types. An accurate estimation of source reliability has to bemade by modeling multiple properties in a unified model. Existing conflict resolution workeither does not conduct source reliability estimation; or models multiple propertiesseparately.

It is often more effective to give power to users and allow them tospecify outlier queries flexibly; and the system will then process such mining queriesefficiently. In this study; we introduce the concept of query-based outlier in heterogeneousinformation networks; design a query language to facilitate users to specify such queriesflexibly; define a good outlier measure in heterogeneous networks; and study how toprocess outlier queries efficiently in large data sets.

Learning to efficiently rank on big data,Lidan Wang; Jimmy Lin; Donald Metzler; Jiawei Han,Abstract Ranking in response to user queries is a central problem in information retrieval;data mining; and machine learning. In the era of" Big data"; traditional effectiveness-centricranking techniques tend to get more and more costly (requiring additional hardware andenergy costs) to sustain reasonable ranking speed on large data. The mentality ofcombating big data by throwing in more hardware/machines will quickly become highlyexpensive since data is growing at an extremely fast rate oblivious to any cost concerns fromus." Learning to efficiently rank" offers a cost-effective solution to ranking on large data (eg;billions of documents). That is; it addresses a critically important question--whether it ispossible to improve ranking effectiveness on large data without incurring (too much)additional cost?,Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on World Wide Web,2014,8

Analysis and refinement of cross-lingual entity linking,Taylor Cassidy; Heng Ji; Hongbo Deng; Jing Zheng; Jiawei Han,Abstract In this paper we propose two novel approaches to enhance cross-lingual entitylinking (CLEL). One is based on cross-lingual information networks; aligned based onmonolingual information extraction; and the other uses topic modeling to ensure globalconsistency. We enhance a strong baseline system derived from a combination of state-of-the-art machine translation and monolingual entity linking to achieve 11.2% improvement inB-Cubed+ F-measure. Our system achieved highly competitive results in the NIST TextAnalysis Conference (TAC) Knowledge Base Population (KBP2011) evaluation.

Optimizing index for taxonomy keyword search,Bolin Ding; Haixun Wang; Ruoming Jin; Jiawei Han; Zhongyuan Wang,Abstract Query substitution is an important problem in information retrieval. Much workfocuses on how to find substitutes for any given query. In this paper; we study how toefficiently process a keyword query whose substitutes are defined by a given taxonomy. Thisproblem is challenging because each term in a query can have a large number ofsubstitutes; and the original query can be rewritten into any of their combinations. Wepropose to build an additional index (besides inverted index) to efficiently process queries.For a query workload; we formulate an optimization problem which chooses the additionalindex structure; aiming at minimizing the query evaluation cost; under given index spaceconstraints. We show the NP-hardness of the problem; and propose a pseudo-polynomialtime algorithm using dynamic programming; as well as an 1 over 4 (1-1/e)-approximation …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,8

Growing parallel paths for entity-page discovery,Tim Weninger; Fabio Fumarola; Cindy Xide Lin; Rick Barber; Jiawei Han; Donato Malerba,Abstract In this paper; we use the structural and relational information on the Web to findentity-pages. Specifically; given a Web site and an entity-page (eg; department and facultymember homepage) we seek to find all of the entity-pages of the same type (eg; all facultymembers in the department). To do this; we propose a web structure mining method whichgrows parallel paths through the web graph and DOM trees. We show that by utilizing theseparallel paths we can efficiently discover all entity-pages of the same type. Finally; wedemonstrate the accuracy of our method with a case study on various domains.,Proceedings of the 20th international conference companion on World wide web,2011,8
A general framework for efficient clustering of large datasets based on activity detection,Xin Jin; Sangkyum Kim; Jiawei Han; Liangliang Cao; Zhijun Yin,Abstract Data clustering is one of the most popular data mining techniques with broadapplications. K-Means is one of the most popular clustering algorithms; due to its highefficiency/effectiveness and wide implementation in many commercial/noncommercialsoftwares. Performing efficient clustering on large dataset is especially useful; however;conducting K-Means clustering on large data suffers heavy computation burden whichoriginates from the numerous distance calculations between the patterns and the centers.This paper proposes framework General Activity Detection (GAD) for fast clustering on large-scale data based on center activity detection. Within this framework; we design a set ofalgorithms for different scenarios:(i) exact GAD algorithm; E-GAD; which is much faster thanK-Means and gets the same clustering result;(ii) approximate GAD algorithms with …,Statistical Analysis and Data Mining: The ASA Data Science Journal,2011,8
Mining diversity on networks,Lu Liu; Feida Zhu; Chen Chen; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; S Yu Philip; Shiqiang Yang,Abstract Despite the recent emergence of many large-scale networks in different applicationdomains; an important measure that captures a participant's diversity in the network hasbeen largely neglected in previous studies. Namely; diversity characterizes how diverse agiven node connects with its peers. In this paper; we give a comprehensive study of thisconcept. We first lay out two criteria that capture the semantic meaning of diversity; and thenpropose a compliant definition which is simple enough to embed the idea. An efficient top-kdiversity ranking algorithm is developed for computation on dynamic networks. Experimentson both synthetic and real datasets give interesting results; where individual nodes identifiedwith high diversities are intuitive.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,8
Aggregation of multiple judgments for evaluating ordered lists,Hyun Duk Kim; ChengXiang Zhai; Jiawei Han,Abstract Many tasks (eg; search and summarization) result in an ordered list of items. Inorder to evaluate such an ordered list of items; we need to compare it with an ideal orderedlist created by a human expert for the same set of items. To reduce any bias; multiple humanexperts are often used to create multiple ideal ordered lists. An interesting challenge in suchan evaluation method is thus how to aggregate these different ideal lists to compute a singlescore for an ordered list to be evaluated. In this paper; we propose three new methods foraggregating multiple order judgments to evaluate ordered lists: weighted correlationaggregation; rank-based aggregation; and frequent sequential pattern-based aggregation.Experiment results on ordering sentences for text summarization show that all the three newmethods outperform the state of the art average correlation methods in terms of …,European Conference on Information Retrieval,2010,8

Evaluation of regular nonlinear recursions by deductive database techniques,Jiawei Han; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Nonlinear recursion is one of the most challenging classes of logic programs forefficient evaluation in logic programming systems. We identify one popular class ofnonlinear recursion; regular nonlinear recursion; and investigate its efficient implementationby a deductive database approach. The approach performs a detailed query bindinganalysis based on query information; constraint information and the structure of a recursion;selects an appropriate predicate evaluation order and generates an efficient queryevaluation plan. Interesting query evaluation techniques; such as chain-following; chain-split; and constraint pushing; are developed for the efficient evaluation of different kinds ofqueries. Furthermore; the technique can be extended to the evaluation of regular nonlinearrecursions in HiLog and F-logic programs. The study not only presents a method for the …,Information Systems,1995,8
Recurring and novel class detection using class-based ensemble for evolving data stream,Tahseen Al-Khateeb; Mohammad M Masud; Khaled M Al-Naami; Sadi Evren Seker; Ahmad M Mustafa; Latifur Khan; Zouheir Trabelsi; Charu Aggarwal; Jiawei Han,Streaming data is one of the attention receiving sources for concept-evolution studies. Whena new class occurs in the data stream it can be considered as a new concept and so theconcept-evolution. One attractive problem occurring in the concept-evolution studies is therecurring classes from our previous study. In data streams; a class can disappear andreappear after a while. Existing studies on data stream classification techniques eithermisclassify the recurring class or falsely identify the recurring classes as novel classes.Because of the misclassification or false novel classification; the error rates increases onthose studies. In this paper we address the problem by defining a novel ensemble technique“class-based” ensemble which replaces the traditional “chunk-based” approach in order todetect the recurring classes.

Fast inbound top-k query for random walk with restart,Chao Zhang; Shan Jiang; Yucheng Chen; Yidan Sun; Jiawei Han,Abstract Random walk with restart (RWR) is widely recognized as one of the most importantnode proximity measures for graphs; as it captures the holistic graph structure and is robustto noise in the graph. In this paper; we study a novel query based on the RWR measure;called the inbound top-k (Ink) query. Given a query node q and a number k; the Ink queryaims at retrieving k nodes in the graph that have the largest weighted RWR scores to q. Inkqueries can be highly useful for various applications such as traffic scheduling; diseasetreatment; and targeted advertising. Nevertheless; none of the existing RWR computationtechniques can accurately and efficiently process the Ink query in large graphs. We proposetwo algorithms; namely Squeeze and Ripple; both of which can accurately answer the Inkquery in a fast and incremental manner.

High temperature interactive corrosion of naphthenic acid and organic sulphide on Cr5Mo steel in synthetic refining mixture,DONG Zehua; HE Jinbei; GUO Xingpeng; ZHANG Yaoxiang; HAN Jicheng,Abstract Naphthenic acid corrosion (NAC); sulfur corrosion (SC) and their interaction onCr5Mo carbon steel were studied by mass loss test using a spinning coupon inside a heatedautoclave at 280℃. The test mixture with different level of sulfur content and total acidnumber were prepared by pure naphthenic acid; lauryl mercaptan and low sulfur white oil. Itwas found that the increasing sulfur content can accelerate the NAC dramatically when thesulfur content lower than 2.0 mass%. However; the boost effect of mercaptan to NACdecreased quickly when the sulfur content is higher than 3.0 mass {\%}; which could beattributed to the formation of protective Fe 7 S 8/Cr 5 S 8 layer confirmed by scanningelectron microscope (SEM); energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis and X-ray diffraction(XRD) analysis.

Exploiting background information networks to enhance bilingual event extraction through topic modeling,Hao Li; Heng Ji; Hongbo Deng; Jiawei Han,Abstract—In this paper; we describe a novel approach of biased propagation based topicmodeling to exploit global background knowledge for enhancing both the quality andportability of event extraction on unstructured data. The distributions of event triggers andarguments in topicallyrelated documents are much more focused than those in aheterogeneous corpus. Based on this intuition; we apply topic modeling to automaticallyselect training documents for annotation; and demonstrate it can significantly reduceannotation cost in order to achieve comparable performance for two different languages andtwo different genres. In addition; we conduct cross-document inference within each topiccluster and show that our approach advances state-of-the-art.,Proc. of International Conference on Advances in Information Mining and Management,2011,7
Diamond: Correlation-based anomaly monitoring daemon for dime,Ahsan Arefin; Klara Nahrstedt; Raoul Rivas; Jiawei Han; Zixia Huang,Distributed Interactive Multimedia Environments (DIMEs) show important dependencyconstraints between application and underlying system components over time. For example;the video frame rate and the underlying bandwidth usage have a strong performancedependency. Performance dependencies must also be considered among distributedcomponents. These dependencies over a time-span form correlation relationships.Violations of such correlation relationships represent collective anomalies. Users and mostspecifically DIME application developers face problems of finding (detecting); localizingsuch anomalies; and adapting against them in real-time.

Because of thecurse of dimensionality; it is already known that well-known data structures like kd-tree; R-tree; and M-tree suffer in their performance over high-dimensional data space which isinferior to a brute-force approach linear scan.

Influence of material anisotropy and friction on ring deformation,Han Han,In metal forming processes; friction is one of vital variables. As friction increases formingload and power; changes material flow; strain/stress distribution and influences form filling; itmust be determined. The ring-compression test is one of typical methods for the quantitativeevaluation of friction in bulk metal forming. It was first proposed by Kunogi 1 for comparinglubricants in cold forging; and was later improved by Male and Cockcroft 2 who created thefirst calibration diagram. With this method; the coefficient of friction can be estimated throughthe change in the internal diameter of the deformed ring. A number of works; bothexperimental and theoretical; showed the usefulness of this method in determining thefriction at the die/workpiece interface when various friction models Coulomb's friction;constant friction factor; and general friction models were used.

A study on the structure of linear recursion,Wenyu Lu; Dik Lun Lee; Jiawei Han,We study a general class of single linear recursions and the properties of their expansionsby analyzing the structures of the recursions. We show that the expansions of a linearrecursion of this class are very regular in that the variable connections are heavily sharedand change periodically with respect to the expansions. The variable connections can beprecisely characterized as static bindings and chain connections. We conclude that a singlelinear recursion under our assumptions either is bounded or can be expressed as chainrecursions. This study contributes to query processing; because it provides the basis for rulecompilation as a general and powerful technique for query processing. Combined withquery information; the expansion properties of the recursion provide optimized query-processing plans.,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering,1994,7
Normalization of linear recursions in deductive databases,Jiawei Han; Kangsheng Zeng; Tong Lu,A graph-matrix expansion-based compilation technique that transforms complex linearrecursions into highly regular linear normal forms (LNFs) is introduced. A variableconnection graph-matrix; the V-matrix; is constructed to simulate the expansions of a linearrecursion and discover its expansion regularity. Based on the expansion regularity; a linearrecursion can be normalized into an LNF. The normalization of linear recursions not onlycaptures the bindings that are difficult to be captured otherwise but also facilitates thedevelopment of powerful query analysis and evaluation techniques for complex linearrecursions in deductive databases.,Data Engineering; 1993.

Catchtartan: Representing and summarizing dynamic multicontextual behaviors,Meng Jiang; Christos Faloutsos; Jiawei Han,Abstract Representing and summarizing human behaviors with rich contexts facilitatesbehavioral sciences and user-oriented services. Traditional behavioral modeling representsa behavior as a tuple in which each element is one contextual factor of one type; and thetensor-based summaries look for high-order dense blocks by clustering the values(including timestamps) in each dimension. However; the human behaviors aremulticontextual and dynamic:(1) each behavior takes place within multiple contexts in a fewdimensions; which requires the representation to enable non-value and set-values for eachdimension;(2) many behavior collections; such as tweets or papers; evolve over time.

Representing documents via latent keyphrase inference,Jialu Liu; Xiang Ren; Jingbo Shang; Taylor Cassidy; Clare R Voss; Jiawei Han,Abstract Many text mining approaches adopt bag-of-words or $ n $-grams models torepresent documents. Looking beyond just the words; fiie; the explicit surface forms; in adocument can improve a computer's understanding of text. Being aware of this; researchershave proposed concept-based models that rely on a human-curated knowledge base toincorporate other related concepts in the document representation. But these methods arenot desirable when applied to vertical domains (eg; literature; enterprise; etc) due to lowcoverage of in-domain concepts in the general knowledge base and interference from out-of-domain concepts. In this paper; we propose a data-driven model named Latent KeyphraseInference LAKI) that represents documents with a vector of closely related domainkeyphrases instead of single words or existing concepts in the knowledge base.

Compared with inference algorithms that approximate themaximum likelihood objective; moment-based inference has theoretical guarantee inrecovering model parameters. One such inference method is tensor orthogonaldecomposition; which requires only mild assumptions for exact recovery of topics. However;it suffers from scalability issue due to creation of dense; high-dimensional tensors. In thiswork; we propose a speedup technique by leveraging the special structure of the tensors.

Local; providebusiness category hierarchies for people to navigate through millions of business listings.The category information also provides important ranking features that can be used toimprove search experience. However; category hierarchies are often manually crafted bysome human experts and they are far from complete. Manually constructed categoryhierarchies cannot handle the ever-changing and sometimes long-tail user informationneeds. In this paper; we study the problem of how to expand an existing category hierarchyfor a search/navigation system to accommodate the information needs of users more …,Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on World wide web,2014,6
Leveraging periodicity in human mobility for next place prediction,Bhaskar Prabhala; Jingjing Wang; Budhaditya Deb; Thomas La Porta; Jiawei Han,Periodic transitions from place to place are inherent in human movements. Through visualexamination we detect these periodic movements in traces of user tracking data. Howeversuch user tracking data sets tend to be sparse and incomplete. In addition; periodicmovements are surrounded by noise: transitions to and from less frequently visited placesand transitions to one of a kind visits. In this paper; we present algorithms leveragingtechniques and models to detect periodicity in individual user movements. Our algorithmspredict a user's next place given only the current context of timestamp and location. Weapply these algorithms to real user mobility data sets. Prediction accuracy depends on theratio of periodic movements to noise in user traces. For majority of users in a movementtracking data set collected over a year; our algorithms achieve next place prediction …,Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC); 2014 IEEE,2014,6

Entity role discovery in hierarchical topical communities,Marina Danilevsky; Chi Wang; Nihit Desai; Jiawei Han,ABSTRACT People and social communities are often characterized by the topics andthemes they are working on; or communicating about. Discovering the roles played bydifferent entities in these communities are of great interest in many real-world contexts insocial network analysis. We are also often interested in discovering such roles at differentlevels of granularity. In this paper we study a new problem of mining entity roles inhierarchical topical communities. We first detect topical communities from the textcomponent of a social or information network. Since we mine phrases from the network; andrepresent topical communities by ranked lists of mixed-length phrases; the communitieshave a good interpretation at multiple levels of the hierarchy. We are therefore able todiscover topical roles of different types of entities in both large communities …,Proc. ACM SIGKDD Int. Conf. on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2013,6
Efficient mining of correlated sequential patterns based on null hypothesis,Cindy Xide Lin; Ming Ji; Marina Danilevsky; Jiawei Han,Abstract Frequent pattern mining has been a widely studied topic in the research area ofdata mining for more than a decade. However; pattern mining with real data sets iscomplicated-a huge number of co-occurrence patterns are usually generated; a majority ofwhich are either redundant or uninformative. The true correlation relationships among dataobjects are buried deep among a large pile of useless information. To overcome thisdifficulty; mining correlations has been recognized as an important data mining task for itsmany advantages over mining frequent patterns. In this paper; we formally propose anddefine the task of mining frequent correlated sequential patterns from a sequential database.With this aim in mind; we re-examine various interestingness measures to select theappropriate one (s); which can disclose succinct relationships of sequential patterns.

Bidirectional mining of non-redundant recurrent rules from a sequence database,David Lo; Bolin Ding; Jiawei Han,We are interested in scalable mining of a non-redundant set of significant recurrent rulesfrom a sequence database. Recurrent rules have the form “whenever a series of precedentevents occurs; eventually a series of consequent events occurs”. They are intuitive andcharacterize behaviors in many domains. An example is the domain of softwarespecification; in which the rules capture a family of properties beneficial to programverification and bug detection. We enhance a past work on mining recurrent rules by Lo;Khoo; and Liu to perform mining more scalably. We propose a new set of pruning propertiesembedded in a new mining algorithm. Performance and case studies on benchmarksynthetic and real datasets show that our approach is much more efficient and outperformsthe state-of-the-art approach in mining recurrent rules by up to two orders of magnitude.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,6
Discriminative frequent pattern-based graph classification,Hong Cheng; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Frequent graph mining has been studied extensively with many scalable graphmining algorithms developed in the past. Graph patterns are essential not only forexploratory graph mining but also for advanced graph analysis tasks such as graphindexing; graph clustering; and graph classification. In this chapter; we examine the frequentpattern-based classification of graph data. We will introduce different types of patterns usedin graph classification and their efficient mining approaches. These approaches coulddirectly mine the most discriminative subgraphs without enumerating the complete set offrequent graph patterns. The application of graph classification into chemical compoundanalysis and software behavior prediction will be discussed to demonstrate the power ofdiscriminative subgraphs.,*,2010,6

Indexing noncrashing failures: A dynamic program slicing-based approach,Chao Liu; Xiangyu Zhang; Jiawei Han; Yu Zhang; Bharat K Bhargava,Recent software systems usually feature an automated failure reporting component; withwhich a huge number of failures are collected from software end-users. With a propersupport of failure indexing; which identifies failures due to the same fault; the collectedfailure data can help developers prioritize failure diagnosis; among other utilities of thefailure data. Since crashing failures can be effectively indexed by program crashing venues;current practice has seen great success in prioritizing crashing failures. A recent study ofbug characteristics indicates that as excellent memory checking tools are widely adopted;semantic bugs and the resulting noncrashing failures have become dominant. Unfortunately;the problem of how to index non-crashing failures has not been seriously studied before. Inprevious study; two techniques have been proposed to index noncrashing failures; and …,Software Maintenance; 2007. ICSM 2007. IEEE International Conference on,2007,6
Effect of cold-rolling and annealing on interfacial structures and properties of A500/steel bimetal strip,李宝绵， 韩建芬， 许光明， 崔建忠,The effect of cold-rolling; by both a series of small passes and single-pass with differentdeformations as well as the subsequent annealing; on the interfacial structures andproperties of A500 (AlSn8 Pb2Si2. 5 Cu0. 8 Cr0. 2)/steel bimetal strip produced by liquid-solid roll cladding was investigated. Experimental results of the cold-rolling by a series ofsmall passes show that the interfacial bonding strength increases slightly when the totaldeformation is less than 7.32% and then decreases gradually with the increase indeformation. Subsequent annealing has no effect on the interfacial structures andproperties. The effect of cold-rolling by single-pass less than 33.2% deformation on theinterfacial structures and properties is the same as that of multi-pass cold-rolling; whereascold-rolling by singlepass more than 33. 2% deformation followed by annealing at 350℃ …,中国有色金属学会会刊: 英文版,2005,6
Categorization of spatial data mining techniques,Shashi Shekhar; Yan Huang; Jia-Wei Han; Sanjay Chawla; Sucharita Gopal,Abstract Spatial data mining is the process of discovering interesting; previously unknownbut potentially useful patterns from large spatial datasets. Extracting interesting and usefulpatterns from spatial datasets is more di cult than exatracting corresponding patterns fromtraditional numeric and categorical data due to the complexity of spatial data types andspatial relationships. A popular approach is to preprocessing the spatial components andapply classical data mining techniques. An alternative is to apply new models and objectivefunctions. In this paper we provide a framework to understand the spatial data miningtechniques in literature.,Scientific Data Mining; working,2000,6

Information-associated join indices for spatial range search,Wei Lu; Jiawei Han,Abstract Spatial join indices are join indices constructed for spatial objects. Similar to joinindices in relational database systems; spatial join indices improve efficiency of spatial joinoperations. In this paper; a spatial-information-associated join indexing mechanism isdeveloped to speed up spatial queries; especially; spatial range queries. Three distance-associated join index structures: basic; ring-structured and hierarchical; are developed andstudied. Such join indexing structures can be further extended to include orientationinformation for flexible applications; which leads to zone-structured and other spatial-information-associated join indices. Our performance study and analysis show that spatial-information-associated join indices substantially improve the performance of spatial queriesand that different structures are best suited for different applications.,International Journal of Geographical Information Systems,1995,6
Triovecevent: Embedding-based online local event detection in geo-tagged tweet streams,Chao Zhang; Liyuan Liu; Dongming Lei; Quan Yuan; Honglei Zhuang; Tim Hanratty; Jiawei Han,Abstract Detecting local events (eg; protest; disaster) at their onsets is an important task for awide spectrum of applications; ranging from disaster control to crime monitoring and placerecommendation.

On predicting social unrest using social media,Rostyslav Korolov; Di Lu; Jingjing Wang; Guangyu Zhou; Claire Bonial; Clare Voss; Lance Kaplan; William Wallace; Jiawei Han; Heng Ji,We study the possibility of predicting a social protest (planned; or unplanned) based onsocial media messaging. We consider the process called mobilization; described in theliterature as the precursor of participation. Mobilization includes four stages: beingsympathetic to the cause; being aware of the movement; motivation to take part and ability toparticipate. We suggest that expressions of mobilization in communications of individualsmay be used to predict the approaching protest. We have utilized several Natural LanguageProcessing techniques to create a methodology to identify mobilization in social mediacommunication. Results of experimentation with Twitter data collected before and during the2015 Baltimore events and the information on actual protests taken from news media show acorrelation over time between volume of Twitter communications related to mobilization …,Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM); 2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on,2016,5
Automatic entity recognition and typing in massive text corpora,Xiang Ren; Ahmed El-Kishky; Chi Wang; Jiawei Han,Abstract In today's computerized and information-based society; we are soaked with vastamounts of natural language text data; ranging from news articles; product reviews;advertisements; to a wide range of user-generated content from social media. To turn suchmassive unstructured text data into actionable knowledge; one of the grand challenges is togain an understanding of entities and the relationships between them. In this tutorial; weintroduce data-driven methods to recognize typed entities of interest in different kinds of textcorpora (especially in massive; domain-specific text corpora). These methods canautomatically identify token spans as entity mentions in text and label their types (eg; people;product; food) in a scalable way.

Gin: A clustering model for capturing dual heterogeneity in networked data,Jialu Liu; Chi Wang; Jing Gao; Quanquan Gu; Charu Aggarwal; Lance Kaplan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Networked data often consists of interconnected multi-typed nodes and links. Acommon assumption behind such heterogeneity is the shared clustering structure. However;existing network clustering approaches over-simplify the heterogeneity by either treatingnodes or links in a homogeneous fashion; resulting in massive loss of information. Inaddition; these studies are more or less restricted to specific network schemas orapplications; losing generality. In this paper; we introduce a flexible model to explain theprocess of forming heterogeneous links based on shared clustering information ofheterogeneous nodes. Specifically; we categorize the link generation process into binaryand weighted cases and model them respectively. We show these two cases can beseamlessly integrated into a unified model. We propose to maximize a joint log-likelihood …,*,2015,5
On integrating network and community discovery,Jialu Liu; Charu Aggarwal; Jiawei Han,Abstract The problem of community detection has recently been studied widely in the contextof the web and social media networks. Most algorithms for community detection assume thatthe entire network is available for online analysis. In practice; this is not really true; becauseonly restricted portions of the network may be available at any given time for analysis. Manysocial networks such as Facebook have privacy constraints; which do not allow thediscovery of the entire structure of the social network. Even in the case of more opennetworks such as Twitter; it may often be challenging to crawl the entire network from apractical perspective. For many other scenarios such as adversarial networks; the discoveryof the entire network may itself be a costly task; and only a small portion of the network maybe discovered at any given time. Therefore; it can be useful to investigate whether …,Proceedings of the Eighth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2015,5
Scalable and robust construction of topical hierarchies,Chi Wang; Xueqing Liu; Yanglei Song; Jiawei Han,Abstract: Automated generation of high-quality topical hierarchies for a text collection is adream problem in knowledge engineering with many valuable applications. In this paper ascalable and robust algorithm is proposed for constructing a hierarchy of topics from a textcollection. We divide and conquer the problem using a top-down recursive framework;based on a tensor orthogonal decomposition technique. We solve a critical challenge toperform scalable inference for our newly designed hierarchical topic model. Experimentswith various real-world datasets illustrate its ability to generate robust; high-qualityhierarchies efficiently. Our method reduces the time of construction by several orders ofmagnitude; and its robust feature renders it possible for users to interactively revise thehierarchy. Subjects: Learning (cs.

Parallel field ranking,Ming Ji; Binbin Lin; Xiaofei He; Deng Cai; Jiawei Han,Abstract Recently; ranking data with respect to the intrinsic geometric structure (manifoldranking) has received considerable attentions; with encouraging performance in manyapplications in pattern recognition; information retrieval and recommendation systems. Mostof the existing manifold ranking methods focus on learning a ranking function that variessmoothly along the data manifold. However; beyond smoothness; a desirable rankingfunction should vary monotonically along the geodesics of the data manifold; such that theranking order along the geodesics is preserved. In this paper; we aim to learn a rankingfunction that varies linearly and therefore monotonically along the geodesics of the datamanifold. Recent theoretical work shows that the gradient field of a linear function on themanifold has to be a parallel vector field. Therefore; we propose a novel ranking …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2012,5
Building enriched web page representations using link paths,Tim Weninger; ChengXiang Zhai; Jiawei Han,Abstract Anchor text has a history of enriching documents for a variety of tasks within theWorld Wide Web. Anchor texts are useful because they are similar to typical Web queries;and because they express the document's context. Therefore; it is a common practice forWeb search engines to incorporate incoming anchor text into the document's standardtextual representation. However; this approach will not suffice for documents with very fewinlinks; and it does not incorporate the document's full context. To mediate these problems;we employ link paths; which contain anchor texts from paths through the Web ending at thedocument in question. We propose and study several different ways to aggregate anchortext from link paths; and we show that the information from link paths can be used to (1)improve known item search in site-specific search; and (2) map Web pages to database …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM conference on Hypertext and social media,2012,5

Olaping stream data: Is it feasible,Yixin Chen; Guozhu Dong; Jiawei Han; Jian Pei; Benjamin W Wah; Jianyong Wang,ABSTRACT Real-time surveillance systems and other dynamic environments often generatetremendous (potentially infinite) volume of stream data: the volume is too huge to bescanned multiple times. However; much of such data resides at rather low level ofabstraction; whereas most analysts are interested in dynamic changes (such as trends andoutliers) at relatively high levels of abstraction. To discover such high level characteristics;one may need to perform on-line multi-level analysis of stream data; similar to OLAP (on-lineanalytical processing) of relational or data warehouse data. With limited storage space andthe demand for fast response; is it realistic to promote on-line; multi-dimensional analysisand mining of stream data to alert people about dramatic changes of situations at multiple-levels of abstraction?

Dpclass: An effective but concise discriminative patterns-based classification framework,Jingbo Shang; Wenzhu Tong; Jian Peng; Jiawei Han,Abstract Pattern-based classification was originally proposed to improve the accuracy usingselected frequent patterns; where many efforts were paid to prune a huge number of non-discriminative frequent patterns. On the other hand; tree-based models have shown strongabilities on many classification tasks since they can easily build high-order interactionsbetween different features and also handle both numerical and categorical features as wellas high dimensional features. By taking the advantage of both modeling methodologies; wepropose a natural and effective way to resolve pattern-based classification by adoptingdiscriminative patterns which are the prefix paths from root to nodes in tree-based models(eg; random forest). Moreover; we further compress the number of discriminative patterns byselecting the most effective pattern combinations that fit into a generalized linear model …,*,2016,4

Leveraging pattern semantics for extracting entities in enterprises,Fangbo Tao; Bo Zhao; Ariel Fuxman; Yang Li; Jiawei Han,Abstract Entity Extraction is a process of identifying meaningful entities from text documents.In enterprises; extracting entities improves enterprise efficiency by facilitating numerousapplications; including search; recommendation; etc. However; the problem is particularlychallenging on enterprise domains due to several reasons. First; the lack of redundancy ofenterprise entities makes previous web-based systems like NELL and OpenIE not effective;since using only high-precision/low-recall patterns like those systems would miss themajority of sparse enterprise entities; while using more low-precision patterns in sparsesetting also introduces noise drastically. Second; semantic drift is common in enterprises ("Blue" refers to" Windows Blue"); such that public signals from the web cannot be directlyapplied on entities. Moreover; many internal entities never appear on the web. Sparse …,Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web,2015,4

F-Rank Class provides improvements up to 27.3% on theWikipedia dataset. For multimodal document classification; F-Rank Class showsimprovements up to 19.7% in accuracy when compared to SVM-based meta-classifiers.

HINs; composed ofmultiple types of entities and links are very common in the real world. Many have a textcomponent; and thus can benefit from a high quality hierarchical organization of the topics inthe network dataset. By organizing the topics into a hierarchy; AMETHYST helps understandsearch results in the context of an ontology; and explain entity relatedness at differentgranularities.

As in real life; we often learn more fromnegative results than we do from positive ones. It is time that we; as a community; start toregard failures as being as informative as successes. After all; we do know the difficulty oflearning from positive only experiences; so how can we expect to learn about our field if allwe ever see are successes?

Mining frequent approximate sequential patterns,Feida Zhu; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; Philip S Yu,Frequent sequential pattern mining remains one of the most important data-mining taskssince its introduction in Ref.[1]. With the ubiquity of sequential data; it has found broadapplications in customer analysis; query log analysis; financial stream data analysis; andpattern discovery in genomic DNA sequences in bioinformatics. Extensive research on thetopic has brought about general sequential pattern mining algorithms like Refs.[2–7] andconstraint-based ones like Refs.[8; 9]. Periodic pattern mining in temporal data sequenceshas also been studied [10; 11]. However; all these mining algorithms follow the exactmatching sequential pattern definition. It has been shown that the capacity to accommodateapproximation in the mining process has become critical due to inherent noise andimprecision in data; eg; gene mutations in genomic DNA sequence mining.

Anomaly detection in moving object,Xiaolei Li; Jiawei Han; Sangkyum Kim; Hector Gonzalez,Abstract With recent advances in sensory and mobile computing technology; manyinteresting applications involving moving objects have emerged. One of them isidentification of suspicious movements: an important problem in homeland security. Theobjects in question can be vehicles; airplanes; or ships; however; due to the sheer volume ofdata and the complexities within; manual inspection of the moving objects would require toomuch manpower. Thus; an automated or semi-automated solution to this problem would bevery helpful. That said; it is challenging to develop a method that can efficiently andeffectively detect anomalies. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that anomalies mayoccur at arbitrary levels of abstraction and be associated with multiple granularity ofspatiotemporal features. In this study; we propose a new framework named ROAM (R ule …,*,2008,4

Multi-dimensional analysis of data streams using stream cubes,Jiawei Han; Y Dora Cai; Yixin Chen; Guozhu Dong; Jian Pei; Benjamin W Wah; Jianyong Wang,Abstract Large volumes of dynamic stream data pose great challenges to its analysis.Besides its dynamic and transient behavior; stream data has another importantcharacteristic: multi-dimensionality. Much of stream data resides at a multidimensionalspace and at rather low level of abstraction; whereas most analysts are interested inrelatively high-level dynamic changes in some combination of dimensions. To discover high-level dynamic and evolving characteristics; one may need to perform multi-level; multi-dimensional on-line analytical processing (OLAP) of stream data. Such necessity calls forthe investigation of new architectures that may facilitate on-line analytical processing of multi-dimensional stream data. In this chapter; we introduce an interesting stream_cubearchitecture that effectively performs on-line partial aggregation of multi-dimensional …,*,2007,4

This paperproposes an approach that uses data mining techniques to systematically mine accesssequences in a storage system to characterize storage behaviors. More specifically; we usefrequent sequence mining algorithms to find block access correlations which can be used toimprove the effectiveness of subsystems such as storage caching and disk scheduling; andfor disk power management.

SPARC: Spatial association rule-based classification,Jiawei Han; Anthony KH Tung; Jing He,Abstract Spatial classification is to classify spatial objects based on the spatial andnonspatial features of these objects in a database. The classification results; taken as themodels for the data; can be used for better understanding of the relationships among theobjects in the database and for prediction of characteristics and features of new objects.Spatial classification is a challenging task due to the sparsity of spatial features which leadsto high dimensionality and also the “curse of dimensionality. In this paper; we introduce anassociation-based spatial classification algorithm; called SPARC (SP atial A ssociation R ule-based C lassification); for efficient spatial classification in large geospatial databases.SPARC explores spatial association-based classification and integrates a few importanttechniques developed in spatial indexing and data mining to achieve high scalability …,*,2001,4

Compilation and evaluation of linear mutual recursions,Jiawei Han,Abstract A linear mutual recursion is a recursion that consists of a set of rules; each of whichhas at most one predicate in its body that is mutually recursive with its head predicate. Thispaper studies techniques for compilation and efficient evaluation of linear mutual recursions.It demonstrates that a large class of linear mutual recursions can be compiled to one or a setof linear recursions or pseudo-linear recursions and be evaluated efficiently using the well-studied linear recursive query processing techniques and/or their variations. The benefitsand limitations of such a compilation and evaluation technique are also discussed in thepaper.,Information sciences,1993,4

Liberal entity extraction: Rapid construction of fine-grained entity typing systems,Lifu Huang; Jonathan May; Xiaoman Pan; Heng Ji; Xiang Ren; Jiawei Han; Lin Zhao; James A Hendler,Abstract The ability of automatically recognizing and typing entities in natural languagewithout prior knowledge (eg; predefined entity types) is a major challenge in processingsuch data. Most existing entity typing systems are limited to certain domains; genres; andlanguages. In this article; we propose a novel unsupervised entity-typing framework bycombining symbolic and distributional semantics. We start from learning three types ofrepresentations for each entity mention: general semantic representation; specific contextrepresentation; and knowledge representation based on knowledge bases. Then wedevelop a novel joint hierarchical clustering and linking algorithm to type all mentions usingthese representations. This framework does not rely on any annotated data; predefinedtyping schema; or handcrafted features; therefore; it can be quickly adapted to a new …,Big data,2017,3
Online spectral learning on a graph with bandit feedback,Quanquan Gu; Jiawei Han,Online learning on a graph is appealing due to its efficiency. However; existing onlinelearning algorithms on a graph are limited to binary classification. Moreover; they requireaccessing the full label information; where the label oracle needs to return the true classlabel after the learner makes classification of each node. In many application scenarios; weonly have access to partial label information; where the label oracle will return a single bitindicating whether the prediction is correct or not; instead of the true class label. This is alsoknown as bandit feedback. In this paper; to overcome the above limitations of existing onlinelearning algorithms on a graph; we study online learning on a graph for multi-class nodeclassification; in both the full information setting and the partial information setting. First; wepresent an online multi-class classification algorithm in the full information setting. It is …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2014 IEEE International Conference on,2014,3

Unsupervised link selection in networks,Quanquan Gu; Charu Aggarwal; Jiawei Han,Abstract Real-world networks are often noisy; and the existing linkage structure may not bereliable. For example; a link which connects nodes from different communities may affect thegroup assignment of nodes in a negative way. In this paper; we study a new problem calledlink selection; which can be seen as the network equivalent of the traditional featureselection problem in machine learning. More specifically; we investigate unsupervised linkselection as follows: given a network; it selects a subset of informative links from the originalnetwork which enhance the quality of community structures. To achieve this goal; we useRatio Cut size of a network as the quality measure. The resulting link selection approach canbe formulated as a semi-definite programming problem. In order to solve it efficiently; wepropose a backward elimination algorithm using sequential optimization. Experiments on …,Artificial Intelligence and Statistics,2013,3

Determination of Flow Stress and Coefficient of Friction for Extruded Anisotropic Materials under Cold Forming Conditions,Han Han,ABSTRACT The work material in metal working operations always shows some kind ofanisotropy. In order to simplify the theoretical analysis; especially considering bulkdeformation processes; anisotropy is usually neglected and the material is assumed to beisotropic. On the other hand; the analysis that considered the influence of anisotropy seldomincorporates the influence of friction. For predicting the material flow during plasticdeformation and for predicting the final material properties of the product; adequatedescriptions of both flow stress curves and coefficients of friction have to be developed.

Normalization and compilation of deductive and object-oriented database programs for efficient query evaluation,Zhaohui Xie; Jiawei Han,Abstract A normalization process is proposed to serve not only as a preprocessing stage forcompilation and evaluation but also as a tool for classifying recursions. Then the query-independent compilation and chain-based evaluation method can be extended naturally toprocess a class of DOOD programs and queries. The query-independent compilationcaptures the bindings that could be difficult to be captured otherwise. The chain-basedevaluation explores query constraints; integrity constraints; recursion structures; and otherfeatures of the programs with a set of interesting techniques; such as chain-following; chain-split; and constraint pushing. Therefore; with this normalization and compilation process; aclass of DOOD queries can be evaluated efficiently in deductive and object-orienteddatabases.,International Conference on Deductive and Object-Oriented Databases,1995,3
A descending pathway of analgesia from nucleus accumbens to habenula,Yu Longchuan; Shi Yushun; Han Jisheng,Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that there may be a mesolimbic loop of analgesiabetween periaqueductal grey (PAG) and the nucleus accumbens in the rabbit. This loop consistsof an ascending analgesic pathway from PAG to nucleus accumbens (utilizing 5-hydroxytryptamineand [Met$^5$] enkephalin as its transmitters) and a descending analgesic pathway from thenucleus accumbens to PAG (utilizing [Met$^5$] enkephalin as its transmitter in PAG)$^{[1-3]}$. But now we do not know whether the descending pathway from the nucleus accumbens to PAGis directly or indirectly needing a relay of other nuclei. Habenula has been regarded as the majorlink between forebrain structure and midbrain raphe nuclei.

Given any pair of documentsfrom a (background) document collection; CDA aims to automatically identify sets of qualityphrases to summarize the commonalities of both documents and highlight the distinctions ofeach with respect to the other informatively and concisely.

A probabilistic approach to detect mixed periodic patterns from moving object data,Jun Li; Jingjing Wang; Junfei Zhang; Qiming Qin; Tanvi Jindal; Jiawei Han,Abstract The prevalence of moving object data (MOD) brings new opportunities for behaviorrelated research. Periodic behavior is one of the most important behaviors of movingobjects. However; the existing methods of detecting periodicities assume a moving objecteither does not have any periodic behavior at all or just has a single periodic behavior inone place. Thus they are incapable of dealing with many real world situations whereby amoving object may have multiple periodic behaviors mixed together. Aiming at addressingthis problem; this paper proposes a probabilistic periodicity detection method called MPDA.MPDA first identifies high dense regions by the kernel density method; then generates revisittime sequences based on the dense regions; and at last adopts a filter-refine paradigm todetect mixed periodicities. At the filter stage; candidate periods are identified by …,Geoinformatica,2016,2
Robust classification of information networks by consistent graph learning,Shi Zhi; Jiawei Han; Quanquan Gu,Abstract Graph regularization-based methods have achieved great success for networkclassification by making the label-link consistency assumption; ie; if two nodes are linkedtogether; they are likely to belong to the same class. However; in a real-world network; thereexist links that connect nodes of different classes. These inconsistent links raise a bigchallenge for graph regularization and deteriorate the classification performancesignificantly. To address this problem; we propose a novel algorithm; namely ConsistentGraph Learning; which is robust to the inconsistent links of a network. In particular; given anetwork and a small number of labeled nodes; we aim at learning a consistent network withmore consistent and fewer inconsistent links than the original network. Since the linkinformation of a network is naturally represented by a set of relation matrices; the learning …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2015,2
Torpedo: topic periodicity discovery from text data,Jingjing Wang; Hongbo Deng; Jiawei Han,Although history may not repeat itself; many human activities are inherently periodic;recurring daily; weekly; monthly; yearly or following some other periods. Such recurringactivities may not repeat the same set of keywords; but they do share similar topics. Thus it isinteresting to mine topic periodicity from text data instead of just looking at the temporalbehavior of a single keyword/phrase.

Perspective on measurement metrics for community detection algorithms,Yang Yang; Yizhou Sun; Saurav Pandit; Nitesh V Chawla; Jiawei Han,Abstract Community detection or cluster detection in networks is often at the core of miningnetwork data. Whereas the problem is well-studied; given the scale and complexity ofmodern day social networks; detecting “reasonable” communities is often a hard problem.Since the first use of k-means algorithm in 1960s; many community detection algorithmshave been presented—most of which are developed with specific goals in mind and the ideaof detecting meaningful communities varies widely from one algorithm to another. As thenumber of clustering algorithms grows; so does the number of metrics on how to measurethem. Algorithms are often reduced to optimizing the value of an objective function such asmodularity and internal density. Some of these metrics rely on ground-truth; some do not. Inthis chapter we study these algorithms and aim to find whether these optimization based …,*,2013,2
A survey of datamining methods for sensor network bug diagnosis,Tarek Abdelzaher; Jiawei Han,Abstract This chapter surveys recent debugging tools for sensor networks that are inspiredby data mining algorithms. These tools are motivated by the increased complexity and scaleof sensor network applications; making it harder to identify root causes of system problems.At a high level; debugging solutions in the domain of sensor networks can be classifiedaccording to their goal into two distinct categories;(i) solutions that attempt to localize errorsto a single node; component; or code snippet; and (ii) solutions that attempt to identify aglobal pattern that causes misbehavior to occur. The first category inherits the usual wisdomthat problems are often localized. It is unlikely for independent failures to coinside.

Troubleshooting interactive complexity bugs in wireless sensor networks using data mining techniques,Mohammad Maifi Hasan Khan; Khac Hieu Le; Hossein Ahmadi; Tarek F Abdelzaher; Jiawei Han,This article presents a tool for uncovering bugs due to interactive complexity in networkedsensing applications. Such bugs are not localized to one component that is faulty; but ratherresult from complex and unexpected interactions between multiple often individually non-faulty components. Moreover; the manifestations of these bugs are often not repeatable;making them particularly hard to find; as the particular sequence of events that invokes thebug may not be easy to reconstruct. Because of the distributed nature of failure scenarios;our tool looks for {\em sequences\/} of events that may be responsible for faulty behavior; asopposed to localized bugs such as a bad pointer in a module. We identified severalchallenges in applying discriminative sequence mining for root cause analysis when thesystem fails to perform as expected and presented our solutions to those challenges.

Subspace discovery for promotion: a cell clustering approach,Tianyi Wu; Jiawei Han,Abstract The promotion analysis problem has been proposed in; where ranking-basedpromotion query processing techniques are studied to effectively and efficiently promote agiven object; such as a product; by exploring ranked answers. To be more specific; in amultidimensional data set; our goal is to discover interesting subspaces in which the objectis ranked high. In this paper; we extend the previously proposed promotion cube techniquesand develop a cell clustering approach that is able to further achieve better tradeoff betweenoffline materialization and online query processing. We formally formulate our problem andpresent a solution to it. Our empirical evaluation on both synthetic and real data sets showthat the proposed technique can greatly speedup query processing with respect to baselineimplementations.,International Conference on Discovery Science,2009,2

Among the various approaches proposed in the literature; graphclassification based on frequent subgraphs is a popular branch: Graphs are represented as(usually binary) vectors; with components indicating whether a graph contains a particular subgraphthat is frequent across the dataset. On large graphs; however; one faces the enormous problemthat the number of these frequent subgraphs may grow exponentially with the size of thegraphs; but only few of them possess enough discriminative power to make them useful for graphclassification. Efficient and discriminative feature selection among frequent subgraphs is hencea key challenge for graph mining. In this article; we propose an approach to fea- ture …,MLG,2008,2

In this paper; threetypical types of industrial wastes were co-incinerated in the CRK at Beijing Cement Plant todetermine the effects of waste disposal (especially solid waste disposal) on the quality ofclinker and the concentration of pollutants in air emission. Experimental results show that (1)waste disposal does not affect the quality of clinker and fly ash; and fly ash after the IWdisposal can still be used in the cement production;(2) heavy metals from IW areimmobilized and stabilized in the clinker and cement; and (3) concentration of pollutants inair emission is far below than the permitted values in the China National Standard-AirPollutants Emission Standard (GB 16297-1996).

Fact updates in logic databases,Yan-Nong Huang; Verónica Dahl; Jiawei Han,A logic database has two components. One comprises the base knowledge; representedexplicitly; called the extensional base. The other stores more general knowledge in the formof derivation rules; and is called the intensional base. One may calculate derived facts inadvance and store (or materialize) them. Thus; the response time can be expected to speedup. In this paper; we study a new evaluation technique for incrementally maintaining derivedfacts whenever updates occur on base facts. Our method is based on the seminaiveevaluation so it is easy to implement; it is set-oriented; multiple updates may be dealt withina single manipulation; and insertion and deletion are treated uniformly. The method isevaluated analytically as well as experimentally.

Homomorphic tree embeddings and their applications to recursive program optimization,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Karima Ashraf; Jiawei Han,The problems of stage-preserving linearization and one-boundedness are studied for aclass of nonlinear single rule recursive programs; and syntactic characterizations aredeveloped for both. The characterizations lead to a polynomial-time algorithm for the formerand a linear-time algorithm for the latter. Stage-preserving linearization results in asignificant improvement in evaluation efficiency; compared to a linearization that does notpreserve stages. The class of nonlinear strips that are stage-preserving linearizable includesseveral classes of programs that can be linearized only using a mix of left and right linearrules; as well as programs that cannot be linearized using previously known techniques. Thestudy makes use of a technique based on the notion of homomorphic tree embeddings.,Logic in Computer Science; 1993. LICS'93.; Proceedings of Eighth Annual IEEE Symposium on,1993,2
Binding propagation beyond the reach of rule/goal graphs,Jiawei Han,Abstract Rule/goal graphs have been popularly used in the analysis of binding propagationin deductive databases. Some interesting techniques; such as the Magic rule rewriting andits variations; have been developed based on such an analysis. We re-examine the bindingpropagation in linear recursions and demonstrate that the rule/goal graph cannot capturethe binding propagation information for certain kinds of linear recursions; and hence theMagic rule rewriting technique cannot derive the minimal Magic Sets for such recursions. Acompilation technique; based on the simulation of recursive rule expansions; is proposed tosolve this problem.,Information processing letters,1992,2
Chain-based evaluation-a bridge linking recursive and nonrecursive query evaluation,Jiawei Han,Many recursive query analysis techniques are qualitative in nature. This contracts sharplywith relational query optimization which relies heavily on quantitative analysis. This papershows that chain-based evaluation facilitates quantitative analysis of recursive queriesbased on the available chain information; database statistics and other quantitativemeasurements. Chain-based evaluation not only facilitates binding propagation; constraintpushing and the selection of recursive query evaluation algorithms but also provides precisecompile chain forms in relational expressions. Since most recursions in databaseapplications can be compiled into highly regular chain forms; chain-based evaluation ispromising at bridging recursive and nonrecursive database query evaluation.,Research Issues on Data Engineering; 1992: Transaction and Query Processing; Second International Workshop on,1992,2
On the power of query-independent compilation,Jiawei Han,Abstract Recursive query processing techniques can be classified into three categories:interpretation; query-dependent compilation and query-independent compilation. Query-dependent compilation compiles IDB programs based on possible query instantiations intoquery-specific EDB programs; while query-independent compilation compiles IDB programsinto query-independent and easily analyzable EDB expressions. Previous studies show thatlinear recursions can be query-independently compiled into highly regular forms. This studyanalyzes the power of query-independent compilation and shows that (i) query-independentcompilation captures more binding information than other methods for irregular linearrecursions;(ii) the compilation provides succinct information for the selection of efficientquery processing methods; and (iii) it facilitates the constraint-based processing of …,International Conference on Computing and Information,1991,2

Different from traditional approaches; our proposed GDA framework is ableto not only estimate the reliability of each sensor; but also take advantage of its confidenceinformation; and thus achieves higher decision accuracy. Targeting generalized problemdomains; our framework can naturally handle the scenarios where different sensor nodesobserve different sets of events whose numbers of possible classes may also be different.GDA also makes no assumption about the availability level of ground truth label information;while being able to take advantage of any if present. For these reasons; our approach canbe applied to a much broader spectrum of sensing scenarios. In this paper; we also …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2018,1
An Attention-based Collaboration Framework for Multi-View Network Representation Learning,Meng Qu; Jian Tang; Jingbo Shang; Xiang Ren; Ming Zhang; Jiawei Han,Abstract Learning distributed node representations in networks has been attractingincreasing attention recently due to its effectiveness in a variety of applications. Existingapproaches usually study networks with a single type of proximity between nodes; whichdefines a single view of a network. However; in reality there usually exists multiple types ofproximities between nodes; yielding networks with multiple views. This paper studieslearning node representations for networks with multiple views; which aims to infer robustnode representations across different views. We propose a multi-view representationlearning approach; which promotes the collaboration of different views and lets them vote forthe robust representations. During the voting process; an attention mechanism is introduced;which enables each node to focus on the most informative views.

Automatic Synonym Discovery with Knowledge Bases,Meng Qu; Xiang Ren; Jiawei Han,Abstract Recognizing entity synonyms from text has become a crucial task in many entity-leveraging applications. However; discovering entity synonyms from domain-specific textcorpora (eg; news articles; scientific papers) is rather challenging. Current systems take anentity name string as input to find out other names that are synonymous; ignoring the factthat often times a name string can refer to multiple entities (eg;" apple" could refer to bothApple Inc. and the fruit apple). Moreover; most existing methods require training datamanually created by domain experts to construct supervised-learning systems. In this paper;we study the problem of automatic synonym discovery with knowledge bases; that is;identifying synonyms for knowledge base entities in a given domain-specific corpus.

Probabilistic Models for Clusterings.,Hongbo Deng; Jiawei Han,Probabilistic model-based clustering techniques have been widely used and have shownpromising results in many applications; ranging from image segmentation [71; 15];handwriting recog-nition [60]; document clustering [36; 81]; topic modeling [35; 14] toinformation retrieval [43]. Model-based clustering approaches attempt to optimize the ﬁtbetween the observed data and some mathematical model using a probabilistic approach.Such methods are often based on the assumption that the data are generated by a mixtureof underlying probability distributions. In practice; each cluster can be representedmathematically by a parametric probability distribution; such as a Gaussian or a Poissondistribution. Thus; the clustering problem is transformed into a parameter estimation problemsince the entire data can be modeled by a mixture of K component distributions.,*,2013,1
On the detectability of node grouping in networks,Chi Wang; Hongning Wang; Jialu Liu; Ming Ji; Lu Su; Yuguo Chen; Jiawei Han,Abstract In typical studies of node grouping detection; the grouping is presumed to have acertain type of correlation with the network structure (eg; densely connected groups of nodesthat are loosely connected in between). People have defined different fitness measures(modularity; conductance; etc.) to quantify such correlation; and group the nodes byoptimizing a certain fitness measure. However; a particular grouping with desired semantics;as the target of the detection; is not promised to be detectable by each measure. We study afundamental problem in the process of node grouping discovery: Given a particular groupingin a network; whether and to what extent it can be discovered with a given fitness measure.We propose two approaches of testing the detectability; namely ranking-based andcorrelation-based randomization tests.

Some following studies have shown that it is also usefifl for associatiombasedclassification; sequential or structured pattern analysis; constraint-based mining; clusteranalysis; semantic data compression; data cube computation; and so on. Identification of acrucial research problem itself makes the paper distinct from many others. Second; itdiscovers a nice and elegant property in association mining; namely Apriori; which states …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2001,1

Efficient deduction and induction: Key to the success of data-intensive knowledge-base systems,Jiawei Han,Abstract The development of powerful and efficient deduction and induction mechanisms isthe key to the success of Very Large Knowledge-Base systems (VLKBs). Based on ourstudy; we propose (1) an efficient deduction method which applies query-independentcompilation and set-oriented; chain-based evaluation in deductive databases; and (2) anefficient attribute-oriented induction method for knowledge discovery in databases. A largeknowledge-base system should support both mechanisms and their integration.,*,1993,1
On the power of query-independent compilation,Jia Wei Han,Recursive query processing techniques can be classified into three categories:interpretation; query-dependent compilation and query-independent compilation. Query-dependent compilation compiles IDB (Intensional Data Base) programs based on possiblequery instantiations into query-specific programs; while query-independent compilationcompiles IDB programs into query-independent and easily analyzable relationalexpressions. Previous studies show that linear recursions can be query-independentlycompiled into highly regular forms. This study analyzes the power of query-independentcompilation and shows that (i) query-independent compilation captures more bindinginformation than other methods for irregular linear recursions;(ii) the compilation providessuccinct information for selection of efficient query processing methods; and (iii) it …,International Journal of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering,1992,1
Fabry's Disease: A case report of electronmicroscopy and enzyme studies,Joon Mee Kim; Joung Ho Han; Nam Hee Won; Seung Yong Paik,Abstract Fabry's disease is a rare hereditary metabolic disease caused by alpha-galactosidase deficiency; resulting in abnormal accumulation of galactosyl galactosylgalactosyl ceramide (ceramide trihexoside) in various organs. Articles in English reportedapproximately one hundred cases but only two cases in Korea.

Contrast Subgraph Mining from Coherent Cores,Jingbo Shang; Xiyao Shi; Meng Jiang; Liyuan Liu; Timothy Hanratty; Jiawei Han,Abstract: Graph pattern mining methods can extract informative and useful patterns fromlarge-scale graphs and capture underlying principles through the overwhelmed information.Contrast analysis serves as a keystone in various fields and has demonstrated itseffectiveness in mining valuable information. However; it has been long overlooked in graphpattern mining. Therefore; in this paper; we introduce the concept of contrast subgraph; thatis; a subset of nodes that have significantly different edges or edge weights in two givengraphs of the same node set. The major challenge comes from the gap between the contrastand the informativeness. Because of the widely existing noise edges in real-world graphs;the contrast may lead to subgraphs of pure noise. To avoid such meaningless subgraphs;we leverage the similarity as the cornerstone of the contrast. Specifically; we first identify a …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.06189,2018,*
Curriculum Learning for Heterogeneous Star Network Embedding via Deep Reinforcement Learning,Meng Qu; Jian Tang; Jiawei Han,Abstract Learning node representations for networks has attracted much attention recentlydue to its effectiveness in a variety of applications. This paper focuses on learning noderepresentations for heterogeneous star networks; which have a center node type linked withmultiple attribute node types through different types of edges. In heterogeneous starnetworks; we observe that the training order of different types of edges affects the learningperformance significantly. Therefore we study learning curricula for node representationlearning in heterogeneous star networks; ie; learning an optimal sequence of edges ofdifferent types for the node representation learning process. We formulate the problem as aMarkov decision process; with the action as selecting a specific type of edges for learning orterminating the training process; and the state as the sequence of edge types selected so …,Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2018,*
Cross-type Biomedical Named Entity Recognition with Deep Multi-Task Learning,Xuan Wang; Yu Zhang; Xiang Ren; Yuhao Zhang; Marinka Zitnik; Jingbo Shang; Curtis Langlotz; Jiawei Han,Abstract: Motivation: Biomedical named entity recognition (BioNER) is the most fundamentaltask in biomedical text mining. State-of-the-art BioNER systems often require handcraftedfeatures specifically designed for each type of biomedical entities. This feature generationprocess requires intensive labors from biomedical and linguistic experts; and makes itdifficult to adapt these systems to new biomedical entity types. Although recent studiesexplored using neural network models for BioNER to free experts from manual featuregeneration; these models still require substantial human efforts to annotate massive trainingdata. Results: We propose a multi-task learning framework for BioNER that is based onneural network models to save human efforts. We build a global model by collectivelytraining multiple models that share parameters; each model capturing the characteristics …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.09851,2018,*

In order to extractknowledge or business value; it is of interest to transform such networks into representationsthat are easily machine-actionable. Meanwhile; network embedding has emerged as aneffective approach to generate distributed network representations. Therefore; we aremotivated to study the problem of multi-view network embedding; with a focus on thecharacteristics that are specific and important in embedding this type of networks. In ourpractice of embedding real-world multi-view networks; we identify two such characteristics;which we refer to as preservation and collaboration. We then explore the feasibility ofachieving better embedding quality by simultaneously modeling preservation andcollaboration; and propose the mvn2vec algorithms.

Overcoming Limited Supervision in Relation Extraction: A Pattern-enhanced Distributional Representation Approach,Meng Qu; Xiang Ren; Yu Zhang; Jiawei Han,Abstract: Extracting relations from text corpora is an important task in text mining. It becomesparticularly challenging when focusing on weakly-supervised relation extraction; that is;utilizing a few relation instances (ie; a pair of entities and their relation) as seeds to extractmore instances from corpora. Existing distributional approaches leverage the corpus-levelco-occurrence statistics of entities to predict their relations; and require large number oflabeled instances to learn effective relation classifiers. Alternatively; pattern-basedapproaches perform bootstrapping or apply neural networks to model the local contexts; butstill rely on large number of labeled instances to build reliable models. In this paper; westudy integrating the distributional and pattern-based methods in a weakly-supervisedsetting; such that the two types of methods can provide complementary supervision for …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.03226,2017,*
Detecting Multiple Periods and Periodic Patterns in Event Time Sequences,Quan Yuan; Jingbo Shang; Xin Cao; Chao Zhang; Xinhe Geng; Jiawei Han,Abstract Periodicity is prevalent in physical world; and many events involve more than oneperiods; eg individual's mobility; tide pattern; and massive transportation utilization. Knowingthe true periods of events can benefit a number of applications; such as traffic prediction;time-aware recommendation and advertisement; and anomaly detection. However;detecting multiple periods is a very challenging task due to not only the interwoven periodicpatterns but also the low quality of event tracking records. In this paper; we study theproblem of discovering all true periods and the corresponded occurring patterns of an eventfrom a noisy and incomplete observation sequence. We devise a novel scoring function; bymaximizing which we can identify the true periodic patterns involved in the sequence.

Reaching young married couples in Bangladesh: An underserved population for long-acting methods of contraception.,Z Sultana; SA Shareef; L Ali; M Rahman; E Themmen; AJ Faisel,In Bangladesh more than 70% of married adolescents become pregnant before their firstanniversary and the mean age at first pregnancy is 16.4. Young couples rarely usecontraception before the birth of their first child. An 18-month project to provide youngmarried couples with better information and services on family planning trained peers to bethe main source of information for young men and women in the community and to serve asa link between the community and a facility. An evaluation revealed a small increase incontraceptive use and a shift to more effective methods (the intrauterine device [IUD] andhormonal implants) as well as higher levels of communication about family planningbetween spouses.,*,2013,*
Key to the Success of Data-Intensive Knowledge-Base Systems,Jiawei Han,Abstract The development of powerful and efficient deduction and induction mech-anisms isthe key to the success of Very Large Knowledge-Base sys-tems (VLKBs). Based on ourstudy; we propose (1) an efficient de-duction method which applies query-independentcompilation and set-oriented; chain-based evaluation in deductive databases; and (2) an ef-ficient attribute-oriented induction method for knowledge discovery in databases. A largeknowledge-base system should support both mecha-nisms and their integration.,Formal Methods in Databases and Software Engineering: Proceedings of the Workshop on Formal Methods in Databases and Software Engineering; Montreal; Canada; 15–16 May 1992,2012,*
An Attribute-Oriented Rough Set,Xiaohua Hu; Nick Cercone; Jiawei Han,Abstract In this paper we present an attribute-oriented rough set approach for knowledgediscovery in databases. The method integrates machine learning paradigm; especiallylearning-from-examples techniques; with roughset techniques. An attribute-oriented concepttree ascension technique is first applied in generalization; which substantially reduces thecomputational complexity of database learning processes. Then the causeeffect relationshipamong the attributes in the database is analyzed using rough set techniques and theunimportant or irrelevant attributes are eliminated. Thus concise and strong rules with little orno redundant information can be learned efficiently. Our study shows that attributeorientedinduction combined with the rough set technique provides an efficient and effectivemechanism for knowledge discovery in database systems.,Rough Sets; Fuzzy Sets and Knowledge Discovery: Proceedings of the International Workshop on Rough Sets and Knowledge Discovery (RSKD’93); Banff; Alberta; Canada; 12–15 October 1993,2012,*

KEYWORD SEARCH IN TEXT CUBE: FINDING TOP-K RELEVANT CELLS,Bolin Ding; Yintao Yu; Bo Zhao; Cindy Xide Lin; Jiawei Han; Chengxiang Zhai,Abstract. We study the problem of keyword search in a data cube with text-rich dimension(s)(so-called text cube). The text cube is built on a multidimensional text database; whereeach row is associated with some text data (eg; a document) and other structural dimensions(attributes). A cell in the text cube aggregates a set of documents with matching attributevalues in a subset of dimensions. A cell document is the concatenation of all documents in acell. Given a keyword query; our goal is to find the top-k most relevant cells (rankedaccording to the relevance scores of cell documents wrt the given query) in the text cube. Wedefine a keyword-based query language and apply IR-style relevance model for scoring andranking cell documents in the text cube. We propose two efficient approaches to find the top-k answers.

Growing Parallel Paths for Entity-Page Retrieval,Tim Weninger; Cindy Xide Lin; Jiawei Han,ABSTRACT It has been the dream of the database and web communities to reconcile theunstructured nature of the World Wide Web with the neat; structured schemas of thedatabase paradigm. Even though databases are currently used to generate web content in asite; the schemas of these databases are rarely universal across a domain and thepresentation of the data is never consistent. This makes comparison and aggregation ofinformation from different domains difficult. This paper aims to make an important steptowards resolving this disparity by using the structural and relational information on the Webto find entity-pages. Specifically; given a Web site and an entity-page (eg; department andfaculty member homepage) we seek to find all of the entity-pages of the same type (allfaculty members in the department). To do this; we propose a web structure mining …,*,2010,*

UnkClus,Xiaoxin Yin; Jiawei Han; S Yu Philip,Abstract Uata objects in a relational database are cross-linked with each other via multi-typed links. Links contain rich seman-tic information that may indicate importantrelationships among objects. Most current clustering methods rely only on the properties thatbelong to the objects per se. Howler; the similarities between objects are often indicated bythe links; and desirable clusters cannot be generated using only the properties of objects. Inthis paper we explore linkage-based clustering; in which the similarity between two objectsis measured based on the similarities between the objects linked with them. In comparisonwith a previous study (SimRank) that computes links recursively on all pairs of objects; wetake advantage of the power law distribution of links; and develop a hi-erarchical structurecalled SimTree to represent similarities in multi-granularity manner.

Accelerating DNA sequencing-by-hybridization with noise,Chen Chen; Dong Xin; Jiawei Han,Abstract As a potential alternative to current wet-lab technologies; DNA sequencing-by-hybridization (SBH) has received much attention from different research communities. Inorder to deal with real applications; experiment environments should not be considered aserror-free. Previously; under the assumption of random independent hybridization errors;Leong et al.[9] presented an algorithm for sequence reconstruction which exhibits gracefuldegradation of output accuracy as the error rate increases. However; as the authors alsoadmitted; a notable downside of their method is its too high computational cost. In this paper;we show that the poor efficiency of [9] is due to its mixing-up of situations with widelydifferent characteristics and treating everything in the safest but also slowest way. Our newalgorithm addresses this problem and pushes analysis down to a finer level where a …,Proceedings of the 5th international workshop on Bioinformatics,2005,*

Nano-welding of multi-wall carbon nanotubes,Zhenxia Wang; Liping Yu; Wei Zhang; Litao Sun; Jiaguang Han; Zhiyuan Zhu; Guowei He; Yi Chen; Gang Hu,The authors have demonstrated for the first time that a larger amount of junctions wereformed by multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)-converted amorphous carbon nanowires(ACNWs) during carbon ion beam irradiation. This is very suitable for production of noveltype junction-like structures consisting of amorphous nanowires with uniform diameter oftrunk and branches. The present method; ion-beam weld (IBW) of crossed MWCNTs; notonly used to provide a powerful way in which to achieve perfect welding to build variousjunction-like structures; but also may be helpful for preparing other systems or aligned arrayson substrates by micro-manipulator for potential device.(authors),Nuclear Physics Review,2005,*

Relation of asid-volatile sulfide and clay content of sediment to the bioavailability of zinc and cadmium: laboratory plus field experiment,HAN Jianbo; WANG Juying; MA Deyi; QUAN Xie,英文摘要: Organic matter and iron and maganese oxides have been considered as themajor affecting factors for metals in anoxic or oxidized sediment. In recent research; clay andsulfide are found as major factors in oxic or oxidized sediments that might affectbioavailability of metals. To test this hypothesis; the influence of sulfide; measured as acid-volatile sulfide (AVS); and clay content on the bioavailability of zinc and cadmium insediments was examined. Laboratory simulative experiment and field verificationexperiment were conducted; showing that the bioavailability of zinc and cadmium is stronglycorrelated to AVS and clay content in sediments. Taking into account both AVS and clayparameters in sediments together can better indicate the bioavailability of zinc and cadmiumrather than considering one of them alone.,海洋学报 (中文版),2005,*

Determination of Coefficient of Friction and Anisotropy in Metalworking,Han Han,The work material in metal working operations always showssome kind of anisotropy. Tosimplify the theoretical analysis; anisotropy is usually neglected and the material is assumedtobe isotropic; especially in determination of coefficients offriction. For predicting the materialflow during plasticdeformation and for predicting the final material properties ofthe product;adequate descriptions of both coefficients offriction and flow stress curves have to bedeveloped.In the present work; a new pattern describing the influenceof friction andanisotropy on material flow has been identifiedand verified by means of 3D-FEM analysesand experiments inring compression tests. Results reveal that the influence ofanisotropy onthe ring deformation is quite similar to thatobtained by changing the frictional condition.

From transitive closure recursions to single-chain recursions,Jiawei Han,Abstract A single-chain recursion; whose compiled formula is in a single-chain form; is ageneralization of the transitive closure recursion. In this paper the compilation of linearrecursions to single-chain recursions is studied by the variable connection graph analysis;which characterizes the linear recursions compilable to single-chain recursions and showsthat many seemingly complicated linear recursions are single-chain recursions and can beprocessed by transitive closure strategies. Moreover; we extend the domain of our study tolinear recursions with function symbols and show that many such recursions can also becompiled to single-chain recursions and processed similarly by transitive closure strategies.,Information Systems,1990,*

COE: Clustering with Obstacles Entities A Preliminary Study Anthony KH Tung Jean Hou Jiawei Han School of Computing Science Simon Fraser University,Anthony KH Tung; Jean Hou; Jiawei Han,Abstract. Clustering analysis has been a very active area of research in the data miningcommunity. However; most algorithms have ignored the fact that physical obstacles exist inthe real world and could thus affect the result of clustering dramatically. In this paper; we willlook at the problem of clustering in the presence of obstacles. We called this problem theCOE (Clustering with Obstacles Entities) problem and provide an outline of an algorithmcalled COE-CLARANS to solve it.,*,*,*

Knowledge Discovery in Databases: A Rule-Based Attribute-Oriented Approach David Wai-lok Cheung*; Ada Wai-Chee Fu2 and Jiawei Han3** 1 Department of Co...,David Wai-lok Cheung; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jiawei Han,Abstract. An attribute-oriented induction has been developed in the previous study ofknowledge discovery in databases. A concept tree ascension technique is applied inconcept generalization. In this paper; we extend the background knowledge representationfrom an unconditional non-rule-based concept hierarchy to a rule-based concept hierarchy;which enhances greatly its representation power. An efficient rulebased attribute-orientedinduction algorithm is developed to facilitate learning with a rule-based concept graph. Aninformation loss problem which is special to rule-based induction is described together witha solution suggested.,*,*,*

Under consideration for publication in Knowledge and Information Systems,Petre Tzvetkov; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han,Abstract. Sequential pattern mining has been studied extensively in data mining community.Most previous studies require the specification of a min support threshold for mining acomplete set of sequential patterns satisfying the threshold. However; in practice; it is difficultfor users to provide an appropriate min support threshold. To overcome this difficulty; wepropose an alternative mining task: mining top-k frequent closed sequential patterns oflength no less than min ą; where k is the desired number of closed sequential patterns to bemined; and min ą is the minimal length of each pattern. We mine the set of closed patternssince it is a compact representation of the complete set of frequent patterns. An efficientalgorithm; called TSP; is developed for mining such patterns without min support. Starting at(absolute) min support= 1; the algorithm makes use of the length constraint and the …,*,*,*

An icebergcube is the set of all cells in a data cube that satisfy certain constraints; such as a minimumsupport threshold. Previous studies developed some efficient methods for computingiceberg cubes for simple measures; such as count and sum of nonnegative values.However; it is still a challenging problem to efficiently compute iceberg cubes with complexmeasures; such as average; sum of mixture of nonnegative and negative values; etc. In thispaper; we study efficient methods for computing iceberg cubes with some popularly usedcomplex measures and develop a methodology that uses a weaker but anti-monotonic …,*,*,*

Approximate Frequent Pattern Mining,S Yu Philip; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han; Hong Cheng; Feida Zhu,Summary Frequent pattern mining has been a focused theme in data mining research andan important first step in the analysis of data arising in a broad range of applications. Thetraditional exact model for frequent pattern requires that every item occurs in eachsupporting transaction. However; real application data is usually subject to random noise ormeasurement error; which poses new challenges for the efficient discovery of frequentpattern from the noisy data. Mining approximate frequent pattern in the presence of noiseinvolves two key issues: the definition of a noise-tolerant mining model and the design of anefficient mining algorithm. In this paper; we will give an overview of the approximate itemsetand sequential pattern mining.,*,*,*

There have been a lot of studies on effective stream datamanagement and query processing; as well as some recent studies on stream data mining.Although this is a promising direction; most existing studies have not paid enough attentionto one critical fact: most data streams reside at a rather low level of abstraction and are multi-dimensional in nature; whereas most analysts are interested in finding characteristicfeatures; unusual patterns; and dynamic changes (such as trends and outliers) at relativelyhigh levels of abstraction and in certain multi-dimensional space. To accomplish such tasks;one may need to develop effective mechanisms for on-line; multi-dimensional analysis andmining of stream data. This poses great challenges on system architecture …,*,*,*

Efficient Mining of Partial Periodic Patterns in Time Series Database In ICDE 99,Jiawei Han; Guozhu Dong; Yiwen Yin,Abstract Partial periodicity search; ie; search for partial periodic patterns in time-seriesdatabases; is an interesting data mining problem. Previous studies on periodicity searchmainly consider finding full periodic patterns; where every point in time contributes (preciselyor approximately) to the periodicity. However; partial periodicity is very common in practicesince it is more likely that only some of the time episodes may exhibit periodic patterns. Wepresent several algorithms for efficient mining of partial periodic patterns; by exploring someinteresting properties related to partial periodicity; such as the Apriori property and the max-subpattern hit set property; and by shared mining of multiple periods. The max-subpattern hitset property is a vital new property which allows us to derive the counts of all frequentpatterns from a relatively small subset of patterns existing in the time series. We show that …,*,*,*

Normalization and Compilation of Deductive and Object-Oriented Database Programs for E cient Query Evaluation?,Zhaohui Xie; Jiawei Han,Abstract. A normalization process is proposed to serve not only as a preprocessing stage forcompilation and evaluation but also as a tool for classifying recursions. Then the query-independent compilation and chain-based evaluation method can be extended naturally toprocess a class of DOOD programs and queries. The query-independent compilationcaptures the bindings that could be di cult to be captured otherwise. The chain-basedevaluation explores query constraints; integrity constraints; recursion structures; and otherfeatures of the programs with a set of interesting techniques; such as chain-following; chain-split; and constraint pushing. Therefore; with this normalization and compilation process; aclass of DOOD queries can be evaluated e ciently in deductive and object-orienteddatabases.,*,*,*

RFID-Miner: Warehousing and Mining Massive RFID Data Sets,Hector Gonzalez; Jiawei Han; Xiaolei Li; Diego Klabjan,Abstract Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) applications will play an essential role inobject tracking and supply chain management systems. In the near future; it is expected thatevery major retailer will use RFID systems to track the product movements from suppliers towarehouses; store shelves; and eventually to points of sale. The volume of informationgenerated by such systems can be enormous as each individual object (a pallet; a case; oran individual item) will leave a trail of data as it moves through different locations. Themovement trails of such RFID data form a gigantic repository that contains rich informationabout the characteristics; changes; trends; and outliers of commodity flows. In this demo; wewill present an RFID-Miner system that constructs RFID data warehouses and minesknowledge from such data in the following aspects:(1) RFID data from multiple sites are …,*,*,*

1. High quality of data in data warehouses. M ost data,Jiawei Han; Sonny HS Chee; Jenny Y Chiang,Data warehouses and OLAP engines are expected to be widely available in the near future.The data in data warehouses has been cleansed; integrated; and preprocessed; andinfrastructures have been built surrounding data warehouses for efficient data analysis.Therefore; data warehouses or OLAP databases are expected to be a major platform fordata mining in the future. We discuss the issues related to efficient and effective data miningin large data warehouses and/or data marts; including the desired architectures for anintegrated on-line analytical processing (OLAP) and on-line analytical mining (OLAM)system; the expected features of OLAM; and how to implement such a system effectively.,*,*,*
Beyond Intra-Transaction Association Analysis: Mining Multi-Dimensional Inter-Transaction Association Rules Hongjun Lu Hong Kong University of Science and Tec...,Ling Feng; Jiawei Han,In this paper; we extend the scope of mining association rules from traditional single-dimensional intra-transaction associations; to multi-dimensional inter-transactionassociations. Intra-transaction associations are the associations among items within thesame transaction; where the notion of the transaction could be the items bought by the samecustomer; the events happened on the same day; and so on. However; an inter-transactionassociation describes the association relationships among different transactions; such as" if(company) A's stock goes up on day 1; B's stock will go down on day 2; but go up on day 4."In this case; whether we treat company or day as the unit of transaction; the associated itemsbelong to different transactions. Moreover; such an intertransaction association can beextended to associate multiple contextual properties in the same rule; so that multi …,*,*,*
