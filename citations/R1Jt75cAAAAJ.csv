Learning influence probabilities in social networks,Amit Goyal; Francesco Bonchi; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Recently; there has been tremendous interest in the phenomenon of influencepropagation in social networks. The studies in this area assume they have as input to theirproblems a social graph with edges labeled with probabilities of influence between users.However; the question of where these probabilities come from or how they can be computedfrom real social network data has been largely ignored until now. Thus it is interesting to askwhether from a social graph and a log of actions by its users; one can build models ofinfluence. This is the main problem attacked in this paper. In addition to proposing modelsand algorithms for learning the model parameters and for testing the learned models tomake predictions; we also develop techniques for predicting the time by which a user maybe expected to perform an action. We validate our ideas and techniques using the Flickr …,Proceedings of the third ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2010,815
Never walk alone: Uncertainty for anonymity in moving objects databases,Osman Abul; Francesco Bonchi; Mirco Nanni,Preserving individual privacy when publishing data is a problem that is receiving increasingattention. According to the k-anonymity principle; each release of data must be such thateach individual is indistinguishable from at least k-1 other individuals. In this paper we studythe problem of anonymity preserving data publishing in moving objects databases. Wepropose a novel concept of k-anonymity based on co-localization that exploits the inherentuncertainty of the moving object's whereabouts. Due to sampling and positioning systems(eg; GPS) imprecision; the trajectory of a moving object is no longer a polyline in a three-dimensional space; instead it is a cylindrical volume; where its radius¿ represents thepossible location imprecision: we know that the trajectory of the moving object is within thiscylinder; but we do not know exactly where. If another object moves within the same …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,396
The query-flow graph: model and applications,Paolo Boldi; Francesco Bonchi; Carlos Castillo; Debora Donato; Aristides Gionis; Sebastiano Vigna,Abstract Query logs record the queries and the actions of the users of search engines; andas such they contain valuable information about the interests; the preferences; and thebehavior of the users; as well as their implicit feedback to search engine results. Mining thewealth of information available in the query logs has many important applications includingquery-log analysis; user profiling and personalization; advertising; query recommendation;and more. In this paper we introduce the query-flow graph; a graph representation of theinteresting knowledge about latent querying behavior. Intuitively; in the query-flow graph adirected edge from query qi to query qj means that the two queries are likely to be part of thesame" search mission". Any path over the query-flow graph may be seen as a searchingbehavior; whose likelihood is given by the strength of the edges along the path.,Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2008,334
A data-based approach to social influence maximization,Amit Goyal; Francesco Bonchi; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Influence maximization is the problem of finding a set of users in a social network;such that by targeting this set; one maximizes the expected spread of influence in thenetwork. Most of the literature on this topic has focused exclusively on the social graph;overlooking historical data; ie; traces of past action propagations. In this paper; we studyinfluence maximization from a novel data-based perspective. In particular; we introduce anew model; which we call credit distribution; that directly leverages available propagationtraces to learn how influence flows in the network and uses this to estimate expectedinfluence spread. Our approach also learns the different levels of influence-ability of users;and it is time-aware in the sense that it takes the temporal nature of influence into account.We show that influence maximization under the credit distribution model is NP-hard and …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,298
Social network analysis and mining for business applications,Francesco Bonchi; Carlos Castillo; Aristides Gionis; Alejandro Jaimes,Abstract Social network analysis has gained significant attention in recent years; largely dueto the success of online social networking and media-sharing sites; and the consequentavailability of a wealth of social network data. In spite of the growing interest; however; thereis little understanding of the potential business applications of mining social networks. Whilethere is a large body of research on different problems and methods for social networkmining; there is a gap between the techniques developed by the research community andtheir deployment in real-world applications. Therefore the potential business impact of thesetechniques is still largely unexplored. In this article we use a business process classificationframework to put the research topics in a business context and provide an overview of whatwe consider key problems and techniques in social network analysis and mining from the …,ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST),2011,240
Fast shortest path distance estimation in large networks,Michalis Potamias; Francesco Bonchi; Carlos Castillo; Aristides Gionis,Abstract In this paper we study approximate landmark-based methods for point-to-pointdistance estimation in very large networks. These methods involve selecting a subset ofnodes as landmarks and computing offline the distances from each node in the graph tothose landmarks. At runtime; when the distance between a pair of nodes is needed; it can beestimated quickly by combining the precomputed distances. We prove that selecting theoptimal set of landmarks is an NP-hard problem; and thus heuristic solutions need to beemployed. We therefore explore theoretical insights to devise a variety of simple methodsthat scale well in very large networks. The efficiency of the suggested techniques is testedexperimentally using five real-world graphs having millions of edges. While theoreticalbounds support the claim that random landmarks work well in practice; our extensive …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,226
Mining graph evolution rules,Michele Berlingerio; Francesco Bonchi; Björn Bringmann; Aristides Gionis,Abstract In this paper we introduce graph-evolution rules; a novel type of frequency-basedpattern that describe the evolution of large networks over time; at a local level. Given asequence of snapshots of an evolving graph; we aim at discovering rules describing thelocal changes occurring in it. Adopting a definition of support based on minimum image westudy the problem of extracting patterns whose frequency is larger than a minimum supportthreshold. Then; similar to the classical association rules framework; we derive graph-evolution rules from frequent patterns that satisfy a given minimum confidence constraint.We discuss merits and limits of alternative definitions of support and confidence; justifyingthe chosen framework. To evaluate our approach we devise GERM (Graph Evolution RuleMiner); an algorithm to mine all graph-evolution rules whose support and confidence are …,joint European conference on machine learning and knowledge discovery in databases,2009,169
Discovering leaders from community actions,Amit Goyal; Francesco Bonchi; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract We introduce a novel frequent pattern mining approach to discover leaders andtribes in social networks. In particular; we consider social networks where users performactions. Actions may be as simple as tagging resources (urls) as in del. icio. us; rating songsas in Yahoo! Music; or movies as in Yahoo! Movies; or users buying gadgets such ascameras; handhelds; etc. and blogging a review on the gadgets. The assumption is thatactions performed by a user can be seen by their network friends. Users seeing their friends'actions are sometimes tempted to perform those actions. We are interested in the problem ofstudying the propagation of such" influence"; and on this basis; identifying which users areleaders when it comes to setting the trend for performing various actions. We consideralternative definitions of leaders based on frequent patterns and develop algorithms for …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2008,166
Query suggestions using query-flow graphs,Paolo Boldi; Francesco Bonchi; Carlos Castillo; Debora Donato; Sebastiano Vigna,Abstract The query-flow graph [Boldi et al.; CIKM 2008] is an aggregated representation ofthe latent querying behavior contained in a query log. Intuitively; in the query-flow graph adirected edge from query qi to query qj means that the two queries are likely to be part of thesame search mission. Any path over the query-flow graph may be seen as a possible searchtask; whose likelihood is given by the strength of the edges along the path. An edge (qi; qj) isalso labelled with some information: eg; the probability that user moves from qi to qj; or thetype of the transition; for instance; the fact that qj is a specialization of q i. In this paper wepropose; and experimentally study; query recommendations based on short random walkson the query-flow graph. Our experiments show that these methods can match in precision;and often improve; recommendations based on query-click graphs; without using users' …,Proceedings of the 2009 workshop on Web Search Click Data,2009,150
Anonymizing moving objects: How to hide a mob in a crowd?,Roman Yarovoy; Francesco Bonchi; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Wendy Hui Wang,Abstract Moving object databases (MOD) have gained much interest in recent years due tothe advances in mobile communications and positioning technologies. Study of MOD canreveal useful information (eg; traffic patterns and congestion trends) that can be used inapplications for the common benefit. In order to mine and/or analyze the data; MOD must bepublished; which can pose a threat to the location privacy of a user. Indeed; based on priorknowledge of a user's location at several time points; an attacker can potentially associatethat user to a specific moving object (MOB) in the published database and learn her positioninformation at other time points. In this paper; we study the problem of privacy-preservingpublishing of moving object database. Unlike in microdata; we argue that in MOD; theredoes not exist a fixed set of quasi-identifier (QID) attributes for all the MOBs …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,140
Cold start link prediction,Vincent Leroy; B Barla Cambazoglu; Francesco Bonchi,Abstract In the traditional link prediction problem; a snapshot of a social network is used as astarting point to predict; by means of graph-theoretic measures; the links that are likely toappear in the future. In this paper; we introduce cold start link prediction as the problem ofpredicting the structure of a social network when the network itself is totally missing whilesome other information regarding the nodes is available. We propose a two-phase methodbased on the bootstrap probabilistic graph. The first phase generates an implicit socialnetwork under the form of a probabilistic graph. The second phase applies probabilisticgraph-based measures to produce the final prediction. We assess our method empiricallyover a large data collection obtained from Flickr; using interest groups as the initialinformation. The experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach.,Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2010,136
Sparsification of influence networks,Michael Mathioudakis; Francesco Bonchi; Carlos Castillo; Aristides Gionis; Antti Ukkonen,Abstract We present Spine; an efficient algorithm for finding the" backbone" of an influencenetwork. Given a social graph and a log of past propagations; we build an instance of theindependent-cascade model that describes the propagations. We aim at reducing thecomplexity of that model; while preserving most of its accuracy in describing the data. Weshow that the problem is inapproximable and we present an optimal; dynamic-programmingalgorithm; whose search space; albeit exponential; is typically much smaller than that of thebrute force; exhaustive-search approach. Seeking a practical; scalable approach tosparsification; we devise Spine; a greedy; efficient algorithm with practically littlecompromise in quality.,Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2011,134
K-nearest neighbors in uncertain graphs,Michalis Potamias; Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis; George Kollios,Abstract Complex networks; such as biological; social; and communication networks; oftenentail uncertainty; and thus; can be modeled as probabilistic graphs. Similar to the problemof similarity search in standard graphs; a fundamental problem for probabilistic graphs is toefficiently answer k-nearest neighbor queries (k-NN); which is the problem of computing thek closest nodes to some specific node. In this paper we introduce a framework forprocessing k-NN queries in probabilistic graphs. We propose novel distance functions thatextend well-known graph concepts; such as shortest paths. In order to compute them inprobabilistic graphs; we design algorithms based on sampling. During k-NN queryprocessing we efficiently prune the search space using novel techniques.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,127
Denser than the densest subgraph: extracting optimal quasi-cliques with quality guarantees,Charalampos Tsourakakis; Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis; Francesco Gullo; Maria Tsiarli,Abstract Finding dense subgraphs is an important graph-mining task with many applications.Given that the direct optimization of edge density is not meaningful; as even a single edgeachieves maximum density; research has focused on optimizing alternative densityfunctions. A very popular among such functions is the average degree; whose maximizationleads to the well-known densest-subgraph notion. Surprisingly enough; however; densestsubgraphs are typically large graphs; with small edge density and large diameter. In thispaper; we define a novel density function; which gives subgraphs of much higher qualitythan densest subgraphs: the graphs found by our method are compact; dense; and withsmaller diameter. We show that the proposed function can be derived from a generalframework; which includes other important density functions as subcases and for which …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2013,121
Anonymity preserving pattern discovery,Maurizio Atzori; Francesco Bonchi; Fosca Giannotti; Dino Pedreschi,Abstract It is generally believed that data mining results do not violate the anonymity of theindividuals recorded in the source database. In fact; data mining models and patterns; inorder to ensure a required statistical significance; represent a large number of individualsand thus conceal individual identities: this is the case of the minimum support threshold infrequent pattern mining. In this paper we show that this belief is ill-founded. By shifting theconcept of k-anonymity from the source data to the extracted patterns; we formallycharacterize the notion of a threat to anonymity in the context of pattern discovery; andprovide a methodology to efficiently and effectively identify all such possible threats thatarise from the disclosure of the set of extracted patterns. On this basis; we obtain a formalnotion of privacy protection that allows the disclosure of the extracted knowledge while …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2008,120
Topic-aware social influence propagation models,Nicola Barbieri; Francesco Bonchi; Giuseppe Manco,We study social influence from a topic modeling perspective. We introduce novel topic-aware influence-driven propagation models that experimentally result to be more accurate indescribing real-world cascades than the standard propagation models studied in theliterature. In particular; we first propose simple topic-aware extensions of the well-knownIndependent Cascade and Linear Threshold models. Next; we propose a different approachexplicitly modeling authoritativeness; influence and relevance under a topic-awareperspective. We devise methods to learn the parameters of the models from a dataset of pastpropagations. Our experimentation confirms the high accuracy of the proposed models andlearning schemes.,Data Mining (ICDM); 2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on,2012,119
Learning and predicting the evolution of social networks,Björn Bringmann; Michele Berlingerio; Francesco Bonchi; Arisitdes Gionis,With the increasing availability of large social network data; there is also an increasinginterest in analyzing how those networks evolve over time. Traditionally; the analysis ofsocial networks has focused only on a single snapshot of a network. Researchers havealready verified that social networks follow power-law degree distribution; have a smalldiameter; and exhibit small-world structure and community structure. Attempts to explain theproperties of social networks have led to dynamic models inspired by the preferentialattachment models which assumes that new network nodes have a higher probability offorming links with high-degree nodes; creating a rich-get-richer effect. Although some efforthas been devoted to analyzing global properties of social network evolution; not much hasbeen done to study graph evolution at a microscopic level. A first step in this direction …,IEEE Intelligent Systems,2010,119
A classification-based methodology for planning audit strategies in fraud detection,Francesco Bonchi; Fosca Giannotti; Gianni Mainetto; Dino Pedreschi,ABSTRACT Planning adequate audit strategies is a key success factor in a posterion'frauddetection; eg; in the fiscal and insurance domains; where audits are intended to detect taxevasion and fraudulent claims. A case study is presented in this paper; which illustrates howtechniques based on classification can be used to support the task of planning auditstrategies. The proposed approach is sensible to some conflicting issues of audit planning;eg; the trade-off between maximizing audit benefits vs. minimizing audit costs. Amethodological scenario; common to a whole class of similar applications; is then abstractedaway from the case study.

On minimizing budget and time in influence propagation over social networks,Amit Goyal; Francesco Bonchi; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Suresh Venkatasubramanian,Abstract In recent years; study of influence propagation in social networks has gainedtremendous attention. In this context; we can identify three orthogonal dimensions—thenumber of seed nodes activated at the beginning (known as budget); the expected numberof activated nodes at the end of the propagation (known as expected spread or coverage);and the time taken for the propagation. We can constrain one or two of these and try tooptimize the third. In their seminal paper; Kempe et al. constrained the budget; left timeunconstrained; and maximized the coverage: this problem is known as InfluenceMaximization (or MAXINF for short). In this paper; we study alternative optimization problemswhich are naturally motivated by resource and time constraints on viral marketingcampaigns. In the first problem; termed minimum target set selection (or MINTSS for short) …,Social network analysis and mining,2013,109
Web log data warehousing and mining for intelligent web caching,Francesco Bonchi; Fosca Giannotti; Cristian Gozzi; Giuseppe Manco; Mirco Nanni; Dino Pedreschi; Chiara Renso; Salvatore Ruggieri,Abstract We introduce intelligent web caching algorithms that employ predictive models ofweb requests; the general idea is to extend the least recently used (LRU) policy of web andproxy servers by making it sensitive to web access models extracted from web log datausing data mining techniques. Two approaches have been studied in particular; frequentpatterns and decision trees. The experimental results of the new algorithms show substantialimprovement over existing LRU-based caching techniques; in terms of hit rate. We designedand developed a prototypical system; which supports data warehousing of web log data;extraction of data mining models and simulation of the web caching algorithms.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2001,107
Anonymization of moving objects databases by clustering and perturbation,Osman Abul; Francesco Bonchi; Mirco Nanni,Abstract Preserving individual privacy when publishing data is a problem that is receivingincreasing attention. Thanks to its simplicity the concept of k-anonymity; introduced bySamarati and Sweeney [1]; established itself as one fundamental principle for privacypreserving data publishing. According to the k-anonymity principle; each release of datamust be such that each individual is indistinguishable from at least k− 1 other individuals. Inthis article we tackle the problem of anonymization of moving objects databases.

The role of information diffusion in the evolution of social networks,Lilian Weng; Jacob Ratkiewicz; Nicola Perra; Bruno Gonçalves; Carlos Castillo; Francesco Bonchi; Rossano Schifanella; Filippo Menczer; Alessandro Flammini,Abstract Every day millions of users are connected through online social networks;generating a rich trove of data that allows us to study the mechanisms behind humaninteractions. Triadic closure has been treated as the major mechanism for creating sociallinks: if Alice follows Bob and Bob follows Charlie; Alice will follow Charlie. Here we presentan analysis of longitudinal micro-blogging data; revealing a more nuanced view of thestrategies employed by users when expanding their social circles. While the networkstructure affects the spread of information among users; the network is in turn shaped by thiscommunication activity. This suggests a link creation mechanism whereby Alice is morelikely to follow Charlie after seeing many messages by Charlie. We characterize users with aset of parameters associated with different link creation strategies; estimated by a …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2013,103
On closed constrained frequent pattern mining,Francesco Bonchi; Claudio Lucchese,Constrained frequent patterns and closed frequent patterns are two paradigms aimed atreducing the set of extracted patterns to a smaller; more interesting; subset. Although a lot ofwork has been done with both these paradigms; there is still confusion around the miningproblem obtained by joining closed and constrained frequent patterns in a uniqueframework. In this paper; we shed light on this problem by providing a formal definition and athorough characterization. We also study computational issues and show how to combinethe most recent results in both paradigms; providing a very efficient algorithm which exploitsthe two requirements (satisfying constraints and being closed) together at mining time inorder to reduce the computation as much as possible.,Data Mining; 2004.

Pushing tougher constraints in frequent pattern mining,Francesco Bonchi; Claudio Lucchese,Abstract In this paper we extend the state-of-art of the constraints that can be pushed in afrequent pattern computation. We introduce a new class of tough constraints; namely LooseAnti-monotone constraints; and we deeply characterize them by showing that they are asuperclass of convertible anti-monotone constraints (eg constraints on average or median)and that they model tougher constraints (eg constraints on variance or standard deviation).Then we show how these constraints can be exploited in a level-wise Apriori-likecomputation by means of a new data-reduction technique: the resulting algorithmoutperforms previous proposals for convertible constraints; and it is to treat much tougherconstraints with the same effectiveness of easier ones.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2005,89
Extending the state-of-the-art of constraint-based pattern discovery,Francesco Bonchi; Claudio Lucchese,Abstract In the last years; in the context of the constraint-based pattern discovery paradigm;properties of constraints have been studied comprehensively and on the basis of thisproperties; efficient constraint-pushing techniques have been defined. In this paper wereview and extend the state-of-the-art of the constraints that can be pushed in a frequentpattern computation. We introduce novel data reduction techniques which are able to exploitconvertible anti-monotone constraints (eg; constraints on average or median) as well astougher constraints (eg; constraints on variance or standard deviation). A thoroughexperimental study is performed and it confirms that our framework outperforms previousalgorithms for convertible constraints; and exploit the tougher ones with the sameeffectiveness.

Exante: Anticipated data reduction in constrained pattern mining,Francesco Bonchi; Fosca Giannotti; Alessio Mazzanti; Dino Pedreschi,Abstract Constraint pushing techniques have been proven to be effective in reducing thesearch space in the frequent pattern mining task; and thus in improving efficiency. But whilepushing anti-monotone constraints in a level-wise computation of frequent itemsets hasbeen recognized to be always profitable; the case is different for monotone constraints. Infact; monotone constraints have been considered harder to push in the computation andless effective in pruning the search space. In this paper; we show that this prejudice is illfounded and introduce ExAnte; a pre-processing data reduction algorithm which reducesdramatically both the search space and the input dataset in constrained frequent patternmining. Experimental results show a reduction of orders of magnitude; thus enabling a mucheasier mining task. ExAnte can be used as a pre-processor with any constrained pattern …,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2003,86
Cascade-based community detection,Nicola Barbieri; Francesco Bonchi; Giuseppe Manco,Abstract Given a directed social graph and a set of past informa-tion cascades observedover the graph; we study the novel problem of detecting modules of the graph (communitiesof nodes); that also explain the cascades. Our key observation is that both informationpropagation and social ties forma-tion in a social network can be explained according to thesame latent factor; which ultimately guide a user behavior within the network. Based on thisobservation; we propose the Community-Cascade Network (CCN) model; a stochas-ticmixture membership generative model that can fit; at the same time; the social graph and theobserved set of cas-cades. Our model produces overlapping communities and for eachnode; its level of authority and passive interest in each community it belongs.

ExAMiner: Optimized level-wise frequent pattern mining with monotone constraints,Francesco Bonchi; Fosca Giannotti; Alessio Mazzanti; Dino Pedreschi,The key point is that; in frequent pattern mining; the most appropriate way of exploitingmonotone constraints in conjunction with frequency is to use them in order to reduce theproblem input together with the search space. Following this intuition; we introduceExAMiner; a level-wise algorithm which exploits the real synergy of antimonotone andmonotone constraints: the total benefit is greater than the sum of the two individual benefits.ExAMiner generalizes the basic idea of the preprocessing algorithm ExAnte [F. Bonchi etal.;(2003)]; embedding such ideas at all levels of an Apriori-like computation. The resultingalgorithm is the generalization of the Apriori algorithm when a conjunction of monotoneconstraints is conjoined to the frequency antimonotone constraint. Experimental resultsconfirm that this is; so far; the most efficient way of attacking the computational problem in …,Data Mining; 2003. ICDM 2003. Third IEEE International Conference on,2003,82
Topic-aware social influence propagation models,Nicola Barbieri; Francesco Bonchi; Giuseppe Manco,Abstract The study of influence-driven propagations in social networks and its exploitationfor viral marketing purposes has recently received a large deal of attention. However;regardless of the fact that users authoritativeness; expertise; trust and influence are evidentlytopic-dependent; the research on social influence has surprisingly largely overlooked thisaspect. In this article; we study social influence from a topic modeling perspective. Weintroduce novel topic-aware influence-driven propagation models that; as we show in ourexperiments; are more accurate in describing real-world cascades than the standard (ie;topic-blind) propagation models studied in the literature. In particular; we first proposesimple topic-aware extensions of the well-known Independent Cascade and LinearThreshold models.

From" dango" to" japanese cakes": Query reformulation models and patterns,Paolo Boldi; Francesco Bonchi; Carlos Castillo; Sebastiano Vigna,Understanding query reformulation patterns is a key step towards next generation websearch engines: it can help improving users' web-search experience by predicting theirintent; and thus helping them to locate information more effectively. As a step in thisdirection; we build an accurate model for classifying user query reformulations into broadclasses (generalization; specialization; error correction or parallel move); achieving 92\%accuracy. We apply the model to automatically label two large query logs; creatingannotated query-flow graphs. We study the resulting reformulation patterns; finding resultsconsistent with previous studies done on smaller manually annotated datasets; anddiscovering new interesting patterns; including connections between reformulation typesand topical categories. Finally; applying our findings to a third query log that is publicly …,Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technologies; 2009. WI-IAT'09. IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conferences on,2009,79
Identity obfuscation in graphs through the information theoretic lens,Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis; Tamir Tassa,Abstract Analyzing the structure of social networks is of interest in a wide range ofdisciplines. Unfortunately; sharing social-network datasets is often restrained by privacyconsiderations. One way to address the privacy concern is to anonymize the data beforepublishing. Randomly adding or deleting edges from the social graph is one of theanonymization approaches that have been proposed in the literature. Recent studies havequantified the level of anonymity that is obtained by random perturbation by means of aposteriori belief probabilities and; by conducting experiments on small datasets; arrived atthe conclusion that random perturbation cannot achieve meaningful levels of anonymitywithout deteriorating the graph properties. We offer a new information-theoretic perspectiveon the question of anonymizing a social network by means of random edge additions and …,Information Sciences,2014,78
Do you want to take notes?: identifying research missions in Yahoo! search pad,Debora Donato; Francesco Bonchi; Tom Chi; Yoelle Maarek,Abstract Addressing user's information needs has been one of the main goals of Web searchengines since their early days. In some cases; users cannot see their needs immediatelyanswered by search results; simply because these needs are too complex and involvemultiple aspects that are not covered by a single Web or search results page. This typicallyhappens when users investigate a certain topic in domains such as education; travel orhealth; which often require collecting facts and information from many pages. We refer to thistype of activities as" research missions". These research missions account for 10% of users'sessions and more than 25% of all query volume; as verified by a manual analysis that wasconducted by Yahoo! editors.,Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web,2010,77
Who to follow and why: link prediction with explanations,Nicola Barbieri; Francesco Bonchi; Giuseppe Manco,Abstract User recommender systems are a key component in any on-line social networkingplatform: they help the users growing their network faster; thus driving engagement andloyalty. In this paper we study link prediction with explanations for user recommendation insocial networks. For this problem we propose WTFW (" Who to Follow and Why"); astochastic topic model for link prediction over directed and nodes-attributed graphs. Ourmodel not only predicts links; but for each predicted link it decides whether it is a" topical" ora" social" link; and depending on this decision it produces a different type of explanation.,Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2014,68
Influence Propagation in Social Networks: A Data Mining Perspective.,Francesco Bonchi,Abstract—With the success of online social networks and mi-croblogs such as Facebook;Flickr and Twitter; the phenomenon of influence exerted by users of such platforms on otherusers; and how it propagates in the network; has recently attracted the interest of computerscientists; information technologists; and marketing specialists. One of the key problems inthis area is the identification of influential users; by targeting whom certain desirablemarketing outcomes can be achieved. In this article we take a data mining perspective andwe discuss what (and how) can be learned from the available traces of past propagations.While doing this we provide a brief overview of some recent progresses in this area anddiscuss some open problems. By no means this article must be intended as an exhaustivesurvey: it is instead (admittedly) a rather biased and personal perspective of the author on …,IEEE Intelligent Informatics Bulletin,2011,66
FP-Bonsai: the art of growing and pruning small fp-trees,Francesco Bonchi; Bart Goethals,Abstract In the context of mining frequent itemsets; numerous strategies have beenproposed to push several types of constraints within the most well known algorithms. In thispaper; we integrate the recently proposed ExAnte data reduction technique within the FP-growth algorithm. Together; they result in a very efficient frequent itemset mining algorithmthat effectively exploits monotone constraints.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2004,63
Blocking anonymity threats raised by frequent itemset mining,Maurizio Atzori; Francesco Bonchi; Fosca Giannotti; Dino Pedreschi,In this paper we study when the disclosure of data mining results represents; per se; a threatto the anonymity of the individuals recorded in the analyzed database. The novelty of ourapproach is that we focus on an objective definition of privacy compliance of patterns withoutany reference to a preconceived knowledge of what is sensitive and what is not; on the basisof the rather intuitive and realistic constraint that the anonymity of individuals should beguaranteed. In particular; the problem addressed here arises from the possibility of inferringfrom the output of frequent itemset mining (ie; a set of item-sets with support larger than athreshold a); the existence of patterns with very low support (smaller than an anonymitythreshold k)[M. Atzori et. al; 2005]. In the following we develop a simple methodology toblock such inference opportunities by introducing distortion on the dangerous patterns.,Data Mining; Fifth IEEE International Conference on,2005,59
Injecting uncertainty in graphs for identity obfuscation,Paolo Boldi; Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis; Tamir Tassa,Abstract Data collected nowadays by social-networking applications create fascinatingopportunities for building novel services; as well as expanding our understanding aboutsocial structures and their dynamics. Unfortunately; publishing social-network graphs isconsidered an ill-advised practice due to privacy concerns. To alleviate this problem; severalanonymization methods have been proposed; aiming at reducing the risk of a privacybreach on the published data; while still allowing to analyze them and draw relevantconclusions. In this paper we introduce a new anonymization approach that is based oninjecting uncertainty in social graphs and publishing the resulting uncertain graphs.

Online Topic-aware Influence Maximization Queries.,Cigdem Aslay; Nicola Barbieri; Francesco Bonchi; Ricardo A Baeza-Yates,ABSTRACT Influence maximization is the key algorithmic problem behind viral marketing: itrequires to identify a set of influential users in a social network; who; when convinced toadopt a product; shall influence other users in the network; leading to a large number ofadoptions. Although real world users evidently have different degrees of interest andauthoritativeness on different topics; the bulk of the literature on influence maximization istopic-blind; in the sense that it treats all items as they were the same. In this paper we studyTopic-aware Influence Maximization (TIM) queries: given a directed social graph; where thearcs are associated with a topic-dependent user-to-user social influence strength; and givena budget k; the problem requires to find a set of k users (named seed set) that we shall targetin a viral marketing campaign for a given new item (described as a distribution over topics …,EDBT,2014,53
Overlapping correlation clustering,Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis; Antti Ukkonen,We introduce a new approach to the problem of overlapping clustering. The main idea is toformulate overlapping clustering as an optimization problem in which each data point ismapped to a small set of labels; representing membership to different clusters. The objectiveis to find a mapping so that the distances between data points agree as much as possiblewith distances taken over their label sets. To define distances between label sets; weconsider two measures: a set-intersection indicator function and the Jaccard coefficient. Tosolve the main optimization problem we propose a local-search algorithm. The iterative stepof our algorithm requires solving non-trivial optimization sub problems; which; for themeasures of set-intersection and Jaccard; we solve using a greedy method and non-negative least squares; respectively. Since our frameworks uses pair wise similarities of …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on,2011,51
Core decomposition of uncertain graphs,Francesco Bonchi; Francesco Gullo; Andreas Kaltenbrunner; Yana Volkovich,Abstract Core decomposition has proven to be a useful primitive for a wide range of graphanalyses. One of its most appealing features is that; unlike other notions of densesubgraphs; it can be computed linearly in the size of the input graph. In this paper weprovide an analogous tool for uncertain graphs; ie; graphs whose edges are assigned aprobability of existence. The fact that core decomposition can be computed efficiently indeterministic graphs does not guarantee efficiency in uncertain graphs; where even thesimplest graph operations may become computationally intensive. Here we show that coredecomposition of uncertain graphs can be carried out efficiently as well.,Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2014,49
Fast matrix computations for pairwise and columnwise commute times and Katz scores,Francesco Bonchi; Pooya Esfandiar; David F Gleich; Chen Greif; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract We explore methods for approximating the commute time and Katz score between apair of nodes. These methods are based on the approach of matrices; moments; andquadrature developed in the numerical linear algebra community. They rely on the Lanczosprocess and provide upper and lower bounds on an estimate of the pairwise scores. Wealso explore methods to approximate the commute times and Katz scores from a node to allother nodes in the graph. Here; our approach for the commute times is based on a variationof the conjugate gradient algorithm; and it provides an estimate of all the diagonals of theinverse of a matrix. Our technique for the Katz scores is based on exploiting an empiricallocalization property of the Katz matrix. We adapt algorithms used for personalizedPageRank computing to these Katz scores and theoretically show that this approach is …,Internet Mathematics,2012,47
The meme ranking problem: Maximizing microblogging virality,Francesco Bonchi; Carlos Castillo; Dino Ienco,Microblogging is a modern communication paradigm in which users post bits of information;or" memes" as we call them; that are brief text updates or micromedia such as photos; videoor audio clips. Once a user post a meme; it become visible to the user community. When auser finds a meme of another user interesting; she can eventually repost it; thus allowingmemes to propagate virally trough the social network. In this paper we introduce the memeranking problem; as the problem of selecting which k memes (among the ones posted bytheir contacts) to show to users when they log into the system. The objective is to maximizethe overall activity of the network; that is; the total number of reposts that occur. We deeplycharacterize the problem showing that not only exact solutions are unfeasible; but alsoapproximated solutions are prohibitive to be adopted in an on-line setting. Therefore we …,Journal of Intelligent Information Systems,2013,46
Trajectory anonymity in publishing personal mobility data,Francesco Bonchi; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Hui Wendy Wang,Abstract Recent years have witnessed pervasive use of location-aware devices such asGSM mobile phones; GPS-enabled PDAs; location sensors; and active RFID tags. The useof these devices generates a huge collection of spatio-temporal data; variously calledmoving object data; trajectory data; or moblity data. These data can be used for various dataanalysis purposes such as city traffic control; mobility management; urban planning; andlocation-based service advertisements. Clearly; the spatio-temporal data so collected mayhelp an attacker to discover personal and sensitive information like user habits; socialcustoms; religious and sexual preferences of individuals. Consequently; it raises seriousconcerns about privacy. Simply replacing users' real identifiers (name; SSN; etc.) withpseudonyms is insufficient to guarantee anonymity. The problem is that due to the …,ACM Sigkdd Explorations Newsletter,2011,45
Csi: Community-level social influence analysis,Yasir Mehmood; Nicola Barbieri; Francesco Bonchi; Antti Ukkonen,Abstract Modeling how information propagates in social networks driven by peer influence;is a fundamental research question towards understanding the structure and dynamics ofthese complex networks; as well as developing viral marketing applications. Existingliterature studies influence at the level of individuals; mostly ignoring the existence of acommunity structure in which multiple nodes may exhibit a common influence pattern. In thispaper we introduce CSI; a model for analyzing information propagation and social influenceat the granularity of communities. CSI builds over a novel propagation model thatgeneralizes the classic Independent Cascade model to deal with groups of nodes (insteadof single nodes) influence. Given a social network and a database of past informationpropagation; we propose a hierarchical approach to detect a set of communities and their …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2013,44
Hiding sequences,Osman Abul; Maurizio Atzori; Francesco Bonchi; Fosca Giannotti,The process of discovering relevant patterns holding in a database; was first indicated as athreat to database security by O'Leary in [20]. Since then; many different approaches forknowledge hiding have emerged over the years; mainly in the context of association rulesand frequent itemsets mining. Following many real-world data and applications demands; inthis paper we shift; the problem of knowledge hiding to contexts where both the data arid theextracted knowledge have a sequential structure. We provide problem statement; sometheoretical issues including NP-hardness of the problem; a polynomial sanitization algorithmand an experimental evaluation. Finally we discuss possible extensions that will allow to usethis work as a basic building block for more complex kinds of patterns and applications.,Data Engineering Workshop; 2007 IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,44
On condensed representations of constrained frequent patterns,Francesco Bonchi; Claudio Lucchese,Abstract Constrained frequent patterns and closed frequent patterns are two paradigmsaimed at reducing the set of extracted patterns to a smaller; more interesting; subset.Although a lot of work has been done with both these paradigms; there is still confusionaround the mining problem obtained by joining closed and constrained frequent patterns ina unique framework. In this paper; we shed light on this problem by providing a formaldefinition and a thorough characterisation. We also study computational issues and showhow to combine the most recent results in both paradigms; providing a very efficientalgorithm that exploits the two requirements (satisfying constraints and being closed)together at mining time in order to reduce the computation as much as possible.,Knowledge and information systems,2006,44
Chromatic correlation clustering,Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis; Francesco Gullo; Charalampos E Tsourakakis; Antti Ukkonen,Abstract We study a novel clustering problem in which the pairwise relations betweenobjects are categorical. This problem can be viewed as clustering the vertices of a graphwhose edges are of different types (colors). We introduce an objective function that ensuresthe edges within each cluster have; as much as possible; the same color. We show that theproblem is NP-hard and propose a randomized algorithm with approximation guaranteeproportional to the maximum degree of the input graph. The algorithm iteratively picks arandom edge as a pivot; builds a cluster around it; and removes the cluster from the graph.Although being fast; easy to implement; and parameter-free; this algorithm tends to producea relatively large number of clusters. To overcome this issue we introduce a variantalgorithm; which modifies how the pivot is chosen and how the cluster is built around the …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2015,42

The bang for the buck: fair competitive viral marketing from the host perspective,Wei Lu; Francesco Bonchi; Amit Goyal; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract The key algorithmic problem in viral marketing is to identify a set of influential users(called seeds) in a social network; who; when convinced to adopt a product; shall influenceother users in the network; leading to a large number of adoptions. When two or moreplayers compete with similar products on the same network we talk about competitive viralmarketing; which so far has been studied exclusively from the perspective of one of thecompeting players. In this paper we propose and study the novel problem of competitiveviral marketing from the perspective of the host; ie; the owner of the social network platform.The host sells viral marketing campaigns as a service to its customers; keeping control of theselection of seeds. Each company specifies its budget and the host allocates the seedsaccordingly. From the host's perspective; it is important not only to choose the seeds to …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2013,36
Strip: stream learning of influence probabilities,Konstantin Kutzkov; Albert Bifet; Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis,Abstract Influence-driven diffusion of information is a fundamental process in socialnetworks. Learning the latent variables of such process; ie; the influence strength alongeach link; is a central question towards understanding the structure and function of complexnetworks; modeling information cascades; and developing applications such as viralmarketing. Motivated by modern microblogging platforms; such as twitter; in this paper westudy the problem of learning influence probabilities in a data-stream scenario; in which thenetwork topology is relatively stable and the challenge of a learning algorithm is to keep upwith a continuous stream of tweets using a small amount of time and memory.

Scalable online betweenness centrality in evolving graphs,Nicolas Kourtellis; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Francesco Bonchi,Betweenness centrality is a classic measure that quantifies the importance of a graphelement (vertex or edge) according to the fraction of shortest paths passing through it. Thismeasure is notoriously expensive to compute; and the best known algorithm runs in O (nm)time. The problems of efficiency and scalability are exacerbated in a dynamic setting; wherethe input is an evolving graph seen edge by edge; and the goal is to keep the betweennesscentrality up to date. In this paper; we propose the first truly scalable algorithm for onlinecomputation of betweenness centrality of both vertices and edges in an evolving graphwhere new edges are added and existing edges are removed. Our algorithm is carefullyengineered with out-of-core techniques and tailored for modern parallel stream processingengines that run on clusters of shared-nothing commodity hardware. Hence; it is …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,35

Since then; many different approaches forknowledge hiding have emerged over the years; mainly in the context of association rulesand frequent item sets mining. Following many real-world data and application demands; inthis paper; we shift the problem of knowledge hiding to contexts where both the data and theextracted knowledge have a sequential structure. We define the problem of hidingsequential patterns and show its NP-hardness. Thus; we devise heuristics and a polynomialsanitization algorithm. Starting from this framework; we specialize it to the more complexcase of spatiotemporal patterns extracted from moving objects databases.

Adaptive constraint pushing in frequent pattern mining,Francesco Bonchi; Fosca Giannotti; Alessio Mazzanti; Dino Pedreschi,Abstract Pushing monotone constraints in frequent pattern mining can help pruning thesearch space; but at the same time it can also reduce the effectiveness of anti-monotonepruning. There is a clear tradeoff. Is it better to exploit more monotone pruning at the cost ofless anti-monotone pruning; or viceversa? The answer depends on characteristics of thedataset and the selectivity of constraints. In this paper; we deeply characterize this trade-offand its related computational problem. As a result of this characterization; we introduce anadaptive strategy; named ACP (Adaptive Constraint Pushing) which exploits any conjunctionof monotone and anti-monotone constraints to prune the search space; and level by leveladapts the pruning to the input dataset and constraints; in order to maximize efficiency.,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2003,35
Algorithmic bias: From discrimination discovery to fairness-aware data mining,Sara Hajian; Francesco Bonchi; Carlos Castillo,Abstract Algorithms and decision making based on Big Data have become pervasive in allaspects of our daily lives lives (offline and online); as they have become essential tools inpersonal finance; health care; hiring; housing; education; and policies. It is therefore ofsocietal and ethical importance to ask whether these algorithms can be discriminative ongrounds such as gender; ethnicity; or health status. It turns out that the answer is positive: forinstance; recent studies in the context of online advertising show that ads for high-incomejobs are presented to men much more often than to women [Datta et al.; 2015]; and ads forarrest records are significantly more likely to show up on searches for distinctively blacknames [Sweeney; 2013]. This algorithmic bias exists even when there is no discriminationintention in the developer of the algorithm. Sometimes it may be inherent to the data …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining,2016,34
Description-driven community detection,Simon Pool; Francesco Bonchi; Matthijs van Leeuwen,Abstract Traditional approaches to community detection; as studied by physicists;sociologists; and more recently computer scientists; aim at simply partitioning the socialnetwork graph. However; with the advent of online social networking sites; richer data hasbecome available: beyond the link information; each user in the network is annotated withadditional information; for example; demographics; shopping behavior; or interests. In thiscontext; it is therefore important to develop mining methods which can take advantage of allavailable information. In the case of community detection; this means finding goodcommunities (a set of nodes cohesive in the social graph) which are associated with gooddescriptions in terms of user information (node attributes). Having good descriptionsassociated to our models make them understandable by domain experts and thus more …,ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST),2014,34

Fast Reliability Search in Uncertain Graphs.,Arijit Khan; Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis; Francesco Gullo,ABSTRACT Uncertain; or probabilistic; graphs have been increasingly used to representnoisy linked data in many emerging application scenarios; and have recently attracted theattention of the database research community. A fundamental problem on uncertain graphsis reliability; which deals with the probability of nodes being reachable one from another.Existing literature has exclusively focused on reliability detection; which asks to compute theprobability that two given nodes are connected. In this paper we study reliability search onuncertain graphs; which we define as the problem of computing all nodes reachable from aset of query nodes with probability no less than a given threshold. Existing reliability-detection approaches are not well-suited to efficiently handle the reliability-search problem.We propose RQ-tree; a novel index which is based on a hierarchical clustering of the …,EDBT,2014,33
Voting in social networks,Paolo Boldi; Francesco Bonchi; Carlos Castillo; Sebastiano Vigna,Abstract A voting system is a set of rules that a community adopts to take collectivedecisions. In this paper we study voting systems for a particular kind of community:electronically mediated social networks. In particular; we focus on delegative democracy(aka proxy voting) that has recently received increased interest for its ability to combine thebenefits of direct and representative systems; and that seems also perfectly suited forelectronically mediated social networks. In such a context; we consider a voting system inwhich users can only express their preference for one among the people they are explicitlyconnected with; and this preference can be propagated transitively; using an attenuationfactor. We present this system and we study its properties. We also take into considerationthe problem of missing votes; which is particularly relevant in online networks; as some …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,33
Topical query decomposition,Francesco Bonchi; Carlos Castillo; Debora Donato; Aristides Gionis,Abstract We introduce the problem of query decomposition; where we are given a query anda document retrieval system; and we want to produce a small set of queries whose union ofresulting documents corresponds approximately to that of the original query. Ideally; thesequeries should represent coherent; conceptually well-separated topics. We provide anabstract formulation of the query decomposition problem; and we tackle it from two differentperspectives. We first show how the problem can be instantiated as a specific variant of a setcover problem; for which we provide an efficient greedy algorithm. Next; we show how thesame problem can be seen as a constrained clustering problem; with a very particular kindof constraint; ie; clustering with predefined clusters. We develop a two-phase algorithmbased on hierarchical agglomerative clustering followed by dynamic programming.

Efficient query recommendations in the long tail via center-piece subgraphs,Francesco Bonchi; Raffaele Perego; Fabrizio Silvestri; Hossein Vahabi; Rossano Venturini,Abstract We present a recommendation method based on the well-known concept of center-piece subgraph; that allows for the time/space efficient generation of suggestions also forrare; ie; long-tail queries. Our method is scalable with respect to both the size of datasetsfrom which the model is computed and the heavy workloads that current web searchengines have to deal with. Basically; we relate terms contained into queries with highlycorrelated queries in a query-flow graph. This enables a novel recommendation generationmethod able to produce recommendations for approximately 99% of the workload of a real-world search engine. The method is based on a graph having term nodes; query nodes; andtwo kinds of connections: term-query and query-query. The first connects a term to thequeries in which it is contained; the second connects two query nodes if the likelihood …,Proceedings of the 35th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2012,32
Finding subgraphs with maximum total density and limited overlap,Oana Denisa Balalau; Francesco Bonchi; TH Chan; Francesco Gullo; Mauro Sozio,Abstract Finding dense subgraphs in large graphs is a key primitive in a variety of real-worldapplication domains; encompassing social network analytics; event detection; biology; andfinance. In most such applications; one typically aims at finding several (possiblyoverlapping) dense subgraphs which might correspond to communities in social networks orinteresting events. While a large amount of work is devoted to finding a single densestsubgraph; perhaps surprisingly; the problem of finding several dense subgraphs with limitedoverlap has not been studied in a principled way; to the best of our knowledge. In this workwe define and study a natural generalization of the densest subgraph problem; where themain goal is to find at most $ k $ subgraphs with maximum total aggregate density; whilesatisfying an upper bound on the pairwise Jaccard coefficient between the sets of nodes …,Proceedings of the Eighth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2015,31
Query reformulation mining: models; patterns; and applications,Paolo Boldi; Francesco Bonchi; Carlos Castillo; Sebastiano Vigna,Abstract Understanding query reformulation patterns is a key task towards next generationweb search engines. If we can do that; then we can build systems able to understand andpossibly predict user intent; providing the needed assistance at the right time; and thushelping users locate information more effectively and improving their web-searchexperience. As a step in this direction; we build a very accurate model for classifying userquery reformulations into broad classes (generalization; specialization; error correction orparallel move); achieving 92% accuracy. We then apply the model to automatically label twovery large query logs sampled from different geographic areas; and containing a total ofapproximately 17 million query reformulations. We study the resulting reformulation patterns;matching some results from previous studies performed on smaller manually annotated …,Information retrieval,2011,31
Mining clinical data with a temporal dimension: a case study,Michele Berlingerio; Francesco Bonchi; Fosca Giannotti; Franco Turini,Clinical databases store large amounts of information about patients and their medicalconditions. Data mining techniques can extract relationships and patterns holding in thiswealth of data; and thus be helpful in understanding the progression of diseases and theefficacy of the associated therapies. A typical structure of medical data is a sequence ofobservations of clinical parameters taken at different time moments. In this kind of contexts;the temporal dimension of data is a fundamental variable that should be taken in account inthe mining process and returned as part of the extracted knowledge. Therefore; the classicaland well established framework of sequential pattern mining is not enough; because it onlyfocuses on the sequentiality of events; without extracting the typical time elapsing betweentwo particular events. Time-annotated sequences (IAS); is a novel mining paradigm that …,Bioinformatics and Biomedicine; 2007. BIBM 2007. IEEE International Conference on,2007,31
Interestingness is not a dichotomy: Introducing softness in constrained pattern mining,Stefano Bistarelli; Francesco Bonchi,Abstract The paradigm of pattern discovery based on constraints was introduced with theaim of providing to the user a tool to drive the discovery process towards potentiallyinteresting patterns; with the positive side effect of achieving a more efficient computation.So far the research on this paradigm has mainly focussed on the latter aspect: thedevelopment of efficient algorithms for the evaluation of constraint-based mining queries.Due to the lack of research on methodological issues; the constraint-based pattern miningframework still suffers from many problems which limit its practical relevance. As a solution;in this paper we introduce the new paradigm of pattern discovery based on Soft Constraints.Albeit simple; the proposed paradigm overcomes all the major methodological drawbacks ofthe classical constraint-based paradigm; representing an important step further towards …,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2005,31
Composite retrieval of diverse and complementary bundles,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Francesco Bonchi; Carlos Castillo; Esteban Feuerstein; Isabel Mendez-Diaz; Paula Zabala,Users are often faced with the problem of finding complementary items that together achievea single common goal (eg; a starter kit for a novice astronomer; a collection ofquestion/answers related to low-carb nutrition; a set of places to visit on holidays). In thispaper; we argue that for some application scenarios returning item bundles is moreappropriate than ranked lists. Thus we define composite retrieval as the problem of finding kbundles of complementary items. Beyond complementarity of items; the bundles must bevalid wrt a given budget; and the answer set of k bundles must exhibit diversity. We formallydefine the problem and show that in its general form is NP-hard and that also the specialcases in which each bundle is formed by only one item; or only one bundle is sought; arehard. Our characterization however suggests how to adopt a two-phase approach …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,30

In this paper;we analyze such limitations and we show how they flow out from the same source: the factthat in the classical constraint-based mining; a constraint is a rigid boolean function whichreturns either true or false. Indeed; interestingness is not a dichotomy. Following this …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2007,28
Suggesting ghost edges for a smaller world,Manos Papagelis; Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis,Abstract Small changes in the network topology can have dramatic effects on its capacity todisseminate information. In this paper; we consider the problem of adding a small number ofghost edges in the network in order to minimize the average shortest-path distance betweennodes; towards a smaller-world network. We formalize the problem of suggesting ghostedges and we propose a novel method for quickly evaluating the importance of ghost edgesin sparse graphs. Through experiments on real and synthetic data sets; we demonstrate thatour approach performs very well; for a varying range of conditions; and it outperformssensible baselines.,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,27
A constraint-based querying system for exploratory pattern discovery,Francesco Bonchi; Fosca Giannotti; Claudio Lucchese; Salvatore Orlando; Raffaele Perego; Roberto Trasarti,Abstract In this article we present ConQueSt; a constraint-based querying system able tosupport the intrinsically exploratory (ie; human-guided; interactive and iterative) nature ofpattern discovery. Following the inductive database vision; our framework provides userswith an expressive constraint-based query language; which allows the discovery process tobe effectively driven toward potentially interesting patterns. Such constraints are alsoexploited to reduce the cost of pattern mining computation. ConQueSt is a comprehensivemining system that can access real-world relational databases from which to extract data.Through the interaction with a friendly graphical user interface (GUI); the user can definecomplex mining queries by means of few clicks. After a pre-processing step; mining queriesare answered by an efficient and robust pattern mining engine which entails the state-of …,Information Systems,2009,27
The social world of content abusers in community question answering,Imrul Kayes; Nicolas Kourtellis; Daniele Quercia; Adriana Iamnitchi; Francesco Bonchi,Abstract Community-based question answering platforms can be rich sources of informationon a variety of specialized topics; from finance to cooking. The usefulness of such platformsdepends heavily on user contributions (questions and answers); but also on respecting thecommunity rules. As a crowd-sourced service; such platforms rely on their users formonitoring and flagging content that violates community rules. Common wisdom is toeliminate the users who receive many flags. Our analysis of a year of traces from a matureQ&A site shows that the number of flags does not tell the full story: on one hand; users withmany flags may still contribute positively to the community. On the other hand; users whonever get flagged are found to violate community rules and get their accounts suspended.This analysis; however; also shows that abusive users are betrayed by their network …,Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web,2015,26
Influence-based network-oblivious community detection,Nicola Barbieri; Francesco Bonchi; Giuseppe Manco,How can we detect communities when the social graphs is not available? We tackle thisproblem by modeling social contagion from a log of user activity; that is a dataset of tuples(u; i; t) recording the fact that user u" adopted" item i at time t. This is the only input to ourproblem. We propose a stochastic framework which assumes that item adoptions aregoverned by un underlying diffusion process over the unobserved social network; and thatsuch diffusion model is based on community-level influence. By fitting the model parametersto the user activity log; we learn the community membership and the level of influence ofeach user in each community. This allows to identify for each community the" key" users; ie;the leaders which are most likely to influence the rest of the community to adopt a certainitem. The general framework can be instantiated with different diffusion models. In this …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on,2013,25
Hiding sensitive trajectory patterns,Osman Abul; Maurizio Atzori; Francesco Bonchi; Fosca Giannotti,Spatio-temporal traces left behind by moving individuals are increasingly available. On theone hand; mining this kind of data is expected to produce interesting behavioral knowledgeenabling novel classes of mobility applications; but on the other hand; due to the peculiarnature of position data; mining it creates important privacy concerns. Thus; studying privacypreserving data mining methods for mov-ing object data is interesting and challenging. Inthis paper; we address the problem of hiding sensi-tive trajectory patterns from movingobjects databases. The aim is to modify the database such that a given set of sen-sitivetrajectory patterns can no longer be extracted; while the others are preserved as much aspossible. We provide the formal problem statement and show that it is NP-hard; so wedevise heuristics and a polynomial sanitization al-gorithm. We discuss a possible attack …,Data Mining Workshops; 2007.

Using data mining techniques in fiscal fraud detection,Francesco Bonchi; Fosca Giannotti; Gianni Mainetto; Dino Pedreschi,Abstract Planning adequate audit strategies is a key success factor in “a posteriori” frauddetection; eg; in the fiscal and insurance domains; where audits are intended to detect taxevasion and fraudulent claims. A case study is presented in this paper; which illustrates howtechniques based on classification can be used to support the task of planning auditstrategies. The proposed approach is sensible to some conflicting issues of audit planning;eg; the trade-off between maximizing audit benefits vs. minimizing audit costs.,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,1999,25
Graph summarization with quality guarantees,Matteo Riondato; David García-Soriano; Francesco Bonchi,Abstract We study the problem of graph summarization. Given a large graph we aim atproducing a concise lossy representation (a summary) that can be stored in main memoryand used to approximately answer queries about the original graph much faster than byusing the exact representation. In this work we study a very natural type of summary: theoriginal set of vertices is partitioned into a small number of supernodes connected bysuperedges to form a complete weighted graph. The superedge weights are the edgedensities between vertices in the corresponding supernodes. To quantify the dissimilaritybetween the original graph and a summary; we adopt the reconstruction error and the cut-norm error. By exposing a connection between graph summarization and geometricclustering problems (ie; k-means and k-median); we develop the first polynomial-time …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2017,24
The pursuit of a good possible world: extracting representative instances of uncertain graphs,Panos Parchas; Francesco Gullo; Dimitris Papadias; Franceseco Bonchi,Abstract Data in several applications can be represented as an uncertain graph; whoseedges are labeled with a probability of existence. Exact query processing on uncertaingraphs is prohibitive for most applications; as it involves evaluation over an exponentialnumber of instantiations. Even approximate processing based on sampling is usuallyextremely expensive since it requires a vast number of samples to achieve reasonablequality guarantees. To overcome these problems; we propose algorithms for creatingdeterministic representative instances of uncertain graphs that maintain the underlyinggraph properties. Specifically; our algorithms aim at preserving the expected vertex degreesbecause they capture well the graph topology. Conventional processing techniques canthen be applied on these instances to closely approximate the result on the uncertain …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on management of data,2014,23
Viscous democracy for social networks,Paolo Boldi; Francesco Bonchi; Carlos Castillo; Sebastiano Vigna,On April 23; 2009; Facebook announced preliminary results of a vote in which users were askedabout a change in the terms of use of the network. a The vote was the result of a petition by thousandsof users criticizing the site for claiming too many rights over user-generated content. Attemptingto justify the change; Facebook let users vote; saying that if 30% of the then roughly 200 million"active" users would vote the decision would be binding on Facebook management. b The outcomewas 74.4% of the voters preferred the new rules. And while only 600;000 users voted (1/100thof the prefixed quorum of 60;000;000) the change in the terms of use were officially adopted.c The global privacy watchdog; Privacy International; called the vote a "massive confidencetrick" d .

Exante: A preprocessing method for frequent-pattern mining,Francesco Bonchi; Fosca Giannotti; Alessio Mazzanti; Dino Pedreschi,Our main research objective is to define a data mining query language; supported by asystem that can optimize constraint-based data mining queries. We have invented ExAnte; asimple yet effective preprocessing technique for frequent-pattern mining. ExAnte exploitsconstraints to dramatically reduce the analyzed data to those containing patterns of interest.This data reduction; in turn; induces a strong reduction of the candidate patterns' searchspace; thus supporting substantial performance improvements in subsequent mining.,IEEE Intelligent Systems,2005,23
Viral marketing meets social advertising: Ad allocation with minimum regret,Cigdem Aslay; Wei Lu; Francesco Bonchi; Amit Goyal; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Social advertisement is one of the fastest growing sectors in the digitaladvertisement landscape: ads in the form of promoted posts are shown in the feed of usersof a social networking platform; along with normal social posts; if a user clicks on a promotedpost; the host (social network owner) is paid a fixed amount from the advertiser. In thiscontext; allocating ads to users is typically performed by maximizing click-through-rate; ie;the likelihood that the user will click on the ad. However; this simple strategy fails to leveragethe fact the ads can propagate virally through the network; from endorsing users to theirfollowers. In this paper; we study the problem of allocating ads to users through the viral-marketing lenses. We show that allocation that takes into account the propensity of ads forviral propagation can achieve significantly better performance. However; uncontrolled …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,22
Privacy protection: regulations and technologies; opportunities and threats,Dino Pedreschi; Francesco Bonchi; Franco Turini; Vassilios S Verykios; Maurizio Atzori; Bradley Malin; Bart Moelans; Yücel Saygin,Information and communication technologies (ICTs) touch many aspects of our lives. Theintegration of ICTs is enhanced by the advent of mobile; wireless; and ubiquitoustechnologies. ICTs are increasingly embedded in common services; such as mobile andwireless communication; Internet browsing; credit card e-transactions; and electronic healthrecords. As ICT-based services become ubiquitous; our everyday actions leave behindincreasingly detailed digital traces in the information systems of ICT-based serviceproviders.

Exposing the probabilistic causal structure of discrimination,Francesco Bonchi; Sara Hajian; Bud Mishra; Daniele Ramazzotti,Abstract Discrimination discovery from data is an important data mining task; whose goal isto identify patterns of illegal and unethical discriminatory activities against protected-by-lawgroups; eg; ethnic minorities. While any legally valid proof of discrimination requiresevidence of causality; the state-of-the-art methods are essentially correlation based; albeit;as it is well known; correlation does not imply causation. In this paper; we take a principledcausal approach to discrimination detection following Suppes' probabilistic causation theory.In particular; we define a method to extract; from a dataset of historical decision records; thecausal structures existing among the attributes in the data. The result is a type of constrainedBayesian network; which we dub Suppes-Bayes causal network (SBCN). Next; we developa toolkit of methods based on random walks on top of the SBCN; addressing different anti …,International Journal of Data Science and Analytics,2017,21
Efficient and effective community search,Nicola Barbieri; Francesco Bonchi; Edoardo Galimberti; Francesco Gullo,Abstract Community search is the problem of finding a good community for a given set ofquery vertices. One of the most studied formulations of community search asks for aconnected subgraph that contains all query vertices and maximizes the minimum degree. Allexisting approaches to min-degree-based community search suffer from limitationsconcerning efficiency; as they need to visit (large part of) the whole input graph; as well asaccuracy; as they output communities quite large and not really cohesive. Moreover; someexisting methods lack generality: they handle only single-vertex queries; find communitiesthat are not optimal in terms of minimum degree; and/or require input parameters. In thiswork we advance the state of the art on community search by proposing a novel method thatovercomes all these limitations: it is in general more efficient and effective—one/two …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2015,21

Influence maximization with viral product design,Nicola Barbieri; Francesco Bonchi,Abstract Product design and viral marketing are two popular concepts in the marketingliterature that; although following different paths; aim at the same goal: maximizing theadoption of a new product. While the effect of the social network is nowadays kept in greatconsideration in any marketing-related activity; the interplay between product design andsocial influence is surprisingly still largely unexplored. In this paper we move a first step inthis direction and study the problem of designing the features of a novel product such that itsadoption; fueled by peer influence and “word-of-mouth” effect; is maximized. We model theviral process of product adoption on the basis of social influence and the features of theproduct; and devise an improved iterative scaling procedure to learn the parameters thatmaximize the likelihood of our novel feature-aware propagation model.

Gurumine: A pattern mining system for discovering leaders and tribes,Amit Goyal; Byung-Won On; Francesco Bonchi; Laks VS Lakshmanan,In this demo we introduce GuruMine; a pattern mining system for the discovery of leaders; ie;influential users in social networks; and their tribes; ie; a set of users usually influenced bythe same leader over several actions. GuruMine is built upon a novel pattern miningframework for leaders discovery; that we introduced in [1]. In particular; we consider socialnetworks where users perform actions. Actions may be as simple as tagging resources (urls)as in del. icio. us; rating songs as in Yahoo! Music; or movies as in Yahoo! Movies; or usersbuying gadgets such as cameras; handholds; etc. and blogging a review on the gadgets.The assumption is that actions performed by a user can be seen by their network friends.Users seeing their friends actions are sometimes tempted to perform those actions.

Compressing tags to find interesting media groups,Matthijs Van Leeuwen; Francesco Bonchi; Börkur Sigurbjörnsson; Arno Siebes,Abstract On photo sharing websites like Flickr and Zooomr; users are offered the possibilityto assign tags to their uploaded pictures. Using these tags to find interesting groups ofsemantically related pictures in the result set of a given query is a problem with obviousapplications. We analyse this problem from a Minimum Description Length (MDL)perspective and develop an algorithm that finds the most interesting groups. The method isbased on Krimp; which finds small sets of patterns that characterise the data usingcompression. These patterns are sets of tags; often assignedtogether to photos. The better adatabase compresses; the more structure it contains and thus the more homogeneous it is.Following this observation we devise a compression-based measure.

k-Anonymous patterns,Maurizio Atzori; Francesco Bonchi; Fosca Giannotti; Dino Pedreschi,Abstract It is generally believed that data mining results do not violate the anonymity of theindividuals recorded in the source database. In fact; data mining models and patterns; inorder to ensure a required statistical significance; represent a large number of individualsand thus conceal individual identities: this is the case of the minimum support threshold inassociation rule mining. In this paper we show that this belief is ill-founded. By shifting theconcept of k-anonymity from data to patterns; we formally characterize the notion of a threatto anonymity in the context of pattern discovery; and provide a methodology to efficiently andeffectively identify all possible such threats that might arise from the disclosure of a set ofextracted patterns.,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2005,18

Taxonomy-based discovery and annotation of functional areas in the city,Carmen Karina Vaca Ruiz; Daniele Quercia; Bonchi Francesco; Piero Fraternali,ABSTRACT Urban resources are allocated according to socio-economic indicators; andrapid urbanization in developing countries calls for updating those indicators in a timelyfashion. The prohibitive costs of census data collection make that very difficult. To avoidallocating resources upon outdated indicators; one could partly update or complement themusing digital data. It has been shown that it is possible to use social media in developedcountries (mainly UK and USA) for such a purpose. Here we show that this is the case forBrazil too. We analyze a random sample of a microblogging service popular in that countryand accurately predict both economic capital and social capital of Brazilian cities. To makethese predictions; we exploit the sociological concept of glocality; which says thateconomically successful cities tend to be involved in interactions that are both local and …,International Conference on Web and Social Media,2015,15
Meme ranking to maximize posts virality in microblogging platforms,Francesco Bonchi; Carlos Castillo; Dino Ienco,Abstract Microblogging is a modern communication paradigm in which users post bits ofinformation; or “memes” as we call them; that are brief text updates or micromedia such asphotos; video or audio clips. Once a user post a meme; it become visible to the usercommunity. When a user finds a meme of another user interesting; she can eventually repostit; thus allowing memes to propagate virally trough the social network. In this paper weintroduce the meme ranking problem; as the problem of selecting which k memes (amongthe ones posted by their contacts) to show to users when they log into the system. Theobjective is to maximize the overall activity of the network; that is; the total number of repoststhat occur. We deeply characterize the problem showing that not only exact solutions areunfeasible; but also approximated solutions are prohibitive to be adopted in an on-line …,Journal of intelligent information systems,2013,15
Distance oracles in edge-labeled graphs.,Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis; Francesco Gullo; Antti Ukkonen,ABSTRACT A fundamental operation over edge-labeled graphs is the computation ofshortest-path distances subject to a constraint on the set of permissible edge labels.Applying exact algorithms for such an operation is not a viable option; especially for massivegraphs; or in scenarios where the distance computation is used as a primitive for morecomplex computations. In this paper we study the problem of efficient approximation ofshortest-path queries with edge-label constraints; for which we devise two indexes based onthe idea of landmarks: distances from all vertices of the graph to a selected subset oflandmark vertices are pre-computed and then used at query time to efficiently approximatedistance queries. The major challenge to face is that; in principle; an exponential number ofconstraint label sets needs to be stored for each vertex-landmark pair; which makes the …,EDBT,2014,14
Recommendations for the long tail by term-query graph,Francesco Bonchi; Raffaele Perego; Fabrizio Silvestri; Hossein Vahabi; Rossano Venturini,Abstract We define a new approach to the query recommendation problem. In particular; ourmain goal is to design a model enabling the generation of query suggestions also for rareand previously unseen queries. In other words we are targeting queries in the long tail. Themodel is based on a graph having two sets of nodes: Term nodes; and Query nodes. Thegraph induces a Markov chain on which a generic random walker starts from a subset ofTerm nodes; moves along Query nodes; and restarts (with a given probability) only from thesame initial subset of Term nodes. Computing the stationary distribution of such a Markovchain is equivalent to extracting the so-called Center-piece Subgraph from the graphassociated with the Markov chain itself. Given a query; we extract its terms and we set therestart subset to this term set. Therefore; we do not require a query to have been …,Proceedings of the 20th international conference companion on World wide web,2011,14
Sequence mining automata: A new technique for mining frequent sequences under regular expressions,Roberto Trasarti; Francesco Bonchi; Bart Goethals,In this paper we study the problem of mining frequent sequences satisfying a given regularexpression. Previous approaches to solve this problem were focusing on its search space;pushing (in some way) the given regular expression to prune unpromising candidatepatterns. On the contrary; we focus completely on the given input data and regularexpression. We introduce Sequence Mining Automata ($ SMA $); a specialized kind of PetriNet that while reading input sequences; it produces for each sequence all and only thepatterns contained in the sequence and that satisfy the given regular expression. Based onthis automaton; we develop a family of algorithms. Our thorough experimentation on differentdatasets and application domains confirms that in many cases our methods outperform thecurrent state of the art of frequent sequence mining algorithms using regular expressions …,Data Mining; 2008.

Privacy preserving publication of moving object data,Francesco Bonchi,Abstract The increasing availability of space-time trajectories left by location-aware devicesis expected to enable novel classes of applications where the discovery of consumable;concise; and actionable knowledge is the key step. However; the analysis of mobility data isa critic task by the privacy point of view: in fact; the peculiar nature of location data mightenable intrusive inferences in the life of the individuals whose data is analyzed. It is thusimportant to develop privacy-preserving techniques for the publication and the analysis ofmobility data.

Cultures in community question answering,Imrul Kayes; Nicolas Kourtellis; Daniele Quercia; Adriana Iamnitchi; Francesco Bonchi,Abstract CQA services are collaborative platforms where users ask and answer questions.We investigate the influence of national culture on people's online questioning andanswering behavior. For this; we analyzed a sample of 200 thousand users in YahooAnswers from 67 countries. We measure empirically a set of cultural metrics defined in GeertHofstede's cultural dimensions and Robert Levine's Pace of Life and show that behavioralcultural differences exist in community question answering platforms. We find that nationalcultures differ in Yahoo Answers along a number of dimensions such as temporalpredictability of activities; contribution-related behavioral patterns; privacy concerns; andpower inequality.,Proceedings of the 26th ACM Conference on Hypertext & Social Media,2015,12
Activity preserving graph simplification,Francesco Bonchi; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis; Antti Ukkonen,Abstract We study the problem of simplifying a given directed graph by keeping a smallsubset of its arcs. Our goal is to maintain the connectivity required to explain a set ofobserved traces of information propagation across the graph. Unlike previous work; we donot make any assumption about an underlying model of information propagation. Instead;we approach the task as a combinatorial problem. We prove that the resulting optimizationproblem is NP NP-hard. We show that a standard greedy algorithm performs very well inpractice; even though it does not have theoretical guarantees. Additionally; if the activitytraces have a tree structure; we show that the objective function is supermodular; andexperimentally verify that the approach for size-constrained submodular minimizationrecently proposed by Nagano et al.(28th International Conference on Machine Learning …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2013,12
The early-adopter graph and its application to web-page recommendation,Ida Mele; Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis,Abstract In this paper we present a novel graph-based data abstraction for modeling thebrowsing behavior of web users. The objective is to identify users who discover interestingpages before others. We call these users early adopters. By tracking the browsing activity ofearly adopters we can identify new interesting pages early; and recommend these pages tosimilar users. We focus on news and blog pages; which are more dynamic in nature andmore appropriate for recommendation. Our proposed model is called early-adopter graph. Inthis graph; nodes represent users and a directed arc between users u and v expresses thefact that u and v visit similar pages and; in particular; that user u tends to visit those pagesbefore user v. The weight of the edge is the degree to which the temporal rule" v visits apage before v" holds.,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,12

We model sequences with Markov models whose states correspond tonodes in the provided taxonomy; and each state represents the events in the subtree underthe corresponding node. By lumping observed events to states that correspond to internalnodes in the taxonomy; we allow more compact models that are easier to understand andvisualize; at the expense of a decrease in the data likelihood. We formally define andcharacterize our problem; and we propose a scalable search method for finding a goodtrade-off between two conflicting goals: maximizing the data likelihood; and minimizing themodel complexity.

Efficient breadth-first mining of frequent pattern with monotone constraints,Francesco Bonchi; Fosca Giannotti; Alessio Mazzanti; Dino Pedreschi,Abstract The key point of this article is that; in frequent pattern mining; the most appropriateway of exploiting monotone constraints in conjunction with frequency is to use them in orderto reduce the input data; this reduction in turn induces a stronger pruning of the searchspace of the problem. Following this intuition; we introduce ExAMiner; a breadth-firstalgorithm that exploits the real synergy of antimonotone and monotone constraints: the totalbenefit is greater than the sum of the two individual benefits. ExAMiner generalizes the basicidea of the preprocessing algorithm ExAnte (Bonchi et al. 2003 (b)); embedding such ideasat all levels of an Apriori-like computation. The resulting algorithm is the generalization of theApriori algorithm when a conjunction of monotone constraints is conjoined to the frequencyantimonotone constraint. Experimental results confirm that this is; so far; the most efficient …,Knowledge and information systems,2005,12

Existing approaches typicallyapproximate all pairwise relationships simultaneously. In this paper; we are interested incomputing: the score for a single pair of nodes; and the top-k nodes with the best scoresfrom a given source node. For the pairwise problem; we apply an iterative algorithm thatcomputes upper and lower bounds for the measures we seek.

Centrality measures on big graphs: Exact; approximated; and distributed algorithms,Francesco Bonchi; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Matteo Riondato,Abstract Centrality measures allow to measure the relative importance of a node or an edgein a graph wrt~ other nodes or edges. Several measures of centrality have been developedin the literature to capture different aspects of the informal concept of importance; andalgorithms for these different measures have been proposed. In this tutorial; we survey thedifferent definitions of centrality measures and the algorithms to compute them. We start fromthe most common measures; such as closeness centrality and betweenness centrality; andmove to more complex ones such as spanning-edge centrality.

Uncertain graph processing through representative instances,Panos Parchas; Francesco Gullo; Dimitris Papadias; Francesco Bonchi,Abstract Data in several applications can be represented as an uncertain graph whoseedges are labeled with a probability of existence. Exact query processing on uncertaingraphs is prohibitive for most applications; as it involves evaluation over an exponentialnumber of instantiations. Thus; typical approaches employ Monte-Carlo sampling; which (i)draws a number of possible graphs (samples);(ii) evaluates the query on each of them; and(iii) aggregates the individual answers to generate the final result. However; this approachcan also be extremely time consuming for large uncertain graphs commonly found inpractice. To facilitate efficiency; we study the problem of extracting a single representativeinstance from an uncertain graph. Conventional processing techniques can then be appliedon this representative to closely approximate the result on the original graph. In order to …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2015,10
Mining summaries of propagations,Lucrezia Macchia; Francesco Bonchi; Francesco Gullo; Luca Chiarandini,Analyzing the traces left by a meme of information propagating through a social network orby a user browsing a website can help to unveil the structure and dynamics of such complexnetworks. This may in turn open the door to concrete applications; such as finding influentialusers for a topic in a social network; or detecting the typical structure of a web browsingsession that leads to a product purchase. In this paper we define the problem of miningsummaries of propagations as a constrained pattern-mining problem. A propagation is aDAG where an entity (eg; information exchanged in a social network; or a user browsing awebsite) flows following the underlying hierarchical structure of the nodes. A summary is aset of propagations that (i) involve a similar population of nodes; and (ii) exhibit a coherenthierarchical structure when merged altogether to form a single graph.

However; in order to set up aneffective viral marketing campaign; one has first to accurately estimate social influence. Thisis usually done by analyzing user activity data. As we point out in this paper; the dataanalysis and sharing that is needed to estimate social influence raises important privacyissues that may jeopardize the legal; ethical and societal acceptability of such practice; andin turn; the concrete applicability of viral marketing in the real world.,EDBT,2014,9

Given a query issued by the user; the system; apart fromreturning the result patterns; also proposes a number of specializations (ie; supergraphs) ofthe original query to facilitate the exploration of the results. We formalize the problem offinding a set of reformulations of the input query by maximizing a linear combination ofcoverage (of the original query's answer set) and diversity among the specializations. Weprove that our problem is hard; but also that a simple greedy algorithm achieves a (1/2)-approximation guarantee.,Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2015,8

Time-annotated sequences for medical data mining,Michele Berlingerio; Francesco Bonchi; Fosca Giannotti; Franco Turini,A typical structure of medical data is a sequence of observations of clinical parameters takenat different time moments. In this kind of contexts; the temporal dimension of data is afundamental variable that should be taken into account in the mining process and returnedas part of the extracted knowledge. Therefore; the classical and well established frameworkof sequential pattern mining is not enough; because it only focuses on the sequentiality ofevents; without extracting the typical time elapsing between two particular events. Time-annotated sequences (IAS) is a novel mining paradigm that solves this problem.

The minimum wiener connector problem,Natali Ruchansky; Francesco Bonchi; David García-Soriano; Francesco Gullo; Nicolas Kourtellis,Abstract The Wiener index of a graph is the sum of all pairwise shortest-path distancesbetween its vertices. In this paper we study the novel problem of finding a minimum Wienerconnector: given a connected graph G=(V; E) and a set Q⊆ V of query vertices; find asubgraph of G that connects all query vertices and has minimum Wiener index. We showthat MIN WIENER CONNECTOR admits a polynomial-time (albeit impractical) exactalgorithm for the special case where the number of query vertices is bounded. We show thatin general the problem is NP-hard; and has no PTAS unless P= NP. Our main contribution isa constant-factor approximation algorithm running in time Õ (| Q|| E|).,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,7
Complexity and algorithms for composite retrieval,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Francesco Bonchi; Carlos Castillo; Esteban Feuerstein; Isabel Méndez-Díaz; Paula Zabala,Online search has become a daily activity and a source of a variety of valuable information;from the finest granularity such as finding the address of a specific restaurant; to morecomplex tasks like looking for accessories compatible with an iPhone or planning a trip. Thelatter typically involves running multiple search queries to gather information about differentplaces; reading online reviews to find out about hotels; and checking geographic proximityof places to visit. We refer to this information seeking activity as composite retrieval andpropose to organize results into item bundles that together constitute an improvedexploratory experience over ranked lists. As a first step towards composite retrievaldefinition; we need to formalize intuitive desirable properties of item bundles.

Characterizing uncertain data using compression,Francesco Bonchi; Matthijs van Leeuwen; Antti Ukkonen,Abstract Motivated by sensor networks; mobility data; biology and life sciences; the area ofmining uncertain data has recently received a great deal of attention. While various papershave focused on efficiently mining frequent patterns from uncertain data; the problem ofdiscovering a small set of interesting patterns that provide an accurate and condenseddescription of a probabilistic database is still unexplored. In this paper we study the problemof discovering characteristic patterns in uncertain data through information theoretic lenses.Adopting the possible worlds interpretation of probabilistic data and a compression schemebased on the MDL principle; we formalize the problem of mining patterns that compress thedatabase well in expectation. Despite its huge search space; we show that this problem canbe accurately approximated. In particular; we devise a sequence of three methods where …,*,2011,7

Towards low-perturbation anonymity preserving pattern discovery,Maurizio Atzori; Francesco Bonchi; Fosca Giannott; Dino Pedreschi,Abstract It is generally believed that data mining results do not violate the anonymity of theindividuals recorded in the source database. In fact; data mining models and patterns; inorder to ensure a required statistical significance; represent a large number of individualsand thus conceal individual identities: this is the case of the minimum support threshold inassociation rule mining. We have recently shown [3]; that the above belief is ill-founded: byshifting the concept of k-anonymity [8] from data to patterns; we have formally characterizedthe notion of a threat to anonymity in the context of frequent itemsets mining; and provided amethodology to efficiently and effectively identify such threats that might arise from thedisclosure of a set of frequent itemsets. In our previous paper [2] we have introduced a first;naïve strategy (named suppressive) to sanitize such threats.

Our ranked group fairnessdefinition extends group fairness using the standard notion of protected groups and is basedon ensuring that the proportion of protected candidates in every prefix of the top-k rankingremains statistically above or indistinguishable from a given minimum. Utility isoperationalized in two ways:(i) every candidate included in the top-k should be morequalified than every candidate not included; and (ii) for every pair of candidates in the top-k;the more qualified candidate should be ranked above.,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2017,6

Privacy concerns vs. user behavior in community question answering,Imrul Kayes; Nicolas Kourtellis; Francesco Bonchi; Adriana Iamnitchi,Community-based question answering (CQA) platforms are crowd-sourced services forsharing user expertise on various topics; from mechanical repairs to parenting. While theynaturally build-in an online social network infrastructure; they carry a very different purposefrom Facebook-like social networks; where users" hang-out" with their friends and tend toshare more personal information. It is unclear; thus; how the privacy concerns and theircorrelation with user behavior in an online social network translate into a CQA platform. Thisstudy analyzes one year of recorded traces from a mature CQA platform to understand theassociation between users' privacy concerns as manifested by their account settings andtheir activity in the platform.

Catch; clean; and release: A survey of obstacles and opportunities for network trace sanitization,Keren Tan; Jihwang Yeo; Michael E Locasto; David Kotz,The sharing of network trace data provides important benefits to both network researchersand administrators. Sharing traces helps scientists and network engineers compare andreproduce results and the behavior of network tools. The practice of sharing suchinformation; however; faces a number of obstacles. Network traces contain significantamounts of sensitive information about the network structure and its users. Thus;researchers wishing to share traces must “sanitize” them to protect this information. Wedistinguish the terms “anonymization” and “sanitization”:“anonymization” attempts to protectthe privacy of network users; and “sanitization” attempts to protect the privacy of networkusers and the secrecy of operational network information.

Optimising topical query decomposition,Marcin Sydow; Francesco Bonchi; Carlos Castillo; Debora Donato,Abstract Topical query decomposition (TQD) is a paradigm recently introduced in [1]; which;given a query; returns to the user a set of queries that cover the answer set of the originalquery. The TQD problem was studied as a variant of the set-cover problem and solved bymeans of a greedy algorithm. This paper aims to strengthen the original formulation byintroducing a new global objective function; and thus formalising the problem as acombinatorial optimisation one. Such a reformulation defines a common framework allowinga formal evaluation and comparison of different approaches to TQD. We apply simulatedannealing; a sub-optimal meta-heuristic; to the problem of topical query decomposition andwe show; through a large experimentation on a data sample extracted from an actual querylog; that such meta-heuristic achieves better results than the greedy algorithm.,Proceedings of the 2009 workshop on Web Search Click Data,2009,6
Network graph evolution rule generation,*,A network's evolution is characterized by graph evolution rules.

Nearest-neighbor queries in probabilistic graphs,Michalis Potamias; Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis; George Kollios,Large probabilistic graphs arise in various domains spanning from social networks tobiological and communication networks. An important query in these graphs is the k nearest-neighbor query; which involves finding and reporting the k closest nodes to a specific node.This query assumes the existence of a measure of the" proximity" or the" distance" betweenany two nodes in the graph. To that end; we propose various novel distance functions thatextend well known notions of classical graph theory; such as shortest paths and randomwalks. We argue that many meaningful distance functions are computationally intractable tocompute exactly. Thus; in order to process nearest-neighbor queries; we resort to MonteCarlo sampling and exploit novel graph-transformation ideas and pruning opportunities.

Constraint-Based Pattern Discovery.,Francesco Bonchi,Devising fast and scalable algorithms; able to crunch huge amount of data; was for manyyears one of the main goals of data mining research. But then we realized that this was notenough. It does not matter how efficient such algorithms can be; the results we obtain areoften of limited use in practice. Typically; the knowledge we seek is in a small pool of localpatterns hidden within an ocean of irrelevant patterns generated from a sea of data.Therefore; it is the volume of the results itself that creates a second order mining problem forthe human expert. This is; typically; the case of association rules and frequent itemset mining(Agrawal & Srikant; 1994); to which; during the last decade a lot of researchers havededicated their (mainly algorithmic) investigations.

Extending the soft constraint based mining paradigm,Stefano Bistarelli; Francesco Bonchi,Abstract The paradigm of pattern discovery based on constraints has been recognized as acore technique in inductive querying: constraints provide to the user a tool to drive thediscovery process towards potentially interesting patterns; with the positive side effect ofachieving a more efficient computation. So far the research on this paradigm has mainlyfocussed on the latter aspect: the development of efficient algorithms for the evaluation ofconstraint-based mining queries. Due to the lack of research on methodological issues; theconstraint-based pattern mining framework still suffers from many problems which limit itspractical relevance. In our previous work [5]; we analyzed such limitations and showed howthey flow out from the same source: the fact that in the classical constraint-based mining; aconstraint is a rigid boolean function which returns either true or false.

Pushing constraints to detect local patterns,Francesco Bonchi; Fosca Giannotti,Abstract The main position of this paper is that constraints can be a very useful tool in thesearch for local patterns. The justification for our position is twofold. On one hand; pushingconstraints makes feasible the computation of frequent patterns at very low frequency levels;which is where local patterns are. On the other hand constraints can be exploited to guidethe search for those patterns showing deviating; surprising characteristics. We first reviewthe many definitions of local patterns. This review leads us to justify our position. We thenprovide a survey of techniques for pushing constraint into the frequent pattern computation.,*,2005,4

Top-k Reliable Edge Colors in Uncertain Graphs,Arijit Khan; Francesco Gullo; Thomas Wohler; Francesco Bonchi,Abstract We study the fundamental problem of finding the set of top-k edge colors thatmaximizes the reliability between a source node and a destination node in an uncertain andedge-colored graph. Our top-k reliable color set problem naturally arises in a variety of real-world applications including pathway finding in biological networks; topic-aware influencemaximization; and team formation in social networks; among many others.

Local correlation clustering,Francesco Bonchi; David García-Soriano; Konstantin Kutzkov,Abstract: Correlation clustering is perhaps the most natural formulation of clustering. Given $n $ objects and a pairwise similarity measure; the goal is to cluster the objects so that; to thebest possible extent; similar objects are put in the same cluster and dissimilar objects are putin different clusters. Despite its theoretical appeal; the practical relevance of correlationclustering still remains largely unexplored; mainly due to the fact that correlation clusteringrequires the $\Theta (n^ 2) $ pairwise similarities as input. In this paper we initiate theinvestigation into\emph {local} algorithms for correlation clustering. In\emph {localcorrelation clustering} we are given the identifier of a single object and we want to return thecluster to which it belongs in some globally consistent near-optimal clustering; using a smallnumber of similarity queries.

In this work we addressthe problem of summarizing large-scale dynamic graphs; maintaining the evolution of theirstructure and the communication patterns. Our approach is based on grouping the nodes ofthe graph in supernodes according to their connectivity and communication patterns.

In this perspective; in Pisa (Italy) we have started animportant data collection and analysis project; where a very large number ofepidemiological; clinical; immunological and genetic variables collected before thetransplantation of a solid organ; and during the follow-up assessment of the patients; arestored in a datawarehouse for future mining. This on-going data collection involves all liver;kidney; pancreas and kidney-pancreas transplantations of the last five years of one of thelargest (as to number of transplantations) centers in Europe. The project ambitious goal is …,*,2009,2
Privacy-aware knowledge discovery from location data,Maurizio Atzori; Francesco Bonchi; Fosca Giannotti; Dino Pedreschi; Osman Abul,Spatio-temporal; geo-referenced datasets are growing rapidly; and will be more in the nearfuture. This phenomenon is mostly due to the daily collection of telecommunication data frommobile phones and other location-aware devices and is expected to enable novel classes ofapplications based on the extraction of behavioral patterns from mobility data. Such patternscould be used for instance in traffic and sustainable mobility management (eg; to study theaccessibility to services); urban planning; environmental monitoring; and collaborativelocation-based services. Clearly; in these applications privacy is a concern; since someknowledge may be sensitive; or an over-specific pattern may reveal the behaviour of groupsof few individual.

Mining HLA patterns explaining liver diseases,Michele Berlingerio; Francesco Bonchi; Silvia Chelazzi; Michele Curcio; Fosca Giannotti; Fabrizio Scatena,Human leukocyte antigens (HLA); also known as histocompatibility antigens; are moleculesfound on all nucleated cells in the body. Histocompatibility antigens help the immune systemto recognize whether or not a cell is foreign to the body; hence the success of an organtransplantation is strongly connected to the HLA systems of the donor-recipient pair. Beyondthis important role; the HLA system seems to influence also the clinical course of hepaticcirrhosis; both on viral and autoimmune basis. However; not only different antigens havedifferent importance wrt hepatic cirrhosis; but; to make things more complicated; other not yetwell characterized factors could play an important role. It is thus important to assess theexistence of associations between haplotypic settings (possibly mixed with clinical anddemographical information) and hepatic cirrhosis.

Core Decomposition and Densest Subgraph in Multilayer Networks,Edoardo Galimberti; Francesco Bonchi; Francesco Gullo,Abstract Multilayer networks are a powerful paradigm to model complex systems; wherevarious relations might occur among the same set of entities. Despite the keen interest in avariety of problems; algorithms; and analysis methods in this type of network; the problem ofextracting dense subgraphs has remained largely unexplored. As a first step in this direction;in this work we study the problem of core decomposition of a multilayer network. Unlike thesingle-layer counterpart in which cores are all nested into one another and can be computedin linear time; the multilayer context is much more challenging as no total order exists amongmultilayer cores; rather; they form a lattice whose size is exponential in the number of layers.In this setting we devise three algorithms which differ in the way they visit the core lattice andin their pruning techniques. We assess time and space efficiency of the three algorithms …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2017,1
Summarizing static and dynamic big graphs,Arijit Khan; Sourav S Bhowmick; Francesco Bonchi,Abstract Large-scale; highly-interconnected networks pervade our society and the naturalworld around us; including the World Wide Web; social networks; knowledge graphs;genome and scientific databases; medical and government records. The massive scale ofgraph data often surpasses the available computation and storage resources. Besides;users get overwhelmed by the daunting task of understanding and using such graphs due totheir sheer volume and complexity. Hence; there is a critical need to summarize largegraphs into concise forms that can be more easily visualized; processed; and managed.Graph summarization has indeed attracted a lot of interests from various researchcommunities; such as sociology; physics; chemistry; bioinformatics; and computer science.Different ways of summarizing graphs have been invented that are often complementary …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,1
Revenue maximization in incentivized social advertising,Cigdem Aslay; Francesco Bonchi; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Wei Lu,Abstract Incentivized social advertising; an emerging marketing model; providesmonetization opportunities not only to the owners of the social networking platforms but alsoto their influential users by offering a" cut" on the advertising revenue. We consider a socialnetwork (the host) that sells ad-engagements to advertisers by inserting their ads; in the formof promoted posts; into the feeds of carefully selected" initial endorsers" or seed users: theseusers receive monetary incentives in exchange for their endorsements. The endorsementshelp propagate the ads to the feeds of their followers. Whenever any user engages with anad; the host is paid some fixed amount by the advertiser; and the ad further propagates tothe feed of her followers; potentially recursively. In this context; the problem for the host is isto allocate ads to influential users; taking into account the propensity of ads for viral …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,1
Secure Centrality Computation Over Multiple Networks,Gilad Asharov; Francesco Bonchi; David Garcia-Soriano; Tamir Tassa,Abstract Consider a multi-layered graph; where the different layers correspond to differentproprietary social networks on the same ground set of users. Suppose that the owners of thedifferent networks (called hosts) are mutually non-trusting parties: how can they compute acentrality score for each of the users using all the layers; but without disclosing informationabout their private graphs? Under this setting we study a suite of three centrality measureswhose algebraic structure allows performing that computation with provable security andefficiency. The first measure counts the nodes reachable from a node within a given radius.The second measure extends the first one by counting the number of paths between any twonodes. The final one is a generalization to the multi-layered graph case: not only the numberof paths is counted; but also the multiplicity of these paths in the different layers is …,Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web,2017,1
Efficient Methods for Influence-Based Network-Oblivious Community Detection,Nicola Barbieri; Francesco Bonchi; Giuseppe Manco,Abstract We study the problem of detecting social communities when the social graph is notavailable but instead we have access to a log of user activity; that is; a dataset of tuples (u; i;t) recording the fact that user u “adopted” item i at time t. We propose a stochastic frameworkthat assumes that the adoption of items is governed by an underlying diffusion process overthe unobserved social network and that such a diffusion model is based on community-levelinfluence. That is; we aim at modeling communities through the lenses of social contagion.By fitting the model parameters to the user activity log; we learn the community membershipand the level of influence of each user in each community. The general framework isinstantiated with two different diffusion models; one with discrete time and one withcontinuous time; and we show that the computational complexity of both approaches is …,ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST),2017,1
Individual privacy in social influence networks,Sara Hajian; Tamir Tassa; Francesco Bonchi,Abstract Online social networking platforms have the possibility to collect an incredibly richset of information about their users: the people they talk to; the people they follow and trust;the people they can influence; as well as their hobbies; interests; and topics in which theyare authoritative. Analyzing these data creates fascinating opportunities for expanding ourunderstanding about social structures and phenomena such as social influence; trust andtheir dynamics. At the same time; mining this type of rich information allows building novelonline services; and it represents a great resource for advertisers and for building viralmarketing campaigns. Sharing social-network graphs; however; raises important privacyconcerns. To alleviate this problem; several anonymization methods have been proposedthat aim at reducing the risk of a privacy breach on the published data while still allowing …,Social Network Analysis and Mining,2016,1
Uncertain Graph Sparsification,Panos Parchas; Nikolaos Papailiou; Dimitris Papadias; Francesco Bonchi,Abstract: Uncertain graphs are prevalent in several applications including communicationssystems; biological databases and social networks. The ever increasing size of theunderlying data renders both graph storage and query processing extremely expensive.Sparsification has often been used to reduce the size of deterministic graphs by maintainingonly the important edges. However; adaptation of deterministic sparsification methods failsin the uncertain setting. To overcome this problem; we introduce the first sparsificationtechniques aimed explicitly at uncertain graphs. The proposed methods reduce the numberof edges and redistribute their probabilities in order to decrease the graph size; whilepreserving its underlying structure. The resulting graph can be used to efficiently andaccurately approximate any query and mining tasks on the original graph. An extensive …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.04308,2016,1
Identifying buzzing stories via anomalous temporal subgraph discovery,Francesco Bonchi; Ilaria Bordino; Francesco Gullo; Giovanni Stilo,Story identification from online user-generated content has recently raised increasingattention. Existing approaches fall into two categories. Approaches in the first categoryextract stories as cohesive substructures in a graph representing the strength of associationbetween terms. The latter category includes approaches that analyze the temporal evolutionof individual terms and identify stories by grouping terms with similar anomalous temporalbehavior. Both categories have limitations. In this work we advance the literature on storyidentification by devising a novel method that profitably combines the peculiarities of the twomain existing approaches; thus also addressing their weaknesses. Experiments on adataset extracted from a real-world web-search log demonstrate the superiority of theproposed method over the state of the art.,Web Intelligence (WI); 2016 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on,2016,1
Spheres of Influence for More Effective Viral Marketing,Yasir Mehmood; Francesco Bonchi; David García-Soriano,Abstract What is the set of nodes of a social network that; under a probabilistic contagionmodel; would get infected if a given node $ s $ gets infected? We call this set the sphere ofinfluence of s. Due to the stochastic nature of the contagion model we need to define anotion of" expected" or" typical" cascade: this is a set of nodes which is the closest to all thepossible cascades starting from s. We thus formalize the Typical Cascade problem whichrequires; for a given source node s; to find the set of nodes minimizing the expected Jaccarddistance to all the possible cascades from s. The expected cost of a typical cascade alsoprovides us a measure of the stability of cascade propagation; ie; how much randomcascades from a source node s deviate from the" typical" cascade. In this sense sourcenodes with lower expected costs are more reliable. We show that; while computing the …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,1

Diverse dimension decomposition for itemset spaces,Mikalai Tsytsarau; Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis; Themis Palpanas,Abstract We introduce the problem of diverse dimension decomposition in transactionaldatabases; where a dimension is a set of mutually exclusive itemsets. The problem weconsider requires to find a decomposition of the itemset space into dimensions; which areorthogonal to each other and which provide high coverage of the input database. Themining framework we propose can be interpreted as a dimensionality-reducingtransformation from the space of all items to the space of orthogonal dimensions. Relying oninformation-theoretic concepts; we formulate the diverse dimension decomposition problemwith a single objective function that simultaneously captures constraints on coverage;exclusivity; and orthogonality. We show that our problem is NP-hard; and we propose agreedy algorithm exploiting the well-known FP-tree data structure. Our algorithm is …,Knowledge and information systems,2012,1
A survey of challenges and solutions for privacy in clinical genomics data mining,Bradley Malin; Christopher Cassa; Murat Kantarcioglu,Numerous government-sponsored ventures; such as the US Department of Health andHuman Services' Personalized Health Care Initiative [22]; have fueled growth inpersonalized medicine research and its application.

Pre-processing for Constrained Pattern Mining.,Francesco Bonchi; Fosca Giannotti; Alessio Mazzanti; Dino Pedreschi,Abstract. Constraint pushing techniques have been proven to be effective in reducing thesearch space in the frequent pattern mining task; and thus in improving efficiency. But whilepushing anti-monotone constraints in a level-wise computation of frequent itemsets hasbeen recognized to be always profitable; the case is different for monotone constraints. Infact; monotone constraints have been considered harder to push in the computation andless effective in pruning the search space. In this paper; we show that this prejudice is illfounded and introduce ExAnte; a pre-processing data reduction algorithm which reducesdramatically both the search space and the input dataset in constrained frequent patternsmining. Experimental results show a reduction of orders of magnitude; thus enabling a mucheasier mining task. ExAnte can be used as a pre-processor with any constrained patterns …,SEBD,2003,1

Fair-by-design algorithms: matching problems and beyond,David García-Soriano; Francesco Bonchi,Abstract: In discrete search and optimization problems where the elements that may or notbe included in a solution correspond to humans; individual fairness needs to be expressedin terms of each individual's satisfaction probability (the probability of being included in thesolution). In this paper we introduce the maxmin fairness framework which provides; on anygiven input instance; the strongest guarantee possible for all individuals; in terms ofsatisfaction probability. A probability distribution over valid solutions is maxmin-fair if it is notpossible to improve the satisfaction probability of any individual without decreasing it forsome other individual which is no better off. We provide an efficient exact algorithm formaxmin-fair bipartite matching combining flow-based methods with algorithms for edge-coloring regular bipartite graphs.

To Be Connected; or Not to Be Connected: That is the Minimum Inefficiency Subgraph Problem,Natali Ruchansky; Francesco Bonchi; David Garcia-Soriano; Francesco Gullo; Nicolas Kourtellis,Abstract We study the problem of extracting a selective connector for a given set of queryvertices Q subset of V in a graph G=(V; E). A selective connector is a subgraph of G whichexhibits some cohesiveness property; and contains the query vertices but does notnecessarily connect them all. Relaxing the connectedness requirement allows the connectorto detect multiple communities and to be tolerant to outliers. We achieve this by introducingthe new measure of network inefficiency and by instantiating our search for a selectiveconnector as the problem of finding the minimum inefficiency subgraph. We show that theminimum inefficiency subgraph problem is NP-hard; and devise efficient algorithms toapproximate it. By means of several case studies in a variety of application domains (suchas human brain; cancer; and food networks); we show that our minimum inefficiency …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2017,*

Core Decomposition of Massive; Information-Rich Graphs,Francesco Bonchi; Francesco Gullo; Andreas Kaltenbrunner,Recent advances in social and information science have shown that linked data is pervasivein our society and the world around us. Graphs have become a ubiquitous model torepresent realworld structured data. They are routinely used to describe a large variety ofdata such as the Web; social networks; knowledge bases;(heterogeneous) informationnetworks; biological networks; and many more. As the ability to collect data has increasedgeometrically in the recent years; these graphs typically count millions; or even billions; ofvertices and edges. Justifiably; there has been an increasing demand for methods that areable to cope with graphs at a large scale. At the same time; the proliferation ofheterogeneous data acquired from a variety of sources has given rise to more and morecomplex linkeddata representations. As a result; today's realworld graphs exhibit a wide …,*,2017,*
Conditional Reliability in Uncertain Graphs,Arijit Khan; Francesco Bonchi; Francesco Gullo; Andreas Nufer,Abstract: Network reliability is a well-studied problem that requires to measure theprobability that a target node is reachable from a source node in a probabilistic (oruncertain) graph; ie; a graph where every edge is assigned a probability of existence. Manyapproaches and problem variants have been considered in the literature; all assuming thatedge-existence probabilities are fixed. Nevertheless; in real-world graphs; edgeprobabilities typically depend on external conditions. In metabolic networks a protein can beconverted into another protein with some probability depending on the presence of certainenzymes. In social influence networks the probability that a tweet of some user will be re-tweeted by her followers depends on whether the tweet contains specific hashtags.

Privacy Preservation on Time Series,Spiros Papadimitriou; Feifei Li; George Kollios; S Yu Philip,Time series data are sequence of values based on observations at periodic time instantsand appear in a wide range of domains and applications; such as financial; retail;environmental and process monitoring; defense and health care. Additionally; massivevolumes of data from various sources are continuously collected. However; when a dataowner wants to publish this data he may not be willing to exactly reveal the true values dueto various reasons; most notably privacy considerations. A widely employed and acceptedapproach for partial information hiding is based on random perturbation [4]; whichintroduces uncertainty about individual values. Consider the following examples:,Privacy-Aware Knowledge Discovery: Novel Applications and New Techniques,2010,*

For example; DNA or proteinsequences from bio-informatics; click streams from the Web; and spatio-temporal trajectoriesof moving objects from GPS or GSM applications are few of such popular data types. Massesof collected sequence data; naturally attracted data mining researchers to developalgorithms for extracting patterns or descriptive models from sequences. In fact; one of theearly data mining papers considers customer purchase sequences as the target data source[4] to discover frequently appearing sequences of customer purchases. Another seminaldata mining paper is on mining frequent episodes from event sequences which proposed …,Privacy-Aware Knowledge Discovery: Novel Applications and New Techniques,2010,*

On the high density of leadership nuclei in endorsement social networks,Guillermo Garrido; Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis,Abstract In this paper we study the community structure of endorsement networks; ie; socialnetworks in which a directed edge u→ v is asserting an action of support from user u to userv. Examples include scenarios in which a user u is favoring a photo; liking a post; orfollowing the microblog of user v. Starting from the hypothesis that the footprint of acommunity in an endorsement network is a bipartite directed clique from a set of followers toa set of leaders; we apply frequent itemset mining techniques to discover such bicliques. Ouranalysis of real networks discovers that an interesting phenomenon is taking place: theleaders of a community are endorsing each other forming a very dense nucleus.,Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web,2010,*

Weighted and Probabilistic Instances of the Soft Constraint Based Pattern Mining Paradigm,Stefano Bistarelli; Francesco Bonchi,Abstract. The paradigm of pattern discovery based on constraints has been recognized as acore technique in inductive querying: constraints provide to the user a tool to drive thediscovery process towards potentially interesting patterns; with the positive side effect ofachieving a more efficient computation. However; due to the lack of research onmethodological issues; the constraint-based pattern mining framework still suffers from manyproblems which limit its practical relevance. In our previous work [4]; we analyzed suchlimitations and showed how they flow out from the same source: the fact that in the classicalconstraint-based mining; a constraint is a rigid boolean function which returns either true orfalse. To overcome such limitations we introduced the new paradigm of pattern discoverybased on Soft Constraints; and instantiated our idea to the fuzzy soft constraints.

In this paper we study data mining query language and optimizations in the contextof a Logic-based Knowledge Discovery Support Environment. ie; a flexible knowledgediscovery system with capabilities to obtain; maintain; represent; and utilize both inducedand deduced knowledge. In particular; we focus on frequent pattern queries; since this kindof query is at the basis of many mining tasks; and it seems appropriate to be encapsulated ina knowledge discovery system as a primitive operation. We introduce an inductive languagefor frequent pattern queries; which is simple enough to be highly optimized and expressiveenough to cover the most of interesting queries. Then we define an optimized constraint-pushing operational semantics for our inductive language. This semantics is based on afrequent pattern mining operator; which is able to exploit as much as possible the given …,SEBD,2004,*

The magazine archive includes every article published in Communications of the ACM for over the past 50 years.,Sharon McDonald; Helen M Edwards,The construction of software engineering teams; the interaction between members; and howindividual personalities influence these; has been a concern from the 1960s to the presentday [5]. Nevertheless; despite claims from leading figures in the field that it is fundamentallypeople that make the difference between software success and failure; a corpus ofknowledge and good practice has failed to emerge. While there have been some attempts toinvestigate these issues through the application of psychometric tests; the issue of whatpersonality analysis can or cannot offer software engineering is still open for debate [6; 9]. Inthis article we argue that the lack of progress in this field is due in part to the inappropriateuse of psychological tests; frequently coupled with basic misunderstandings of personalitytheory by those who use them.

Algorithmic bias: from discrimination discovery to fairness-aware data mining (KDD’16 Tutorial),Francesco Bonchi; Carlos Castillo; Sara Hajian,Abstract Algorithms and decision making based on Big Data have become pervasive in allaspects of our daily (offline and online) lives; as they have become essential tools inpersonal finance; health care; hiring; housing; education; and policies. Data and algorithmsdetermine the media we consume; the stories we read; the people we meet; the places wevisit; but also whether we get a job; or whether our loan request is approved. It is therefore ofsocietal and ethical importance to ask whether these algorithms can be discriminative ongrounds; such as gender; ethnicity; marital or health status. It turns out that the answer ispositive: for instance; recent studies have shown that Google's online advertising systemdisplayed ads for high-income jobs to men much more often than it did to women; and adsfor arrest records were significantly more likely to show up on searches for distinctively …,*,*,*

We start with representatives that capture theexpected vertex degrees; as this is a fundamental property of the graph topology. We thengeneralize the notion of vertex degree to the concept of n-clique cardinality; ie; the numberof cliques of size n that contain a vertex. For the first problem; we propose two methods:Average Degree Rewiring (ADR); which is based on random edge rewiring; andApproximate B-matching (ABM); which applies graph matching techniques. For the secondproblem; we develop a greedy approach and a game theoretic framework. Weexperimentally demonstrate; with real uncertain graphs; that indeed the representativeinstances can be used to answer; efficiently and accurately; queries based on several …,*,*,*

Pisa KDD Laboratory ISTI-CNR Area della Ricerca di Pisa Via Giuseppe Moruzzi 1; 56124 Pisa; Italy bonchi@ di. unipi. it; f. giannotti@ cnuce. cnr. it,Francesco Bonchi,Abstract The key point of this paper is that; in frequent pattern mining; the most appropriateway of exploiting monotone constraints in conjunction with frequency is to use them in orderto reduce the problem input together with the search space. Following this intuition; weintroduce ExAMiner; a level-wise algorithm which exploits the real synergy of antimonotoneand monotone constraints: the total benefit is greater than the sum of the two individualbenefits. Ex-AMiner generalizes the basic idea of the preprocessing algorithm ExAnte [4];embedding such ideas at all levels of an Apriori-like computation. The resulting algorithm isthe generalization of the Apriori algorithm when a conjunction of monotone constraints isconjoined to the frequency antimonotone constraint. Experimental results confirm that this is;so far; the most efficient way of attacking the computational problem in analysis.,*,*,*

Social Web Mining,Francesco Bonchi; Wray Buntine; Ricard Gavalda; Shengbo Guo,Social networks have drawn increasingly larger number of users worldwide for the lastdecade; thanks to the success deployment of social platforms such as Facebook; LinkedIn;Flickr; Delicious; Douban; and many others. Information underlying the social networks hasproved to be extremely beneficial for diverse applications such as recommender systems;electronic commerce; and even search engines; just to name a few. The rapid growth ofsocial networks brings unprecedent commercial opportunities to the machine learning anddata mining communities; but there are many open problems for analyzing social networks.Some are:,*,*,*
