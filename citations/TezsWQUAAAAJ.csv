Spatio-textual similarity joins,Panagiotis Bouros; Shen Ge; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Given a collection of objects that carry both spatial and textual information; a spatio-textual similarity join retrieves the pairs of objects that are spatially close and textuallysimilar. As an example; consider a social network with spatially and textually tagged persons(ie; their locations and profiles). A useful task (for friendship recommendation) would be tofind pairs of persons that are spatially close and their profiles have a large overlap (ie; theyhave common interests). Another application is data de-duplication (eg; finding photographswhich are spatially close to each other and high overlap in their descriptive tags). Despitethe importance of this operation; there is very little previous work that studies its efficientevaluation and in fact under a different definition; only the best match for each object isidentified. In this paper; we combine ideas from state-of-the-art spatial distance join and …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,61
Caching dynamic skyline queries,Dimitris Sacharidis; Panagiotis Bouros; Timos Sellis,Abstract Given a query tuple q; the dynamic skyline query retrieves the tuples that are notdynamically dominated by any other in the data set with respect to q. A tuple dynamicallydominates another; wrt q; if it has closer to q's values in all attributes; and has strictly closerto q's value in at least one. The dynamic skyline query can be treated as a standard skylinequery; subject to the transformation of all tuples' values. In this work; we make theobservation that results to past dynamic skyline queries can help reduce the computationcost for future queries. To this end; we propose a caching mechanism for dynamic skylinequeries and devise a cache-aware algorithm. Our extensive experimental evaluationdemonstrates the efficiency of this mechanism compared to standard techniques withoutcaching.,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2008,28
Evaluating reachability queries over path collections,Panagiotis Bouros; Spiros Skiadopoulos; Theodore Dalamagas; Dimitris Sacharidis; Timos Sellis,Abstract Several applications in areas such as biochemistry; GIS; involve storing andquerying large volumes of sequential data stored as path collections. There is a number ofinteresting queries that can be posed on such data. This work focuses on reachabilityqueries: given a path collection and two nodes vs; vt; determine whether a path from vs to vtexists and identify it. To answer these queries; the path-first search paradigm; which treatspaths as first-class citizens; is proposed. To improve the performance of our techniques; twoindexing structures that capture the reachability information of paths are introduced. Further;methods for updating a path collection and its indices are discussed. Finally; an extensiveexperimental evaluation verifies the advantages of our approach.,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2009,25
Dynamic pickup and delivery with transfers,Panagiotis Bouros; Dimitris Sacharidis; Theodore Dalamagas; Timos Sellis,Abstract In the dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem with Transfers (dPDPT); a set oftransportation requests that arrive at arbitrary times must be assigned to a fleet of vehicles.We use two cost metrics that capture both the company's and the customer's viewpointsregarding the quality of an assignment. In most related problems; the rule of thumb is toapply a two-phase local search algorithm to heuristically determine a good requests-to-vehicles assignment. This work proposes a novel solution based on a graph-basedformulation of the problem that treats each request independently. Briefly; in this conceptualgraph; the goal is to find a shortest path from a node representing the pickup location to thatof the delivery location. However; we show that efficient Bellman-Ford or Dijkstra-likealgorithms cannot be applied. Still; our method is able to find dPDPT solutions …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2011,22
An empirical evaluation of set similarity join techniques,Willi Mann; Nikolaus Augsten; Panagiotis Bouros,Abstract Set similarity joins compute all pairs of similar sets from two collections of sets. Weconduct extensive experiments on seven state-of-the-art algorithms for set similarity joins.These algorithms adopt a filter-verification approach. Our analysis shows that verificationhas not received enough attention in previous works. In practice; efficient verificationinspects only a small; constant number of set elements and is faster than some of the moresophisticated filter techniques. Although we can identify three winners; we find that mostalgorithms show very similar performance. The key technique is the prefix filter; and AllPairs;the first algorithm adopting this techniques is still a relevant competitor. We repeatexperiments from previous work and discuss diverging results. All our claims are supportedby a detailed analysis of the factors that determine the overall runtime.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,19
Routing directions: keeping it fast and simple,Dimitris Sacharidis; Panagiotis Bouros,Abstract The problem of providing meaningful routing directions over road networks is ofgreat importance. In many real-life cases; the fastest route may not be the ideal choice forproviding directions in written/spoken text; or for an unfamiliar neighborhood; or in cases ofemergency. Rather; it is often more preferable to offer" simple" directions that are easy tomemorize; explain; understand or follow. However; there exist cases where the simplestroute is considerably longer than the fastest. This paper tries to address this issue; by findingnear-simplest routes which are as short as possible and near-fastest routes which are assimple as possible. Particularly; we focus on efficiency; and propose novel algorithms; whichare theoretically and experimentally shown to be significantly faster than existingapproaches.,Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2013,18
Efficient answering of set containment queries for skewed item distributions,Manolis Terrovitis; Panagiotis Bouros; Panos Vassiliadis; Timos Sellis; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract In this paper we address the problem of efficiently evaluating containment (ie;subset; equality; and superset) queries over set-valued data. We propose a novel indexingscheme; the Ordered Inverted File (OIF) which; differently from the state-of-the-art; indexesset-valued attributes in an ordered fashion. We introduce query processing algorithms thatpractically treat containment queries as range queries over the ordered postings lists of OIFand exploit this ordering to quickly prune unnecessary page accesses. OIF is simple toimplement and our experiments on both real and synthetic data show that it greatlyoutperforms the current state-of-the-art methods for all three classes of containment queries.,Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2011,14
An effective encoding scheme for spatial RDF data,John Liagouris; Nikos Mamoulis; Panagiotis Bouros; Manolis Terrovitis,Abstract The RDF data model has recently been extended to support representation andquerying of spatial information (ie; locations and geometries); which is associated with RDFentities. Still; there are limited efforts towards extending RDF stores to efficiently supportspatial queries; such as range selections (eg; find entities within a given range) and spatialjoins (eg; find pairs of entities whose locations are close to each other).

Mining user navigation patterns for personalizing topic directories,Theodore Dalamagas; Panagiotis Bouros; Theodore Galanis; Magdalini Eirinaki; Timos Sellis,Abstract Topic directories are popular means of organizing information resources in the web.In this work; we introduce a methodology for personalizing topic directories. The key featureof our methodology is that the personalization is based on the mining of navigation patternsextracted from previous user visits. These patterns; expressed in the form of visitedcategories and retrieved resources; represent the navigation behaviour and interests ofdifferent users or user groups. Our work provides a set of mining tasks for user navigationpatterns and a set of personalization tasks that customize the organization of the topicdirectory according to these patterns for certain user groups.,Proceedings of the 9th annual ACM international workshop on Web information and data management,2007,12
Regionally influential users in location-aware social networks,Panagiotis Bouros; Dimitris Sacharidis; Nikos Bikakis,Abstract The ubiquity of mobile location aware devices and the proliferation of socialnetworks have given rise to Location-Aware Social Networks (LASN); where users formsocial connections and make geo-referenced posts. The goal of this paper is to identifyusers that can influence a large number of important other users; within a given spatialregion. Returning a ranked list of regionally influential LASN users is useful in viralmarketing and in other per-region analytical scenarios. We show that under a generalinfluence propagation model; the problem is# P-hard; while it becomes solvable inpolynomial time in a more restricted model. Under the more restrictive model; we then showthat the problem can be translated to computing a variant of the so-called closenesscentrality of users in the social network; and devise an evaluation method.,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2014,11

Efficient top-k spatial distance joins,Shuyao Qi; Panagiotis Bouros; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Consider two sets of spatial objects R and S; where each object is assigned a score(eg; ranking). Given a spatial distance threshold ε and an integer k; the top-k spatial distancejoin (k-SDJ) returns the k pairs of objects; which have the highest combined score (based onan aggregate function γ) among all object pairs in R× S which have spatial distance at mostε. Despite the practical application value of this query; it has not received adequate attentionin the past. In this paper; we fill this gap by proposing methods that utilize both location andscore information from the objects; enabling top-k join computation by accessing a limitednumber of objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that a technique which accessesblocks of data from R and S ordered by the object scores and then joins them using an aR-tree based module performs best in practice and outperforms alternative solutions by a …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2013,6
Alternative routing: k-shortest paths with limited overlap,Theodoros Chondrogiannis; Panagiotis Bouros; Johann Gamper; Ulf Leser,Abstract Shortest path computation is a fundamental problem in road networks withapplication in various domains in research and industry. However; returning only theshortest path is often not satisfying; users are also interested in alternative paths which mightbe longer but have other advantages; eg; less frequent traffic congestion. In this paper; weformally introduce the k-Shortest Paths with Limited Overlap (k-SPwLO) problem seeking torecommend k alternative paths which are (a) as short as possible and (b) sufficientlydissimilar based on a user-controlled similarity threshold. We propose two algorithms thatexamine the paths from a source s to a target t in increasing order of their length andprogressively construct the result set.

Set containment join revisited,Panagiotis Bouros; Nikos Mamoulis; Shen Ge; Manolis Terrovitis,Abstract Given two collections of set objects R and S; the R ⋈ _ ⊆ SR⋈⊆ S set containmentjoin returns all object pairs (r; s) ∈ R * S (r; s)∈ R× S such that r ⊆ sr⊆ s. Besides being abasic operator in all modern data management systems with a wide range of applications;the join can be used to evaluate complex SQL queries based on relational division and as amodule of data mining algorithms. The state-of-the-art algorithm for set containment joins(PRETTI PRETTI) builds an inverted index on the right-hand collection S and a prefix tree onthe left-hand collection R that groups set objects with common prefixes and thus; avoidsredundant processing. In this paper; we present a framework which improves PRETTIPRETTI in two directions. First; we limit the prefix tree construction by proposing an adaptivemethodology based on a cost model; this way; we can greatly reduce the space and time …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2016,4

Evaluating “find a path” reachability queries,Panagiotis Bouros; Theodore Dalamagas; Spiros Skiadopoulos; Timos Sellis,Abstract. Graphs are used for modelling complex problems in many areas; such as spatialand road networks; social networks; Semantic Web. An important type of queries in graphsare reachability queries. In this paper; we consider the problem of answering “find a path”reachability queries. Given two nodes s and t in a graph; we want to find a path from s to t. Tothis end; we propose a novel representation of a graph as a set of paths that preserve thereachability information and introduce P-Index to index and provide efficient access in thisrepresentation. Then; we extend the depth-first search algorithm to work with the paths of therepresentation; instead of the graph edges; for evaluating “find a path” reachability queries.Finally; we conduct a preliminary set of experiments that indicate the advantage of exploitinga set of paths for efficiently answering “find a path” reachability queries instead of using …,Proceedings of the European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI) Workshop on Spatial and Temporal Reasoning (Patras; Greece),2008,4

A forward scan based plane sweep algorithm for parallel interval joins,Panagiotis Bouros; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract The interval join is a basic operation that finds application in temporal; spatial; anduncertain databases. Although a number of centralized and distributed algorithms havebeen proposed for the efficient evaluation of interval joins; classic plane sweep approacheshave not been considered at their full potential. A recent piece of related work proposes anoptimized approach based on plane sweep (PS) for modern hardware; showing that itgreatly outperforms previous work. However; this approach depends on the development ofa complex data structure and its parallelization has not been adequately studied. In thispaper; we explore the applicability of a largely ignored forward scan (FS) based planesweep algorithm; which is extremely simple to implement. We propose two optimizations ofFS that greatly reduce its cost; making it competitive to the state-of-the-art single-threaded …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,1

Finding The Most Preferred Path,Dimitris Sacharidis; Panagiotis Bouros; Theodoros Chondrogiannis,The proliferation of navigation devices; such as smartphones with GPS receivers; hasrenewed the interest in algorithms for obtaining optimal routing (driving or walking)directions. Conventional routing operates under the assumption that traveling time ordistance is the most important optimization objective. Hence; a plethora of methods havebeen proposed that answer shortest path queries in almost constant time; even forcontinental sized networks;[5; 41] offer a complete survey and an experimental evaluation. Inpractice however; there exist a number of hard-to-formalize factors that affect people'srouting decisions and so; reaching the destination as fast as possible is not necessarily theoptimal way of moving.

Efficient Top-k Joins on Complex Data Types,Shuyao Qi; Panagiotis Bouros; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Consider two collections of objects R and S; where each object is assigned a score(eg; a rating). Given a join predicate φ and an integer k; a top-k join query returns the k pairsof objects which have the highest combined score (based on an aggregate scoring functionγ) among all object pairs in R⇥ S that qualify φ. This query type has been extensivelystudied in the relational database context where the join predicate is equality; with the maingoal of minimizing the number of tuples accessed from relations R and S. However; if the top-k join involves a non-equijoin predicate φ on complex data types; the computational cost caneasily become the bottleneck of query evaluation.

This is especially true when considering advanced spelling checkers; wherethe usage of contextual rules at the syntax level can significantly increase the spelling errordetection and correction capability of such systems. The advantage of the contextualapproach over the isolated-word approach becomes more clear in morphologically richlanguages; in which it is very likely that a spelling error free word can; in fact; represent amisspelled word within a given context. In such cases; even a minimal set of syntactic rulescan be proved very effective in obtaining high spelling performance levels.

An Empirical Evaluation of Set Similarity Join Techniques [Experiments and Analyses],Willi Mann; Nikolaus Augsten; Panagiotis Bouros,ABSTRACT Set similarity joins compute all pairs of similar sets from two collections of sets.We conduct extensive experiments on seven state-of-the-art algorithms for set similarityjoins. These algorithms adopt a filter-verification approach. Our analysis shows thatverification has not received enough attention in previous works. In practice; efficientverification inspects only a small; constant number of set elements and is faster than some ofthe more sophisticated filter techniques. Although we can identify three winners; we find thatmost algorithms show very similar performance. The key technique is the prefix filter; andAllPairs; the first algorithm adopting this techniques is still a relevant competitor. We repeatexperiments from previous work and discuss diverging results. All our claims are supportedby a detailed analysis of the factors that determine the overall runtime.,*,*,*
