Self-trapping of partially spatially incoherent light,Matthew Mitchell; Zhigang Chen; Ming-feng Shih; Mordechai Segev,Optical spatial solitons have been extensively studied during the last three decades[1]. Self-trappingof optical beams occurs when diffraction is exactly balanced by self- focusing due to an opticalnonlinearity [2]. Self-focusing was first studied in gases [3]; fluids [4]; and solids [5] which possessKerr-like nonlinearities. It has been found that self-trapping of a two dimensional beam in Kerrme- dia is unstable; which leads to catastrophic self-focusing [6] and eventually to beambreakup. Furthermore; even self-trapping of a one dimensional beam in a bulk Kerr mediumis unstable: It suffers from transverse instabil- ities that lead to beam breakup and filamentation[7]. Thus only self-trapping of a one dimensional beam in a slab waveguide is stable in a Kerrmedium [5]. Theoret- ical studies have shown that saturable Kerr media should be able to supportstable self-trapping of a two dimen- sional beam [8]. The first … FIG.2.

Discrete solitons and soliton-induced dislocations in partially coherent photonic lattices,Hector Martin; Eugenia D Eugenieva; Zhigang Chen; Demetrios N Christodoulides,Abstract We investigate both experimentally and theoretically the interaction between a lightbeam and a photonic lattice optically induced with partially coherent light. We demonstrate aclear transition from two-dimensional discrete diffraction to discrete solitons in such apartially coherent lattice and show that the nonlinear interaction process is associated with ahost of new phenomena including lattice dislocation; lattice deformation; and creation ofstructures akin to optical polarons.,Physical review letters,2004,289
Optical spatial solitons: historical overview and recent advances,Zhigang Chen; Mordechai Segev; Demetrios N Christodoulides,Abstract Solitons; nonlinear self-trapped wavepackets; have been extensively studied inmany and diverse branches of physics such as optics; plasmas; condensed matter physics;fluid mechanics; particle physics and even astrophysics. Interestingly; over the past twodecades; the field of solitons and related nonlinear phenomena has been substantiallyadvanced and enriched by research and discoveries in nonlinear optics. While opticalsolitons have been vigorously investigated in both spatial and temporal domains; it is nowfair to say that much soliton research has been mainly driven by the work on optical spatialsolitons. This is partly due to the fact that although temporal solitons as realized in fiber opticsystems are fundamentally one-dimensional entities; the high dimensionality associatedwith their spatial counterparts has opened up altogether new scientific possibilities in …,*,2012,261
Trapping and guiding microparticles with morphing autofocusing Airy beams,Peng Zhang; Jai Prakash; Ze Zhang; Matthew S Mills; Nikolaos K Efremidis; Demetrios N Christodoulides; Zhigang Chen,We observe optical trapping and manipulation of dielectric microparticles using autofocusingradially symmetric Airy beams. This is accomplished by exploiting either the inward oroutward transverse acceleration associated with their chirped wavefronts. Weexperimentally demonstrate; for the first time to our knowledge; that such Airy beams morphinto nondiffracting Bessel beams in their far-field. Furthermore; the ability of guiding andtransporting microparticles along the primary rings of this class of beams is explored.,Optics letters,2011,257

Self-trapping of dark incoherent light beams,Zhigang Chen; Matthew Mitchell; Mordechai Segev; Tamer H Coskun; Demetrios N Christodoulides,“Dark beams” are nonuniform optical beams that contain either a one-dimensional (1D) darkstripe or a two-dimensional (2D) dark hole resulting from a phase singularity or an amplitudedepression in their optical field. Thus far; self-trapped dark beams (dark solitons) have beenobserved using coherent light only. Here; self-trapped dark incoherent light beams (self-trapped dark incoherent wavepackets) were observed. Both dark stripes and dark holesnested in a broad partially spatially incoherent wavefront were self-trapped to form darksolitons in a host photorefractive medium. These self-trapped 1D and 2D dark beamsinduced refractive-index changes akin to planar and circular dielectric waveguides. Theexperiments introduce the possibility of controlling high-power coherent laser beams withlow-power incoherent light sources such as light emitting diodes.,Science,1998,217
Coupled photorefractive spatial-soliton pairs,Zhigang Chen; Mordechai Segev; Tamer H Coskun; Demetrios N Christodoulides; Yuri S Kivshar,We provide a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study of incoherently coupledphotorefractive spatial-soliton pairs in all three possible realizations: bright–bright; dark–dark; and dark–bright. We also show that when the total intensity of two coupled solitons ismuch lower than the effective dark irradiance; the coupled soliton pair is reduced toManakov solitons. In all cases; mutual trapping of both components in the coupled solitonpair is verified by analyzing; experimentally and numerically; the beam evolution afterdecoupling.,JOSA B,1997,192
Nonparaxial Mathieu and Weber accelerating beams,Peng Zhang; Yi Hu; Tongcang Li; Drake Cannan; Xiaobo Yin; Roberto Morandotti; Zhigang Chen; Xiang Zhang,Abstract We demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally nonparaxial Mathieu andWeber accelerating beams; generalizing the concept of previously found acceleratingbeams. We show that such beams bend into large angles along circular; elliptical; orparabolic trajectories but still retain nondiffracting and self-healing capabilities. The circularnonparaxial accelerating beams can be considered as a special case of the Mathieuaccelerating beams; while an Airy beam is only a special case of the Weber beams at theparaxial limit. Not only do generalized nonparaxial accelerating beams open up manypossibilities of beam engineering for applications; but the fundamental concept developedhere can be applied to other linear wave systems in nature; ranging from electromagneticand elastic waves to matter waves.,Physical review letters,2012,183
Plasmonic Airy beams with dynamically controlled trajectories,Peng Zhang; Sheng Wang; Yongmin Liu; Xiaobo Yin; Changgui Lu; Zhigang Chen; Xiang Zhang,We report the experimental generation and dynamic trajectory control of plasmonic Airybeams (PABs). The PABs are created by directly coupling free-space Airy beams to surfaceplasmon polaritons through a grating coupler on a metal surface. We show that the ballisticmotion of the PABs can be reconfigured in real time by either a computer addressed spatiallight modulator or mechanical means.,Optics letters,2011,172

Self-trapping of an optical vortex by use of the bulk photovoltaic effect,Zhigang Chen; Mordechai Segev; Daniel W Wilson; Richard E Muller; Paul D Maker,Abstract We report the first observation of self-trapping of an optical vortex due to the bulkphotovoltaic effect. A singly charged vortex nested on a broad cw laser beam is trapped inboth transverse dimensions in a lithium niobate crystal. Although the optically inducedphotovoltaic current is inherently polar; the space charge field gives rise to two-dimensionalself-defocusing effects. We observe both circular and elliptical self-trapped vortices; as wellas beam deformation due to modulation instability.,Physical review letters,1997,165
Waveguides induced by photorefractive screening solitons,Ming-feng Shih; Zhigang Chen; Matthew Mitchell; Mordechai Segev; Howard Lee; Robert S Feigelson; Jeffrey P Wilde,We study theoretically and experimentally the properties of waveguides induced by one-dimensional steady-state photorefractive screening solitons. We show that the number ofpossible guided modes in a waveguide induced by a bright soliton depends on the intensityratio of the soliton; which is the ratio between the soliton peak intensity and the sum of thebackground illumination and the dark irradiance. We find that the number of guided modesincreases monotonically with increasing intensity ratio. By adjusting the intensity ratio andthe applied field; one can keep a fixed soliton size and at the same time vary the number ofguided modes continuously. On the other hand; waveguides induced by dark screeningsolitons can support only one guided mode for all intensity ratios. Our experiments showgood agreement with the theoretical results for both bright-and dark-soliton-induced …,JOSA B,1997,150

We compare experimental measurementswith theoretical calculations of the soliton properties and find good agreement betweentheory and experiments. We confirm the shapepreserving behavior of the dark soliton bymeasuring its beam profile as it propagates throughout a specially cut crystal and by guidinga beam of a different wavelength.,Optics letters,1996,146
Spatial soliton pixels from partially incoherent light,Zhigang Chen; Kathryn McCarthy,We report what is to our knowledge the first observation of pixellike spatial solitons frompartially spatially incoherent light. We created an array of as many as 32× 32 soliton pixelsby launching a spatially modulated incoherent light beam into a noninstantaneous self-focusing photorefraction medium. These solitons were stable and robust; forming a steady-state two-dimensional waveguide array in which optical coupling and control of localwaveguide channels could be realized.,Optics letters,2002,143
Topological creation and destruction of edge states in photonic graphene,Mikael C Rechtsman; Yonatan Plotnik; Julia M Zeuner; Daohong Song; Zhigang Chen; Alexander Szameit; Mordechai Segev,Abstract We experimentally demonstrate a topological transition of classical light in“photonic graphene”: an array of waveguides arranged in the honeycomb geometry. As thesystem is uniaxially strained (compressed); the two unique Dirac points (present in thespectrum of conventional graphene) merge and annihilate each other; and a band gapforms. As a result; edge states are created on the zigzag edge and destroyed on thebearded edge. These results are applicable for any 2D honeycomb-type structure; fromcarbon-based graphene to photonic lattices and crystals.,Physical review letters,2013,142

Observation of unconventional edge states in ‘photonic graphene’,Yonatan Plotnik; Mikael C Rechtsman; Daohong Song; Matthias Heinrich; Julia M Zeuner; Stefan Nolte; Yaakov Lumer; Natalia Malkova; Jingjun Xu; Alexander Szameit; Zhigang Chen; Mordechai Segev,Abstract Graphene; a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms; has beenattracting much interest in recent years. Electrons therein behave as massless relativisticparticles; giving rise to strikingly unconventional phenomena. Graphene edge states areessential for understanding the electronic properties of this material. However; the coarse orimpure nature of the graphene edges hampers the ability to directly probe the edge states.Perhaps the best example is given by the edge states on the bearded edge that have neverbeen observed—because such an edge is unstable in graphene. Here; we use the opticalequivalent of graphene—a photonic honeycomb lattice—to study the edge states and theirproperties.

Necklacelike solitons in optically induced photonic lattices,J Yang; I Makasyuk; PG Kevrekidis; H Martin; BA Malomed; DJ Frantzeskakis; Zhigang Chen,Abstract We report the first observation of stationary necklacelike solitons. Such necklacestructures were realized when a high-order vortex beam was launched appropriately into atwo-dimensional optically induced photonic lattice. Our theoretical results obtained withcontinuous and discrete models show that the necklace solitons resulting from a charge-4vortex have a π phase difference between adjacent “pearls” and are formed in an octagonshape. Their stability region is identified.,Physical review letters,2005,129
Defect modes in one-dimensional photonic lattices,Francesco Fedele; Jianke Yang; Zhigang Chen,Linear defect modes in one-dimensional photonic lattices are studied theoretically. Fornegative (repulsive) defects; various localized defect modes are found. The strongestconfinement of the defect modes appears when the lattice intensity at the defect site isnonzero rather than zero. When launched at small angles into such a defect site of thelattice; a Gaussian beam can be trapped and undergo snake oscillations under appropriateconditions.,Optics letters,2005,128

Theory of incoherent dark solitons,Demetrios N Christodoulides; Tamer H Coskun; Matthew Mitchell; Zhigang Chen; Mordechai Segev,Abstract We formulate the theory of incoherent dark spatial solitons in noninstantaneous self-defocusing nonlinear media. We find that the basic modal constituents of these incoherentdark soliton entities are radiation modes as well as bound states. Our results explain for thefirst time why incoherent dark solitons are in fact gray and why a transverse π-phase flip canfacilitate their observation.,Physical review letters,1998,121

Directional coupler with soliton-induced waveguides,Song Lan; Eugenio DelRe; Zhigang Chen; Ming-feng Shih; Mordechai Segev,We demonstrate a directional coupler that employs two waveguides induced by two mutuallyincoherent photorefractive solitons propagating in parallel at close proximity. Efficientcoupling from one waveguide to the other is achieved for probe beams at wavelengths muchlonger than that of the solitons. We study the mutual coupling as a function of distancebetween solitons.,Optics letters,1999,114
Dipole and quadrupole solitons in optically induced two‐dimensional photonic lattices: theory and experiment,Jianke Yang; Igor Makasyuk; Anna Bezryadina; Zhigang Chen,Abstract Dipole and quadrupole solitons in a two-dimensional photorefractive optical latticeare investigated both theoretically and experimentally. It is shown theoretically that out-of-phase dipole solitons and quadrupole solitons exist and are linearly stable in theintermediate-intensity regime. In-phase dipole and quadrupole solitons; however; arealways linearly unstable; but their instabilities are rather weak in the low-intensity regime.Experimentally; both types of dipole solitons are observed; and the experimental resultsagree qualitatively with the theoretical predictions. In addition; we have observed theanisotropic effect of the photorefractive crystal in the dipole-soliton formation.,Studies in applied mathematics,2004,110

Spontaneous symmetry breaking in photonic lattices: Theory and experiment,PG Kevrekidis; Zhigang Chen; BA Malomed; DJ Frantzeskakis; MI Weinstein,Abstract We examine an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking in a double-wellwaveguide with a symmetric potential. The ground state of the system beyond a criticalpower becomes asymmetric. The effect is illustrated numerically; and quantitatively analyzedvia a Galerkin truncation that clearly shows the bifurcation from a symmetric to anasymmetric steady state. This phenomenon is also demonstrated experimentally when aprobe beam is launched appropriately into an optically induced photonic lattice in aphotorefractive material.,Physics Letters A,2005,104

Steady-state vortex-screening solitons formed in biased photorefractive media,Zhigang Chen; Ming-feng Shih; Mordechai Segev; Daniel W Wilson; Richard E Muller; Paul D Maker,We report the observation of steady-state photorefractive vortex-screening solitons. As asingly charged circular vortex nested on a broad beam propagates through a biasedstrontium barium niobate crystal; it self-traps in both transverse dimensions despite theinherent anisotropy of the photorefractive nonlinearity. When the vortex beam is a doughnut-shaped narrow beam; it breaks up into two elongated slices (with a self-defocusingnonlinearity) or into two focused filaments (with a self-focusing nonlinearity). Wedemonstrate the optical guidance of a probe beam in a circular waveguide induced by theself-trapped vortex.,Optics letters,1997,95
Defect solitons in photonic lattices,Jianke Yang; Zhigang Chen,Abstract Nonlinear defect modes (defect solitons) and their stability in one-dimensionalphotonic lattices with focusing saturable nonlinearity are investigated. It is shown that defectsolitons bifurcate out from every infinitesimal linear defect mode. Low-power defect solitonsare linearly stable in lower bandgaps but unstable in higher bandgaps. At higher powers;defect solitons become unstable in attractive defects; but can remain stable in repulsivedefects. Furthermore; for high-power solitons in attractive defects; we found a type ofVakhitov-Kolokolov (VK) instability which is different from the usual VK instability based onthe sign of the slope in the power curve. Lastly; we demonstrate that in each bandgap; inaddition to defect solitons which bifurcate from linear defect modes; there is also an infinitefamily of other defect solitons which can be stable in certain parameter regimes.,Physical Review E,2006,92
Experiments on induced modulational instability of an incoherent optical beam,Jill Klinger; Hector Martin; Zhigang Chen,We report the observation of modulational instability (MI) of a partially spatially incoherentbeam induced by seeding noise through cross-phase modulation. We show experimentallythat a threshold exists for such induced incoherent MI to occur that depends on the degree ofspatial coherence as well as on the strength of the nonlinearity. Above threshold; theinduced MI leads to the formation of ordered and disordered patterns of incoherent light.,Optics letters,2001,91

The parameters that characterize the properties of the high-orderdark screening solitons are measured and compared with the theoretical prediction for thefundamental dark screening soliton.

Defect modes at different wavelengths are also observed.,Physical review letters,2006,84

Without a priori spectral or phaseengineering; a stripe beam whose spatial power spectrum lies only in one transversedirection evolves into a gap soliton train with power spectrum growing also in the orthogonaldirection due to nonlinear transport and spectrum reshaping.

Sequential formation of multiple dark photorefractive spatial solitons: experiments and theory,Zhigang Chen; Mordechai Segev; Sujata R Singh; Tamer H Coskun; Demetrios N Christodoulides,Steady-state dark photorefractive spatial screening solitons are observed in an odd-or even-number sequence when a laser beam that contains a dark stripe generated from a phase oramplitude discontinuity in the center of the beam is launched into a biased bulk strontiumbarium niobate crystal. If the initial width of the dark stripe is small; only a fundamentalsoliton or a Y-junction soliton is generated; corresponding to the lowest order in the odd-oreven-number soliton sequence. As the initial width and the bias field are increased; weobserve a progressive transition from a lower-order soliton to a sequence of higher-ordermultiple solitons. We show that these dark solitons induce stable waveguides that can guidean intense beam of a different wavelength into multiple channels.

This new class of soliton states involves bright solitonson a partially incoherent background of infinite extent. In the case where the nonlinearity isof the Kerr type; their existence is demonstrated analytically by means of an exact solution.Computer simulations and experiments indicate that these incoherent antidark solitons canpropagate in a stable fashion provided that the spatial coherence of their background isreduced below the incoherent modulation instability threshold.,Physical review letters,2000,69
Stable higher-order vortices and quasivortices in the discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation,PG Kevrekidis; Boris A Malomed; Zhigang Chen; DJ Frantzeskakis,Abstract Vortex solitons with the topological charge S= 3; and “quasivortex”(multipole)solitons; which exist instead of the vortices with S= 2 and 4; are constructed on a squarelattice in the discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation (true vortices with S= 2 were knownbefore; but they are unstable). For each type of solitary wave; its stability interval is found; interms of the intersite coupling constant. The interval shrinks with increase of S. At couplingsabove a critical value; oscillatory instabilities set in; resulting in breakup of the vortex orquasivortex into lattice solitons with a lower vorticity. Such localized states may be observedin optical guiding structures; and in Bose-Einstein condensates loaded into optical lattices.,Physical Review E,2004,68
Persistence and breakdown of Airy beams driven by an initial nonlinearity,Yi Hu; Simon Huang; Peng Zhang; Cibo Lou; Jingjun Xu; Zhigang Chen,We study the behavior of Airy beams propagating from a nonlinear medium to a linearmedium. We show that an Airy beam initially driven by a self-defocusing nonlinearityexperiences anomalous diffraction and can maintain its shape in subsequent propagation;but its intensity pattern and acceleration cannot persist when driven by a self-focusingnonlinearity. The unusual behavior of Airy beams is examined from their energy flow as wellas the Brillouin zone spectrum of self-induced chirped photonic lattices.,Optics letters,2010,65

Fourier-space generation of abruptly autofocusing beams and optical bottle beams,Ioannis Chremmos; Peng Zhang; Jai Prakash; Nikolaos K Efremidis; Demetrios N Christodoulides; Zhigang Chen,We demonstrate analytically and experimentally that a circular abruptly autofocusing (AAF)Airy beam can be generated by Fourier-transforming an appropriately apodized Besselbeam whose radial oscillations are chirped by a cubic phase term. Depending on therelation between the chirp rate and the focal distance of the Fourier-transforming lens; it ispossible to generate AAF beams with one or two foci; the latter case leading to the formationof an elegant paraboloid optical bottle.,Optics letters,2011,64

Self-accelerating Airy beams: generation; control; and applications,Yi Hu; Georgios A Siviloglou; Peng Zhang; Nikolaos K Efremidis; Demetrios N Christodoulides; Zhigang Chen,Abstract Recently; a specific type of nondiffracting beams named self-accelerating Airybeams has attracted a great deal of interest due to their unique properties and manyproposed applications in areas such as optical micromanipulation; plasma guidance;vacuum electron acceleration; and routing surface plasmon polaritons. In contradistinctionwith Bessel beams; Airy beams do not rely on simple conical superposition of plane waves;and they possess the properties of self-acceleration in addition to nondiffraction and self-healing. For the past few years; tremendous research work has been devoted to the study ofAiry beams; from theoretical predictions to experimental observations; from linear control tononlinear self-trapping; and from fundamental aspects to demonstrations of potentialapplications. In this chapter; we provide an overview on generation and control of Airy …,*,2012,62

Observation of self-accelerating Bessel-like optical beams along arbitrary trajectories,Juanying Zhao; Peng Zhang; Dongmei Deng; Jingjiao Liu; Yuanmei Gao; Ioannis D Chremmos; Nikolaos K Efremidis; Demetrios N Christodoulides; Zhigang Chen,We experimentally demonstrate self-accelerating Bessel-like optical beams propagatingalong arbitrary trajectories in free space. With computer-generated holography; such beamsare designed to follow different controllable trajectories while their main lobe transverseprofiles remain nearly invariant and symmetric. Examples include parabolic; snake-like;hyperbolic; hyperbolic secant; and even three-dimensional spiraling trajectories. The self-healing property of such beams is also demonstrated. This new class of optical beams canbe considered as a hybrid between accelerating and nonaccelerating nondiffracting beamsthat may find a variety of applications.,Optics letters,2013,57
Inversion and tight focusing of Airy pulses under the action of third-order dispersion,Rodislav Driben; Yi Hu; Zhigang Chen; Boris A Malomed; Roberto Morandotti,By means of direct simulations and theoretical analysis; we study the nonlinear propagationof truncated Airy pulses in an optical fiber exhibiting both anomalous second-order andstrong positive third-order dispersions (TOD). It is found that the Airy pulse first reaches afinite-size focal area as determined by the relative strength of the two dispersion terms; andthen undergoes an inversion transformation such that it continues to travel with an oppositeacceleration. The system notably features tight focusing if the TOD is a dominant factor.These effects are partially reduced by Kerr nonlinearity.,Optics letters,2013,56

Properties of Defect Modes in One‐Dimensional Optically Induced Photonic Lattices,Francesco Fedele; Jianke Yang; Zhigang Chen,Abstract In this article; localized defect modes in one-dimensional optically induced photoniclattices are studied comprehensively. First; the origin of these defect modes is investigatedanalytically in the weak-defect limit by perturbation methods. It is shown that in an attractivedefect where the lattice light intensity at the defect site is higher than that of nearby sites; adefect mode bifurcates from the left edge of every Bloch band; while in a repulsive defect; adefect mode bifurcates from the right edge of every Bloch band. When the defect is not weak;defect modes are examined by numerical methods. It is shown that in a repulsive defect; thestrongest confinement of defect modes arises when the lattice light intensity at the defect siteis nonzero rather than zero. In addition; as the potential strength increases; defect modesdisappear from lower bandgaps and appear in higher bandgaps. In an attractive defect …,Studies in Applied Mathematics,2005,53
Bessel-like optical beams with arbitrary trajectories,Ioannis D Chremmos; Zhigang Chen; Demetrios N Christodoulides; Nikolaos K Efremidis,A method is proposed for generating Bessel-like optical beams with arbitrary trajectories infree space. The method involves phase-modulating an optical wavefront so that conicalbundles of rays are formed whose apexes write a continuous focal curve with pre-specifiedshape. These ray cones have circular bases on the input plane; thus their interferenceresults in a Bessel-like transverse field profile that propagates along the specified trajectorywith a remarkably invariant main lobe. Such beams can be useful as hybrids between non-accelerating and accelerating optical waves that share diffraction-resisting and self-healingproperties.,Optics letters,2012,52

Observation of in-band lattice solitons,Xiaosheng Wang; Zhigang Chen; Jiandong Wang; Jianke Yang,Abstract We report the first experimental and theoretical demonstrations of in-band (orembedded) lattice solitons. Such solitons appear in trains; and their propagation constantsreside inside the first Bloch band of a square lattice; different from all previously observedsolitons. We show that these solitons bifurcate from Bloch modes at the interior high-symmetry X points within the first band; where normal and anomalous diffractions coexistalong two orthogonal directions. At high powers; the in-band soliton can move into the firstband gap and turn into a gap soliton.,Physical review letters,2007,50
Three is a crowd: Solitary waves in photorefractive media with three potential wells,Todd Kapitula; Panayotis G Kevrekidis; Zhigang Chen,In this paper we analytically; numerically; and experimentally study the dynamics of waves inphotorefractive media in the presence of a potential with three wells. The results containedherein are also immediately applicable to the study of Bose–Einstein condensates in theweak interaction limit. Motivated by the recent theoretical and experimental efforts in thecase of two wells; we systematically analyze the ways in which the bifurcation analysis ofsteady states and the stability picture are modified in the presence of a third potential well. Inparticular; it is shown that the presence of a third well causes all bifurcations to be of saddle-node type. Our analytical results are based on a Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction in the modesof the underlying linear problem. We corroborate the analytical predictions with numericalresults which are based on fixed point methods. Finally; we illustrate how these findings …,SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems,2006,50

Clustering of solitons in weakly correlated wavefronts,Zhigang Chen; Suzanne M Sears; Hector Martin; Demetrios N Christodoulides; Mordechai Segev,Clustering; or the gross-scale aggregation of fine-scale structures; has been observed in manydiverse physical systems: from galactic clusters (1; 2) to molecular aggregates (3; 4); fromself-assembled quantum dots (5) to biological systems (6); just to name a few. Despite the greatvariety of physical systems in which these clustering phenomena occur; the underlying processesare fundamentally similar in several ways. This similarity is actually a manifestation of two characteristicfeatures: (i) the fine structure results from the equilibrium of opposing effects or forces; and(ii) the cluster forms because of attraction between these individual “fine-scale elements.” Forexample; a protein molecule may be made up by more than one polypeptide chain. In the caseof hemoglobin; four separate polypeptide chains; or subunits; are clustered together (held togetherby van der Waals and ionic forces).

Abruptly autofocusing and autodefocusing optical beams with arbitrary caustics,Ioannis D Chremmos; Zhigang Chen; Demetrios N Christodoulides; Nikolaos K Efremidis,Abstract We propose a simple yet efficient method for generating abruptly autofocusingoptical beams with arbitrary caustics. In addition; we introduce a family of abruptlyautodefocusing beams whose maximum intensity suddenly decreases by orders ofmagnitude right after the target. The method relies on appropriately modulating the phase ofa circularly symmetric optical wavefront; such as that of a Gaussian; and subsequently onFourier-transforming it by means of a lens. If two such beams are superimposed in a Bessel-like standing wave pattern; then a complete mirror-symmetric; with respect to the focal plane;caustic surface of revolution is formed that can be used as an optical bottle. We also showhow the same method can be used to produce accelerating 1D or 2D optical beams witharbitrary convex caustics.,Physical Review A,2012,46
Two-dimensional defect modes in optically induced photonic lattices,Jiandong Wang; Jianke Yang; Zhigang Chen,Abstract In this article; localized linear defect modes due to band gap guidance in two-dimensional photonic lattices with localized or nonlocalized defects are investigatedtheoretically. First; when the defect is localized and weak; eigenvalues of defect modesbifurcated from edges of Bloch bands are derived analytically. It is shown that in an attractive(repulsive) defect; defect modes bifurcate out from Bloch-band edges with normal(anomalous) diffraction coefficients. Furthermore; distances between defect-modeeigenvalues and Bloch-band edges decrease exponentially with the defect strength; whichis very different from the one-dimensional case where such distances decreasequadratically with the defect strength. It is also found that some defect-mode branchesbifurcate not from Bloch-band edges; but from quasiedge points within Bloch bands …,Physical Review A,2007,46
Wave propagation in waveguide arrays with alternating positive and negative couplings,Nikolaos K Efremidis; Peng Zhang; Zhigang Chen; Demetrios N Christodoulides; Christian E Rüter; Detlef Kip,Abstract We introduce a waveguide array model with alternating positive and negativecouplings between adjacent waveguides. Two different settings where such a model can berealized are identified as arrays of defects in Bragg gratings and arrays with propagationconstants that periodically vary along the propagation direction. We analyze the propertiesof wave propagation in such waveguide arrays and find several interesting properties thathave no counterpart in the case of arrays with constant couplings. These include the beamself-splitting; self-induced Talbot oscillations; symmetric evolution of Bloch oscillations; andnew families of lattice solitons.,Physical Review A,2010,45

Unveiling pseudospin and angular momentum in photonic graphene,Daohong Song; Vassilis Paltoglou; Sheng Liu; Yi Zhu; Daniel Gallardo; Liqin Tang; Jingjun Xu; Mark Ablowitz; Nikolaos K Efremidis; Zhigang Chen,Abstract Pseudospin; an additional degree of freedom inherent in graphene; plays a key rolein understanding many fundamental phenomena such as the anomalous quantum Halleffect; electron chirality and Klein paradox. Unlike the electron spin; the pseudospin wastraditionally considered as an unmeasurable quantity; immune to Stern-Gerlach-typeexperiments. Recently; however; it has been suggested that graphene pseudospin is a realangular momentum that might manifest itself as an observable quantity; but so far direct testsof such a momentum remained unfruitful. Here; by selective excitation of two sublattices ofan artificial photonic graphene; we demonstrate pseudospin-mediated vortex generationand topological charge flipping in otherwise uniform optical beams with Bloch momentumtraversing through the Dirac points.

Experiments on Gaussian beams and vortices in optically induced photonic lattices,Zhigang Chen; Hector Martin; Anna Bezryadina; Dragomir Neshev; Yuri S Kivshar; Demetrios N Christodoulides,We investigate experimentally the propagation of fundamental Gaussian beams and vorticesin a two-dimensional photonic lattice optically induced with partially coherent light. We focuson soliton-lattice interactions and vortex-lattice interactions when the lattice is operated in anonlinear regime. In this case a host of novel phenomena is demonstrated; including soliton-induced lattice dislocation-deformation; soliton hopping and slow-down; and creation ofstructures akin to optical polarons. In addition; we observe that the nonlinear interactionbetween a vortex beam and a solitonic lattice leads to lattice twisting due to a transfer of theangular momentum carried by the vortex beam to the lattice. Results demonstrating a cleartransition from discrete diffraction to the formation of two-dimensional; discrete fundamentaland vortex solitons in a linear lattice are also included.,JOSA B,2005,39
Induced modulation instability of partially spatially incoherent light with varying perturbation periods,Zhigang Chen; Jill Klinger; Demetrios N Christodoulides,Abstract We demonstrate experimentally that a periodic perturbation on a partially spatiallyincoherent optical beam induces modulation instability that depends strongly on theperturbation periods as well as on the strength of the nonlinearity and the degree of spatialcoherence. At a fixed value of the nonlinearity and coherence; the incoherent modulationinstability has a maximum growth at a preferred perturbation period (or spatial frequency);leading to the formation of ordered patterns. While the nonlinearity in our photorefractivesystem is inherently anisotropic; pattern control and pattern switching with anisotropiccoherence is readily realized. Our experimental observations are in good agreement withtheoretical predictions.,Physical Review E,2002,39
Laser-assisted guiding of electric discharges around objects,Matteo Clerici; Yi Hu; Philippe Lassonde; Carles Milián; Arnaud Couairon; Demetrios N Christodoulides; Zhigang Chen; Luca Razzari; François Vidal; François Légaré; Daniele Faccio; Roberto Morandotti,Electric breakdown in air occurs for electric fields exceeding 34 kV/cm and results in a largecurrent surge that propagates along unpredictable trajectories. Guiding such currents acrossspecific paths in a controllable manner could allow protection against lightning strikes andhigh-voltage capacitor discharges. Such capabilities can be used for delivering charge tospecific targets; for electronic jamming; or for applications associated with electric weldingand machining. We show that judiciously shaped laser radiation can be effectively used tomanipulate the discharge along a complex path and to produce electric discharges thatunfold along a predefined trajectory. Remarkably; such laser-induced arcing can evencircumvent an object that completely occludes the line of sight.,Science advances,2015,38

Lossless data hiding scheme based on adjacent pixel difference,Zhuo Li; Xiaoping Chen; Xuezeng Pan; Xianting Zeng,This paper proposes a lossless data hiding scheme with high embedding capacity; whichcan recover the original image without any distortion after the hidden data have beenextracted. In this scheme; difference value of the adjacent pixels is calculated first. Afteradjusting the difference slightly; we can increase (decrease) it by 1 or maintain it intact toembed information into the cover image. Experimental results show that the averageembedding capacity can be up to 0.91 bpp (bit per pixel) while the PSNR stays larger than30dB. Compared with some existing known lossless data hiding schemes; the proposedmethod provides higher embedding capacity and lower image degradation. Moreover; thepresented algorithm is quite simple and the execution time is rather short.,Computer Engineering and Technology; 2009. ICCET'09. International Conference on,2009,38

High-order-mode soliton structures in two-dimensional lattices with defocusing nonlinearity,PG Kevrekidis; H Susanto; Z Chen,Abstract While fundamental-mode discrete solitons have been demonstrated with both self-focusing and defocusing nonlinearity; high-order-mode localized states in waveguidelattices have been studied thus far only for the self-focusing case. In this paper; the existenceand stability regimes of dipole; quadrupole; and vortex soliton structures in two-dimensionallattices induced with a defocusing nonlinearity are examined by the theoretical andnumerical analysis of a generic envelope nonlinear lattice model. In particular; we find thatthe stability of such high-order-mode solitons is quite different from that with self-focusingnonlinearity. As a simple example; a dipole (“twisted”) mode soliton with adjacent excitedsites which may be stable in the focusing case becomes unstable in the defocusing regime.Our results may be relevant to other two-dimensional defocusing periodic nonlinear …,Physical Review E,2006,36
The kinetics and mechanism of an aqueous phase isoprene reaction with hydroxyl radical,D Huang; X Zhang; ZM Chen; Y Zhao; XL Shen,Aqueous phase chemical processes of organic compounds in the atmosphere havereceived increasing attention; partly due to their potential contribution to the formation ofsecondary organic aerosol (SOA). Here; we analyzed the aqueous OH-initiated oxidation ofisoprene and its reaction products including carbonyl compounds and organic acids;regarding the acidity and temperature as in-cloudy conditions. We also performed alaboratory simulation to improve our understanding of the kinetics and mechanisms for theproducts of aqueous isoprene oxidation that are significant precursors of SOA; theseincluded methacrolein (MACR); methyl vinyl ketone (MVK); methyl glyoxal (MG); and glyoxal(GL).

Spectrum to distance mapping via nonlinear Airy pulses,Yi Hu; Ming Li; Domenico Bongiovanni; Matteo Clerici; Jianping Yao; Zhigang Chen; José Azaña; Roberto Morandotti,We theoretically and experimentally study the phenomena related to self-phase modulationof Airy pulses in fibers. During nonlinear evolution; most spectral components of the Airypulses concentrate into one or two peaks for normal and anomalous dispersion;respectively. The resulting peaks self-shift along the propagation; effectively mapping thelongitudinal coordinate into the frequency domain. The frequency shift can be preciselycontrolled by simply acting on the spectral cubic phase structure without the need to alter thefiber length.,Optics letters,2013,33

Symmetry breaking; dynamical pulsations; and turbulence in the transverse intensity patterns of a laser: the role played by defects,EJ D'Angelo; C Green; JR Tredicce; NB Abraham; S Balle; Z Chen; GL Oppo,Abstract Pulsations which spontaneously break the cylindrical symmetry of a laser cavitygeometry and the simultaneous appearance of topological defects in the transverse intensitypatterns lead from periodic and quasiperiodic behavior to chaos and turbulence. We studythese phenomena by numerical integration of the Maxwell-Bloch equations for thetransverse pattern of a single-longitudinal mode laser with spherical mirrors and cylindricallysymmetric boundary conditions. The motion of the defects appears in the form of travellingwaves in the angular direction. This motion reduces the correlation of the intensityfluctuations at spatially separated points. One and two defect patterns are periodic orquasiperiodic; respectively. More complex patterns involving many moving defects displayboth the loss of temporal correlation (chaos) and the loss of spatial correlation (turbulence …,Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,1992,33

Effects of plant polyphenols on ovarian follicular reserve in aging rats,Zhen-Guo Chen; Li-Li Luo; Jin-Jie Xu; Xiao-Lan Zhuang; Xiao-Xia Kong; Yu-Cai Fu,The pool of ovarian primordial follicles is established during embryonic development or atbirth. During the development from primordial to primary; secondary; and antral follicles; onlya small portion of follicles can mature and successfully ovulate; the others are destined todegenerate through apoptotic or atretic loss. As aging advances; females ultimately enterthe cessation phase of the estrous cycle and are no longer capable of fertilization. Thepresumption is that if we can slow down the process of folliculogenesis or decrease follicleloss; females may have a larger ovarian follicular reserve and a longer reproductivelifespan. In our study; rats underwent intragastric administration with tea polyphenols;quercetin (meletin); genistein; or resveratrol; once a day for 4 months (from age 12 to 15months); to test whether they have positive effects on follicular reserve or ovarian …,Biochemistry and Cell Biology,2010,29

Plasmonic resonant solitons in metallic nanosuspensions,Shima Fardad; Alessandro Salandrino; Matthias Heinrich; Peng Zhang; Zhigang Chen; Demetrios N Christodoulides,Robust propagation of self-trapped light over distances exceeding 25 diffraction lengths hasbeen demonstrated for the first time in plasmonic nanosuspensions. This phenomenonresults from the interplay between optical forces and enhanced polarizability that wouldhave been otherwise impossible in conventional dielectric dispersions. Plasmonicnanostructures such as core–shell particles; nanorods; and spheres are shown to displaytunable polarizabilities depending on their size; shape; and composition; as well as thewavelength of illumination. Here we discuss nonlinear light–matter dynamics arising from aneffective positive Kerr effect; which in turn allows for deep penetration of long needles of lightthrough dissipative colloidal media. Our findings may open up new possibilities towardsynthesizing soft-matter systems with customized optical nonlinearities.,Nano letters,2014,26

Linear instability of two-dimensional low-amplitude gap solitons near band edges in periodic media,Zuoqiang Shi; Jiandong Wang; Zhigang Chen; Jianke Yang,Abstract Previous work has shown that in a two-dimensional periodic medium underfocusing or defocusing cubic nonlinearities; gap solitons in the form of low-amplitude andslowly modulated single-Bloch-wave packets can bifurcate out from the edges of Blochbands. In this paper; linear stability properties of these gap solitons near band edges aredetermined both analytically and numerically. Through asymptotic analysis; it is shown thatthese gap solitons are linearly unstable if the slope of their power curve at the band edgehas the opposite sign of nonlinearity (here focusing nonlinearity is said to have a positivesign; and defocusing nonlinearity to have a negative sign). An equivalent condition for linearinstability is that the power of the gap solitons near the band edge is lower than the limitpower value on the band edge.

Improved intrapulse Raman scattering control via asymmetric Airy pulses,Yi Hu; Amirhossein Tehranchi; Stefan Wabnitz; Raman Kashyap; Zhigang Chen; Roberto Morandotti,Abstract We experimentally demonstrate the possibility of tuning the frequency of a laserpulse via the use of an Airy pulse-seeded soliton self-frequency shift. The intrinsicallyasymmetric nature of Airy pulses; typically featured by either leading or trailing oscillatorytails (relatively to the main lobe); is revealed through the nonlinear generation of both aprimary and a secondary Raman soliton self-frequency shift; a phenomenon which is drivenby the soliton fission processes. The resulting frequency shift can be carefully controlled byusing time-reversed Airy pulses or; alternatively; by applying an offset to the cubic phasemodulation used to generate the pulses. When compared with the use of conventionalchirped Gaussian pulses; our technique brings about unique advantages in terms of bothefficient frequency tuning and feasibility; along with the generation and control of …,Physical review letters,2015,23

Incomplete Brillouin-zone spectra and controlled Bragg reflection with ionic-type photonic lattices,Peng Zhang; Sheng Liu; Cibo Lou; Fajun Xiao; Xiaosheng Wang; Jianlin Zhao; Jingjun Xu; Zhigang Chen,Abstract We demonstrate ionic-type photonic lattices consisting of alternating positive andnegative lattice potentials akin to those of ionic crystals in solids. A modified geometricalstructure factor is developed for describing Bragg scattering in these non-Bravais photoniclattices. We show that lattice reconfiguration leads to incomplete Brillouin zone spectra dueto selective band-gap closures. Experimentally; incomplete Brillouin zone spectra andassociated Bragg-reflection suppression are observed in such ionic-type lattices opticallyinduced in a bulk nonlinear crystal. Our experimental results agree well with our theoreticalanalysis.,Physical Review A,2010,21

X-ray diffraction pattern reveals a well-grownepitaxial BFO thin film. Atomic force microscopy study indicates that the BFO film is ratherdense with a smooth surface. The ellipsometric spectra of the STO substrate; the SRO bufferlayer; and the BFO thin film were measured; respectively; in the photon energy range 1.55 to5.40 eV. Following the dielectric functions of STO and SRO; the ones of BFO described bythe Lorentz model are received by fitting the spectra data to a five-medium optical modelconsisting of a semi-infinite STO substrate/SRO layer/BFO film/surface roughness/airambient structure. The thickness and the optical constants of the BFO film are obtained.Then a direct bandgap is calculated at 2.68 eV; which is believed to be influenced by …,Nanoscale research letters,2014,20
Exponential convergence for HRNNs with continuously distributed delays in the leakage terms,Zhibin Chen; Mingquan Yang,Abstract This paper considers exponential convergence for a class of high-order recurrentneural networks (HRNNs) with continuously distributed delays in the leakage terms(ie;“leakage delays”). Without assuming the boundedness on the activation functions; somesufficient conditions are derived to ensure that all solutions of this system convergeexponentially to zero point by using Lyapunov functional method and differential inequalitytechniques; which are new and complement previously known results. In particular; wepropose a new approach to prove the exponential convergence of HRNNs with continuouslydistributed delays in the leakage terms. Moreover; an example is given to show theeffectiveness of the proposed method and results.,Neural Computing and Applications,2013,20

Temperature dependence of polarization switching properties of Bi3. 15Nd0. 85Ti3O12 ferroelectric thin film,Y Zhang; XL Zhong; ZH Chen; JB Wang; YC Zhou,The temperature dependences of the polarization switching properties of Bi3. 15Nd0.85Ti3O12 (BNT) ferroelectric thin film in the range from 25 to 150° C have been investigated.With increasing temperature; the switchable polarization and switching time decrease.Meanwhile; the depolarization field due to the interfacial layer between the electrode andthe BNT film increases with increasing temperature; which induces more domain back-switching. In addition; the local switching properties of BNT film have been studied usingpiezoresponse force microscopy; and it is found that the prepared BNT film has good localswitching behaviors.,Journal of Applied Physics,2011,20

Effect of frequency on electrical tree characteristics in silicone rubber,Qiong Nie; Yuanxiang Zhou; Zhengzheng Chen; Haihang Chen,As an advanced internal insulating material; silicone rubber has been widely used in extrahigh voltage prefabricated cable accessories. However; few studies were focused on theinfluence of frequency on the electrical tree characteristics and the damage mechanism ofsuch insulation is still unknown. In this paper; the characteristics of electrical tree in siliconerubber under AC voltage of different frequency ranging from 50 Hz to 130 kHz were studied.The tree initiation voltage was measured at room-temperature and the processes ofelectrical tree were observed via a digital micro-observing system.

Multipath multicomponent self-accelerating beams through spectrum-engineered position mapping,Yi Hu; Domenico Bongiovanni; Zhigang Chen; Roberto Morandotti,Abstract We introduce the concept of spatial spectral phase gradient; and demonstrate; boththeoretically and experimentally; how this concept could be employed for generating single-and multipath self-accelerating beams. In particular; we show that the trajectories of theaccelerating beams are determined a priori by different key spatial frequencies throughdirect spectrum-to-distance mapping. In the nonparaxial regime; our results clearly illustratethe breakup of Airy beams from a different perspective; and demonstrate how circular;elliptic; or hyperbolic accelerating beams can be created by judiciously engineering thespectral phase. Furthermore; we found that the accelerating beams still follow the predictedtrajectory also for vectorial wave fronts.

Transition between Tamm-like and Shockley-like surface states in optically induced photonic superlattices,Natalia Malkova; Ivan Hromada; Xiaosheng Wang; Garnett Bryant; Zhigang Chen,Abstract We study the formation of Shockley-like surface states and their transition intoTamm-like surface states in an optically induced semi-infinite photonic superlattice. Whileperfect Shockley-like states appear only when the induced superlattice with alternatingstrong and weak bonds is terminated properly with an unperturbed surface; deformedShockley-like surface states often appear in the so-called inverted band gap when thesurface perturbation is nonzero. Furthermore; transitions between linear Tamm-like;Shockley-like; and nonlinear Tamm-like surface states are also observed by fine tuning thesurface perturbation. Using coupled-mode theory; we confirm the existence of these linearand nonlinear surface states in a finite array of N identical single-mode waveguides coupledwith alternating strong and weak bonds.,Physical Review A,2009,18
Photoinduced magnetic softening of perpendicularly magnetized L 1 0-FePt granular films,Z Xu; XD Liu; RX Gao; ZF Chen; TS Lai; HN Hu; SM Zhou; XJ Bai; J Du,Ultrafast spin dynamics has for the first time been studied in perpendicular magnetizedgranular films. For FePt continuous films and FePt–MgO and FePt–Ag granular films withfemtosecond laser excitations; the coercivity HC and the saturation Kerr rotation θ KS aredramatically reduced; accompanied by a sharp increase in the reflectivity R. Afterward; thesephysical quantities are slowly recovered. The changes in HC; θ KS; and R are all differentamong FePt; FePt–MgO; and FePt–Ag films. The difference is caused by different filmthicknesses and in particular by the surface plasmon resonance of metallic nanoparticles.,Applied Physics Letters,2008,18
Waveguides and waveguide arrays formed by incoherent light in photorefractive materials,Zhigang Chen; Hector Martin,Abstract We report on experimental observations of nonlinear optical waveguides andwaveguide arrays formed by incoherent light in photorefractive materials. Such waveguidesare made possible by creating partially spatially incoherent solitons in a noninstantaneousself-focusing photorefractive medium. In addition to planar; Y-junction; and circularwaveguides; we report the first demonstration of pixel-like spatial solitons from partiallyincoherent light. An array of as many as 56× 56 soliton pixels is readily realized bylaunching a spatially modulated incoherent beam into the self-focusing photorefractivemedium. These solitons are stable and robust; forming a steady-state two-dimensionalwaveguide array in which optical coupling and control of local waveguide channels can beachieved. These experiments bring about the possibility of controlling high-power laser …,Optical Materials,2003,18

Activation of MAP kinases by 5-fluorouracil in a 5-fluorouracil-resistant variant human cell line derived from a KT breast cancer cell line.,Y Wu; T Hiwasa; E Isogai; T Sonoda; K Kita; Z Chen; S Sugaya; H Yamamori; H Tanzawa; N Suzuki,Abstract To investigate the mechanism of the acquired resistance of human cells to ananticancer drug; 5-fluorouracil (5-FU); a drug-resistant clone; KTFU-4; was isolated from ahuman KT breast carcinoma cell line; treated with ethylmethanesulfonate and then with 5-FU. The viability of the KT cells; analyzed using an MTT assay; was suppressed by 5-FU in adose-dependent manner; while that of the KTFU-4 cells was enhanced by it atconcentrations between 0.1 and 1.0 microgram/ml. Treatment of KTFU-4 cells with 5-FUresulted in increased amounts of activated phosphorylated ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinases;but not in the parent KT cells. It is thus possible that 5-FU stimulated the proliferation of KTFU-4 cells by activating a signal transduction pathway leading to cell growth.,International journal of oncology,1998,17

Then; we combinefuzzy set theory and educational hypotheses to model the examinees' mastery on the …,IJCAI,2015,15
Periodic self-accelerating beams by combined phase and amplitude modulation in the Fourier space,Yi Hu; Domenico Bongiovanni; Zhigang Chen; Roberto Morandotti,We propose and demonstrate the generation of periodic self-accelerating beams throughboth phase and amplitude modulation in the Fourier space. For small amplitude variations;an accelerating beam still follows a smooth convex trajectory; which can be traced by actingon the spectral phase only. However; large modulations such as those generated from theHeaviside function with a zero amplitude distribution partially modify the convex trajectorydue to the appearance of straight-line paths. Furthermore; periodic self-accelerating beamsalong convex trajectories are realized by employing an array of “spectral wells” in both theparaxial and nonparaxial regimes.,Optics letters,2013,15

Subpicosecond domain switching in discrete regions of Pb (Zr0. 35Ti0. 65) O3 thick films,An Quan Jiang; Zhi Hui Chen; Wen Yuan Hui; Dongping Wu; James F Scott,Abstract The time dependence of the domain switching current density; J sw (t); underpulsed voltages on a ferroelectric parallel-plate capacitor is the consequence of region-by-region polarization reversals across the film. As the distributive coercive voltage of domainnucleation increases from zero to the maximum applied voltage during the capacitorcharging time; J sw (t) is proportional to the domain switching speed at each time. Bytransforming the spatially inhomogeneous domain nucleation distribution into a temporaldistribution of coercive fields (E c); a local lnJ sw versus E c− 1 plot is derived for eachdomain; following the Merz equation. This provides insight into the independent domainswitching dynamics at different nucleation sites in Pb (Zr 0.35 Ti 0.65) O 3 thick films over alarge current range. Although the activation field of the slope of the lnJ sw (t) versus E c …,Advanced Functional Materials,2012,15
Changes in left ventricular ejection fraction and coronary flow reserve after coronary microembolization,Jianying Ma; Juying Qian; Junbo Ge; Xin Zeng; Aijun Sun; Shufu Chang; Zhangwei Chen; Yunzeng Zou,Results Left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.77±0.08 at baseline; 0.69±0.08 at 2 h;0.68±0.08 at 6 h; and 0.76±0.06 at 1 week (2 h vs. baseline p< 0.05; 6 h vs. baseline p<0.01). After CME; left ventricular end systolic volume (LVESV) and end diastolic volume(LVEDV) were significant larger 1 week later (p< 0.01 for both); while CFR was significantlyreduced at 6 h (1.24±0.10 at 6 h vs. 1.77±0.30 at baseline; p< 0.01) and myocardial bloodflow remained unchanged. Serum ET-1 level was significantly higher only at 6 h after CME(6 h vs. baseline p< 0.05). Conclusions Reduction of CFR and LVEF is significant at 6 h afterCME and recovers 1 week later with left ventricular dilation.,Archives of medical science: AMS,2012,15

However; the applicabilityin Chinese patients of these subgroups was unclear. We collected 116 specimens andperformed immunohistochemical staining for CD10; BCL-6; MUM1; CD138; and CD5; andthe results were classified into subgroups according to 3 different algorithms. We thenanalyzed the subgroups' correlation to patient survival. Expression of CD10 and BCL-6predicted favorable 5-year OS (70 and 62.5%; respectively) and PFS (64.3 and 61.5%;respectively) rates. In contrast; the expression of MUM1 predicted unfavorable 5-year OS(23.1%) and PFS (17.9%) rates and was also independent of other markers. All algorithmsled to useful subclassifications.

Geometric stabilization of extended S= 2 vortices in two-dimensional photonic lattices: Theoretical analysis; numerical computation; and experimental results,KJH Law; D Song; PG Kevrekidis; J Xu; Zhigang Chen,Abstract In this work; we focus on the subject of nonlinear discrete self-trapping of S= 2(doubly-charged) vortices in two-dimensional photonic lattices; including theoreticalanalysis; numerical computation; and experimental demonstration. We revisit earlier findingsabout S= 2 vortices with a discrete model and find that S= 2 vortices extended over eightlattice sites can indeed be stable (or only weakly unstable) under certain conditions; not onlyfor the cubic nonlinearity previously used; but also for a saturable nonlinearity more relevantto our experiment with a biased photorefractive nonlinear crystal. We then use the discreteanalysis as a guide toward numerically identifying stable (and unstable) vortex solutions in amore realistic continuum model with a periodic potential. Finally; we present ourexperimental observation of such geometrically extended S= 2 vortex solitons in optically …,Physical Review A,2009,15

Pattern dynamics in photorefractive bidirectional ring-resonator experiments,Z Chen; D McGee; NB Abraham,The complexity of the dynamics and the correlation between patterns in counterpropagatingbeams in a confocal bidirectional photorefractive ring oscillator (BaTiO_3 pumped by a He–Ne 632.8-nm laser) depend significantly on the Fresnel number of the resonator. When theFresnel number is increased to more than∼ 5; the patterns lose their correlation through firstinterleaving their bright and dark regions and then losing correlation altogether. Thealternation of modal patterns for low Fresnel numbers of a well-aligned cavity is caused bychanges in the cavity length and results from room-temperature changes or slow movementof a mirror; and it is consistent with predictions from numerical simulations. When it appearsthat a few transverse modal patterns are superposed to form an evolving pattern; there istypically an intermode beat frequency of tens of millihertz; regardless of whether the …,JOSA B,1996,15

Self-trapping of optical vortices at the surface of an induced semi-infinite photonic lattice,Daohong Song; Cibo Lou; Kody JH Law; Liqin Tang; Zhuoyi Ye; PG Kevrekidis; Jingjun Xu; Zhigang Chen,We demonstrate self-trapping of singly-charged vortices at the surface of an opticallyinduced two-dimensional photonic lattice. Under appropriate conditions of self-focusingnonlinearity; a singly-charged vortex beam can self-trap into a stable semi-infinite gapsurface vortex soliton through a four-site excitation. However; a single-site excitation leads toa quasi-localized state in the first photonic gap; and our theoretical analysis illustrates thatsuch a bandgap surface vortex soliton is always unstable. Our experimental results of stableand unstable topological surface solitons are corroborated by direct numerical simulationsand linear stability analysis.,Optics Express,2010,14

The polymer could form homogeneous micelles with an averagediameter of around 80 nm through self-assembly; which would then be loaded with thesinglet oxygen-generating photosensitizer of zinc phthalocyanine (ZNPC) and anti-cancerdrug of DOX. The disassembly of micelles could be triggered by the hydrophobic tohydrophilic transition of the PPS core in response to ROS-induced oxidation in vitro. ZNPCmolecules are capable of producing ROS under laser irradiation; which results in the rapiddisassembly of micelles and releasing of the anti-tumor drug for tumor therapy underphysiological condition otherwise. Moreover; the excessive ROS production deriving from …,Biomaterials,2016,13

Generation of linear and nonlinear propagation of three-Airy beams,Yi Liang; Zhuoyi Ye; Daohong Song; Cibo Lou; Xinzheng Zhang; Jingjun Xu; Zhigang Chen,We report the first experimental demonstration of the so-called three-Airy beams. Suchbeams represent a two-dimensional field that is a product (rather than simple superposition)of three Airy beams. Our experiments show that; in contrast to conventional Airy beams; thisnew family of Airy beams can be realized even without the use of truncation by finiteapertures. Furthermore; we study linear and nonlinear propagation of the three-Airy beamsin a photorefractive medium. It is found that a three-Airy beam tends to linearly diffract into asuper-Gaussian-like beam; while under nonlinear propagation it either turns into threeintensity spots with a self-defocusing nonlinearity or evolves into a self-trapped channel witha self-focusing nonlinearity.,Optics Express,2013,12

It is shown that in-phase nearest-neighbor and out-of-phase next-nearest-neighbor dipoles exist and can bestable in the intermediate intensity regime. There are also different types of dipoles that arealways unstable. In-phase nearest-neighbor quadrupoles are also numerically obtained;and may also be linearly stable.

Experimental generation of Riemann waves in optics: a route to shock wave control,Benjamin Wetzel; Domenico Bongiovanni; Michael Kues; Yi Hu; Zhigang Chen; Stefano Trillo; John M Dudley; Stefano Wabnitz; Roberto Morandotti,Abstract We report the first observation of Riemann (simple) waves; which play a crucial rolefor understanding the dynamics of any shock-bearing system. This was achieved by properlytailoring the phase of an ultrashort light pulse injected into a highly nonlinear fiber. OpticalRiemann waves are found to evolve in excellent quantitative agreement with the remarkablysimple inviscid Burgers equation; whose applicability in physical systems is oftenchallenged by viscous or dissipative effects. Our method allows us to further demonstrate aviable novel route to efficiently control the shock formation by the proper shaping of a laserpulse phase. Our results pave the way towards the experimental study; in a convenientbenchtop setup; of complex physical phenomena otherwise difficult to access.,Physical review letters,2016,11

Under non-isothermal condition; theactivation energies for the glass transition and crystallization at the onset and the peakcrystallization temperatures are determined by means of Kissinger plots to be 383±11;290±7 and 325±13 kJ/mol; respectively. During the isothermal crystallization process; theaverage activation energy for crystallization deduced by using the Arrhenius equation isabout 385±7 kJ/mol; which is larger than that obtained by Kissinger equation. Thecrystallization mechanism under isothermal condition was investigated by using Johnson–Mehl–Avrami (JMA) equation. The Avrami exponent is mainly in the range of 2.64 to 3.07 …,Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,2014,11

Interactions between self-channeled optical beams in soft-matter systems with artificial nonlinearities,Shima Fardad; Matthew S Mills; Peng Zhang; Weining Man; Zhigang Chen; DN Christodoulides,We demonstrate optical interactions between stable self-trapped optical beams in soft-mattersystems with pre-engineered saturable self-focusing optical nonlinearities. Our experiments;carried out in dilute suspensions of particles with negative polarizabilities; show that opticalbeam interactions can vary from attractive to repulsive; or can display an energy exchangedepending on the initial relative phases. The corresponding observations are in goodagreement with theoretical predictions.,Optics letters,2013,11
Simulation and experimental investigation of jetting penetrator charge at large stand-off distance,Jian-ping Fu; Zhi-gang Chen; Xiu-cheng Hou; Shu-qiang Li; Shou-cang Li; Jing-wen Wang,Abstract In order to study and apply the penetration performance of jetting penetrator chargeat long stand-off distance; three jetting penetrator charges (JPC); including spherical coneliner; truncated wide-angle liner and spherical segment liner; are designed. The numericalsimulation analysis of the formation; elongation and penetration processes of rod-like jet isconducted by using LS-DYNA software. And the penetrating test is carried out at long stand-off distance. The test results show that the rod-like jet formed by the optimized sphericalsegment liner can pierce through a 90 mm thick 45# steel target at 20 charge diameters(CD) Stand-off distance when the charge detonation mode is a central point initiation; andthe penetration depth can be up to 1.6 CD.

Nonlinear beam deflection in photonic lattices with negative defects,Jiandong Wang; Zhuoyi Ye; Alexandra Miller; Yi Hu; Cibo Lou; Peng Zhang; Zhigang Chen; Jianke Yang,Abstract We demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that a nonlinear beam canbe reflected by a negative defect in a photonic lattice if the incident angle is below athreshold value. Above this threshold angle; the beam simply passes through the defect.This phenomenon occurs in both one-and two-dimensional photonic lattices; and it providesa way to use the incident angle to control beam propagation in a lattice network. If the defectis absent or positive; no evident transition from reflection to transmission occurs. Thesenonlinear phenomena are also compared with linear nondiffracting-beam propagation in aphotonic lattice with a defect; and both similarities and differences are observed. In addition;some important features in linear and nonlinear beam propagations are explainedanalytically by using a linear model with a delta-function defect.,Physical Review A,2011,11

Scalable pseudo random RFID private mutual authentication,Jianqing Fu; Chunming Wu; Xiaoping Chen; Rong Fan; Lingdi Ping,Nowadays; the use of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems in industry and storeshas increased. Nevertheless; some of these systems present problems that may discouragepotential users. Hence; high confidence and efficient privacy protocols are urgently needed.Previous studies to achieve privacy authentication can be grouped into tree-based andsynchronization approaches. But all of the tree-based designs are not suitable to large scaleRFID systems; and most of the synchronization designs have security flaws. So in this paper;we propose a scalable pseudo random RFID private mutual authentication protocol (SPRA)to archive both scalable and security. The analysis results show that SPRA effectivelyenhances the security protection for RFID private authentication; and has the authenticationefficiency of O (1).,Computer Engineering and Technology (ICCET); 2010 2nd International Conference on,2010,11

Water Modeling of Swirling Flow Tundish for Steel Continuous Casting,YUE Qiang; Zong-Shu Zou; Qin-Fu Hou; CHEN Zhou,Abstract A conventional turbulence inhibitor is compared with a swirling chamber from thepoints of view of fluid flow and removal rate of inclusion in the tundish. Comparing the RTDcurves; inclusion removals; and the streamlines in water model experiments; it can be foundthat the tundish equipped with a swirling chamber has a great effect on improving the flowfield; and the floatation rate of inclusion is higher than the tundish with a turbulence inhibitor.Because of the introduction of the swirling chamber; the flow field and inclusion removal in atwo-strand swirling flow tundish are asymmetrical. Rotating the inlet direction of swirlingchamber 60 degree is a good strategy to improve the asymmetrical flow field.,Journal of Iron and Steel Research; International,2009,11
Postingrank: Bringing order to web forum postings,Zhi Chen; Li Zhang; Weihua Wang,Abstract Web forum is an important information resource. Each day innumerable postings onvarious topics are created in thousands of web forums in internet. However; only a small partof them are utilized for the reason that it is difficult to rank the postings importance. Unlikegeneral web sites with hyperlinks in web pages created by editors; links in web forums areautomatically generated; therefore; traditional link-based methods; such as famousPageRank are useless to rank postings. In this paper; we propose a novel algorithm namedPostingRank to rank postings. The main idea of our method is to exploit the common repliersbetween postings and leverage the relationship between these common repliers. We buildimplicit links based on that co-repliers relation and construct a link graph. In the way ofiterative calculation; each posting's importance score can be obtained.

Here we design and demonstrate 'tug-of-war'optical tweezers that canfacilitate the assessment of cell–cell adhesion—a key contributing factor to biofilmdevelopment; thanks to the combined actions of optical scattering and gradient forces. Witha customized optical landscape distinct from that of conventional tweezers; not only cansuch 'tug-of-war'tweezers stably trap and stretch a rod-shaped bacterium in the observingplane; but; more importantly; they can also impose a tunable lateral force that pulls apartcellular clusters without any tethering or mechanical movement. As a proof of principle; weexamined a Sinorhizobium meliloti strain that forms robust biofilms and found that thestrength of intercellular adhesion depends on the growth medium.

Dynamics of vocalization-induced modulation of auditory cortical activity at mid-utterance,Zhaocong Chen; Jeffery A Jones; Peng Liu; Weifeng Li; Dongfeng Huang; Hanjun Liu,Background Recent research has addressed the suppression of cortical sensory responsesto altered auditory feedback that occurs at utterance onset regarding speech. However;there is reason to assume that the mechanisms underlying sensorimotor processing at mid-utterance are different than those involved in sensorimotor control at utterance onset. Thepresent study attempted to examine the dynamics of event-related potentials (ERPs) todifferent acoustic versions of auditory feedback at mid-utterance. Methodology/Principalfindings Subjects produced a vowel sound while hearing their pitch-shifted voice (100cents); a sum of their vocalization and pure tones; or a sum of their vocalization and whitenoise at mid-utterance via headphones. Subjects also passively listened to playback of whatthey heard during active vocalization. Cortical ERPs were recorded in response to …,PLoS One,2013,10
Anomalous interactions of spatial gap solitons in optically induced photonic lattices,Sheng Liu; Yi Hu; Peng Zhang; Xuetao Gan; Fajun Xiao; Cibo Lou; Daohong Song; Jianlin Zhao; Jingjun Xu; Zhigang Chen,We demonstrate coherent interactions between spatial gap solitons in optically inducedphotonic lattices. Because of the “staggered” phase structures; two in-phase (out-of-phase)bright gap solitons can repel (attract) each other at close proximity; in contrast to solitoninteraction in homogeneous media. A reversal of energy transfer direction and a transitionbetween attractive and repulsive interaction forces can be obtained solely by changing theinitial soliton separation relative to the lattice spacing.,Optics letters,2011,10

An analysis of antigen-antibody binding kinetics for biosensor applications utilized as a model system: influence of non-specific binding,Zhanchi Chen; Ajit Sadana,Abstract The influence of non-specific binding on the specific binding of antigen in solutionto antibody immobilized on a biosensor surface is presented for first-; one and a half-;second-; and other order reactions occurring under external diffusion-limited conditions.Both single-step and dual-step binding of antigen to antibody is considered. For a half-orderreaction the value of the ratio of non-specific binding to specific binding (α) does not affectthe rate of specific binding since a single curve represents the binding curve for α= 0 to 0.5.An increase in the α value leads to a decrease in the rate of binding and in the amount ofantigen bound specifically to the antibody on the surface for first-; one and a half-; andsecond-order reactions. Also; an increase in the reaction order increases the sensitivity ofthe specific binding to the α value. An increase in the antigen concentration in solution …,Biophysical chemistry,1996,10

Specially shaped Bessel-like self-accelerating beams along predesigned trajectories,Juanying Zhao; ID Chremmos; Ze Zhang; Yi Hu; Daohong Song; Peng Zhang; NK Efremidis; Zhigang Chen,Abstract Over the past several years; spatially shaped self-accelerating beams alongdifferent trajectories have been studied extensively. Due to their useful properties such asresistance to diffraction; self-healing; and self-bending even in free space; these beamshave attracted great attention with many proposed applications. Interestingly; some of thesebeams could be designed with controllable spatial profiles and thus propagate alongvarious desired trajectories such as parabolic; snake-like; hyperbolic; hyperbolic secant;three-dimensional spiraling; and even self-propelling trajectories. Experimentally; suchbeams are realized typically by using a spatial light modulator so as to imprint a desiredphase distribution on a Gaussian-like input wave front propagating under paraxial ornonparaxial conditions.

Such self-accelerating features exist only in the presence of the lattice and are not observed in ahomogenous medium. Under the action of nonlinearity; however; the beam structure andacceleration cannot be preserved.

Human RSa cells have unusual sensitivity to UV-induced cell-killing. We searched for molecules on the cell-surface of RSa cells that werepresent in different amounts as compared to a variant of these cells; UVr-1 cells; which haveincreased resistance to UV cell-killing. Among the 21 molecules examined; the amount oftransferrin receptor (TfR) protein was found to be 2-fold higher in UVr-1 cells compared within RSa cells. The amounts of this protein were also higher in the UV-resistant hematopoieticcell lines; CEM6 and Daudi; as compared to the UV-sensitive cell lines; Molt4 and 697.Culturing of UVr-1 cells in a medium containing anti-transferrin antibodies resulted in …,Journal of radiation research,2005,9

Influence of non-specific binding on antigen-antibody binding kinetics for biosensor applications,Ajit Sadana; Zhanchi Chen,Abstract A theoretical analysis is presented for the influence of non-specific binding on thespecific binding of antigen in solution to antibody immobilized on a biosensor surface for first-; one and a half-; second-; and other-order reactions occurring under external diffusion-limited conditions. Both single-step and dual-step binding of antigen to antibody areconsidered. An increase in α (the ratio of non-specific binding to specific binding) and anincrease in the forward binding rate coefficient leads to a decrease in the normalizedantigen concentration near the surface; cs/c 0 and in the amount of antigen boundspecifically to the antibody immobilized on the surface; Γ Ag s/c 0 for a first-order reaction.The presence of non-specific binding complicates the influence of the forward binding ratecoefficient; kfs on the Γ Ag s/c 0 amount for the one and a half-and second-order reactions …,Biosensors and Bioelectronics,1996,9
Induction; modification; and perception of the salicylic acid signal in plant defence.,DF Klessig; J Malamy; J Hennig; P Sanchez-Casas; J Indulski; G Grynkiewicz; Z Chen,Abstract Endogenous salicylic acid (SA) levels increase and several families ofpathogenesis-related genes (including PR-1 and PR-2) are induced during the resistanceresponse of tobacco to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) infection. We have found that at atemperature (32 degrees C) that prevents the induction of PR genes and resistance; theincreases in SA levels were eliminated. However; when the resistance response wasrestored by shifting inoculated plants to lower temperatures; SA levels increaseddramatically and preceded PR-1 gene expression and necrotic lesion formation associatedwith resistance. SA was also found in a conjugated form whose levels increased in parallelwith the free SA levels. This SA beta-glucoside (SAG) was as active as SA in inducing PR-1gene expression. PR-1 gene induction by SAG was preceded by a transient release of SA …,Biochemical Society symposium,1994,9
Two transitions in single crystal GdBa2Cu3O7− y near Tc,Wang Ke-qin; Chen Zhao-Jia; Xia Jian-Sheng; Chen Zuyao; Zhang Qirui,Abstract The specific heat near Tc for superconducting single crystal GdBa 2 Cu 3 O 7− yhas been measured with an instrument of differential calorimeter at low temperature. Twotransitions were observed between 80.7 K and 87.5 K. They are separated from each other;and the temperature interval φ T between the two specific heat peaks is 3.5 K. It is supposedthat the specific heat jump at higher temperature is due to structural transition and the one atlower temperature is superconducting transition.,Solid state communications,1989,9

Efficient optical energy harvesting in self-accelerating beams,Domenico Bongiovanni; Yi Hu; Benjamin Wetzel; Raul A Robles; Gregorio Mendoza González; Erwin A Marti-Panameño; Zhigang Chen; Roberto Morandotti,Abstract We report the experimental observation of energetically confined self-acceleratingoptical beams propagating along various convex trajectories. We show that; under anappropriate transverse compression of their spatial spectra; these self-accelerating beamscan exhibit a dramatic enhancement of their peak intensity and a significant decrease oftheir transverse expansion; yet retaining both the expected acceleration profile and theintrinsic self-healing properties. We found our experimental results to be in excellentagreement with the numerical simulations. We expect further applications in such contextswhere power budget and optimal spatial confinement can be important limiting factors.,Scientific reports,2015,8

Observation of novel edge states in photonic graphene,Mikael C Rechtsman; Yonatan Plotnik; Daohong Song; Matthias Heinrich; Julia M Zeuner; Stefan Nolte; Natalia Malkova; Jingjun Xu; Alexander Szameit; Zhigang Chen; Mordechai Segev,Abstract: The intriguing properties of graphene; a two-dimensional material composed of ahoneycomb lattice of carbon atoms; have attracted a great deal of interest in recent years.Specifically; the fact that electrons in graphene behave as massless relativistic particlesgives rise to unconventional phenomena such as Klein tunneling; the anomalous quantumHall effect; and strain-induced pseudo-magnetic fields. Graphene edge states play a crucialrole in the understanding and use of these electronic properties. However; the coarse orimpure nature of the edges hampers the ability to directly probe the edge states and theirband structure. Perhaps the best example is the edge states on the bearded edge (alsocalled the Klein edge) that have thus far never been observed-because such an edge isunstable in graphene. Here; we use the optical equivalent of graphene-a photonic …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1210.5361,2012,8

Hybrid nonlinearity supported by nonconventionally biased photorefractive crystals,Peng Zhang; Sheng Liu; Cibo Lou; Yuhan Gao; Jianlin Zhao; Jingjun Xu; Zhigang Chen,Abstract We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that a nonconventionally biasedphotorefractive crystal can support hybrid nonlinearity; ie; coexistence of self-focusing andself-defocusing nonlinearities under an identical bias condition. It is revealed that thenonlinearity experienced by a one-dimensional (stripe) beam can be switched between self-focusing and self-defocusing solely by changing the beam orientation. For a two-dimensional beam; the hybrid nonlinearity leads to unusual nonlinear beam dynamics withenhanced anisotropy and nonlocality.,Applied Physics B,2009,8
Influence of frequency on tree initiation voltage and electrical tree shape in silicone rubber,Qiong Nie; YX Zhou; ZZ Chen; Hai-hang CHEN,To investigate the influence of frequency on the electrical tree characteristics and thedamage mechanism of such insulation; the characteristics of electrical tree in silicone rubberunder AC voltage of different frequency ranging from 50 Hz to 130 kHz were studied. Thetree initiation voltage was measured at room-temperature and the processes of electricaltree were observed via a digital micro-observing system. From the experiments; it is foundthat the electrical tree in silicone rubber is greatly affected by the frequency of appliedvoltage. With the increase of frequency; tree initiation voltage of silicone rubber decreases.And the frequency can be separated into four stages; while tree initiation voltage appearsdifferent magnitude of decrease.

Guiding and nonlinear coupling of light in plasmonic nanosuspensions,Trevor S Kelly; Yu-Xuan Ren; Akbar Samadi; Anna Bezryadina; Demetrios Christodoulides; Zhigang Chen,We demonstrate two different types of coupled beam propagation dynamics in colloidal goldnanosuspensions. In the first case; an infrared (IR) probe beam (1064 nm) is guided by alow-power visible beam (532 nm) in a gold nanosphere or in nanorod suspensions due tothe formation of a plasmonic resonant soliton. Although the IR beam does not experiencenonlinear self-action effects; even at high power levels; needle-like deep penetration of bothbeams through otherwise highly dissipative suspensions is realized. In the second case; amaster/slave-type nonlinear coupling is observed in gold nanoshell suspensions; in whichthe nanoparticles have opposite polarizabilities at the visible and IR wavelengths. In thislatter regime; both beams experience a self-focusing nonlinearity that can be fine-tuned.,Optics letters,2016,7

Incoherent self-accelerating beams,Yaakov Lumer; Yi Liang; Ran Schley; Ido Kaminer; Elad Greenfield; Daohong Song; Xinzheng Zhang; Jingjun Xu; Zhigang Chen; Mordechai Segev,Self-accelerating optical beams form as a direct outcome of interference; initiated by apredesigned initial condition. In a similar fashion; quantum mechanical particles exhibit force-free acceleration as a result of interference effects following proper preparation of the initialSchrödinger wave function. Indeed; interference is at the heart of such wave packets; andhence it is implied that self-accelerating wave packets must be coherent entities. Counter tothat; we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally spatially incoherent self-acceleratingbeams; in both the paraxial and the nonparaxial domains. We show that in principle; thetransverse correlation distance can be as short as a single wavelength; while a properlydesigned initial beam will give rise to shape-preserving acceleration for the same distanceas a coherent accelerating beam propagating on the same trajectory.

Dynamical deformed Airy beams with arbitrary angles between two wings,Yi Liang; Yi Hu; Zhuoyi Ye; Daohong Song; Cibo Lou; Xinzheng Zhang; Jingjun Xu; Roberto Morandotti; Zhigang Chen,We study both numerically and experimentally the acceleration and propagation dynamicsof 2D Airy beams with arbitrary initial angles between their “two wings.” Our results show thatthe acceleration of these generalized 2D Airy beams strongly depends on the initial anglesand cannot be simply described by the vector superposition principle (except for the normalcase of a 90° angle). However; as a result of the “Hyperbolic umbilic” catastrophe (a two-layer caustic); the main lobes of these 2D Airy beams still propagate along parabolictrajectories even though they become highly deformed. Under such conditions; the peakintensity (leading energy flow) of the 2D Airy beams cannot be confined along the main lobe;in contrast to the normal 90° case. Instead; it is found that there are two parabolic trajectoriesdescribing the beam propagation: one for the main lobe; and the other for the peak …,JOSA A,2014,7

SIIPU* S: A semantic pattern learning algorithm,Dawei Hu Dawei Hu; Liu Wenyin Liu Wenyin; Enhong Chen Enhong Chen; Xiaoping Chen Xiaoping Chen; Xin Li Xin Li,The efficacy of pattern-based question answering system is mostly determined by the size ofthe semantic pattern base and the expression capability of the semantic patterns. We findthat the expression capabilities of semantic patterns are determined by their instantiationdegrees. Hence; we propose an evaluation strategy named Semantic Identifiability InversePattern Universality (SIIPU); using which we can estimate the instantiation degree of apattern for a certain semantic requirement. Moreover; on the basis of SIIPU; we propose asemantic pattern learning algorithm named SIIPU* S. Using SIIPU* S we can extract thesemantic patterns at the most appropriate instantiation level for a given semanticrequirement from a training corpus. Preliminary results show the proposed method's efficacyto extract patterns at different instantiation levels and their effects in analyzing questions.,Semantics; Knowledge and Grid; 2006. SKG'06.

Light localization and nonlinear beam transmission in specular amorphous photonic lattices,Peigen Ni; Peng Zhang; Xinyuan Qi; Jianke Yang; Zhigang Chen; Weining Man,We demonstrate specular photonic “lattices” with random index variations at disorderedpositions of lattice sites. These amorphous lattice structures; optically induced in a bulknonlinear crystal; remain invariant during propagation since they are constructed fromrandom components residing on a fixed ring in momentum space. We observe linear spatiallocalization of a light beam when probing through different “defect” points in such specularlattices; as well as the nonlinear destruction of localized modes. In addition; we illustrate thepossibility of image transmission through the disordered lattices; when a self-defocusingnonlinearity is employed.,Optics express,2016,6

76% efficient cryogenically-cooled eyesafe diode laser for resonant pumping of Er-doped gain media,Zhigang Chen; Weimin Dong; Xingguo Guan; Sandrio Elim; Shiguo Zhang; Mike Grimshaw; Mark Devito; Paul Leisher; Manoj Kanskar,There is great interest in the development of high-power; high-efficiency InP-based broadarea pump diode lasers operating in the 14xx-15xx nm band to be used for resonant-pumping of Er-doped solid state lasers. Cryogenic cooling of diode lasers can provide greatbenefit to performance; arising from the dramatic reduction in the threshold current and theincrease in the diode's slope efficiency. These improvements are attributed to reduction inthe non-radiative losses and leakage current associated with thermionic emission of carriersfrom the quantum well. This is; however; at the expense of a large increase in the diodevoltage; limiting the power conversion efficiency at cryogenic temperatures.

Optimal compression and energy confinement of optical Airy bullets,Domenico Bongiovanni; Benjamin Wetzel; Yi Hu; Zhigang Chen; Roberto Morandotti,We report on an approach to generate non-diffractive and non-dispersive Airy^ 3 bullets withenhanced spatio-temporal energy confinement. By appropriately reshaping the initialspectral components in the Fourier domain; the resulting optical bullets show a significantenhancement of their central lobe intensity while exhibiting a reduced spatio-temporaloutspread of the surrounding sub-lobes-typical of Airy^ 3 bullets. Numerically; wedemonstrate that when propagating in dispersive media within a linear regime; suchoptimized Airy^ 3 bullets maintain the peculiar properties of their “standard” counterparts;including curved trajectories; non-spreading features and self-healing. We foresee directapplications in novel and non-disruptive optical techniques for imaging; tomography andspatio-temporally resolved spectroscopy.,Optics express,2016,5

Dirac Hamiltonian with Imaginary Mass and Induced Helicity-Dependence by Indefinite Metric,Ulrich D Jentschura,Abstract: It is of general theoretical interest to investigate the properties of superluminalmatter wave equations for spin one-half particles. One can either enforce superluminalpropagation by an explicit substitution of the real mass term for an imaginary mass; or onecan use a matrix representation of the imaginary unit that multiplies the mass term. The latterleads to the tachyonic Dirac equation; while the equation obtained by the substitution m-> i*m in the Dirac equation is naturally referred to as the imaginary-mass Dirac equation. Boththe tachyonic as well as the imaginary-mass Dirac Hamiltonians commute with the helicityoperator. Both Hamiltonians are pseudo-Hermitian and also possess additional modifiedpseudo-Hermitian properties; leading to constraints on the resonance eigenvalues. Here; byan explicit calculation; we show that specific sum rules over the spectrum hold for the …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1201.6300,2012,5

Modeling and parameter identification of amplitude-and frequency-dependent rubber isolator,De-wei Sun; Zhi-gang Chen; Guang-yu Zhang; P Eberhard,Abstract A model to describe the hysteresis damping characteristic of rubber material waspresented. It consists of a parallel spring and damper; whose coefficients change with thevibration amplitude and frequency. In order to acquire these relations; force decompositionwas carried out according to some sine vibration measurement data of nonlinear forceschanging with the deformation of the rubber material. The nonlinear force is decomposedinto a spring force and a damper force; which are represented by the amplitude-andfrequency-dependent spring and damper coefficients; respectively. Repeating this step fordifferent measurements gives different coefficients corresponding to different amplitudes andfrequencies. Then; the application of a parameter identification method provides therequested approximation functions over amplitude and frequency.

Analysis of production decline and influence factors in the carbonate reservoirs of Tahe oilfield [J],Chang-hong LIU; Zhi-hai CHEN,The Ordovician fracture-cavern carbonate reservoirs in the Tahe oilfield are characterized bysevere heterogeneity; complicated reservoir bodies and types and oil-water relationships;and sophisticated oil well production performances. For the three types of oil wells classifiedby drilling encountered types of fracture-cavern reservoirs; an analysis method of productiondecline has been established by using production-normalized approach. The characteristicsof production decline in different types of oil wells and their influence factors are analyzed. Itis thought that the main reasons for production decline are water breakthrough andinsufficient nature energy. In addition; formation pressure decline can result in lowproductivity index; and the change of flow regime can also be an important influence factor.,Special Oil & Gas Reservoirs,2010,5

Video coding with coding of the locations of significant coefficients in a block of coefficients,*,In known image compression; following quantisation; a very sparse distribution of significant(ie non-zero) amplitude coefficients of the transformed image signal may be obtained whilemost quantised coefficients are zeros. A costly task for a transform-based imagecompression in terms of resulting overall data rate is to record the locations of suchsignificant coefficients within the coding blocks. In quartation processing; a 'significantsquare'(containing at least one non-zero amplitude coefficient in the coefficient block) isrecursively divided into four smaller squares until single significant coefficients are reached;and the significance statuses of all generated squares are encoded.

Constant distortion rate control for H. 264/AVC high definition videos with scene change,Dongdong Zhang; Zhenzhong Chen; King Ngi Ngan,In this paper; we propose a constant distortion rate control algorithm for H. 264/AVC highdefinition videos with scene change. With the rate and distortion information of each frame;the frame scene complexity is modeled and the scene change is detected in the first passencoding. In the second-pass encoding; the expected distortion of each GOP under theconstraint of target bits is derived based on the first-pass statistics. And the quantization step(Q-step) of each frame can be obtained with a linear distortion-quantizer (DQ) model byconsidering the parameter update of this model at scene change.

In optics; a typical example of periodic system is a closely-spaced waveguidearray; in which collective behavior of wave propagation exhibits many intriguing phenomenathat have no counterpart in homogeneous media. Even in a linear waveguide array; thediffraction property of a light beam changes due to evanescent coupling between nearbywaveguide sites; leading to normal and anomalous discrete diffraction. In a nonlinearwaveguide array; a balance between diffraction and self-action gives rise to novel localizedstates such as spatial “discrete solitons” in the semi-infinite (or total-internal-reflection) gapor spatial “gap solitons” in the Bragg reflection gaps.

Adaptive filters based on the best matched wavelet tree,Z Chen; N Erdol; F Bao,In applications where some prior information exists about the physical system that gives riseto the signals under consideration; simplification is to be expected in search ofrepresentational optimality. Often the purpose of processing is to separate signals fromuncorrelated and correlated noise; the latter being certifiably difficult to do without theknowledge of features that enables one to distinguish the signal from noise. Under suchcircumstances; a priori information about the signal can be used to chose a fixed waveletbasis so that a fixed best wavelet tree can be found in which at least one scale level containsthe statistical majority of the input signal energy. Such a wavelet basis is said to match thesignal. It is shown that adaptive filtering using matched wavelet filter banks results inimproved convergence speed as compared to adaptive filtering with no consideration of …,Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics; 1995.; IEEE ASSP Workshop on,1995,4

Nonlinear self-action of light through biological suspensions,Anna Bezryadina; Tobias Hansson; Rekha Gautam; Benjamin Wetzel; Graham Siggins; Andrew Kalmbach; Josh Lamstein; Daniel Gallardo; Edward J Carpenter; Andrew Ichimura; Roberto Morandotti; Zhigang Chen,Abstract It is commonly thought that biological media cannot exhibit an appreciablenonlinear optical response. We demonstrate; for the first time to our knowledge; a tunableoptical nonlinearity in suspensions of cyanobacteria that leads to robust propagation andstrong self-action of a light beam. By deliberately altering the host environment of the marinebacteria; we show experimentally that nonlinear interaction can result in either deeppenetration or enhanced scattering of light through the bacterial suspension; while theviability of the cells remains intact. A theoretical model is developed to show that a nonlocalnonlinearity mediated by optical forces (including both gradient and forward-scatteringforces) acting on the bacteria explains our experimental observations.,Physical review letters,2017,3

In order to understand responsible molecules for the multidrugresistance phenotype of KAS cells; we examined the expressions of ATP-binding cassette(ABC) transporters and found that the ABCB6 and ABCC1/multidrug resistance protein 1(ABCC1/MRP1) were increased. ABCC1/MRP1 was not completely responsible for the drugresistance spectrum of KAS cells and several reports have suggested that ABCB6 is relatedto anticancer drug and metal resistance. We; therefore; established and examined ABCB6-expressing KB cells and ABCB6-knockdown KAS cells. ABCB6 expression enhancedresistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU); SN-38 and vincristine (Vcr) but not to arsenite.Conversely; down-regulation of ABCB6 in KAS cells increased the sensitivity of KAS cells …,Anticancer research,2014,3
Distinct representations of symbolic ordinality and quantity: evidence from neuropsychological investigations in a Chinese patient with Gerstmann’s syndrome,Zhongqin Chen; Mingwei Xu; Desheng Shang; Guoping Peng; Benyan Luo,Abstract A number of recent studies have shown conflicting evidence as to common ordistinct representations between symbolic ordinality and quantity. We investigated this issuethrough a series of neuropsychological tests in a unique Chinese patient with the leftangular gyrus and left supramarginal gyrus lesions. Behavioral experiments revealed that(1) the patient showed Gerstmann syndrome; with minimal anomia and alexia and (2) thepatient showed the dissociation among number semantic representations with relativelypreserved symbolic quantity knowledge and impaired processing of symbolic ordermeaning. Together with existing evidence in the literature; results of the current studysuggest that there might be two separate cognitive representations of symbolic ordinalityand quantity in logographic language according to this dissociation.

Asymmetric Two-Way Relay Communication with physical Layer Network Coding [J],CHl Xin-sheng ZHENG Bao-yu; CHEN Zhi-cheng WEI Hao,In this paper we proposed a scheme for asymmetric data transmission in Two-way RelayingSystems with physical layer network coding (PLNC). As we all known; the wireless links arediscrepant. The sources nodes transmit message with asymmetric rates according to theirindividual link qualities by employing network coding at the relay. The scheme withasymmetric data transmission not only make full use of the better link to transmit more data;but also considerate the reliability in the worse link. The main idea to realize asymmetricdata transmission is to add prior known information so as to diminish the constellation of thesuperimposed signal received in the relay and to get better performance of system indemodulation and decoding. The relay node joint demodulate the superimposed signalaccording to the constellation. Therefore; it can reduce the complexity of the …,Signal Processing,2012,3

Nonlinear spectrum broadening of femtosecond laser pulses in photorefractive waveguide arrays,Zhe Wang; Qiang Wu; Chengliang Yang; Xinzheng Zhang; Zhigang Chen; Romano A Rupp; Jingjun Xu,In photorefractive waveguide arrays; the process and extent of spectral broadening offemtosecond laser pulse caused by self-phase modulation are studied theoretically andexperimentally. The threshold of self-phase modulation is more than two times larger thanthe common threshold in a bulk sample; which affects the extent of spectral broadeningdramatically. The coupling length and the ratio between the common threshold and the inputpeak intensity of the femtosecond laser pulse are the two key parameters dominating thesephenomena. The experimental results confirm the theoretical expectation.,Optics express,2010,3

The SiC/Al interface of the as-rolledcomposite sheets was observed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy(HRTEM). The results show that there are two kinds of SiC/Al interfaces in the composites.One is crystalline silicon transition layer with about 3 nm in thickness; and some dispersedAl4C3 phases appear in the matrix near the interface. And the other one is amorphous silicalayer with about 5 nm in thickness and SiC particles solve partly to inject Si into the matrix;resulting in Si concentration gradient. Both of the two kinds of interfaces are characterizedwith good wettability; which contributes to the strong bonding between SiC particles and Almatrix.

A fast adaptive quantization matrix selection method in H. 264/AVC,Yifu Zhang; Shunliang Mei; Quqing Chen; Zhibo Chen,Adaptive quantization matrix selection (AQMS) method was recently proposed in ITU-TVCEG to improve video coding performance. As a reference model for VCEG; this methodinvolves coding a frame multiple times to obtain optimal candidate matrix parameters. In thispaper; the method in AQMS is analyzed and an fast adaptive quantization matrix selectionmethod is proposed. The proposed method keeps the quantization matrix selection in themacroblock level but removes the iterative quantization matrix parameter calculation in theframe level. Therefore; computational complexity is greatly reduced while the coding gain ismaintained.,Circuits and Systems; 2008. ISCAS 2008. IEEE International Symposium on,2008,3
Reversal effect of BM-cyclin 1 on multidrug resistance in C-A120 cells,Lin Wang; Jian Sun; Yong-Qiang Li; Zhe-Sheng Chen; Shin-Ichi Akiyama; Li-Jian Xian,Overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins (MRPs) hasbeen demonstrated to be and implicated in mechanisms of resistance in some cancer-celllines. P-gp and MRPS belong to the ATP-binding cassette superfamily of transport proteins.These proteins induce MDR either by decreasing the total intracellular retention of drugs orby redistributing intracellular accumulation of drugs away from the target organelles. Anotheratypical MDR phenotype has been identified; the predominant mechanism of resistance ofthis phenotype has been shown to bring about qualitative or quantitative changes in thelevels and activity of topoisomerase II (Topo II)[1]. The decreased expression of Topo IIα hasbeen observed in a variety of cell lines that have developed resistance to a wide range ofchemotherapeutic drugs.

Sequences of high-order dark photorefractive spatial solitons and soliton-induced waveguides formed in bulk SBN,Zhigang Chen; Mordechai Segev,Steady-state dark photorefractive spatial screening solitons are observed in an odd-or even-number sequence when a laser beam containing a dark stripe generated from a phase oramplitude discontinuity in the center of the beam is launched into a biased bulk strontiumbarium niobate (SBN) crystal. If the initial width of the dark stripe is small; only a fundamentalsoliton or a Y-junction soliton is generated; corresponding to the lowest order in the odd-oreven-number soliton sequence. As the initial width and the bias field are increased; weobserve a progressive transition from a lower-order soliton to a sequence of higher-ordersolitons. We show that these dark solitons induce stable waveguides which can guide anintense beam of a different wavelength into multiple channels.,Photorefractive Materials,1996,3

Wavelet interpolation: from orthonormal to the oversampled wavelet transform,Nurgun Erdol; Feng Bao; Zajing Chen,The orthonormal wavelet transform is an efficient method of signal representation sincethere is no redundancy in its expression; but due to aliasing in the decimation stage it lacksthe often desired property of shift invariance. On the other hand; the oversampled ornonorthogonal wavelet offers a finer resolution in translation; thus reducing the effect of shiftof origin; it is more robust to changes in the initial phase of the signal. In some areas ofsignal processing; such as wideband correlation processing; sensitivity to time alignmentnecessitates the use of the nonorthogonal wavelet transform. The price paid for theadvantage of robustness to shifting is the introduction of redundancy in the expression. Inmany applications; both of these properties are needed in different stages of signalprocessing. Thus there is a need to know the conditions under which the redundant and …,Acoustics; Speech; and Signal Processing; 1995. ICASSP-95.; 1995 International Conference on,1995,3

Photosynthetic acclimation to water stress in citrus,Chen Zhihui; Zhang Liangcheng; WU Guanglin; Zhang Shanglong,Water stress imposed on citrus trees (Citrus unshiu Marc.)(transplanted to nutrient solution24 days before stress imposition) by addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG; MW 4000) toreduce the osmotic potential of the nutrient solution led to rapid decline of leaf waterpotential (ψ1); leaf relative water content (LWC); leaf net photosyn-thesis (Pn); transpiration(Tr); stomatal conductance (Gs) and mesophyllconductance (Gm). Trees which suffered theseverest stress shed all their leaves in 3 days. ψ1of the less stressed trees ultimatelydropped to a minimum and remained at this level even when LWC began to increase withconcomitant recovery of Pn and Gm. Tr and Gs; however; went up more slowly. The recoverywas incomplete during the stress period. It seems that the citrus trees had acclimatedthemselves to the water stress.

Strontium folic acid derivative functionalized titanium surfaces for enhanced osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells in vitro and bone formation in vivo,Kui Xu; Weizhen Chen; Caiyun Mu; Yonglin Yu; Kaiyong Cai,The introduction of the bioactive strontium (Sr) element has become an attractive method inthe design of bio-functional layers on titanium surfaces. However; there are still no effectivesolutions to some of the associated problems including the toxicity of free Sr2+ ions and therapid and irreversible loss of the strontium element from the bio-functional layers. In thisstudy; we successfully fabricated a bioactive layer on Ti substrates with a strontium folic acidderivative (FASr). About 3.11 at% Sr was incorporated into the Ti surface. Thecharacterization results showed that FASr was stable over a long period of time and minimalfree Sr2+ ions were detected in simulated body fluid (SBF). In the in vitro experiment; theFASr could significantly promote the cell adhesion; proliferation and osteogenicdifferentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) over a short period.

This process may cause variable degrees offractionation of Ce from other trivalent rear earth elements; and thus may provide specificinsight into the geological processes associated with marked redoxomorphism. Multiplegeochemical tracing of Sr-Nd-Ce isotopes are performed on the felsic and mafic intrusives ofthe Neoproterozoic (~ 800 Ma) Huangling complex located at the eastern Three Gorges;South China. The intrusive rocks exclusively show various extents of negative Ceanomalies.

Hydrogen peroxide maintains the heterogeneous reaction of sulfur dioxide on mineral dust proxy particles,Liubin Huang; Yue Zhao; Huan Li; Zhongming Chen,Abstract The heterogeneous oxidation of sulfur dioxide (SO 2) on α-Al 2 O 3 particles wasinvestigated using a flow reactor coupled with a transmission-Fourier transform infrared (T-FTIR) spectrometer at different relative humidities (RH) in the absence or presence ofhydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2); with an emphasis on the saturation coverage of SO 2 and thetimescale on which the reaction reaches saturation. It is found that the saturation coverage ofSO 2 in the absence of H 2 O 2 increases with rising RH due to the hydrolysis of SO 2 bysurface adsorbed water. However; the reaction ultimately reaches saturation since theproduced sulfite/bisulfite cannot be further converted to sulfate/bisulfate in the absence ofoxidants. In addition; the presence of H 2 O 2 can significantly increase the saturationcoverage of SO 2 by efficiently oxidizing sulfite/bisulfite to sulfate/bisulfate.

Scattering detection of a solenoidal Poynting vector field,Shima Fardad; Alessandro Salandrino; Akbar Samadi; Matthias Heinrich; Zhigang Chen; Demetrios N Christodoulides,The Poynting vector S plays a central role in electrodynamics as it is directly related to thepower and the momentum carried by an electromagnetic wave. In the presence of multipleelectromagnetic waves with different polarizations and propagation directions; the Poyntingvector may exhibit solenoidal components which are not associated to any power flow. Here;we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that the presence of such solenoidalcomponents has physical consequences; and it is not a mere artifact of the gauge invarianceof S. In particular; we identify a simple field configuration displaying solenoidal componentsof S and theoretically show that a judiciously designed scatterer can act as a “Poyntingvector detector” which when immersed in such field distribution would experience atransverse optical force orthogonal to the incidence plane. We experimentally validate our …,Optics letters,2016,2

Visual word form processing in the right hemisphere: Evidence from neuropsychological investigations in two Chinese patients with a splenium lesion,Zhongqin Chen; Benyan Luo; Mingwei Xu; Desheng Shang; Hui Liang,Background: Though there is no doubt that the left hemisphere (LH) is the superior languageprocessor; an increasing number of researches have demonstrated significant linguisticability in the “nonverbal” right hemisphere (RH); such as orthographic processing and thesuperiority of recognising words presented in unfamiliar formats. However; it is difficult torule out the role of the LH in language processing completely; because the subjects reportedin most studies have no lesion or commissurotomy in the splenium of the corpus callosum(SCC); which allowed the interaction between left and right hemispheres in visual wordprocessing. Patients with a lesion or commissurotomy in the SCC provide a uniqueopportunity to explore visual word form processing in the RH.

Mirror transformation and super-focusing of Airy pulses under the action of third order dispersion,R Driben; Y Hu; Z Chen; BA Malomed; R Morandotti,We study truncated Airy pulses launched into an anomalous dispersion domain of a fiberwith strong positive third order dispersion. The pulse quickly reaches the focal point; andthen it undergoes a mirror transformation and continues to propagate with the accelerationin the opposite direction. At the focal point all of the light pulse energy is concentrated in avery narrow temporal slot; exhibiting an intriguing pulse compression technique. When bothdispersion terms act on the pulse; the focal point extends to a finite area of spreading of thetruncated Airy pulse. The size of the area depends on the relative strength of the TOD termrelative to its second-order counterpart. After this area; the pulse reemerges again andcontinues its evolution mirror-transformed. A full exact analytical description of pulsesdynamics is developed and verified with direct numerical simulations.,Integrated Optics: Physics and Simulations,2013,2

Light localization by defects in optically induced photonic structures,Jianke Yang; Xiaosheng Wang; Jiandong Wang; Zhigang Chen,Abstract In the past ten years; there has blossomed an interest in the study of collectivebehavior of wave propagation in periodic waveguide arrays and photonic lattices [1–3]. Theunique bandgap structures of these periodic media; coupled with nonlinear effects; give riseto many types of novel soliton structures [1–26]. On the other hand; it is well known that oneof the unique and most interesting features of photonic band-gap structures is afundamentally different way of waveguiding by defects in otherwise uniformly periodicstructures. Such waveguiding has been demonstrated with an “air-hole” in photonic crystalfibers (PCF) for optical waves [27; 28]; in an isolated defect in two-dimensional arrays ofdielectric cylinders for microwaves [29–31]; and recently in all-solid PCF with a lower-indexcore [32; 33].

The number ofemitted electrons increases in experiments when a pre-plasma is created on the target rearsurface. The formation of the electrostatic potential is clearly retarded in particle-in-cellsimulations resulting in the elongation of time window for hot electron emission. Theincrease in the number of electrons is consistent with the Alfvén current within the elongatedtime window.,Plasma and Fusion Research,2007,2
Optically Induced PCF-Like Structures,Xiaosheng Wang; Igor Makasyuk; Jianke Yang; Zhigang Chen,One of the most fascinating features of photonic band-gap (PBG) structures is that theyprovide a fundamentally different way of waveguiding by defects in otherwise uniformlyperiodic structures; as opposed to guidance by total internal reflection (TIR). 1 Suchbandgap guidance has been demonstrated in two-dimensional (2D) arrays of dielectriccylinders with an isolated defect for microwaves; and in holey-core photonic crystal fibers(PCF) or in all-solid PCF with a lower-index core for optical waves; where the PBG refers totime-domain frequency modes. In fact; laser emission based on photonic defect modes hasbeen realized for a wide range of spectra. On the other hand; the PBG of spatial frequencymodes (propagation constant vs. transverse wave vector) in waveguide lattices2 representsanother possibility for unconventional guidance of light; especially in periodic …,Optics and Photonics News,2006,2

Aromatization of n-Hexane over Ni-Modified ZSM-5 [J],Zhu Guangzhong,The aromatization of n-hexane over Cu-modified ZSM-5 was studied. It was found that theselectivity to aromatization and the yield of aromatics have increased by adding someamount of Cu into ZSM-5. The investigation of the relationship of the catalytic function withthe acidic properties of the catalyst was made. It appeared that Bronsted acidity decreased;and Lewis acidity increased by introducing Ni into the catalyst; which is likely to beresponsible for the increase of aromatization activity. It was proposed that the good effect forn-hexane aromatization was attributed to the cooperation functions of both Bronsted andLewis acids.,Journal of Huizhou University,1995,2

The OH-initiated oxidation of atmospheric peroxyacetic acid: Experimental and model studies,Huihui Wu; Yin Wang; Huan Li; Liubin Huang; Dao Huang; Hengqing Shen; Yanan Xing; Zhongming Chen,Abstract Peroxyacetic acid (PAA; CH 3 C (O) OOH) plays an important role in atmosphericchemistry; serving as reactive oxidant and affecting radical recycling. However; previousstudies revealed an obvious gap between modelled and observed concentrations ofatmospheric PAA; which may be partly ascribed to the uncertainty in the kinetics andmechanism of OH-oxidation. In this study; we measured the rate constant of OH radicalreaction with PAA (k PAA+ OH) and investigated the products in order to develop a morerobust atmospheric PAA chemistry. Using the relative rates technique and employingtoluene and meta-xylene as reference compounds; the k PAA+ OH was determined to be(9.4–11.9)× 10− 12 cm 3 molecule− 1 s− 1 at 298 K and 1 atm; which is about (2.5–3.2)times larger than that parameter used in Master Chemical Mechanism v3. 3.1 (MCM v3 …,Atmospheric Environment,2017,1

Here; we demonstrate both experimentallyand numerically; topological vortex degeneracy lifting and Aharonov–Bohm-like interferencefrom local deformation in a photonic honeycomb lattice. When a single valley is excited;lattice deformation leads to the generation of a vortex pair due to the lifting of degeneracyassociated with pseudospin states.

Soliton-mediated orientational ordering of gold nanorods and birefringence in plasmonic suspensions,Yu-Xuan Ren; Trevor S Kelly; Chensong Zhang; Huizhong Xu; Zhigang Chen,We report on the soliton-mediated orientational ordering of gold nanorods in a colloidalplasmonic suspension. Due to the nonlinear optical response of the suspension; a lightbeam forms an optical spatial soliton which creates an effective optical waveguide. Theorientation of the nanorods along the waveguide is regulated by the optical torque exertedby the linearly polarized soliton beam. By measuring the polarization transmission spectrumof a probe beam at a wavelength far from the plasmonic resonance; we observe orientation-enhanced birefringence along the soliton channel; suggesting a disorder-to-order transitionof nanorods due to the action of the soliton beam.

Understanding atmospheric peroxyformic acid chemistry: observation; modeling and implication,H Liang; ZM Chen; D Huang; QQ Wu; LB Huang,The existence and importance of peroxyformic acid (PFA) in the atmosphere has been undercontroversy. We present here; for the first time; the observation data for PFA from four fieldmeasurements carried out in China. These data provided powerful evidence that PFA canstay in the atmosphere; typically in dozens of pptv level. The relationship between PFA andother detected peroxides was examined. The results showed that PFA had a strong positivecorrelation with its homolog; peroxyacetic acid; due to their similar sources and sinks.Through an evaluation of PFA production and removal rates; we proposed that the reactionsbetween peroxyformyl radical (HC (O) O 2) and formaldehyde or the hydroperoxyl radical(HO 2) were likely to be the major source and degradation into formic acid (FA) was likely tobe the major sink for PFA. Based on a box model evaluation; we proposed that the HC (O) …,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics Discussions,2015,1

Control of self-accelerating Airy beams with optically-induced refractive-index gradient,Zhuoyi Ye; Sheng Liu; Cibo Lou; Peng Zhang; Yi Hu; Daohong Song; Jianlin Zhao; Zhigang Chen,Recently; free-space self-accelerating Airy beams [1; 2] have attracted increasing research interestdue to their peculiar features promising for many applications [3; 4]. However; in many environmentsthe refractive media is intrinsically nonuniform. For instance; the atmosphere can be consideredas a layered refractive index media. In optics and photonics; graded-index variation appearsall the time. Therefore; it is quite desirable to study the propagation of Airy beams in nonuniformmedia.

In many applications it isoften highly desirable to have a beam abruptly auto-focus all its energy right before a target.For instance; this feature could be attractive in several settings ranging from biomedical treatmentapplications; to plasmonic lensing and optical filamentation studies. Along these lines; it hasbeen recently proposed that a new class of auto-focusing optical beams; based on self-acceleratingAiry beams [1; 2]; could be possible. These beams can maintain quite low intensity profiles throughoutpropagation while abruptly concentrating all their power on target-right at the focus without usingnonlinear self-focusing effects [3].

Self-trapping and stabilization of doubly-charged optical vortices in two-dimensional photonic lattices,Eugenia Eugenieva; Daohong Song; Anna Bezryadina; Peng Zhang; Zhigang Chen; Neal B Abraham,We report our recent work on self-trapping of doubly-charged vortices (DCVs) in two-dimensional optically induced photonic lattices. We show that in an ideal isotropic nonlinearperiodic medium self-trapping of a DCV can lead to formation of a rotating 'quasi-vortex'soliton with periodic charge-flipping; but the vortex breaks up into multiple singly-charged vortices in an anisotropic nonlinear medium. Such topological transformation ofhigh-order vortices under conventional four-site excitation in a square photonic lattice hasbeen observed in our experiment and corroborated with numerical simulations. Withgeometrically extended eight-site excitation; however; discrete self-trapping of a DCV into astable high-order vortex soliton can be realized with both self-focusing and self-defocusingnonlinearities.,Journal of Modern Optics,2010,1

Security policy for information erasing and leaking in multithreaded codes,Li JIANG; Jian CHEN; Ling-di PING; Xiao-ping CHEN,In multithreaded environment; sensitive information is often deliberately released by manyreal applications and sometimes information needs to become more confidential. In order toaddress this situation; a security policy was defined in the style of strong bisimulationequivalence; which can handle both information leaking and erasing. The policy controlswhat information is released and guarantees that attackers cannot exploit informationreleasing mechanisms to reveal more sensitive data than intended. Moreover; it ensures thatpublic data after erasing cannot be abused by attackers. Then a secure transforming typesystem was proposed to enforce the security policy by using the cross-copying technique;which can eliminate internal timing covert channels resulting from the interplay betweendifferent threads.

Optical Shockley-like surface states in photonic superlattices,Ivan Hromada; Natalia Malkova; Xiaosheng Wang; Garnett Bryant; Zhigang Chen,Electronic Tamm and Shockley sur- face states have intrigued scientists since they were firstpredicted;1 although their direct observation remained elusive for decades because of the intrinsicde- fects and the complicated nature of real surfaces in condensed matter physics. In optics;surface states typically cannot exist at the interface between two linear homogeneousdielectrics; whereas under nonlinear conditions; their observation was hampered by the requirementof high threshold power. Recently; nonlinear surface states (surface solitons) have beendemonstrat- ed in experiments with fabricated or op- tically induced photonic structures.2;3 Akey feature of previously observed optical surface states is that they rely on surface perturbationand exist only above a cer- tain threshold; thus; they have the same physical origin as Tammstates in crystals.

Content-dependent Frequency Domain based RDO Mode Decision,Zhibo Chen; Quqing Chen; Charles Wang,In this paper; we propose a content-dependent frequency domain based RDO (ratedistortion optimization) mode decision algorithm such that an optimal mode decision isachieved with significantly reduced computational complexity. Specifically; based on the factthat quantized coefficients mainly focus on the lower frequency domain and few of them arenon-zero entries especially in the low bit rate case; a computational savings can beachieved by using simplified transform to obtain lower frequency coefficients; as wellestimate rate and distortion in the frequency domain. Therefore calculation on transform;quantization; inverse quantization can be decreased; entropy coding can be omitted; andinverse transform can be decreased in case of using simplified transform or omitted in othercases. Primary result shows averagely more than 46.5% computation reduction in RDO …,Information; Communications and Signal Processing; 2005 Fifth International Conference on,2005,1
Object-based rate control for MPEG-4 video object coding,Zhenzhong Chen; King Ngi Ngan,In this paper; we develop an object-based rate control algorithm for MPEG-4 arbitrarilyshaped video object coding. An improved quadratic rate-distortion model for textureinformation is derived; which is more accurate for arbitrarily shaped video objects. We alsointroduce an accurate rate-distortion model for shape information. Combining the rate-distortion models for texture and shape information; an object level rate control algorithm isproposed. To achieve constant bit rate; the quantizer is adjusted based on buffer fullness.The tradeoff between picture quality and buffer fullness is considered. Comparing with therate control algorithm for the MPEG-4 verification model; our proposed scheme can achievea more stable buffer without sacrificing picture quality.,Circuits and Systems; 2004.

Observation of spatial optical diametric drive acceleration in photonic lattices,Yumiao Pei; Yi Hu; Cibo Lou; Daohong Song; Liqin Tang; Jingjun Xu; Zhigang Chen,Abstract We experimentally and theoretically demonstrate a spatial diametric driveacceleration of two mutually incoherent optical beams in 1D optical lattices under a self-defocusing nonlinearity. The two beams; exciting the modes at the top/bottom edges of thefirst Bloch band and hence experiencing normal/anomalous diffraction; can bind togetherand bend in the same direction during nonlinear propagation; analogous to the interplaybetween two objects with opposite signs of mass that breaks Newton's third law. Theirspatial spectrum changes associated with the acceleration are analyzed for different latticemodulations. We find that the acceleration limit is determined by the beam exciting the topband edge that reaches a saturated momentum change prior to the other pairing beam.,Optics letters,2018,*

Design and synthesis of indole derivatives as ABCG2 mediated resistance reversal agents,Chao-Yun Cai; Hong Zhai; Zi-Ning Lei; Bao-Li Chen; Zhao-Yi Du; Yun-Kai Zhang; Yi-Jun Wang; Bo Wang; Zhe-Sheng Chen,Multidrug resistance is a phenomenon that cancer cells become resistant to anticancerdrugs. Multidrug resistance has been shown to be related with the overexpression of ATP-binding (ABC) transporters; including ABCG2. Therefore; ABCG2 is a therapeutic target forthe development of multidrug resistance reversal agents. Fumitremorgin C; with an indolegroup which is an important pharmacophore in many drugs; is a known ABCG2 inhibitor.Inspired by this; we synthesized two series of indole derivatives as ABCG2 mediatedresistance reversal agents.

The production of formaldehyde and hydroxyacetone in methacrolein photooxidation: New insights into mechanism and effects of water vapor,Yanan Xing; Huan Li; Liubin Huang; Huihui Wu; Hengqing Shen; Zhongming Chen,Abstract Methacrolein (MACR) is an abundant multifunctional carbonyl compound with highreactivity in the atmosphere. In this study; we investigated the hydroxyl radical initiatedoxidation of MACR at various NO/MACR ratios (0 to 4.04) and relative humidities (< 3% to80%) using a flow tube. Meanwhile; a box model based on the Master Chemical Mechanismwas performed to test our current understanding of the mechanism. In contrast to thereasonable predictions for hydroxyacetone production; the modeled yields of formaldehyde(HCHO) were twice higher than the experimental results. The discrepancy was ascribed tothe existence of unconsidered non-HCHO forming channels in the chemistry of CH 3 C (CH2) OO; which account for approx. 50%. In addition; the production of hydroxyacetone andHCHO were affected by water vapor as well as the initial NO/MACR ratio. The yields of …,Journal of Environmental Sciences,2017,*

Indeed; Cherenkov analogues appear in many fields; and particularly relevant examplescan be found in nonlinear optics; including Cherenkov-type parametric processes [2] and dispersivewaves (DWs) radiation in fibers optics [3]; where the role of the emitter is played by nonlinearlyinduced dipoles. In this optical framework; one of the predominant applications of this phenomenonis the realization of novel electromagnetic sources.

Rogue waves in red blood cell suspensions,Yu-Xuan Ren; Josh Lamstein; Trevor S Kelly; Chensong Zhang; Yong Sun; Claudio Conti; Demetrios N Christodoulides; Zhigang Chen,Rogue waves are ubiquitous in nature: they appear in a variety of physical systems ranging fromacoustics; microwave cavities; optical fibers and resonators; to plasmas; superfluids andBose-Einstein condensates [1-7]. Unlike solitons; however; rogue waves are rare or extremeevents that “appear from nowhere and disappear without a trace.” Recently; it has been demonstratedthat; even without nonlinearity; rogue waves can appear in various experimental settings[8-12]. Here; we demonstrate for the first time to our knowledge rogue waves in healthy humanred blood cell (RBC) suspensions. The observed rogue-wave-like events in RBC suspensionsare characterized by an abnormal L-shaped probability distribution that considerably deviatesfrom Rayleigh-law statistics.

Observation of spatial optical diametric drive acceleration,Yumiao Pei; Yi Hu; Cibo Lou; Daohong Song; Liqin Tang; Jingjun Xu; Zhigang Chen,Although negative mass is still a concept appearing mostly in theory; its associated dynamicsis counter-intuitive and fascinating [1-6]. In particular; as predicted from Newton's third law ofmotion; the interaction between two objects with negative and positive mass may lead to a diametricdrive acceleration; where the positive mass object experiences an attracting force but the negativeone a repelling force. Realizing such a prediction was suspended as a result of the failure onsearching negative mass. Although an electron state was found to have negative effective massin crystals; the preformation of interaction between the electrons with opposite values of effectmass seems to be impossible. On the other hand; optical pulses can have effective “mass” (relatedto dispersion relationship) analogous to that of the electrons in crystals; and their interactioncan be realized in experiment.

OCIS codes: (130.2790) Guided waves;(230.0230) Optical devices; (070.7345) Wave propagation … Localization effects of light wavesand associated image transmission have attracted a great deal of interest; with exemplary successthrough engineering the disorder; nonlinearity; waveguide coupling; or analogous external fields[1-6]. Recently; a novel type of localization due to a nondispersive energy band (ie; the flat band[7]) was observed in photonic Lieb lattices [8; 9]. Such localization is due to the principle of phasecancellation; which is a common feature of flat-band eigenstates.

Guiding and coupling light through nonlinear plasmonic nanosuspensions,Yuxuan Ren; Trevor Kelly; Akbar Samadi; Anna Bezryadina; Demetrios N Christodoulides; Zhigang Chen,Artificial soft-matter systems exhibiting unique optical properties not found in natural materialsmay lead to many intriguing applications. Recently; self-trapping and guiding of light throughscattering colloidal suspensions has attracted a great deal of interest [1-6]. In particular; we havedemonstrated two types of soft-matter systems (dielectric and plasmonic nanosuspensions) thatcan exhibit negative polarizability and thus support deep penetration of light through the colloids[2; 5]. In this work; we show how one can alter at will the coupling between two light beams byappropriately tuning the relative strength of the wavelength-dependent polarizabilities. Theseprocesses range from guiding a strong beam through a weak beam due to soliton-induced waveguidesin gold sphere suspensions; to master/slave vector-type nonlinear coupling of two beams dueto their combined action resulting from opposite polarizabilities in gold core-shell …,CLEO: QELS_Fundamental Science,2016,*
Observation of flat-band image transmission in optically induced Lieb photonic lattices,Shiqiang Xia; Yi Hu; Daohong Song; Yuanyuan Zong; Liqin Tang; Zhigang Chen,Lieb lattices have intrigued scientists for decades [1] due to their unique band structure characterizedby a dispersionless (flat) energy band. Such a flat band is composed of entirely degenerate localizedstates [2]. This is particularly interesting in photonics because it provides a new way for light localizationwithout the need of defect [3]; disorder [4]; or nonlinearity [5]. Quite recently; Lieb photonic latticeswere realized via the femtosecond laser- writing techniques; allowing for direct observationsof diffractionless flat-band states [6; 7]. Interestingly; it was theoretically predicted that photonicflat-band modes might be used for diffraction-free image transmission [8]; but it has not beenexperimentally realized to the best of our knowledge. Here; we present a simple way to establishLieb photonic lattices without the need of femtosecond laser-writing; and more importantly; demonstrateexperimentally distortion-free flat-band image transmission in such lattices.

The differences of visual word form processing mechanism between Chinese and Western pure alexia,Jie ZHANG; CHEN Zhong-qin; LUO Ben-yan,Abstract Pure alexia is a dysfunction with simple symptoms and specific impaired regions;which happens at early stage of reading called visual word form processing; and involvesvisual word form area (VWFA). Reading as an acquired higher nervous function is closelyrelated with culture; so the comparison between Chinese and Western pure alexia couldlead to further understanding of visual word form processing mechanism. As the differentclinical manifestations of pure alexia in Chinese and Western cultures; the signal distinctionof words is the primary cause whereas the plasticity of VWFA is the neurobiological basis.Chinese and Western reading both present left-hemispheric lateralization; but based on thespecial feature of Chinese pure alexia; it is inferred that the right hemispheric may play amore outstanding role in Chinese word processing.

Quick Triaxial Consolidated Drained Test on Gravelly Soil,Zhi-Bo Chen; Jun-Gao Zhu; Wen-Bin Jian,Abstract Gravelly soil; a mixture of clay and gravel; has been widely used as a core materialof high earth core rock fill dams. The triaxial consolidated drained (CD) test for gravelly soilis time-consuming; especially for larger scale test samples because of its low permeabilitycaused by the high content of clay. This study presents a quick triaxial consolidated drained(QCD) test; which can greatly accelerate the CD test on gravelly soil. In the QCD test; thetraditional cylindrical specimen was modified to a sand-core cylindrical specimen containinga hollow cylindrical specimen; and the sand column filled in the central hollow. As a result;the sand column in the center of the specimen greatly accelerates the water drainage of thespecimen; and both the consolidation stage and the shear stage of the test can be finishedquickly.

In such a sys- tem phenomena such as conical diffraction[2;3]; photonic Landau levels [4]; and topological edge states [5] have been observed. The orbitalangular momentum L of the Dirac equation; and thus of photonic graphene; is notconserved.

Optical manipulation of rod-shaped bacteria and adhesive cellular clusters with novel “tug-of-war” optical tweezers,Anna Bezryadina; John Keith; Joseph Chen; Zhigang Chen,Rod-shaped bacteria are abundant in nature; and they represent one of the most efficient morphologiesfor swimming in a fluid environment [1]. Well-defined alignment of rod-shaped bacteria is thushighly desired for observation of bacterial motility and intracellular processes. However; mostavailable methods for trapping and orientational control of rod-shaped bacteria are very limitedin scope; partly because a rod-shaped object has a strong tendency to be aligned (orflipped) along the direction of the trapping beam so its whole structure cannot be examined inthe observing plane. Recently; holographic optical tweezers (HOT) [2] have been developedwith dual or multiple traps to achieve full control of a large number of nanowires and rod-shapedbacteria [3]. Such tweezers also have limitations since part of a nonspherical bacterium tendsto be trapped and flipped only by one of the traps first; and then one needs to manually …,Lasers and Electro-Optics (CLEO); 2014 Conference on,2014,*

Abruptly autofocusing waves,Nikolaos K Efremidis; Demetrios Christodoulides; Ioannis Chremmos; Zhigang Chen,The focusing characteristics of optical beams have always been an issue of great practicalimportance. In the case of a Gaussian wavefront the peak intensity follows a Lorentzian distributionaround the focus. However; for many applications it is crucial that a beam abruptly focuses itsenergy right before a target while maintaining a low intensity profile until that very moment. Ideallythis should be a linear property of the wave itself and not the outcome of any self-focusingeffects. In medical laser treatments this feature may be highly desirable since the wave shouldonly affect the intended area while leaving any preceding tissue intact [1]. Such behavior canalso be useful in suddenly “igniting” a particular nonlinear process; such as multi-photonabsorption; stimulated Raman; optical filaments in gases etc [2; 3].

Robust discovery of partial rigid symmetries on 3D models,Kangying Cai; Weiwei Li; Weiliang Meng; Wencheng Wang; Zhibo Chen; Xin Zheng,Abstract The ubiquity of symmetry in nature and man-made artifacts has made symmetrydiscovery an important tool for numerous applications. The most fundamental and visuallyprominent kind of symmetry is partial rigid symmetry; which is explained as the invariancebetween parts of a 3D model under a set of translation; rotation; reflection; and uniformscaling generators. Thus automatic discovery of partial rigid symmetry on general 3Dmodels; with no assumption on the size; shape or location of the symmetric parts; keeps tobe a hot topic during recent years. Among such kind of works; the transformation votingtechnique [Mitra et al. 2006] is most widely used; due to its high efficiency and easiness forunderstanding and implementation.,ACM SIGGRAPH ASIA 2010 Sketches,2010,*

Minimum Cost Routing Based on Network Coding in Wireless Mesh Networks,Xiaojian Shen; Zhigang Chen; Ying Guo; Hui Ye,Wireless mesh networks can significantly improve the transmission performance of multi-hoplinks by using network coding. Thus; a minimum cost routing protocol of wireless meshnetworks based on network coding in multicast communications is presented. This paperintroduced the conceptions of key nodes and super-key nodes; and the correspondingselection algorithm. This protocol judges its routing by whether the next hop nodes are super-key nodes or key nodes. The next hop routing nodes select super-key nodes as a priority;followed by the key nodes and then the general nodes as the last choice. It can increasenetwork coding opportunities and achieve minimum cost routing. Simulation results showthat this protocol can support network coding better while achieving the maximum flow ofmulticast; which significantly reduce the routing costs.,Multimedia Technology (ICMT); 2010 International Conference on,2010,*

Negative refraction in optical waveguide arrays with loss layers,Peng Zhang; Sheng Liu; Xiaosheng Wang; Jianlin Zhao; Zhigang Chen,Light propagation in waveguide arrays exhibits many intriguing phenomena (eg; anomalousdiffraction and refraction); which have attracted a great deal of research interest in the pastdecade [1]. Much of the beam dynamics in waveguide arrays can be explained byemploying the diffraction relationship as well as bandgap structures. Since Bloch modes inwaveguide arrays can be somewhat explained by using the superposition of the guidingmodes of a single waveguide; one may wonder if it is possible to control the beampropagation in waveguide arrays by use of waveguide mode-selection technique. Here wepropose a novel mode-selection technique for optical waveguides by introducing losses intothe waveguide structure; and demonstrate for the first time negative refraction of a singleGaussian beam in such waveguide arrays due to suppression of the even guiding modes.,Lasers and Electro-Optics 2009 and the European Quantum Electronics Conference.

Context-based inverse quantization and its application in wavelet image compression,Jicheng An; Zixing Cai; Quqing Chen; Zhibo Chen; Jun Teng,In this paper; we propose a context-based inverse quantization and show its application inwavelet image compression. The proposed method breaks the traditional one-to-onemapping of the quantization index to reconstruction value in inverse quantization whilemaps an index to several different reconstruction values according to the correspondingcontexts of the index. By accurate context modeling; this method can reduce the quantizationdistortion significantly. Since the quantization indices used for encoding is not changed; thismethod does not increase the encoding bit rates except the negligible overhead.,Circuits and Systems; 2009. ISCAS 2009.

Design of Non-Critical Path Resource Distributor for SMT Processors,Hongzhou Chen; Lingdi Ping; Xiaoping Chen; Kuijun Lu,The performance in simultaneous multithreading (SMT) processors is mainly determined bythe distribution of the common resources among the threads. However; resource distributionmethods often take cycles to calculate a resource allocation solution. Implementing a many-cycles resource distributor in the critical pipeline path will result in an innegligible impact onSMT processor performance. This work proposes a design of non-critical path resourcedistributor (NCPRD) for SMT processors; which separates the resource distribution from thecritical pipeline path to avoid the clock wastage caused by the computation on the allocationsolution. Our limit case study shows that; NCPRD benefits from its asynchronous work modeunder both throughput and fairness metric in all type workloads but the memory-intensiveworkloads; and obtains more gains over the critical-path-involved resource distributor …,Computer Engineering and Technology; 2009.

A Dissipative Resource Distribution policy for SMT processors,Hongzhou Chen; Lingdi Ping; Xuezeng Pan; Kuijun Lu; Xiaoping Chen,The performance in Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) processors is significantlyinfluenced by how optimally the common resources are shared among all threads.

The optimum design for the selection of earth materials and thezoning schemes of the core wall was studied. The test results show that the stress level atthe upper part of the core wall is relatively small; resulting in the low requirements ofdeformation and mechanical indices of the dam materials. The natural clayey soil or thegravelly soil with less gravel content may be employed at the upper part of the core wall;while at the lower part; the wide grading gravelly soil with high gravel content should beemployed.

Vortex Interaction with Nonlinear Photonic Lattices of Varying Coherence,Anita Fors; Eugenia Eugenieva; Zhigang Chen,Vortex propagation in optically-induced photonic lattices has attracted great interest [1-5]. In mostof previous studies; the lattice remains linear and is invariant or “fixed” during propagation.Indeed; discrete vortex trapping [1; 2]; vortex transformation and charge flipping [4; 5] in fixedlattices has been observed; but richer dynamics could occur in nonlinear (or “flexible”) lattices[3]. It would be interesting to investigate the evolution of a vortex beam interacting with nonlinearsolitonic lattices; especially when the coherence length of the lattice affects the dynamical propagationof both the lattice and vortex beams. Here we report on our study of vortex interaction with a 2Dnonlinear lattices induced by partially coherent light. In particular; we find that the speed of phaseevolution/rotation of a singly-charged vortex increases as the lattice coherence decreases.

Observation of aging of the nonlinear susceptibility in soft-matter,N Ghofraniha; Claudio Conti; Giancarlo Ruocco,Complex systems; including soft-materials; are characterized by an exponentially largenumber of metastable states routinely visited while the system is evolving towardsthermodynamic equilibrium if prepared far from equilibrium. This process can extend ontimescales much longer than the atomic/molecular motions ones; due to the large number ofmetastable states. As a result; the response features; like the relaxation time; depend on thespecific instant (the waiting time tw) and are determined by the current metastable state. Thismechanism is known as" aging".

Observation of discrete vortex solitons,Dragomir N Neshev; Tristram J Alexander; Elena A Ostrovskaya; Yuri S Kivshar; Hector Martin; Zhigang Chen,Periodic photonic structures and photonic crystals recently attracted a lot of interest due to theunique means they offer for controlling light propagation. Periodic modulation of the refractiveindex modifies the wave diffraction properties and strongly affects nonlinear propagation andlocalization of light1. Recently; many nonlinear effects; including formation of lattice solitons;have been demonstrated experimentally for one- and two-dimensional optically- induced photoniclattices2–5. Optically-induced lattices are formed by modifying the refractive index of a nonlinearmedium with periodic optical patterns6. A weaker probe beam can be used to study the scatteringof light from the resulting periodic photonic structure. Current experiments employ photorefractivecrystals with strong electro-optic anisotropy to create linear optically-induced lattices with a polarizationorthogonal to that of a probe beam; which also eliminates the nonlinear interaction …,Nonlinear Guided Waves and Their Applications,2004,*
Dipole solitons in two-dimensional photonic lattices,Jianke Yang; Igor Makasyuk; Anna Bezryadina; Zhigang Chen,Dipole solitons in a two-dimensional photorefractive optical lattice are theoretically predictedand experimentally demonstrated. These solitons can be in-phase or out-of-phase in their twolobe components; and they are stabilized by the lattice-induced waveguide. OCIS codes: 190.5530… Laser beam propagation in photorefractive crystals has drawn a lot of study in the past tenyears. The reason is that such crystals exhibit strong screening nonlinearity; so that nonlineareffects become visible at very low optical powers (on the order of a few miniWatts). Inaddition; its nonlinearity is saturable; hence the critical collapse of laser beams in (2+1) dimensionsis suppressed. Because of these properties; (2+1)D photorefractive solitons have been experimentallyobserved. Studies on vector solitons and the interaction between solitons and strips in photorefractivecrystals quickly followed (see [1] for a review).

Modulation instability of incoherent waves,Marin Soljacic; Mordechai Segev; Tamer H Coskun; Demetrios N Christodoulides; Ashvin Vishwanath; Zhigang Chen,Modulation Instability (Ml) is a common phenomenon in coherent non-linear wave Systems;it can be typically observed on top of a broad pulse or an optica! beam. In this case; smallnoise perturbations grow exponentially as the pulse propagates; transferring energy fromlarge wavelengths into smaller wave-Icngths. In a sense; MI phenomena can be regarded asa precursor of bright optical solitons. The recent demonstration of existence of incoherentsolitons' led ns to wander whether Ml can be observed with incoherent waves as well. Here;we demonstrate analytically and numericalh ihal Ml can exisl in nonlinear inco herentsystems.

Self-trapping of incoherent bright and dark beams,Matthew L Mitchell; Zhigang Chen; Mordechai Segev; Tamer Coskun; Demetrios Christodoulides,Until very recently; all experimental and theoretical studies of optical spatial solitons in natureemployed a coherent beam either in space; time; or both. In other words; given the phase at agiven location on the pulse one could predict the phase anywhere on the spatial pulse.However; beams or pulses do not necessarily need to be coherent. Light from natural sourcessuch as the sun or from an incandescent bulb are typically temporally and spatiallyincoherent. In 1996 it was demonstrated for the first time that self-trapping of beams whose phasevaried randomly in time/space across any plane was possible[1;2]. It has since then been shownthat both bright and dark incoherent beams are trappable in nonlinear media[3]. The self-trappingof these incoherent light sources has opened a new sub-field in the study of optical spatialsolitons.

We show that;in the 1D case; planar or Y-splitting waveguides induced by self-trapped incoherence darkstripes can guide other coherent light of a different wavelength.

Photorefractive spatial solitons,Ming-Feng Shih; Mordechai Segev; Zhigang Chen; Matthew L Mitchell; Demetrios Christodoulides; Gregory J Salamo,Since they have been predicted and observed six years ago; photorefractive spatial solitonshave attracted substantial research interest. Photorefractive solitons bring about several newfundamental aspects related to solitons in general. Perhaps the single most important aspectis being the first system in which solitons were demonstrated. This has enabled the study ofinteractions between 2D solitons in a full 3D medium; which has revealed a fundamentallynew property of interacting solitons: conversation of angular momentum when the solitonsare bound to each other in a spiraling configuration. Another key property of thephotorefractive nonlinearity that has had a major impact on soliton research; is its non-instantaneous nature. This has allowed us to generate a new type of'self-trapped'lightbeams: incoherent solitons; which are made of partially spatially incoherent light or of …,Optical Pulse and Beam Propagation,1999,*

Waveguides induced by photorefractive screening solitons,Ming-Feng Shih; Zhigang Chen; Matthew Mitchell; Mordechai Segev; Howard Lee; Robert S Feigelson; Jeffrey P Wilde,Summary form only given. Photorefractive spatial solitons form when the optically inducedspace-charge field modifies the refractive index via electro-optic effect and forms awaveguide that confines the optical beam that has induced the waveguide. Since thephotorefractive response is wavelength dependent; one can generate a soliton with a weakbeam and guide in it a more intense beam of a less photosensitive wavelength. Here wepresent theoretical and experimental studies of the waveguides induced by photorefractivescreening solitons. We show that the number of guided modes in a waveguide induced by abright screening soliton increases monotonically with increasing intensity ratio (the ratiobetween the peak soliton intensity and the background or dark irradiance); whereas thewaveguides induced by dark screening solitons are always single-mode waveguides.,Quantum Electronics Conference; 1998.

Incoherently coupled photorefractive spatial soliton pairs,Zhigang Chen; Mordechai Segev; Tamer H Coskun; Demetrios N Christodoulides; Yuri S Kivshar; Vsevolod V Afanasjev,Incoherently coupled photorefractive spatial soliton pairs are observed in a biasedphotorefractive SBN crystal; as has been predicted recently. 1 These soliton pairs involvetwo steadystate screening solitons2 that propagate collinearly in the crystal and experiencea refractive-index modulation induced by both beams. Thus they differ in their physical originfrom soliton paring in Kerr-type nonlinear systems. 3 A coupled photorefractive soliton paircan have dark-bright as well as brightbright and dark-dark realizations. In all of these cases;once a soliton pair is decoupled (ie; one beam is blocked); the remaining component alonecannot" survive" as a soliton under the same experimental condition.

Self-trapping of an optical vortex in photovoltaic and biased photorefractive media,Zhigang Chen; Mordechai Segev; Daniel W Wilson; Richard E Muller; Paul D Maker,Optical vortex solitons have been studied previously in Kerr-type1 and saturable2selfdefocusing nonlinear systems. Here we report; for the first time we believe; on self-trapping of an optical vortex in both transverse dimensions resulting from two distinctlydifferent nonlinear mechanisms: the bulk photovoltaic effect in an unbiasedphotovoltaicphotorefractive crystal; and the steady-state screening effect in a biasedphotorefractive crystal. In both cases; a singly charged vortex nested in a broad optical beamis trapped into a circular or an elliptical soliton-like structure. First we report the observationof selftrapping of an optical vortex in an unbiased photovoltaic-photorefractive LiNb03crystal. The optical nonlinearity responsible for the trapping is due to the transport of chargecarriers (electrons) dominated by the bulk photovoltaic (or photogalvanic) current.

BENZOTHIADIAZOLE; AN INDUCER OF PLANT DEFENSES,DAVID WENDEHENNE; JöG DURNER; ZHIXIANG CHEN; DANIEL F KLESSIG,Abstract–Benzothiadiazole (BTH) is a recently described synthetic inducer of plant defenses.Molecular and genetic studies have suggested that it acts as a functional analogue of theendogenous defense signalling molecule salicylic acid (SA). Here we demonstrate that BTHinhibits catalase and ascorbate peroxidase; two potential targets through which SA hasbeen proposed to act. BTH was found to be a considerably better inhibitor of catalase thanSA. This is consistent with its greater potency for inducing the expression of defenserelatedgenes; such as the acidic PR-1; PR-2 and PR-3 genes. In addition; induction of PR-1 geneexpression by either BTH or SA was suppressed by antioxidants. These results suggest thatchanges in H; O; levels or the cellular redox status may be involved in the BTH/SA-mediatedactivation of certain defense responses.("; 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Self-Trapping of Partially Spatially Incoherent Light Beams,Matthew Mitchell; Zhigang Chen; Ming-feng Shih; Mordechai Segev,Self-trapping of optical beams has been extensively studied during the last three decades. Itoccurs when the beam changes the optical properties of the medium it propagates in; givingrise to a strong optical nonlinearity. Self-trapping of optical beams has been observed inKerr media; saturable nonlinear media; cascaded media; and photorefractives. However; allprevious experimental observations and theoretical studies inves tigated self-trapping ofspatially coherent light beams only. To the best of our knowledge; no previous attempt hasbeen made to self-trap; either in time or space; an incoherent pulse. Here; we report the firstobservation of self-trapping of a" partially" spatially incoherent opti cal beam in a nonlinearmedium. 1 Self-trapping occurs in both transverse dimensions; when diffraction is exactlybalanced by photorefractive self-focusing.

Steady-state dark screening solitons and soliton-induced waveguides formed in a bulk photorefractive medium,Zhigang Chen; Matthew Mitchell; Ming-Feng Shih; Mordechai Segev; Mark H Garrett; George C Valley,Summary form only given. Steady-state dark photorefractive screening-solitons; as predictedrecently; are observed when a laser beam containing a dark notch propagates through abulk strontium barium niobate crystal biased by an electric field. The photorefractive darksolitons induce waveguides in the bulk of a photorefractive crystal that guide other beams.We use these soliton-induced waveguides to monitor the shape-preserving behavior of thedark soliton. A proper input beam at an appropriate external field can also generate Yjunctions and Y-junction waveguides; as observed for Kerr-type solitons in slab waveguides.We further confirm the shape preserving nature of dark solitons and Y-junctions bymeasuring the soliton beam-profile as it propagates throughout a specially cut (wedged)crystal.,Quantum Electronics and Laser Science Conference; 1996.

Clq induces IL-1ra production by Raji and U937 cells,Chen Zhengliang; Xie Peirong; Zheng Ping,Abstract The cell-free supernatants from Raji and U937 cells exposed to Clq for 24 hourscontained IL-1 inhibitory activity in the IL-1-augmented murine thymocyte assay; in which theactive component was IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-lra); as evidenced by the facts that anti-rIL-lra antibody could recognize a protein molecule of 22-24KD and neutralize the IL-1inhibitory activity in the supernatants. Clq induced IL-lra production by these cells in aspecific; dose-dependent and saturable manner. The data indicate that the Clq/ClqR systemmediates IL-lra generation; suggesting that it may play an important role in the modulation ofthe inflammation; immune response and cytokine network.,Journal of immunology,1996,*
Scale-translation filtering for wideband correlated noise attenuation,Feng Bao; Nurgun Erdol; Zajing Chen,Conventional filtering techniques do not perform satisfactorily in improving the signal-to-noiseratio of short time-duration; wide-band signals in correlated noise; largely due to the fact thatthe signal and noise are not "separable" in the frequency domain. The term "separable" has beendefined in and is a measure of overlap of the Fourier transforms of the signals underconsideration. The conventional method uses whitening of the noise with subsequent matchedfiltering which requires more knowledge about the noise than is often available. When the signalunder consideration exhibits some periodicity and hence can be described as a sparse trainof pulse-like signals of random arrival time; then time-frequency filtering techniques 2;3;6;7;8;9;10result in improved signal-to- noise ratios. In this paper; we introduce a novel idea ofscale-translation filtering based on the orthonormal wavelet transform.,Wavelet Applications II,1995,*

Study on phase-formation mechamism and intergrowth for Bi (Pb)-Sr-Ca-Cu-O system,Xianhui Chen; Yitai Qian; Chun Lin,Abstract In this paper; the phase-formation mechanism of Bi-based superconductors wassystematically investigated by using high-temperature X-ray diffraction; differential thermalanalysis (DTA) and crystallization of amorphous state. The transformations among Bi-based2201; 2212 and 2223 phases were observed; and the intergrown phenomenon of the 2201;2212 and 2223 phases was explained. It was proposed that there exist a compositionequilibrium between 2212 phase and Ca_ (2) CuO_ (3) and a competition of thermodynamicstability among Ca_ (2) CuO_ (3); 2212 and 2223 phases. This is why it is difficult to preparethe 2223 phase. After Pb was doped in Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O system; Ca_ (2) CuO_ (3) phase inthe Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O system was replaced by Ca_ (2) PbO_ (4); so that the compositionequilibrium and competition of thermodynamic stability mentioned above were avoided.,Science in China.

Interaction between vector solitons and solitonic gluons,Zhigang Chen; R Segev; Elena A Ostrovskaya; Yuri S Kivshar,Summary form only given. It is well known that interaction between two coherent brightsolitons can be either attractive or repulsive depending on their relative phase; whereasinteractions between two dark solitons is always repulsive. Surprisingly; we find that theseinteractions can change dramatically when each soliton itself is involved in formation ofvector solitons; which interact and generate multi-component bound states (compositesolitons). In particular; the repulsion between two dark solitons in a self-defocusing mediumcan be suppressed once they team up with two out-of-phase bright beams. In fact; these fourcomponents form two vector solitons and are all glued together due to balance betweenrepulsion of dark components and attraction of bright components. Such vector-solitoninteraction is different from interaction between fundamental one component scalar …,Quantum Electronics and Laser Science Conference; 1999. QELS'99. Technical Digest.

Curved and self-healing electric discharges,Matteo Clerici; Yi Hu; Philippe Lassonde; Carles Milián; Arnaud Couairon; Demetrios N Christodoulides; Zhigang Chen; Luca Razzari; François Vidal; François Légaré; Daniele Faccio; Roberto Morandotti,Electric discharges play an important role in daily life; eg; in combustion engines. They arealso crucial to several modern technologies; such as micromachining1; 2 and pollutioncontrol. 3 The possibility of harnessing lightning—the most impressive manifestation of anelectric discharge—is a fascinating idea. For several reasons (eg; the natural beauty oflightning; the intriguing physics associated with its formation; and the number of potentialapplications); investigating ways to tame electric discharges is an active area of research.Intense laser beams can be used to trigger and guide electric discharges in air. This ispossible because of a laser's capability to ionize air molecules. The air then becomesheated; which causes a reduction in the breakdown voltage. A path of least resistance—which the discharge follows—is also created. This concept of guiding electric discharges …,*,*,*

Small-scale controlled discharges find relevantindustrial applications; eg in cutting and milling; and are also investigated as a mean tocontrol gas flows and pollution.Since the seventies; it has been realized that intense laserpulses may trigger and guide electric discharges [1]; and ground breaking experimentalresults started to appear few years later (see eg [2–4] and references therein).

PROOF COPY [57713] 014507JOB,Zhigang Chen; Hector Martin; Anna Bezryadina; Dragomir Neshev; Yuri S Kivshar; Demetrios N Christodoulides,We investigate experimentally the propagation of fundamental Gaussian beams and vorticesin a twodimensional photonic lattice optically induced with partially coherent light. We focuson soliton–lattice interactions and vortex–lattice interactions when the lattice is operated in anonlinear regime. In this case a host of novel phenomena is demonstrated including soliton-induced lattice dislocation–deformation; soliton hopping and slow-down; and creation ofstructures akin to optical polarons. In addition; we observe that the nonlinear interactionbetween a vortex beam and a solitonic lattice leads to lattice twisting due to a transfer of theangular momentum carried by the vortex beam to the lattice. Results demonstrating a cleartransition from discrete diffraction to the formation of two-dimensional; discrete fundamentaland vortex solitons in a linear lattice are also included.© 2005 Optical Society of America …,*,*,*
