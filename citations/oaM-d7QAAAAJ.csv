The TSIMMIS approach to mediation: Data models and languages,Hector Garcia-Molina; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Dallan Quass; Anand Rajaraman; Yehoshua Sagiv; Jeffrey Ullman; Vasilis Vassalos; Jennifer Widom,Abstract TSIMMIS—The Stanford-IBM Manager of Multiple InformationSources—is a systemfor integrating information. It offers a datamodel and a common query language that aredesigned to support thecombining of information from many different sources. It alsoofferstools for generating automatically the components that are needed tobuild systems forintegrating information. In this paper we shalldiscuss the principal architectural features andtheir rationale.,Journal of intelligent information systems,1997,1114
Template-based wrappers in the TSIMMIS system,Joachim Hammer; Hector Garcia-Molina; Svetlozar Nestorov; Ramana Yerneni; Marcus Breunig; Vasilis Vassalos,Abstract In order to access information from a variety of heterogeneous information sources;one has to be able to translate queries and data from one data model into another. Thisfunctionality is provided by so-called (source) wrappers [4; 8] which convert queries into oneor more commands/queries understandable by the underlying source and transform thenative results into a format understood by the application. As part of the TSIMMIS project [1;6] we have developed hard-coded wrappers for a variety of sources (eg; Sybase DBMS;WWW pages; etc.) including legacy systems (Folio). However; anyone who has built awrapper before can attest that a lot of effort goes into developing and writing such a wrapper.In situations where it is important or desirable to gain access to new sources quickly; this is amajor drawback. Furthermore; we have also observed that only a relatively small part of …,ACM Sigmod Record,1997,348
Incremental maintenance for materialized views over semistructured data,Serge Abiteboul; Jason McHugh; Michael Rys; Vasilis Vassalos; Janet Wiener,Semistructured data is not strictly typed like relational or object-oriented data and may beirregular or incomplete. It often arises in practice; eg; when heterogeneous data sources areintegrated or data is taken from the World Wide Web. Views over semistructured data can beused to filter the data and to restructure (or provide structure to) it. To achieve fast queryresponse time; these views are often materialized. This paper studies incrementalmaintenance techniques for materialized views over semistructured data. We use the graph-based data model OEM and the query language Lorel; developed at Stanford; as theframework for our work. We propose a new algorithm that produces a set of queries thatcompute the changes to the view based upon a change to the source. We develop ananalytic cost model and compare the cost of executing our incremental maintenance …,*,1998,209
Query rewriting for semistructured data,Yannis Papakonstantinou; Vasilis Vassalos,Abstract We address the problem of query rewriting for TSL; a language for queryingsemistructured data. We develop and present an algorithm that; given a semistructuredquery q and a set of semistructured views V; finds rewriting queries; ie; queries that accessthe views and produce the same result as q. Our algorithm is based on appropriatelygeneralizing containment mappings; the chase; and query composition—techniques thatwere developed for structured; relational data. We also develop an algorithm forequivalence checking of TSL queries. We show that the algorithm is sound and complete forTSL; ie; it always finds every non-trivial TSL rewriting query of q; and we discuss itscomplexity. We extend the rewriting algorithm to use some forms of structural constraints(such as DTDs) and find more opportunities for query rewriting.,In Proc. of the ACM SIGMOD Int.

Capability based mediation in TSIMMIS,Chen Li; Ramana Yerneni; Vasilis Vassalos; Hector Garcia-Molina; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Jeffrey Ullman; Murty Valiveti,The TSIMMIS system [l] integrates data from multiple het-erogeneous sources and providesusers with seamless integrated views of the data. It translates a user query on the integratedviews into a set of source queries and postprocessing steps that compute the answer to theuser query from the results of the source queries. TSIMMIS uses a mediation architecture[ll]to accomplish this (Figure 1).,ACM SIGMOD Record,1998,169
Describing and using query capabilities of heterogeneous sources,Vasilis Vassalos; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Information integration systems have to cope with the different and limited query interfaces ofthe underlying information sources. First; the integration systems need descriptions of thequery capabilities of each source; ie; the set of queries supported by each source. Second;the integration systems need algorithms for deciding how a query can be answered giventhe capabilities of the sources. Third; they need to translate a query into the format that thesource understands. We present two languages suitable for descriptions of querycapabilities of sources and compare their expressive power. We also describe algorithms fordeciding whether a query" matches" the description and show their application to theproblem of translating user queries into source-specific queries and commands.

Views for semistructured data,Serge Abiteboul; Roy Goldman; Jason McHugh; Vasilis Vassalos; Yue Zhuge,Defining a view over a semistructured database introduces many new problems.

The two main approaches; query rewriting and viewmaterialization; are outlined with focus on the diffcult problems caused by the semistructurednature of the data.,*,1997,98
QURSED: querying and reporting semistructured data,Yannis Papakonstantinou; Michalis Petropoulos; Vasilis Vassalos,Abstract QURSED enables the development of web-based query forms and reports (QFRs)that query and report semistructured XML data; ie; data that are characterized by nesting;irregularities and structural variance. The query aspects of a QFR are captured by its queryset specification; which formally encodes multiple parameterized condition fragments andcan describe large numbers of queries. The run-time component of QURSED producesXQuery-compliant queries by synthesizing fragments from the query set specification thathave been activated during the interaction of the end-user with the QFR. The design-timecomponent of QURSED; called QURSED Editor; semi-automates the development of thequery set specification and its association with the visual components of the QFR bytranslating visual actions into appropriate query set specifications. We describe QURSED …,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2002,76
Expressive capabilities description languages and query rewriting algorithms,Vasilis Vassalos; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Abstract Information integration systems have to cope with a wide variety of differentinformation sources; which support query interfaces with very varied capabilities. To dealwith this problem; the integration systems need descriptions of the query capabilities of eachsource; ie; the set of queries supported by each source. Moreover; the integration systemsneed algorithms for deciding how a query can be answered given the capabilities of thesources. Finally; they need to translate a query into the format that the source understands.We present two languages suitable for descriptions of query capabilities of sources andcompare their expressive power. We also use one of the languages to automatically derivethe capabilities description of the integration system itself; in terms of the capabilities of thesources it integrates.

Architecture and implementation of an XQuery-based information integration platform,Yannis Papakonstantinou; Vasilis Vassalos,Abstract An increasing number of business users and software applications need to processinformation that is accessible via multiple diverse information systems; such as databasesystems; file systems; legacy applications or web services. We describe the Enosys XMLIntegration Platform (EXIP); a commercial XQuery-based data integration software platformthat provides a queryable integrated view of such information. We describe the platformarchitecture and describe what the main principles and challenges are for the query engine.In particular; we discuss the query engine architecture and the underlying semistructuredalgebra; which is tuned for enabling query plan optimizations.,IEEE Data Eng.

Xpath on steroids: exploiting relational engines for xpath performance,Haris Georgiadis; Vasilis Vassalos,Abstract A lot of research has been conducted by the database community on methods andtechniques for efficient XPath processing; with great success. Despite the progress made;significant opportunities for optimization of XPath still exist. One key to further improvementsis to utilize more effectively existing facilities of relational RDBSes for the processing ofXPath queries. After taking a comprehensive look at such facilities; we present techniquesfor XPath processing that work by identifying the best relational join algorithms; indices andfile organization strategies for XPath queries. Our techniques both reduce the latency of theresulting SQL translations and guarantee their pipelined execution. We also propose a newtechnique for XML reconstruction from relations-mapped XML that" splits the difference"between schema-aware and schema-oblivious XML-to-relational mapping for a …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,40
XML queries and algebra in the Enosys integration platform,Yannis Papakonstantinou; Vinayak Borkar; Maxim Orgiyan; Kostas Stathatos; Lucian Suta; Vasilis Vassalos; Pavel Velikhov,Abstract We describe the Enosys XML integration platform; focusing on the query language;algebra; and architecture of its query processor. The platform enables the development ofeBusiness applications in customer relationship management; e-commerce; supply chainmanagement; and decision support. These applications often require that data be integrateddynamically from multiple information sources. The Enosys platform allows one to build(virtual and/or materialized) integrated XML views of multiple sources; using XML queries asview definitions. During run-time; the application issues XML queries against the views.Queries and views are translated into the XCQL algebra and are combined into a singlealgebra expression/plan. Query plan composition and query plan decomposition challengesare faced in this process. Finally; the query processor lazily evaluates the result; using an …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2003,37
System for querying markup language data stored in a relational database according to markup language schema,*,A data processing system receives data in a first format utilizing a markup language such aseXtensible Markup Language (XML); and stores the data in a different; relational databaseformat involving multiple tables and columns; etc. The system translates subsequent queryinput expressed in the first format to prepare representative query instructions in SQL oranother query language compatible with relational data; and thereafter executes theprepared instructions upon data in the relational database.

Efficient XQuery rewriting using multiple views,Ioana Manolescu; Konstantinos Karanasos; Vasilis Vassalos; Spyros Zoupanos,We consider the problem of rewriting XQuery queries using multiple materialized XQueryviews. The XQuery dialect we use to express views and queries corresponds to tree patterns(returning data from several nodes; at different granularities; ranging from node identifiers tofull XML subtrees) with value joins. We provide correct and complete algorithms for findingminimal rewritings; in which no view is redundant. Our work extends the state of the art byconsidering more flexible views than the mostly XPath 1.0 dialects previously considered;and more powerful rewritings. We implemented our algorithms and assess theirperformance through a set of experiments.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,34
Another outlier bites the dust: Computing meaningful aggregates in sensor networks,Antonios Deligiannakis; Yannis Kotidis; Vasilis Vassalos; Vassilis Stoumpos; Alex Delis,Recent work has demonstrated that readings provided by commodity sensor nodes are oftenof poor quality. In order to provide a valuable sensory infrastructure for monitoringapplications; we first need to devise techniques that can withstand" dirty" and unreliable dataduring query processing. In this paper we present a novel aggregation framework thatdetects suspicious measurements by outlier nodes and refrains from incorporating suchmeasurements in the computed aggregate values. We consider different definitions of anoutlier node; based on the notion of a user-specified minimum support; and discusstechniques for properly routing messages in the networkin order to reduce the bandwidthconsumption and the energy drain during the query evaluation.

XML query forms (XQForms): Declarative specification of XML query interfaces,Michalis Petropoulos; Vasilis Vassalos; Yannis Papakonstantinou,ABSTRACT XQForms is the first generator of Web-based query forms and reports for XMLdata. XQForms takes as input (i) XML Schemas that model the data to be queried andpresented;(ii) declarative specifications; called annotations; of the logic of the query formsand reports that will be generated; and (iii) a set of template presentation libraries. Theoutput is a set of query forms and reports that provide automated query construction andreport formatting in order for the end users to query and browse the underlying XML data.Thus XQForms separates content (given by the XML Schema of the data); query form logic(specified by the annotations) and presentation of the forms and reports.

Graphical query interfaces for semistructured data: the QURSED system,Michalis Petropoulos; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Vasilis Vassalos,Abstract We describe the QURSED system for the declarative specification and automaticgeneration of Web-based query forms and reports (QFRs) for semistructured XML data. InQURSED; a QFR is formally described by its query set specification (QSS) which capturesthe complex query and reporting capabilities of the QFR and the associations of the queryset specification with visual elements that implement these capabilities on a Web page.

Using knowledge of redundancy for query optimization in mediators,Vasilis Vassalos; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Many autonomous and heterogeneous information sources are becoming increasinglyavailable to users through the Internet; especially through the World Wide Web. In order tomake the information available in a consolidated; uniform; and efficient manner; it isnecessary to integrate the different information sources. The integration of Internet sourcesposes several challenges that have not been sufficiently addressed by work on theintegration of corporate databases residing on an Intranet [LMR90]. We believe that the mostimportant ones are heterogeneity; large number of sources; redundancy; availability; sourceautonomy; and diverse access methods and querying interfaces.,Proc. of the AAAI Symposium on AI and Data Integration,1998,28
Materialized view selection for XQuery workloads,Asterios Katsifodimos; Ioana Manolescu; Vasilis Vassalos,Abstract The efficient processing of XQuery still poses significant challenges. A particularlyeffective technique to improve XQuery processing performance consists of usingmaterialized views to answer queries. In this work; we consider the problem of choosing thebest views to materialize within a given space budget in order to improve the performance ofa query workload. The paper is the first to address the view selection problem for queriesand views with value joins and multiple return nodes. The challenges we face stem from theexpressive power and features of both the query and view languages and from the size ofthe search space of candidate views to materialize. While the general problem hasprohibitive complexity; we propose and study a heuristic algorithm and demonstrate itssuperior performance compared to the state of the art.,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,27
Semi-streamed index join for near-real time execution of ETL transformations,Mihaela A Bornea; Antonios Deligiannakis; Yannis Kotidis; Vasilis Vassalos,Active data warehouses have emerged as a new business intelligence paradigm wheredata in the integrated repository is refreshed in near real-time. This shift of practicesachieves higher consistency between the stored information and the latest updates; which inturn influences crucially the output of decision making processes. In this paper we focus onthe changes required in the implementation of Extract Transform Load (ETL) operationswhich now need to be executed in an online fashion. In particular; the ETL transformationsfrequently include the join between an incoming stream of updates and a disk-resident tableof historical data or metadata.

Modelling real p2p networks: The effect of altruism,Dimitrios K Vassilakis; Vasilis Vassalos,We develop a model of the interaction of rational peers in an incentive-free peer-to-peer(P2P) network and use game theoretic analysis to derive results about peer and networkbehavior. We calculate and discuss Nash equilibria and predict peer behavior in terms ofindividual contribution. At the heart of our model is altruism; an intrinsic parameter reflectingpeers inherent willingness to contribute. Two different approaches for modelling altruisticbehavior and its attendant benefit are introduced and discussed. We consider the cases ofP2P networks of peers that (i) have homogeneous altruism levels or (ii) have heterogeneousaltruism levels; but with known probability distributions. We find that; under the effects ofaltruism; a substantial fraction of peers will contribute when altruism levels are within certainintervals; even though no incentive mechanism is used.

Two-phase schema matching in real world relational databases,Nikolaos Bozovic; Vasilis Vassalos,We propose a new approach to the problem of schema matching in relational databases thatmerges the hybrid and composite approach of combining multiple individual matchingtechniques. In particular; we propose assigning individual matchers to twocategories;“strong” matchers that provide apriori higher quality matches; and “weak”matchers that may be more sensitive to the inputs and are less reliable but can still helpgenerate some matches. Matching is correspondingly done in two phases; with strong“matches” being produced by strong matchers being combined using a simple votingcombiner; and weak matchers providing additional evidence for attributes left unmatched(again using a voting combiner).

On equivalence and rewriting of XPath queries using views under DTD constraints,Pantelis Aravogliadis; Vasilis Vassalos,Abstract It has long been recognized that query rewriting techniques are important tools forquery optimization and semantic caching and are at the heart of data integration systems. Inparticular; the problem of rewriting queries using view definitions has received a lot ofattention in these contexts. At the same time; the XPath language has become very popularfor processing XML data; and there is much recent progress in semantic XPath optimizationproblems; such as XPath containment; and; more recently; XPath rewriting using views. Inthis paper we address the open problems of finding equivalent query rewritings using viewsfor XPath queries and views that include the child; predicate and wildcard features (ie; theyare in XP (/;[];*)) under DTD constraints. In the process; we also develop novel containmenttests for queries in XP (/;[];*) under DTD constraints.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2011,7
Efficient physical operators for cost-based XPath execution,Haris Georgiadis; Minas Charalambides; Vasilis Vassalos,Abstract The creation of a generic and modular query optimization and processinginfrastructure can provide significant benefits to XML data management. Key pieces of suchan infrastructure are the physical operators that are available to the execution engine; to turnqueries into execution plans. Such operators; to be efficient; need to implementsophisticated algorithms for logical XPath or XQuery operations. Moreover; to enable a cost-based optimizer to choose among them correctly; it is also necessary to provide cost modelsfor such operator implementations. In this paper we present two novel families of algorithmsfor XPath physical operators; called LookUp (LU) and Sort-Merge-based (SM); along withdetailed cost models. Our algorithms have significantly better performance compared toexisting techniques over any one of a variety of different XML storage systems that …,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2010,7
DAIMON: data integration for a mobile network,Constantinos V Katsaros; Ioannis L Niarhos; Vasilis Vassalos,Abstract We describe the DAIMON system for data integration of nomadic data. DAIMON isbased on an extension of the mediator-wrapper architecture; where each node is a mediatorof its own information and information from its neighbouring nodes. We describe the overallarchitecture; including our lightweight peer location and neighbourhood identificationscheme; cache management strategy and query processing and execution architecture; andshow how it addresses the challenges of the wireless environment. We introduceconnectivity profiles for mobile peers to capture their different connectivity; availability andaccessibility patterns; and we describe how they can be used to guide query processing andoptimization decisions by the mediator module of the mobile peers. The implementation ofthe DAIMON system is also discussed.,Proceedings of the 4th ACM international workshop on Data engineering for wireless and mobile access,2005,6
Inconsistency resolution in online databases,Yannis Katsis; Alin Deutsch; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Vasilis Vassalos,Shared online databases allow community members to collaboratively maintain knowledge.Collaborative editing though inevitably leads to inconsistencies as different members entererroneous data or conflicting opinions. Ideally community members should be able to seeand resolve these inconsistencies in a collaborative fashion. However most current onlinedatabases do not support inconsistency resolution. Instead they try to by-pass the problemby either ignoring inconsistencies and treating data as if they were not conflicting or byrequiring inconsistencies to be resolved outside the system. To address this limitation; wepropose Ricolla; an online database system that; by treating inconsistencies as first-classcitizens; supports a natural workflow for the management of conflicting data. The systemcaptures inconsistencies (so that community members can easily inspect them) and …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,5
Answering queries using views,Vasilis Vassalos,1. Software non-determinism: A software system is non-deterministic if; when re-executed; itresults in a different execution path than a prior execution. Non-determinism can arise when;for example; paths are determined by relative processor speed or the sequence of externalevents. Such software bugs have been called ''Heisenbugs''(hard failures being ''Bohrbugs'').2. Soft hardware failures: Hardware can also suffer from ''Heisenbugs.''For example; atransient hardware failure may be triggered by an environmental cause; such as a cosmicray changing a memory bit; etc. 3. Operator failures: Systems occasionally require operatorintervention. Operators; being human; make mistakes. An operator is unlikely to make thesame mistake at the same point in a subsequent execution.,*,2009,5
Describing and using query capabilities of heterogeneous sources (extended version),Vasilis Vassalos; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Abstract Information integration systems have to cope with the di erent and limited queryinterfaces of the underlying information sources. First; the integration systems needdescriptions of the query capabilities of each source; ie; the set of queries supported by eachsource. Second; the integration systems need algorithms for deciding how a query can beanswered given the capabilities of the sources. Third; they need to translate a query into theformat that the source understands. We present two languages suitable for descriptions ofquery capabilities of sources and compare their expressive power. We also describealgorithms for deciding whether a query\matches" the description and show their applicationto the problem of translating user queries into source-speci c queries and commands.Finally; we propose new improved algorithms for the problem of answering queries using …,Technical Report,1997,5

Keywords-To-SPARQL translation for RDF data search and exploration,Katerina Gkirtzou; Kostis Karozos; Vasilis Vassalos; Theodore Dalamagas,Abstract Linked Data is the most common practice for publishing and sharing information inthe Data Web. As new data become available; their exploration is a fundamental steptowards integration and interoperability. However; typical search methods as SPARQLqueries require knowing both the SPARQL syntax and the vocabulary used in the data. Forthis reason; keyword-based search has been proposed; allowing an intuitive way forsearching an RDF dataset. In this paper; we present a novel approach for keyword searchon graph-structured data; and in particular temporal RDF graph; ie RDF data that involvetemporal properties. Our method; instead of providing answers directly from the RDF datagraph; automatically generates a set of candidate SPARQL queries that try to capture usersinformation need as expressed by the keywords used.

For identical processors; we present LP-based O (1)-approximation algorithms; while for unrelated processors the approximation ratio naturallydepends on the maximum number of rounds of any job (a small constant in practice). For thesingle-round case; we substantially improve on previously best known approximation ratiosfor both identical and unrelated processors.

Generating Query Forms and Reports for Semistructured Data: The QURSED Editor,Yannis Papakonstantinou; Michalis Petropoulos; Vasilis Vassalos,Abstract. The wide adoption of semistructured XML databases requires the existence ofsystems for the generation and execution of web-based interactive database query formsand reports. Such systems are most effective when they allow the construction of the queryforms and reports without programming; via the use of intuitive graphical tools. We describethe architecture of the QURSED system for the declarative specification and automaticgeneration of web-based query forms and reports (QFRs) for semistructured XML data. Wethen focus on the QURSED Editor; a powerful GUI tool for the generation of the declarativespecifications of QFRs. We describe the Editor's architecture and present the techniques andheuristics the Editor employs for translating visual designer input into meaningfulspecifications of query forms and reports.

Query rewriting for semistructured data (extended version),Yannis Papakonstantinou; Vasilis Vassalos,We address the problem of query rewriting for TSL; a language for querying semistructureddata. We develop and present an algorithm that; given a semistructured query $ q $ and aset of semistructured views ${\cal V} $; finds rewriting queries; ie; queries that access theviews and produce the same result as $ q $. Our algorithm is based on appropriatelygeneralizing containment mappings; the chase; and query composition--techniques thatwere developed for structured; relational data. We also develop an algorithm forequivalence checking of TSL queries. We show that the algorithm is sound and complete forTSL; ie; it always finds every non-trivial TSL rewriting query of $ q $; and we discuss itscomplexity. We extend the rewriting algorithm to use some forms of structural constraints(such as DTDs) and find more opportunities for query rewriting,*,1998,2
Rewriting minimisations for efficient ontology-based query answering,Tassos Venetis; Giorgos Stoilos; Vasilis Vassalos,Computing a (Union of Conjunctive Queries-UCQ) rewriting R for an input query andontology and evaluating it over the given dataset is a prominent approach to queryanswering over ontologies.

Two Phase User Driven Schema Matching,Nick Bozovic; Vasilis Vassalos,Abstract In recent years it has become apparent that schema matching is a labor intensiveprocess that is very costly in resources; this has led to the development of various automatedtools to substitute the human experts involved in it. To this end we propose two new ideas.The first is the separation of matching techniques into strong and weak ones; in what we calltwo phase schema matching. The second is using information a human expert can provideto the system during the process of schema matching; that is used to determine how tocombine the various matching techniques. A system encompassing both our ideas is easilytunable and allows the human expert to become part of the matching process and help thesystem choose the best techniques to use. In extensive experiments we demonstrate thatthis approach is better than contemporary state of the art systems in relational databases …,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2015,1

A Framework and Positive Results for Query Answering over Inconsistent Description Logic Knowledge Bases,Despoina Trivela; Giorgos Stoilos; Vasilis Vassalos,Answering queries over inconsistent DL knowledge bases has recently received significantattention [4; 2; 6]. Inconsistency-tolerant semantics; like the IAR semantics; have beenproposed as means to compute meaningful query answers. So far; query answering underthe IAR semantics has mostly been studied over lightweight DLs like DL-Lite; while theproblem is coNP-hard wrt data complexity; already in cL⊥[5]. In our work we study IAR-answering over DL ontologies and identify positive tractability results. We provide a generalalgorithm which applies to arbitrary DLs but need not terminate. If it terminates; then theoutput is a datalog-program extended with negative body atoms; which can be evaluatedover the dataset to obtain the IAR-answers. Our algorithm and analysis help us pinpoint themain reason for the difficulty of IAR-answering and hence we were next able to devise a …,*,*,*

While users may believein conflicting facts (due to conflicting sources; measurements or opinions); current onlinedatabases do not offer support for the management of data conflicts. Thus online databasescould clearly benefit from technology for uncertain/incomplete databases. However; priorworks on uncertain databases are of limited help when designing a conflict-aware onlinedatabase; for two reasons: First; their performance degrades rapidly as the number ofconflicting facts escalates; which can be the case in large user communities. Second; theywere built as storage models; resulting in data models that are either non-simple or non-compact and thus may require additional; often non-trivial processing before they appear …,*,*,*

Conflict Resolution in Online Databases,Yannis Katsis; Alin Deutsch; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Vasilis Vassalos,ABSTRACT Shared online databases; such as Google Fusion Tables or Quickbase; allownon-programmer community members to collaboratively maintain and browse data. Whilecommunity members may believe in conflicting facts (due to conflicting sources;measurements or opinions); current online databases do not yet offer support for themanagement of data conflicts. Ricolla is a novel online database that treats data conflicts asfirst-class citizens. Unlike prior work in uncertain databases; which was made to provide adatabase back-end to application logic; Ricolla is tuned to the requirements of the onlinedatabase paradigm; allowing intuitive visualization of conflicts and collaborative dataediting/conflict resolution. The proposed end-to-end system makes the followingcontributions: a) an online database paradigm that captures conflicts; allowing data query …,*,*,*
Rewriting XPath queries using views in the presence of a DTD,Pantelis Aravogliadis; Vasilis Vassalos,ABSTRACT It has long been recognized that query rewriting techniques are important toolsfor query optimization and semantic caching and are at the heart of data integration systems.In particular; the problem of rewriting queries using view definitions has received a lot ofattention in these contexts. At the same time; the XPath language has become very popularfor processing XML data; and there is much recent progress in semantic XPath optimizationproblems; such as XPath containment; and; more recently; XPath rewiring using views. Inthis paper we address the open problems of finding equivalent query rewritings using viewsfor various interesting subsets of XPath in the presence of DTDs. In particular; we developsound and complete algorithms for query rewriting using views for XPath queries and viewsthat include the child; descendant and predicate features (ie; they belong to XP (/;//;[])) …,*,*,*

The QURSED System,Michalis Petropoulos; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Vasilis Vassalos,Abstract QURSED enables the development of web-based query forms and reports (QFRs)that query and report semistructured XML data; ie; data that are characterized by nesting;irregularities and structural variance. The query aspects of a QFR are captured by its queryset specification; which formally encodes multiple parameterized; possibly interdependentcondition fragments and can describe large numbers of queries. The run-time component ofQURSED produces XQuery-compliant queries by synthesizing fragments from the query setspecification that have been activated during the interaction of the end-user with the QFR.The design-time component of QURSED; called QURSED Editor; semiautomates thedevelopment of the query set specification and its association with the visual components ofthe QFR and guides the development of meaningful dependencies between condition …,*,*,*
