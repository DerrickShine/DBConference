Fine-grained private matching for proximity-based mobile social networking,Rui Zhang; Yanchao Zhang; Jinyuan Sun; Guanhua Yan,Proximity-based mobile social networking (PMSN) refers to the social interaction amongphysically proximate mobile users directly through the Bluetooth/WiFi interfaces on theirsmartphones or other mobile devices. It becomes increasingly popular due to the recentlyexplosive growth of smartphone users. Profile matching means two users comparing theirpersonal profiles and is often the first step towards effective PMSN. It; however; conflicts withusers' growing privacy concerns about disclosing their personal profiles to completestrangers before deciding to interact with them.

TIGHT: A geographic routing protocol for cognitive radio mobile ad hoc networks,Xiaocong Jin; Rui Zhang; Jingchao Sun; Yanchao Zhang,This paper presents TIGHT; a geographic routing protocol for cognitive radio mobile ad hocnetworks. TIGHT offers three routing modes and allows secondary users to fully explore thetransmission opportunities over a primary channel without affecting primary users (PUs). Thegreedy mode routes a packet via greedy geographic forwarding until a PU region isencountered and then further routes the packet around the PU region to where greedyforwarding can resume. It works best when the PUs are only occasionally active. In contrast;the optimal and suboptimal modes route a packet along optimal and suboptimal trajectoriesto the destination; respectively. They work best when the PUs are active most of the time.The suboptimal mode is computationally more efficient than the optimal mode at the cost ofusing suboptimal trajectories in rare cases.

Experiments aredesigned to simulate the real world cases and results demonstrate that our solution isefficient and feasible for current air traffic management.,Communications and Network Security (CNS); 2016 IEEE Conference on,2016,1
POWERFUL: Mobile app fingerprinting via power analysis,Yimin Chen; Xiaocong Jin; Jingchao Sun; Rui Zhang; Yanchao Zhang,Which apps a mobile user has and how they are used can disclose significant privateinformation about the user. In this paper; we present the design and evaluation ofPOWERFUL; a new attack which can fingerprint sensitive mobile apps (or infer sensitive appusage) by analyzing the power consumption profiles on Android devices. POWERFUL workson the observation that distinct apps and their different usage patterns all lead todistinguishable power consumption profiles. Since the power profiles on Android devicesrequire no permission to access; POWERFUL is very difficult to detect and can pose aserious threat against user privacy. Extensive experiments involving popular and sensitiveapps in Google Play Store show that POWERFUL can identify the app used at any particulartime with accuracy up to 92.9%; demonstrating the feasibility of POWERFUL.,INFOCOM 2017-IEEE Conference on Computer Communications; IEEE,2017,*
Verifiable social data outsourcing,Xin Yao; Rui Zhang; Yanchao Zhang; Yaping Lin,Social data outsourcing is an emerging paradigm for effective and efficient access to thesocial data. In such a system; a third-party Social Data Provider (SDP) purchases completesocial datasets from Online Social Network (OSN) operators and then resells them to dataconsumers who can be any individuals or entities desiring the complete social datasatisfying some criteria. The SDP cannot be fully trusted and may return wrong query resultsto data consumers by adding fake data and deleting/modifying true data in favor of thebusinesses willing to pay. In this paper; we initiate the study on verifiable social dataoutsourcing whereby a data consumer can verify the trustworthiness of the social datareturned by the SDP. We propose three schemes for verifiable queries over outsourcedsocial data. The three schemes all require the OSN provider to generate some …,INFOCOM 2017-IEEE Conference on Computer Communications; IEEE,2017,*
Your face your heart: Secure mobile face authentication with photoplethysmograms,Yimin Chen; Jingchao Sun; Xiaocong Jin; Tao Li; Rui Zhang; Yanchao Zhang,Face authentication emerges as a powerful method for preventing unauthorized access tomobile devices. It is; however; vulnerable to photo-based forgery attacks (PFA) andvideobased forgery attacks (VFA); in which the adversary exploits a photo or videocontaining the user's frontal face. Effective defenses against PFA and VFA often rely onliveness detection; which seeks to find a live indicator that the submitted face photo or videoof the legitimate user is indeed captured in real time. In this paper; we propose FaceHeart; anovel and practical face authentication system for mobile devices. FaceHeart simultaneouslytakes a face video with the front camera and a fingertip video with the rear camera on COTSmobile devices. It then achieves liveness detection by comparing the twophotoplethysmograms independently extracted from the face and fingertip videos; which …,INFOCOM 2017-IEEE Conference on Computer Communications; IEEE,2017,*
Privacy-Preserving Social Media Data Publishing,Jinxue Zhang; Jingchao Sun; Rui Zhang; Yanchao Zhang; Xia Hu,Abstract: User-generated social media data are exploding and also of high demand in publicand private sectors. The disclosure of complete and intact social media data exacerbates thethreats to user privacy. In this paper; we first identify a text-based user-linkage attack oncurrent social media data publishing practices; in which the real users of anonymous IDs ina published dataset can be pinpointed based on the users' unprotected text data. Then wepropose a framework for differentially privacy-preserving social media data publishing forthe first time in literature. Within our framework; social media data service providers canpublish perturbed datasets to provide differential privacy to social media users while offeringhigh data utility to social media data consumers. Our differential privacy mechanism is basedon a novel notion of $\epsilon $-text indistinguishability; which we propose to thwart the …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1701.01900,2017,*
Secure Outsourced Location-Based Skyline Query Processing via Untrusted Cloud Service Providers,Wenxin Chen; Mengjun Liu; Rui Zhang; Yanchao Zhang; Shubo Liu,Abstract—Recent years have witnessed a growing number of location-based serviceproviders (LBSPs) outsourcing their points of interest (POI) datasets to third-party cloudservice providers (CSPs); which in turn answer various data queries from mobile users ontheir behalf. A main challenge in such systems is that the CSPs cannot be fully trusted; whichmay return fake query results for various bad motives; eg; in favor of POIs willing to pay. Asan important type of queries; location-based skyline queries (LBSQ) ask for the POIs that arenot spatially dominated by any other POI with respect to some query position. In this paper;we propose three novel schemes that enable efficient verification of any LBSQ resultreturned by an untrusted CSP by embedding and exploring a novel neighboring relationshipamong POIs. The efficacy and efficiency of our schemes are thoroughly analyzed and …,*,*,*
