CURE: an efficient clustering algorithm for large databases,Sudipto Guha; Rajeev Rastogi; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Clustering; in data mining; is useful for discovering groups and identifyinginteresting distributions in the underlying data. Traditional clustering algorithms either favorclusters with spherical shapes and similar sizes; or are very fragile in the presence ofoutliers. We propose a new clustering algorithm called CURE that is more robust to outliers;and identifies clusters having non-spherical shapes and wide variances in size. CUREachieves this by representing each cluster by a certain fixed number of points that aregenerated by selecting well scattered points from the cluster and then shrinking them towardthe center of the cluster by a specified fraction. Having more than one representative pointper cluster allows CURE to adjust well to the geometry of non-spherical shapes and theshrinking helps to dampen the effects of outliers.

ROCK: A robust clustering algorithm for categorical attributes,Sudipto Guha; Rajeev Rastogi; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Clustering; in data mining; is useful to discover distribution patterns in theunderlying data. Clustering algorithms usually employ a distance metric based (eg;euclidean) similarity measure in order to partition the database such that data points in thesame partition are more similar than points in different partitions. In this paper; we studyclustering algorithms for data with boolean and categorical attributes. We show thattraditional clustering algorithms that use distances between points for clustering are notappropriate for boolean and categorical attributes. Instead; we propose a novel concept oflinks to measure the similarity/proximity between a pair of data points. We develop a robusthierarchical clustering algorithm ROCK that employs links and not distances when mergingclusters. Our methods naturally extend to non-metric similarity measures that are relevant …,Information systems,2000,2130
Efficient algorithms for mining outliers from large data sets,Sridhar Ramaswamy; Rajeev Rastogi; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract In this paper; we propose a novel formulation for distance-based outliers that isbased on the distance of a point from its k th nearest neighbor. We rank each point on thebasis of its distance to its k th nearest neighbor and declare the top n points in this ranking tobe outliers. In addition to developing relatively straightforward solutions to finding suchoutliers based on the classical nested-loop join and index join algorithms; we develop ahighly efficient partition-based algorithm for mining outliers. This algorithm first partitions theinput data set into disjoint subsets; and then prunes entire partitions as soon as it isdetermined that they cannot contain outliers. This results in substantial savings incomputation. We present the results of an extensive experimental study on real-life andsynthetic data sets. The results from a real-life NBA database highlight and reveal several …,ACM Sigmod Record,2000,1727
Fast similarity search in the presence of noise; scaling; and translation in time-series databases,Rake& Agrawal King-lp Lin; Harpreet S Sawhney Kyuseok Shim,Abstract We introduce a new model of similarity of time sequences that captures the intuitivenotion that two sequences should be considered similar if they have enough non-overlapping time-ordered pairs of subsequences thar are similar. The model allows theamplitude of one of the two sequences to be scaled by any suitable amount and its o setadjusted appropriately. Two subsequences are considered similar if one can be enclosedwithin an envelope of a speci ed width drawn around the other. The model also allows non-matching gaps in the matching subsequences. The matching subsequences need not bealigned along the time axis. Given this model of similarity; we present fast search techniquesfor discovering all similar sequences in a set of sequences. These techniques can also beused to nd all sub sequences similar to a given sequence. We applied this matching …,Proceeding of the 21th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases,1995,962
SPIRIT: Sequential pattern mining with regular expression constraints,Minos N Garofalakis; Rajeev Rastogi; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Discovering sequential patterns is an important problem in data mining with a hostof application domains including medicine; telecommunications; and the World Wide Web.Conventional mining systems provide users with only a very restricted mechanism (basedon minimum support) for specifying patterns of interest. In this paper; we propose the use ofRegular Expressions (REs) as a flexible constraint specification tool that enables user-controlled focus to be incorporated into the pattern mining process. We develop a family ofnovel algorithms (termed SPIRIT–Sequential Pattern mIning with Regular expressIonconsTraints) for mining frequent sequential patterns that also satisfy user-specified REconstraints. The main distinguishing factor among the proposed schemes is the degree towhich the RE constraints are enforced to prune the search space of patterns during …,VLDB,1999,646
Approximate query processing using wavelets,Kaushik Chakrabarti; Minos Garofalakis; Rajeev Rastogi; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Approximate query processing has emerged as a cost-effective approach fordealing with the huge data volumes and stringent response-time requirements of today'sdecision support systems (DSS). Most work in this area; however; has so far been limited inits query processing scope; typically focusing on specific forms of aggregate queries.Furthermore; conventional approaches based on sampling or histograms appear to beinherently limited when it comes to approximating the results of complex queries over high-dimensional DSS data sets. In this paper; we propose the use of multi-dimensional waveletsas an effective tool for general-purpose approximate query processing in modern; high-dimensional applications. Our approach is based on building wavelet-coefficient synopsesof the data and using these synopses to provide approximate answers to queries.

APEX: An adaptive path index for XML data,Chin-Wan Chung; Jun-Ki Min; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract The emergence of the Web has increased interests in XML data. XML querylanguages such as XQuery and XPath use label paths to traverse the irregularly structureddata. Without a structural summary and efficient indexes; query processing can be quiteinefficient due to an exhaustive traversal on XML data. To overcome the inefficiency; severalpath indexes have been proposed in the research community. Traditional indexes generallyrecord all label paths from the root element in XML data. Such path indexes may result inperformance degradation due to large sizes and exhaustive navigations for partial matchingpath queries start with the self-or-descendent axis ("//"). In this paper; we propose APEX; anadaptive path index for XML data. APEX does not keep all paths starting from the root andutilizes frequently used paths to improve the query performance.

PUBLIC: A decision tree classifier that integrates building and pruning,Rajeev Rastogi; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Classification is an important problem in data mining. Given a database of records;each with a class label; a classifier generates a concise and meaningful description for eachclass that can be used to classify subsequent records. A number of popular classifiersconstruct decision trees to generate class models. These classifiers first build a decision treeand then prune subtrees from the decision tree in a subsequent pruning phase to improveaccuracy and prevent" overfitting". Generating the decision tree in two distinct phases couldresult in a substantial amount of wasted effort since an entire subtree constructed in the firstphase may later be pruned in the next phase. In this paper; we propose PUBLIC; animproved decision tree classifier that integrates the second" pruning" phase with the initial"building" phase.

Data-streams and histograms,Sudipto Guha; Nick Koudas; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Histograms have been used widely to capture data distribution; to represent thedata by a small number of step functions. Dynamic programming algorithms which provideoptimal construction of these histograms exist; albeit running in quadratic time and linearspace. In this paper we provide linear time construction of 1+ &egr; approximation of optimalhistograms; running in polylogarithmic space. Our results extend to the context of data-streams; and in fact generalize to give 1+ &egr; approximation of several problems in data-streams which require partitioning the index set into intervals. The only assumptionsrequired are that the cost of an interval is monotonic under inclusion (larger interval haslarger cost) and that the cost can be computed or approximated in small space. This exhibitsa nice class of problems for which we can have near optimal data-stream algorithms.,Proceedings of the thirty-third annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing,2001,346
Including group-by in query optimization,Surajit Chaudhuri; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract In existing relational database systems; processing of group-by and computation ofaggregate functions are always postponed until all joins are performed. In this paper; wepresent transformations that make it possible to push group-by operation past one or morejoins and can potentially reduce the cost of processing a query significantly. Therefore; theplacement of group-by should be decided based on cost estimation. We explain how thetraditional System-R style optimizers can be modified by incorporating the greedyconservative heuristic that we developed. We prove that applications of greedy conservativeheuristic produce plans that are better (or no worse) than the plans generated by atraditional optimizer. Our experimental study shows that the extent of improvement in thequality of plans is significant with only a modest increase in optimization cost. Our …,VLDB,1994,332
WALRUS: A similarity retrieval algorithm for image databases,Apostol Natsev; Rajeev Rastogi; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Traditional approaches for content-based image querying typically compute asingle signature for each image based on color histograms; texture; wavelet tranforms etc.;and return as the query result; images whose signatures are closest to the signature of thequery image. Therefore; most traditional methods break down when images contain similarobjects that are scaled differently or at different locations; or only certain regions of theimage match. In this paper; we propose WALRUS (WAveLet-based Retrieval of User-specified Scenes); a novel similarity retrieval algorithm that is robust to scaling andtranslation of objects within an image. WALRUS employs a novel similarity model in whicheach image is first decomposed into its regions; and the similarity measure between a pair ofimages is then defined to be the fraction of the area of the two images covered by …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1999,323
XTRACT: a system for extracting document type descriptors from XML documents,Minos Garofalakis; Aristides Gionis; Rajeev Rastogi; Sridhar Seshadri; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract XML is rapidly emerging as the new standard for data representation and exchangeon the Web. An XML document can be accompanied by a Document Type Descriptor (DTD)which plays the role of a schema for an XML data collection. DTDs contain valuableinformation on the structure of documents and thus have a crucial role in the efficient storageof XML data; as well as the effective formulation and optimization of XML queries. In thispaper; we propose XTRACT; a novel system for inferring a DTD schema for a database ofXML documents. Since the DTD syntax incorporates the full expressive power of regularexpressions; naive approaches typically fail to produce concise and intuitive DTDs. Instead;the XTRACT inference algorithms employ a sequence of sophisticated steps that involve:(1)finding patterns in the input sequences and replacing them with regular expressions to …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2000,321

Mining optimized association rules with categorical and numeric attributes,Rajeev Rastogi; Kyuseok Shim,Mining association rules on large data sets has received considerable attention in recentyears. Association rules are useful for determining correlations between attributes of arelation and have applications in marketing; financial; and retail sectors. Furthermore;optimized association rules are an effective way to focus on the most interestingcharacteristics involving certain attributes. Optimized association rules are permitted tocontain uninstantiated attributes and the problem is to determine instantiations such thateither the support or confidence of the rule is maximized.

Developing Tightly-Coupled Data Mining Applications on a Relational Database System.,Rakesh Agrawal; Kyuseok Shim,Most of the current data mining applications have a loose connection with databases. A majorityof them treat database simply as a container from which data is extracted to populate main memorydata structures before the main execution begins. This approach limits the amount of data theapplication can handle e ec- tively. The more database-aware applications use loosely- coupledSQL to fetch data records as needed by the mining algorithm. The front-end of the applicationis implemented in a host programming language; with embedded SQL statements in it. The applicationuses a SQL select statement to retrieve the set of records of interest from the database. A loopin the applica- tion program copies records in the result set one-by- one from the database addressspace to the applica- tion address space; where computation is performed on them. This approachhas two performance prob- lems: i copying of records from the database address space …,KDD,1996,185
Walrus: A similarity retrieval algorithm for image databases,Apostol Natsev; Rajeev Rastogi; Kyuseok Shim,Approaches for content-based image querying typically extract a single signature from eachimage based on color; texture; or shape features. The images returned as the query resultare then the ones whose signatures are closest to the signature of the query image. Whileefficient for simple images; such methods do not work well for complex scenes since they failto retrieve images that match the query only partially; that is; only certain regions of theimage match. This inefficiency leads to the discarding of images that may be semanticallyvery similar to the query image since they may contain the same objects. The problembecomes even more apparent when we consider scaled or translated versions of the similarobjects. We propose WALRUS (wavelet-based retrieval of user-specified scenes); a novelsimilarity retrieval algorithm that is robust to scaling and translation of objects within an …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2004,172

Approximate algorithms for k-anonymity,Hyoungmin Park; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract When a table containing individual data is published; disclosure of sensitiveinformation should be prohibitive. A naive approach for the problem is to remove identifierssuch as name and social security number. However; linking attacks which joins thepublished table with other tables on some attributes; called quasi-identifier; may reveal thesensitive information. To protect privacy against linking attack; the notion of k-anonymitywhich makes each record in the table be indistinguishable with k-1 other records has beenproposed previously. It is shown to be NP-Hard to k-anonymize a table minimizing thenumber of suppressed cells. To alleviate this; O (k log k)-approximation and O (k)-approximation algorithms were proposed in previous works. In this paper; we proposeseveral approximation algorithms that guarantee O (log k)-approximation ratio and …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,160
Data mining and the Web: past; present and future,Minos N Garofalakis; Rajeev Rastogi; S Seshadri; Kyuseok Shim,The World Wide Web is rapidly emerging as an important medium for transacting commerceas well as for the dissemination of information related to a wide range of topics (eg;business; government; recreation). According to most predictions; the majority of humaninformation will be available on the Web in ten years. These huge amounts of data raise agrand challenge; namely; how to turn the Web into a more useful information utility.Crawlers; search engines and Web directories like Yahoo! constitute the state-of-the-arttools for information retrieval on the Web today. Crawlers for the major search enginesretrieve Web pages on which full-text indexes are constructed.

Query optimization in the presence of foreign functions,Surajit Chaudhuri; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract The declarativeness of relational query languages is very attractive for developingapplications. However; many applications also need to invoke external functions or toaccess data that is not stored in the database. It is not hard to express references to suchforeign functions in the query language. However; the issue of cost-based optimization ofrelational queries in the presence of such foreign functions has not previously beenaddressed satisfactorily. In this paper; we describe a comprehensive approach to thisproblem. Our key observation is that the optimization must take into account semanticinformation about foreign functions. Therefore; we provide a simple declarative rulelanguage to express such semantics. We present algorithms necessary for applying therules and for generating the space of equivalent queries. The equivalent queries provide …,VLDB,1993,144
Parametric query optimization,Yannis E Ioannidis; Raymond T Ng; Kyuseok Shim; Timos K Sellis,Abstract In most database systems; the values of many important run-time parameters of thesystem; the data; or the query are unknown at query optimization time. Parametric queryoptimization attempts to identify several execution plans; each one of which is optimal for asubset of all possible values of the run-time parameters. We present a general formulation ofthis problem and study it primarily for the bu er size parameter. We adopt randomizedalgorithms as the main approach to this style of optimization and enhance them with asideways information passing feature that increases their e ectiveness in the new task.Experimental results of these enhanced algorithms show that they optimize queries for largenumbers of bu er sizes in the same time needed by their conventional versions for a singlebu er size; without much sacri ce in the output quality.,VLDB,1992,134

Approximation and streaming algorithms for histogram construction problems,Sudipto Guha; Nick Koudas; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Histograms and related synopsis structures are popular techniques forapproximating data distributions. These have been successful in query optimization and avariety of applications; including approximate querying; similarity searching; and datamining; to name a few. Histograms were a few of the earliest synopsis structures proposedand continue to be used widely. The histogram construction problem is to construct the besthistogram restricted to a space bound that reflects the data distribution most accuratelyunder a given error measure. The histograms are used as quick and easy estimates. Thus; aslight loss of accuracy; compared to the optimal histogram under the given error measure;can be offset by fast histogram construction algorithms. A natural question arises in thiscontext: Can we find a fast near optimal approximation algorithm for the histogram …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2006,111

REHIST: Relative error histogram construction algorithms,Sudipto Guha; Kyuseok Shim; Jungchul Woo,Abstract Histograms and Wavelet synopses provide useful tools in query optimization andapproximate query answering. Traditional histogram construction algorithms; such as V-Optimal; optimize absolute error measures for which the error in estimating a true value of 10by 20 has the same effect of estimating a true value of 1000 by 1010. However; severalresearchers have recently pointed out the drawbacks of such schemes and proposedwavelet based schemes to minimize relative error measures. None of these schemesprovide satisfactory guarantees-and we provide evidence that the difficulty may lie in thechoice of wavelets as the representation scheme. In this paper; we consider histogramconstruction for the known relative error measures. We develop optimal as well as fastapproximation algorithms.

Improvements on a heuristic algorithm for multiple-query optimization,Kyuseok Shim; Timos Sellis; Dana Nau,Abstract Multiple-query processing has received a lot of attention recently. The problemarises in many areas; such as extended relational database systems and deductivedatabase systems. In this paper we describe a heuristic search algorithm for this problem.This algorithm uses an improved heuristic function that enables it to expand only a smallfraction of the nodes expanded by an algorithm that has been proposed in the past. Inaddition; it handles implied relationships without increasing the size of the search space orthe number of nodes generated in this space. We include both theoretical analysis andexperimental results to demonstrate the utility of the algorithm.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,1994,103
High-dimensional similarity joins,Kyuseok Shim; Ramakrishnan Srikant; Rakesh Agrawal,Many emerging data mining applications require a similarity join between points in a high-dimensional domain. We present a new algorithm that utilizes a new index structure; calledthe/spl epsiv/-kdB tree; for fast spatial similarity joins on high-dimensional points. This indexstructure reduces the number of neighboring leaf nodes that are considered for the join test;as well as the traversal cost of finding appropriate branches in the internal nodes. Thestorage cost for internal nodes is independent of the number of dimensions. Hence theproposed index structure scales to high-dimensional data. Empirical evaluation; usingsynthetic and real-life datasets; shows that similarity join using the/spl epsiv/-kdB tree is 2 toan order of magnitude faster than the R/sup+/tree; with the performance gap increasing withthe number of dimensions.,Data Engineering; 1997.

Method and apparatus for query optimization in a relational database system having foreign functions,*,Database applications typically need to invoke foreign functions or to access data that is notstored in the database. The invention provides a comprehensive approach to cost-basedoptimization of relational queries in the presence of such foreign functions. The optimizationtakes into account semantic information about foreign functions using a declarative rulelanguage (eg; SQL) to express such semantics. Procedures for applying the rewrite rulesand for generating the execution space of equivalent queries are described. Procedures toobtain an optimal plan from this enriched execution space are also described. Moreover;necessary extensions to the cost model that are needed in the presence of foreign functionsare described.,*,1996,99
Optimizing queries with aggregate views,Surajit Chaudhuri; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Complex queries; with aggregates; views and nested subqueries are important indecision-support applications. Such queries are represented as multi-block queries where aquery block may be a view definition containing aggregates or a correlated nestedsubquery. Beyond transformations that propagate predicates across blocks; the problem ofoptimizing such queries has not been addressed adequately. In this paper; we show howsuch queries can be optimized in a cost-based fashion. The crux of our solution is a carefultreatment of group-by and aggregation operators that occur among views.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,1996,93

XTRACT: Learning document type descriptors from XML document collections,Minos Garofalakis; Aristides Gionis; Rajeev Rastogi; Sridhar Seshadri; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract XML is rapidly emerging as the new standard for data representation and exchangeon the Web. Unlike HTML; tags in XML documents describe the semantics of the data andnot how it is to be displayed. In addition; an XML document can be accompanied by aDocument Type Descriptor (DTD) which plays the role of a schema for an XML datacollection. DTDs contain valuable information on the structure of documents and thus have acrucial role in the efficient storage of XML data; as well as the effective formulation andoptimization of XML queries. Despite their importance; however; DTDs are not mandatory;and it is frequently possible that documents in XML databases will not have accompanyingDTDs.

Programmed medium for clustering large databases,*,The present invention relates to a computer method; apparatus and programmed mediumfor clustering large databases. The present invention represents each cluster to be mergedby a constant number of well scattered points that capture the shape and extent of thecluster. The chosen scattered points are shrunk towards the mean of the cluster by ashrinking fraction to form a representative set of data points that efficiently represent thecluster. The clusters with the closest pair of representative points are merged to form a newcluster. The use of an efficient representation of the clusters allows the present invention toobtain improved clustering while efficiently eliminating outliers.,*,2000,65
Text: Automatic template extraction from heterogeneous web pages,Chulyun Kim; Kyuseok Shim,World Wide Web is the most useful source of information. In order to achieve highproductivity of publishing; the webpages in many websites are automatically populated byusing the common templates with contents. The templates provide readers easy access tothe contents guided by consistent structures. However; for machines; the templates areconsidered harmful since they degrade the accuracy and performance of web applicationsdue to irrelevant terms in templates. Thus; template detection techniques have received a lotof attention recently to improve the performance of search engines; clustering; andclassification of web documents. In this paper; we present novel algorithms for extractingtemplates from a large number of web documents which are generated from heterogeneoustemplates. We cluster the web documents based on the similarity of underlying template …,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data Engineering,2011,64
Extending q-grams to estimate selectivity of string matching with low edit distance,Hongrae Lee; Raymond T Ng; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract There are many emerging database applications that require accurate selectivityestimation of approximate string matching queries. Edit distance is one of the mostcommonly used string similarity measures. In this paper; we study the problem of estimatingselectivity of string matching with low edit distance. Our framework is based on extending q-grams with wildcards. Based on the concepts of replacement semi-lattice; string hierarchyand a combinatorial analysis; we develop the formulas for selectivity estimation and providethe algorithm BasicEQ. We next develop the algorithm Opt EQ by enhancing BasicEQ withtwo novel improvements. Finally we show a comprehensive set of experiments using threebenchmarks comparing Opt EQ with the state-of-the-art method SEPIA. Our experimentalresults show that Opt EQ delivers more accurate selectivity estimations.,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,63
Methods of imaging based on wavelet retrieval of scenes,*,Methods of imaging objects based on wavelet retrieval of scenes utilize wavelettransformation of plural defined regions of a query image. By increasing the granularity ofthe query image to greater than one region; accurate feature vectors are obtained that allowfor robust extraction of corresponding regions from a database of target images. Themethods further include the use of sliding windows to decompose the query and targetimages into regions; and the clustering of the regions utilizing a novel similarity metric thatensures robust image matching in low response times.,*,2004,63
XWAVE: optimal and approximate extended wavelets,Sudipto Guha; Chulyun Kim; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Wavelet synopses have been found to be of interest in query optimization andapproximate query answering.

Parametric query optimization,Yannis E Ioannidis; Raymond T Ng; Kyuseok Shim; Timos K Sellis,Abstract. In most database systems; the values of many important run-time parameters of thesystem; the data; or the query are unknown at query optimization time. Parametric queryoptimization attempts to identify at compile time several execution plans; each one of whichis optimal for a subset of all possible values of the run-time parameters. The goal is that atrun time; when the actual parameter values are known; the appropriate plan should beidentifiable with essentially no overhead. We present a general formulation of this problemand study it primarily for the buffer size parameter. We adopt randomized algorithms as themain approach to this style of optimization and enhance them with a sideways informationpassing feature that increases their effectiveness in the new task. Experimental results ofthese enhanced algorithms show that they optimize queries for large numbers of buffer …,The VLDB Journal,1997,61

Mining optimized support rules for numeric attributes,Rajeev Rastogi; Kyuseok Shim,Generalizes the optimized support association rule problem by permitting rules to containdisjunctions over uninstantiated numeric attributes. For rules containing a single numericattribute; we present a dynamic programming algorithm for computing optimized associationrules. Furthermore; we propose a bucketing technique for reducing the input size; and adivide-and-conquer strategy that improves the performance significantly without sacrificingoptimality. Our experimental results for a single numeric attribute indicate that our bucketingand divide-and-conquer enhancements are very effective in reducing the execution timesand memory requirements of our dynamic programming algorithm. Furthermore; they showthat our algorithms scale up almost linearly with the attribute's domain size as well as withthe number of disjunctions.,Data Engineering; 1999.

An overview of cost-based optimization of queries with aggregates,Surajit Chaudhuri; Kyuseok Shim,The optimization problem of Select-Project-Join queries has been studied extensively.However; a problem that has until recently received relatively less attention is that ofoptimizing queries with aggregates. For example; for single block SQL; traditional queryprocessing systems directly implement SQL semantics and defer execution of grouping untilall joins in the FROM and WHERE clauses have been executed. Furthermore; for queriesthat reference views with aggregates; traditional optimizers do not consider flattening suchviews. In this paper; we will show that there is a rich set of execution alternatives that cansignificantly enhance the quality of the plans produced. We also discuss how one canchoose among the alternatives. First; let us consider single-block SQL queries.

However; for many applications; such as business and scientificapplications; quantitative attributes are often recorded in the data; which are ignored byexisting algorithms. Quantity information included in the mined sequential patterns canprovide useful insight to the users. In this paper; we consider the problem of miningsequential patterns with quantities. We demonstrate that naive extensions to existingalgorithms for sequential patterns are inefficient; as they may enumerate the search spaceblindly. To alleviate the situation; we propose hash filtering and quantity samplingtechniques that significantly improve the performance of the naive extensions …,Journal of Systems and Software,2007,48

Similarity join size estimation using locality sensitive hashing,Hongrae Lee; Raymond T Ng; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Similarity joins are important operations with a broad range of applications. In thispaper; we study the problem of vector similarity join size estimation (VSJ). It is ageneralization of the previously studied set similarity join size estimation (SSJ) problem andcan handle more interesting cases such as TF-IDF vectors. One of the key challenges insimilarity join size estimation is that the join size can change dramatically depending on theinput similarity threshold. We propose a sampling based algorithm that uses Locality-Sensitive-Hashing (LSH). The proposed algorithm LSH-SS uses an LSH index to enableeffective sampling even at high thresholds. We compare the proposed technique withrandom sampling and the state-of-the-art technique for SSJ (adapted to VSJ) anddemonstrate LSH-SS offers more accurate estimates throughout the similarity threshold …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,30
Storing XML (with XSD) in SQL databases: Interplay of logical and physical designs,Surajit Chaudhuri; Zhiyuan Chen; Kyuseok Shim; Yuqing Wu,Much of business XML data has accompanying XSD specifications. In many scenarios"shredding" such XML data into a relational storage is a popular paradigm. Optimizingevaluation of XPath queries overmuch XML data requires paying careful attention to both thelogical and physical designs of the relational database where XML data is shredded. Noneof the existing solutions has taken into account physical design of the generated relationaldatabase. In this paper; we study the interplay of logical and physical design and concludethat 1) solving them independently leads to suboptimal performance and 2) there issubstantial overlap between logical and physical designs: some well-known logical designtransformations generate the same mappings as physical design. Furthermore; existingsearch algorithms are inefficient to search the extremely large space of logical and …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2005,30

Power-law based estimation of set similarity join size,Hongrae Lee; Raymond T Ng; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract We propose a novel technique for estimating the size of set similarity join. Theproposed technique relies on a succinct representation of sets using Min-Hash signatures.We exploit frequent patterns in the signatures for the Set Similarity Join (SSJoin) sizeestimation by counting their support. However; there are overlaps among the counts ofsignature patterns and we need to use the set Inclusion-Exclusion (IE) principle. We developa novel lattice-based counting method for efficiently evaluating the IE principle. Theproposed counting technique is linear in the lattice size. To make the mining process verylight-weight; we exploit a recently discovered Power-law relationship of pattern count andfrequency. Extensive experimental evaluations show the proposed technique is capable ofaccurate and efficient estimation.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,29

High-dimensional similarity joins,Kyuseok Shim; Ramakrishnan Srikant; Rakesh Agrawal,Many emerging data mining applications require a similarity join between points in a high-dimensional domain. We present a new algorithm that utilizes a new index structure; calledthe/spl epsi/tree; for fast spatial similarity joins on high-dimensional points. This indexstructure reduces the number of neighboring leaf nodes that are considered for the join test;as well as the traversal cost of finding appropriate branches in the internal nodes. Thestorage cost for internal nodes is independent of the number of dimensions. Hence; theproposed index structure scales to high-dimensional data. We analyze the cost of the join forthe/spl epsi/tree and the R-tree family; and show that the/spl epsi/tree will perform better forhigh-dimensional joins. Empirical evaluation; using synthetic and real-life data sets; showsthat similarity join using the/spl epsi/tree is twice to an order of magnitude faster than the …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2002,24
An adaptive path index for XML data using the query workload,Jun-Ki Min; Chin-Wan Chung; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Due to its flexibility; XML is becoming the de facto standard for exchanging andquerying documents over the Web. Many XML query languages such as XQuery and XPathuse label paths to traverse the irregularly structured XML data. Without a structural summaryand efficient indexes; query processing can be quite inefficient due to an exhaustivetraversal on XML data. To overcome the inefficiency; several path indexes have beenproposed in the research community. Traditional indexes generally record all label pathsfrom the root element in XML data and are constructed with the use of data only. Such pathindexes may result in performance degradation due to large sizes and exhaustivenavigations for partial matching path queries which start with the self-or-descendent axis(“//”). To improve the query performance; we propose an adaptive path index for XML data …,Information Systems,2005,22

Method for identifying outliers in large data sets,*,A new method for identifying a predetermined number of data points of interest in a largedata set. The data points of interest are ranked in relation to the distance to their neighboringpoints. The method employs partition-based detection algorithms to partition the data pointsand then compute upper and lower bounds for each partition. These bounds are then usedto eliminate those partitions that do contain the predetermined number of data points ofinterest. The data points of interest are then computed from the remaining partitions thatwere not eliminated. The present method eliminates a significant number of data points fromconsideration as the points of interest; thereby resulting in substantial savings incomputational expense compared to conventional methods employed to identify suchpoints.,*,2003,17

Approximate substring selectivity estimation,Hongrae Lee; Raymond T Ng; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract We study the problem of estimating selectivity of approximate substring queries. Itsimportance in databases is ever increasing as more and more data are input by users andare integrated with many typographical errors and different spelling conventions. To beginwith; we consider edit distance for the similarity between a pair of strings. Based oninformation stored in an extended N-gram table; we propose two estimation algorithms; MOFand LBS for the task. The latter extends the former with ideas from set hashing signatures.The experimental results show that MOF is a light-weight algorithm that gives fairly accurateestimations. However; if more space is available; LBS can give better accuracy than MOFand other baseline methods.

Scalable algorithms for mining large databases,Rajeev Rastogi; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract. A large number of corporations have invested heavily in information technology tomanage their businesses more effectively; and vast amounts of critical business data havebeen stored in database systems. The volume of this data is expected to grow considerablyin the near future. Yet many organizations have been unable to collect valuable insightsfrom the data to guide their marketing strategy; investment and management policies. One ofthe reasons for this is that most information is stored implicitly in the large amounts of data.Fortunately; new and sophisticated techniques being developed in the area of data miningcan help companies leverage their data more effectively and extract insightful informationfrom their data. This tutorial describes the fundamental algorithms for data mining; many ofwhich have been proposed in recent years. These techniques include association rules …,Tutorial notes of the fifth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,1999,16
Approximate algorithms with generalizing attribute values for k-anonymity,Hyoungmin Park; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract When a table containing individual data is published; disclosure of sensitiveinformation should be prohibitive. Since simply removing identifiers such as name andsocial security number may reveal the sensitive information by linking attacks which joins thepublished table with other tables on some attributes; the notion of k-anonymity which makeseach record in the table be indistinguishable with k− 1 other records by suppression orgeneralization has been proposed previously. It is shown to be NP-hard to k-anonymize atable minimizing information loss. The approximation algorithms with up to O (k)approximation ratio were proposed when generalization is used for anonymization. In thispaper; we propose several approximation algorithms for k-anonymity with generalizing theattribute values by hierarchies that guarantee O (log k) approximation ratio and perform …,Information Systems,2010,14
Dtd inference from xml documents: The xtract approach,Minos Garofalakis; Aristides Gionis; Rajeev Rastogi; S Seshadri; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract XML is rapidly emerging as the new standard for data representation and exchangeon the Web. Document Type Descriptors (DTDs) contain valuable information on thestructure of XML documents and thus have a crucial role in the efficient storage andquerying of XML data. Despite their importance; however; DTDs are not mandatory; and it isquite possible for documents in XML databases to not have accompanying DTDs. In thispaper; we present an overview of XTRACT; a novel system for inferring a DTD schema for adatabase of XML documents. Since the DTD syntax incorporates the full expressive power ofregular expressions; naive approaches typically fail to produce concise and intuitive DTDs.Instead; the XTRACT inference algorithms employ a sequence of sophisticated steps thatinvolve:(1) finding patterns in the input sequences and replacing them with regular …,IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin,2003,13
Technique for effectively instantiating attributes in association rules,*,In a data processing system; association rules are used to determine correlations ofattributes of collected data; thereby extracting insightful information therefrom. In solving anoptimized association rule problem where multiple instantiations for at least oneuninstantiated attribute are required; unlike prior art; not all possible instantiations areconsidered to realize an optimized set of instantiations. Rather; using inventive pruningtechniques; only selected instantiations need to be considered to realize same. Inaccordance with the invention; instantiations are assigned weights and are subject topruning in an order dependent upon their weight. The weighted instantiations are testedbased on selected criteria to identify; for example; those instantiations; consideration ofwhich for the optimized set would be redundant in view of other instantiations to be …,*,1999,12
Wavelet synopsis for hierarchical range queries with workloads,Sudipto Guha; Hyoungmin Park; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Synopses structures and approximate query answering have become increasinglyimportant in DSS/OLAP applications with stringent response time requirements. Rangequeries are an important class of problems in this domain; and have a wide variety ofapplications and have been studied in the context of histograms. However; wavelets havebeen shown to be quite useful in several scenarios and in fact their multi-resolution structuremakes them especially appealing for hierarchical domains. Furthermore the fact that theHaar wavelet basis has a linear time algorithm for the computation of coefficients has madethe Haar basis one of the important and widely used synopsis structures. Very recentlyoptimal algorithms were proposed for the wavelet synopsis construction problem forequality/point queries.

Supporting set-valued joins in NoSQL using MapReduce,Chulyun Kim; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract NoSQL systems are increasingly adopted for Web applications requiring scalabilitythat relational database systems cannot meet. Although NoSQL systems have not beendesigned to support joins; as they are applied to a wide variety of applications; the need tosupport joins has emerged. Furthermore; joins performed in NoSQL systems are generallysimilarity joins; rather than exact-match joins; which find similar pairs of records. Since Webapplications often use the MapReduce framework; we develop a solution to performsimilarity joins in NoSQL systems using the MapReduce framework.,Information Systems,2015,10

Efficient processing of substring match queries with inverted q-gram indexes,Younghoon Kim; Kyoung-Gu Woo; Hyoungmin Park; Kyuseok Shim,With the widespread of the internet; text-based data sources have become ubiquitous andthe demand of effective support for string matching queries becomes ever increasing. Therelational query language SQL also supports LIKE clause over string data to handlesubstring matching queries. Due to popularity of such substring matching queries; therehave been a lot of study on designing efficient indexes to support the LIKE clause in SQL.Among them; q-gram based indexes have been studied extensively.

DIGTOBI: a recommendation system for Digg articles using probabilistic modeling,Younghoon Kim; Yoonjae Park; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Digg is a social news website that lets people submit articles to share their favoriteweb pages (eg blog postings or news articles) and vote the articles posted by others. Diggservice currently lists the articles in the front page by popularity without considering eachuser's preference to the topics in the articles. Helping users to find the most interesting Diggarticles tailored to each user's own interests will be very useful; but it is not an easy task toclassify the articles according to their topics in order to recommend the articles differently toeach user. In this paper; we propose DIGTOBI; a personalized recommendation system forDigg articles using a novel probabilistic modeling. Our model considers the relevant articleswith low Digg scores important as well. We show that our model can handle both warm-startand cold-start scenarios seamlessly through a single model.

A Clustering algorithm for categorical attributes,Sudipto Guha; Rajeev Rastogi; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Clustering; in data mining; is useful to discover distribution patterns of theunderlying data. Clustering algorithms usually employ a distance based (eg; euclidean)similarity measure in order to partition the database such that data points in the samepartition are more similar than points in different partitions. In this paper; we study clusteringalgorithms for data with boolean and categorical attributes. We first show that the traditionalclustering algorithms using distance metric between points is not appropriate for booleanand categorical attributes. Instead; we propose a novel concept of links to measure thesimilarity/proximity between a pair of data points and develop a hierarchical clusteringalgorithm that employ links and not distance when merging clusters. Our methods naturallyextend to non-metric similarity measures that are relevant in situations where a domain …,Information System Journal 25 (5):; Elsevier Science Ltd (2000) URL http://ee. snu. ac. kr/~ shim/is-rock. pdf,1997,8

Techniques for clustering massive data sets,Sudipto Guha; Rajeev Rastogi; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract The wealth of information embedded in huge databases belonging to corporations(eg; retail; financial; telecom) has spurred a tremendous interest in the areas of knowledgediscovery and data mining. Clustering; in data mining; is a useful technique for discoveringinteresting data distributions and patterns in the underlying data. The problem of clusteringcan be defined as follows: given n data points in ad-dimensional metric space; partition thedata points into k clusters such that the data points within a cluster are more similar to eachother than data points in different clusters.,*,2004,7
Latent ranking analysis using pairwise comparisons,Younghoon Kim; Wooyeol Kim; Kyuseok Shim,Ranking objects is an essential problem in recommendation systems. Since comparing twoobjects is the simplest type of queries in order to measure the relevance of objects; theproblem of aggregating pair wise comparisons to obtain a global ranking has been widelystudied. In order to learn a ranking model; a training set of queries as well as their correctlabels are supplied and a machine learning algorithm is used to find the appropriateparameters of the ranking model with respect to the labels. In this paper; we propose aprobabilistic model for learning multiple latent rankings using pair wise comparisons. Ournovel model can capture multiple hidden rankings underlying the pair wise comparisons.Based on the model; we develop an efficient inference algorithm to learn multiple latentrankings.

CATCH: A detecting algorithm for coalition attacks of hit inflation in internet advertising,Chulyun Kim; Hui Miao; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract As the Internet flourishes; online advertising becomes essential for marketingcampaigns for business applications. To perform a marketing campaign; advertisers providetheir advertisements to Internet publishers and commissions are paid to the publishers of theadvertisements based on the clicks made for the posted advertisements or the purchases ofthe products of which advertisements posted. Since the payment given to a publisher isproportional to the amount of clicks received for the advertisements posted by the publisher;dishonest publishers are motivated to inflate the number of clicks on the advertisementshosted on their web sites. Since the click frauds are critical for online advertising to bereliable; the online advertisers make the efforts to prevent them effectively. However; themethods used for click frauds are also becoming more complex and sophisticated. In this …,Information Systems,2011,6
Advanced query optimization techniques for relational database systems,Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Current query optimizers make certain assumptions about many important run-timeparameters whose values are unknown at query optimization time. Thus; when theseassumptions are violated at run-time; re-optimization is needed or performance suffers. Toovercome this shortcoming; we develop a new technique called parametric queryoptimization which attempts to identify several execution plans; each one of which is optimalfor a subset of all possible values of the run-time parameters. We adopt randomizedalgorithms as the main approach and enhance them with a sideways information passingfeature that increases their effectiveness in the new task. Experimental results show that theyoptimize queries for large numbers of optimizer parameter values in the same time neededby their conventional versions for a single parameter value; without much sacrifice in the …,*,1993,6
Optimization of queries with user-de ned predicates,Surajit Chaudhuri; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Relational databases provide the ability to store user-de ned functions andpredicates which can be invoked in SQL queries. When evaluation of a user-de nedpredicate is relatively expensive; the traditional method of evaluating predicates as early aspossible is no longer a sound heuristic. There are two previous approaches for optimizingsuch queries. However; none of these approaches is able to guarantee the optimal planover the desired execution space. We present e cient techniques that are able to guaranteethe choice of an optimal plan over the desired execution space. The naive optimizationalgorithm is very general and therefore is most widely useful. The optimization algorithm withrank ordering improves upon the naive optimization algorithm by exploiting the nature of thecost formulas for join methods and is polynomial in the number of user-de ned predicates …,Twenty-second Int.

Aggregate query processing in the presence of duplicates in wireless sensor networks,Jun-Ki Min; Raymond T Ng; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have received increasing attention in the pastdecade. In existing studies for query processing of WSNs; each sensor node measuresenvironmental parameters such as temperature; light and humidity around its location.Instead; in our work; we consider a different type of sensors that detect objects in theirsensing regions which may overlap with each other. In WSNs with such sensors; an objectmay be detected by several sensor nodes and processing of aggregate queries (such asCOUNT; SUM and AVERAGE) becomes problematic since an identical object can beconsidered redundantly. In this paper; we propose efficient algorithms for processingaggregate queries as well as sliding window aggregate queries in the presence of multiplydetected events.

However; computing a skyline is challenging today since we have to deal withbig data. For data-intensive applications; the MapReduce framework has been widely usedrecently. In this paper; we propose the efficient parallel algorithm SKY-MR+ for processingskyline queries using MapReduce. We first build a quadtree-based histogram for spacepartitioning by deciding whether to split each leaf node judiciously based on the benefit ofsplitting in terms of the estimated execution time. In addition; we apply the dominance powerfiltering method to effectively prune non-skyline points in advance. We next partition databased on the regions divided by the quadtree and compute candidate skyline points foreach partition using MapReduce.

TWINS: Efficient time-windowed in-network joins for sensor networks,Jun-Ki Min; Jinhyun Kim; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have recently received a lot of attention andseveral techniques have been proposed for in-network join processing. Since sensorreadings are continuously collected and it is interesting to track the relationships betweensensor readings in order to detect the events of interest; the in-network joins with timewindows are very important for WSNs. Most of existing techniques on in-network joinprocessing for sensor networks transmit sensor readings redundantly in a time window andresult in a lot of unnecessary energy consumption. In this paper; we propose the energy-efficient time-windowed in-network join algorithm for Sensor networks (TWINS).

High power test of PEFP RFQ,CB Shim; KS Shim; YS Cho; SH Han; JH Jang; YH Kim; HJ Kwon; MY Park; KT Seol,Abstract In the PEFP (Proton Engineering Frontier Project); a 350MHz; 3MeV RFQ (RadioFrequency Quadrupole) has been developed and tested. It is 3.2 m long four vane type RFQwhich consists of two segments coupled by coupling plate. The tuning results showed thatthe resonant frequency is somewhat higher than 350MHz and other methods in addition toslug tuners should be used to tune the cavity correctly. To check the cavity characteristics;high power RF test has been done. The required peak RF power is 535kW and pulse width;repetition rate for initial test are 50µs; 0.1 Hz respectively. Because the temperatureregulation of the cooling system was poor; frequency modulation was used to drive the RFpower into the cavity. In this paper; the status and test results of the PEFP RFQ arepresented.,*,2004,3
Speech recognition in car noise environments using multiple models according to noise masking levels,Myung Gyu Song; Hoi In Jung; Kab-Jong Shim; Hyung Soon Kim,ABSTRACT In speech recognition for real-world applications; the performance degradationdue to the mismatch introduced between training and testing environments should beovercome. In this paper; to reduce this mismatch; we provide a hybrid method of spectralsubtraction and residual noise masking. We also employ multiple model approach to obtainimproved robustness over various noise environments. In this approach; multiple model setsare made according to several noise masking levels and then a model set appropriate forthe estimated noise level is selected automatically in recognition phase. According tospeaker independent isolated word recognition experiments in car noise environments; theproposed method using model sets with only two masking levels reduces average worderror rate by 60% in comparison with spectral subtraction method.,Fifth International Conference on Spoken Language Processing,1998,3

Approximation algorithms for histogram construction problems,Sudipto Guha; Nick Koudas; Kyuseok Shim,*,*,2004,1
Recent advances in histogram construction algorithms,Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Obtaining fast and accurate approximations to data distributions is a problem ofcentral interest to database management. A variety of database applications including;approximate querying; similarity searching and data mining in most application domains;rely on such accurate approximations. A very popular way in database theory and practice toapproximate a data distribution is by means of a histogram. Histograms approximate a datadistribution using a fixed amount of space; and under certain assumptions strive to minimizethe overall error incurred by the approximation. The problem of histogram construction is ofprofound importance and has attracted a lot of research attention. A fundamentalrequirement for any good histogram construction algorithm is to approximate the underlyingdata distribution in a provably good way and be efficient in terms of running time.

A Subsequence Matching Algorithm Supporting Moving Average Transform of Arbitrary Order in Time-Series Databases,Ung-Gi No; Sang-Uk Kim; Gyu-Yeong Hwang; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract In this paper; we propose a subsequence matching algorithm that supports movingaverage transform of arbitrary order in time-series databases. Moving average transformreduces the effect of noise and has been used in many areas such as econometrics since itis useful in finding the overall trends in the time-series data. The moving average order to beused varies; since the users want to control the degree of noise reduction and the frequencyof analysis depending on the applications and the characteristics of data sequences. Theproposed matching algorithm supports moving average transform of arbitrary order byextending the existing subsequence matching algorithm. If we applied the existingsubsequence matching algorithm without any extension; we would have to generate anindex per each moving average order. Thus; supporting an arbitrary moving average …,Journal of KIISE: Databases,2000,1
A Fast Algorithm for high-dimensional Similarity Joins,Kyuseok Shim; Ramakrishnan Srikant; Rakesh Agrawal,Abstract Many emerging data mining applications require a similarity join between points ina highdimensional domain. We present a new algorithm that utilizes a new index structure;called the-kdB tree; for fast spatial similarity joins on high-dimensional points. This indexstructure reduces the number of neighboring leaf nodes that are considered for the join test;as well as the traversal cost of nding appropriate branches in the internal nodes. Thestorage cost for internal nodes is independent of the number of dimensions. Hence theproposed index structure scales to high-dimensional data. We analyze the cost of the join forthe-kdB tree and the R-tree family; and show that the-kdB tree will perform better for high-dimensional joins. Empirical evaluation; using synthetic and real-life datasets; shows thatsimilarity join using the-kdB tree is typically 3 to 20 times faster than the R+ tree; with the …,*,1996,1
Developing tightly-coupled data mining applications on a relational database system: Methodology and experience,K Shim,Most of the current data mining applications have a loose connection with databases. A majorityof them treat database simply as a container from which data is extracted to populate main memorydata structures before the main execution begins. This approach puts a hard limit on the amountof data the application can handle. The more database-aware applications use loosely- coupledSQL to fetch data records as needed by the mining algorithm. The front-end of the applicationis implemented in a host programming language; with embedded SQL statements in it. The applicationuses a SQL select statement to retrieve the set of records of interest from the database. A loopin the applica- tion program copies records in the result set one-by- one from the database addressspace to the applica- tion address space; where computation is performed on them. This approachhas two performance prob- lems: i) copying of records from the database address space …,*,1995,1

Structured whitelist generation in SCADA network using PrefixSpan algorithm,Woo-Suk Jung; Jeong-Han Yun; Sin-Kyu Kim; Kyu-Seok Shim; Myung-Sup Kim,SCADA system works in repeated or periodic used of only limited communication devices.Because of this feature; whitelist based security techniques are widely used and accessrestriction method using whitelist based static ACL is most commonly applied in securityfield. Static ACL have advantages in security; but their expressiveness is too simple toexpress communication using dynamic allocated port. In addition; it does not reflect all thecommunication characteristics of the control device; and the generated static ACL shouldalways be open regardless of the frequent use. We propose a structured ACL that extendsthe fixed generation sequence information between the communication and communication-specific periodicity to reflect the mechanical and repetitive communication characteristics ofthe SCADA system in the static ACL.

Efficient Haar+ synopsis construction for the maximum absolute error measure,Jinhyun Kim; Jun-Ki Min; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Several wavelet synopsis construction algorithms were previously proposed basedon dynamic programming for unrestricted Haar wavelet synopses as well as Haar+synopses. However; they find an optimal synopsis for every incoming value in each node ofa coefficient tree; even if different incoming values share an identical optimal synopsis. Toalleviate the limitation; we present novel algorithms; which keep only a minimal set of thedistinct optimal synopses in each node of the tree; for the error-bounded synopsis problem.Furthermore; we propose the methods to restrict coefficient values to be considered tocompute the optimal synopses in each node. In addition; by partitioning all optimal synopsesin each node into a set of groups; such that every group can be represented by a compactrepresentation; we significantly improve the performance of the proposed algorithms.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,*

Furthermore; ranking with pairwise comparisons has recently received a lotof attention in crowdsourcing systems where binary comparative queries can be usedeffectively to make assessments faster for precise rankings.

Effective behavior signature extraction method using sequence pattern algorithm for traffic identification,Kyu‐Seok Shim; Sung‐Ho Yoon; Baraka D Sija; Jun‐Sang Park; Kyunghee Cho; Myung‐Sup Kim,Summary With the rapid development of the internet and a vigorous emergence of newapplications; traffic identification has become a key issue. Although various methods havebeen proposed; there are still several limitations to achieving fine-grained and application-level identification. Therefore; we previously proposed a behavior signature model forextracting a unique traffic pattern of an application. Although this signature model achieves agood identification performance; it has trouble with the signature extraction; particularly froma huge amount of input traffic; because a Candidate-Selection method is used for extractingthe signature. To improve this inefficiency in the extraction process; in this paper; wepropose a novel behavior signature extraction method using a sequence pattern algorithm.The proposed method can extract a signature regardless of the volume of input traffic …,International Journal of Network Management,2017,*

Using a Greedy Algorithm for the Improvement of a MapReduce; Theta join; M-Bucket-I Heuristic,Wooyeol Kim; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Theta join is one of the essential and important types of queries in databasesystems. As the amount of data needs to be processed increases; processing theta joinswith a single machine becomes impractical. Therefore; theta join algorithms usingdistributed computing frameworks have been studied widely. Although one of the state-of-the-art theta-join algorithms uses M-Bucket-I heuristic; it is hard to use since running time ofM-Bucket-I heuristic; which computes a mapping from a record to a reducer (ie; reducermapping); is O (n) where n is the size of input data. In this paper; we propose MBI-I algorithmwhich reduces the running time of M-Bucket-I heuristic to and gives the same result as M-Bucket-I heuristic does. We also conducted several experiments to show algorithm andconfirmed that our algorithm can improve the performance of a theta join by 10%.,Journal of KIISE,2016,*

Precession feature analysis of ballistic targets by FMCW-ISAR,W Chang; Z Li; J Yang,Precession is a typical kind of micro-motion of space targets such as ballistic targets. It hasconsiderable significance to analyze the precession feature of ballistic targets in spacetarget recognition and classification applications. A new idea using FMCW-ISAR (frequencymodulation continuous wave-inverse synthetic aperture radar) system to extract micromotionfeatures is presented in this paper; which opens up a new road for precession featureanalysis. FMCW-ISAR system is consecutively transmitting and receiving signals; whichgives it an advantage over traditional pulse radar systems on precession parameterestimation; especially in the case of high precession angular velocity.

Anonymizing Transaction Data for Publication,Young-Hoon Kim; Hyoung-Min Park; Kyu-Seok Shim,Abstract Transaction data; which is a table of item sets where each item set is associatedwith an individual; is very common in databases such as basket data and query log insearch engine. When a table containing individual data is published; disclosure of sensitiveinformation should be prohibitive. Since simply removing identifiers such as name andsocial security number may reveal the sensitive information by linking attacks which join thepublished table with other public tables on some sets of items; several privacy preservingmodels such as k-anonymity and 1-diversity are proposed; and anonymization algorithmsare also suggested previously. In this paper; we propose a novel privacy preserving modelthat prohibits the linking attacks with the information of absent items; which we call (h; k; p; n)-coherence; and suggest an approximation algorithm that guarantees (h; k; p; n) …,Journal of KIISE: Databases,2011,*

Wepropose novel suffix tree transform algorithms for this problem. Unlike previous approacheswhere a full suffix tree is pruned and then an estimation algorithm is employed; we transforma suffix tree into a suffix graph systematically. In our approach; nodes with similar counts aremerged while structural information in the original suffix tree is preserved in a controlledmanner.

However; for many applications; such as business and scientific applications;quantitative attributes are often recorded in the data; which are ignored by existingalgorithms but can provide useful insight to the users. In this paper; we consider the problemof mining sequential patterns with quantities. We demonstrate that naive extensions toexisting algorithms for sequential patterns are inefficient; as they may enumerate the searchspace blindly. Thus; we propose hash filtering and quantity sampling techniques thatsignificantly improve the performance of the naive extensions.

퀀터티가 있는 순차 패턴을 찾는 깊이 우선 탐색 알고리즘,김철연， 심규석,순차 패턴을 찾는 것은 데이타 마이닝 응용분야에서 중요한 문제이다. 기존의 순차 마이닝알고리즘들은 아이템으로만 이루어진 순차 패턴만을 취급하였으나 Apriori-QSP 에서는 새롭게퀀터티 정보에 대한 처리의 개념을 도입하였다. 전체 순차 패턴을 찾는 알고리즘들은 너비 우선탐색과 깊이 우선 탐색 기법으로 분류할 수 있는데; 이러한 분류에서 Apriori-QSP 알고리즘은너비 우선 탐색 기법으로 분류할 수 있다. 본 논문에서는 퀀터티 정보를 처리하는 깊이 우선탐색 기법을 제안하였다. Apriori-QSP 에서 제안되었던 후보패턴 생성에 대한 필터링과 샘플링기법을 깊이 우선 탐색의 탐색 기법으로 적용하였으며; 다양한 실험 결과들이 깊이 우선탐색에서도 이러한 기법이 효율적임을 보여 주고 있다. 또한 길이가 긴 순차 패턴 마이닝의 경우너비우선 탐색에 비해 향상된 성능을 보임을 확인하였다.,한국정보과학회 학술발표논문집,2004,*

A Subsequence Matching Algorithm Supporting Moving Average Transform of Arbitrary Order in Time-Series Databases,Woong-Kee Loh; Sang-Wook Kim; Kyu-Young Whang; Kyu-Seok Shim,Abstract In this paper; we propose a subsequence matching algorithm that supports movingaverage transform of arbitrary order in time-series databases. Moving average transformreduces the effect of noise and has been used in many areas such as econometrics since itis useful in finding the overall trends in the time-series data. The moving average order to beused varies; since the users want to control the degree of noise reduction and the frequencyof analysis depending on the applications and the characteristics of data sequences. Theproposed matching algorithm supports moving average transform of arbitrary order byextending the existing subsequence matching algorithm. If we applied the existingsubsequence matching algorithm without any extension; we would have to generate anindex per each moving average order. Thus; supporting an arbitrary moving average …,Journal of KIISE: Databases,2000,*

The session co-chairs are grateful to the reviewers for their careful comments and insightful suggestions: Alan Ableson; Dianne Cook; Paul Kearney; Steven Salzbur...,Peter Karp Gerster; Kyuseok Shim; Dan Suciu; Edwin Knorr,The development and growth of molecular databases over the last decade has brought a growingproblem to the biocomputing community. Our ability to analyze; summarize and extract informationfrom these databases has lagged far behind our ability to collect and store data. As well; traditionalmethods for handling data either automated or manual cannot be effectively applied becauseof the volume and complexity of these emerging databases. Knowledge discovery generallyrefers to the process of identifying valid; novel and understandable patterns. Knowledge discoveryfrom large databases; often called data mining; refers to the application of the discovery processon large databases or datasets. The discovery process can be broken into several steps;including: developing an understanding of the application domain; cre- ating a target dataset; data cleaning and preprocessing; finding useful features with which to represent the …,Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing,1999,*
High-dimensional Proximity Joins,Kyuseok Shim; Ramakrishnan Srikant; Rakesh Agrawal,Abstract Many emerging data mining applications require a proximity similarity join betweenpoints in a high-dimensional domain. We present a new algorithm that utilizes a new datastructure; called the-kd tree; for fast spatial proximity joins on high-dimensional points. Thisdata structure reduces the number of neighboring leaf nodes that are considered for the jointest; as well as the traversal cost of nding appropriate branches in the internal nodes. Thestorage cost for internal nodes is independent of the number of dimensions. Hence theproposed data structure scales to high-dimensional data. We analyze the cost of the join forthe-kd tree and the R-tree family; and show that the-kd tree will perform better for high-dimensional joins. Empirical evaluation; using synthetic and real-life datasets; shows thatproximity join using the-kd tree is typically 2 to 40 times faster than the R+ tree; with the …,*,1997,*
