A unified framework for hybrid control: Model and optimal control theory,Michael S Branicky; Vivek S Borkar; Sanjoy K Mitter,We propose a very general framework that systematizes the notion of a hybrid system;combining differential equations and automata; governed by a hybrid controller that issuescontinuous-variable commands and makes logical decisions. We first identify thephenomena that arise in real-world hybrid systems. Then; we introduce a mathematicalmodel of hybrid systems as interacting collections of dynamical systems; evolving oncontinuous-variable state spaces and subject to continuous controls and discrete transitions.The model captures the identified phenomena; subsumes previous models; yet retainsenough structure to pose and solve meaningful control problems. We develop a theory forsynthesizing hybrid controllers for hybrid plants in all optimal control framework. In particular;we demonstrate the existence of optimal (relaxed) and near-optimal (precise) controls …,IEEE transactions on automatic control,1998,1528

The ODE method for convergence of stochastic approximation and reinforcement learning,Vivek S Borkar; Sean P Meyn,It is shown here that stability of the stochastic approximation algorithm is implied by theasymptotic stability of the origin for an associated ODE. This in turn implies convergence ofthe algorithm. Several specific classes of algorithms are considered as applications. It isfound that the results provide (i) a simpler derivation of known results for reinforcementlearning algorithms;(ii) a proof for the first time that a class of asynchronous stochasticapproximation algorithms are convergent without using any a priori assumption ofstability;(iii) a proof for the first time that asynchronous adaptive critic and Q-learningalgorithms are convergent for the average cost optimal control problem.,SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization,2000,285
Asymptotic agreement in distributed estimation,Vivek Borkar; Pravin Varaiya,Each of several agents updates his estimate of the same random variable whenever hemakes a new observation or receives the estimate made by another agent. In turn; eachagent transmits his estimate to a randomly chosen subset of the other agents. A subset ofagents forms a communicating ring if for every pair\underline {m};\underline {p} of ringmembers; there is a sequence of ring members\underline {m}=\underline {m} _ {1};\underline{m} _ {2};...;\underline {m} _ {n+ 1}=\underline {p} such that\underline {m} _ {i} sends hisestimate to\underline {m} _ {i+ 1} infinitely often. If each ring member knows that he is a ringmember; then the estimates of all the ring members asymptotically agree. However; thiscommon limit can depend upon the order in which estimates are transmitted.,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,1982,271

A new distributed time synchronization protocol for multihop wireless networks,Roberto Solis; Vivek S Borkar; PR Kumar,A distributed algorithm to achieve accurate time synchronization in large multihop wirelessnetworks is presented. The central idea is to exploit the large number of global constraintsthat have to be satisfied by a common notion of time in a multihop network. If; at a certaininstant; O ij is the clock offset between two neighboring nodes i and j; then for any loop i 1; i2; i 3;...; in; i n+ 1-i 1 in the multihop network; these offsets must satisfy the global constraintSigma k= 1 n O ik; i k+ 1= 0. Noisy estimates Ocirc ij of O ij are usually arrived at by bilateralexchanges of timestamped messages or local broadcasts. By imposing the large number ofglobal constraints for all the loops in the multihop network; these estimates can be smoothedand made more accurate. A fully distributed and asynchronous algorithm which functions bysimple local broadcasts is designed.

A theory of QoS for wireless,I-H Hou; Vivek Borkar; PR Kumar,Wireless networks are increasingly used to carry applications with QoS constraints. Twoproblems arise when dealing with traffic with QoS constraints. One is admission control;which consists of determining whether it is possible to fulfill the demands of a set of clients.The other is finding an optimal scheduling policy to meet the demands of all clients. In thispaper; we propose a framework for jointly addressing three QoS criteria: delay; deliveryratio; and channel reliability. We analytically prove the necessary and sufficient condition fora set of clients to be feasible with respect to the above three criteria. We then establish anefficient algorithm for admission control to decide whether a set of clients is feasible. Wefurther propose two scheduling policies and prove that they are feasibility optimal in thesense that they can meet the demands of every feasible set of clients.

For a differential inclusion x∈ f (x); and any ε> 0; we define a finitesample graph A∈. Every trajectory φ of the differential inclusion x∈ f (x) is also a “trajectory”in A∈. And every “trajectory” η of A∈ has the property that dist (ή (t); f (η (t)))≤ ε. Using this;we can compute the εinvariant sets of the differential inclusion—the sets that remaininvariant under ε-perturbations in f.,International Hybrid Systems Workshop,1995,131
Adaptive control of Markov chains; I: Finite parameter set,Vivek Borkar; P Varaiya,Consider a controlled Markov chain whose transition probabilities depend upon anunknown parameter α taking values in finite set A. To each α is associated a prespecifiedstationary control law\phi (\alpha). The adaptive control law selects at each time t the controlaction indicated by\phi (\alpha_ {t}) where α t is the maximum likelihood estimate of α. It isshown that α t converges to a parameter α* such that the" closed-loop" transitionprobabilities corresponding to α* and\phi (\alpha^{\ast}) are the same as thosecorresponding to α 0 and\phi (\alpha) where α 0 is the true parameter. The situation when α0 does not belong to the model set A is briefly discussed.,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,1979,127
Distributed asynchronous incremental subgradient methods,A Nedić; Dimitri P Bertsekas; Vivek S Borkar,Abstract We propose and analyze a distributed asynchronous subgradient method forminimizing a convex function that consists of the sum of a large number of componentfunctions. This type of minimization arises in a dual context from Lagrangian relaxation of thecoupling constraints of large scale separable problems. The idea is to distribute thecomputation of the component subgradients among a set of processors; which communicateonly with a coordinator. The coordinator performs the subgradient iteration incrementallyand asynchronously; by taking steps along the subgradients of the component funtions thatare available at the update time. The incremental approach has performed very well incentralized computation; and the parallel implementation should improve its performancesubstantially; particularly for typical problems where computation of the component …,Studies in Computational Mathematics,2001,119

It is shown that if instead of the state observations an associated“innovations process” is encoded and transmitted; then the separation principle holds;leading to an optimal control linear in state estimate.

Convex analytic methods in Markov decision processes,Vivek S Borkar,Markov decision processes optimize phenomena evolving with time and thus are intrinsicallydynamic optimization problems. Nevertheless; they can be cast as abstract 'static' optimizationproblems over a closed convex set of measures. They then become convex programming (infact; infinite dimensional linear programming) problems for which the enormous machinery ofthe latter fields can be invoked and used to advantage. Logically; these are extensions of thelinear programming approach to finite state finite action space problems due to Manne [43].(Further references are given in the 'bibliographical note' at the end.) The attraction of this approachlies in the following … (i) It leads to elegant alternative derivations of known results; sometimesunder weaker hypotheses; from a novel perspective … (ii) It brings to the fore the possibilityof using convex/linear programming techniques for computing near-optimal strategies.,*,2002,107

A convex analytic approach to Markov decision processes,Vivek S Borkar,Summary This paper develops a new framework for the study of Markov decision processesin which the control problem is viewed as an optimization problem on the set of canonicallyinduced measures on the trajectory space of the joint state and control process. This set isshown to be compact convex. One then associates with each of the usual cost criteria(infinite horizon discounted cost; finite horizon; control up to an exit time) a naturally definedoccupation measure such that the cost is an integral of some function with respect to thismeasure. These measures are shown to form a compact convex set whose extreme pointsare characterized. Classical results about existence of optimal strategies are recovered fromthis and several applications to multicriteria and constrained optimization problems arebriefly indicated.,Probability Theory and Related Fields,1988,95

We propose a new approach for on-lineimplementation of the optimal packet scheduling algorithm. This approach is based onreformulating the value iteration equation by introducing a virtual state called post-decisionstate. The resultant value iteration equation becomes amenable to online implementationbased on stochastic approximation. This approach has an advantage that an explicitknowledge of the probability distribution of the channel state as well as the arrivals is notrequired for the implementation. We prove that the on-line algorithm indeed converges to theoptimal policy.,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,2008,90

An actor-critic algorithm for constrained Markov decision processes,Vivek S Borkar,Constrained Markov decision processes are Markov decision processes (MDPs) wherein oneaims to minimize one cost functional subject to prescribed bounds on one or more additionalcost functionals. These have been extensively studied (see [1;7;13]) and find manyapplications; particularly in communication networks [2]. While the algorithmic issues for thesehave also been extensively studied when the underlying transition mechanism is known [1]; thereis a need to study the case when it is not. For the classical (ie; without constraints) Markov decisionprocesses; a popular tool to handle such situations has been the `reinforcement learning' algorithmsfor approximate dynamic programming; such as TD( λ ); Q-learning; actor-critic algorithms;etc. [5;16].

Stochastic approximation for nonexpansive maps: Application to Q-learning algorithms,Jinane Abounadi; Dimitri P Bertsekas; Vivek Borkar,We discuss synchronous and asynchronous iterations of the form xk+ 1= x^ k+\gamma (k)(h(x^ k)+ w^ k); where h is a suitable map and {wk} is a deterministic or stochastic sequencesatisfying suitable conditions. In particular; in the stochastic case; these are stochasticapproximation iterations that can be analyzed using the ODE approach based either onKushner and Clark's lemma for the synchronous case or on Borkar's theorem for theasynchronous case. However; the analysis requires that the iterates {xk} be bounded; a factwhich is usually hard to prove. We develop a novel framework for proving boundedness inthe deterministic framework; which is also applicable to the stochastic case when thedeterministic hypotheses can be verified in the almost sure sense.

Structural properties of optimal transmission policies over a randomly varying channel,Mukul Agarwal; Vivek S Borkar; Abhay Karandikar,We consider the problem of transmitting packets over a randomly varying point to pointchannel with the objective of minimizing the expected power consumption subject to aconstraint on the average packet delay. By casting it as a constrained Markov decisionprocess in discrete time with time-averaged costs; we prove structural results about thedependence of the optimal policy on buffer occupancy; number of packet arrivals in theprevious slot and the channel fading state for both iid and Markov arrivals and channelfading. The techniques we use to establish such results: convexity; stochastic dominance;decreasing-differences; are among the standard ones for the purpose. Our maincontribution; however; is the passage to the average cost case; a notoriously difficultproblem for which rather limited results are available.

A note on stochastic dissipativeness,Vivek S Borkar; Sanjoy K Mitter,In [8; 9]; Willems introduced the notion of a dissipative dynamical system with associated 'supplyrate' and 'storage function;' with a view to building a Lyapunov- like theory of input-output stabilityfor deterministic control systems. In this article; we extend these notions to stochasticsystems; specifically to controlled diffusions. This makes contact with the ergodic control problemfor controlled dif- fusions ([2]; Chapter VI) and offers additional insight into the latter. Inparticular; it allows us to obtain a “martingale dynamic programming principle” for ergodic controlunder partial observations in the spirit of Davis and Varaiya [6]. So far this has been done onlyin special cases using a vanishing discount limit; see Borkar [3; 4; 5]. The next section introducesthe notation and key definitions.

HFSP: size-based scheduling for Hadoop,Mario Pastorelli; Antonio Barbuzzi; Damiano Carra; Matteo Dell'Amico; Pietro Michiardi,Size-based scheduling with aging has; for long; been recognized as an effective approachto guarantee fairness and near-optimal system response times. We present HFSP; ascheduler introducing this technique to a real; multi-server; complex and widely used systemsuch as Hadoop. Size-based scheduling requires a priori job size information; which is notavailable in Hadoop: HFSP builds such knowledge by estimating it on-line during jobexecution. Our experiments; which are based on realistic workloads generated via astandard benchmarking suite; pinpoint at a significant decrease in system response timeswith respect to the widely used Hadoop Fair scheduler; and show that HFSP is largelytolerant to job size estimation errors.,Big Data; 2013 IEEE International Conference on,2013,36

A stable online algorithm for energy-efficient multiuser scheduling,Nitin Salodkar; Abhay Karandikar; Vivek S Borkar,In this paper; we consider the problem of energy-efficient uplink scheduling with delayconstraint for a multiuser wireless system. We address this problem within the framework ofconstrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) wherein one seeks to minimize one cost(average power) subject to a hard constraint on another (average delay). We do not assumethe arrival and channel statistics to be known. To handle state-space explosion andinformational constraints; we split the problem into individual CMDPs for the users; coupledthrough their Lagrange multipliers; and a user selection problem at the base station. Toaddress the issue of unknown channel and arrival statistics; we propose a reinforcementlearning algorithm.

McKean–Vlasov limit in portfolio optimization,VS Borkar; K Suresh Kumar,This article considers a sector-wise allocation in a portfolio consisting of a very large numberof stocks. Their interdependence is captured by the dependence of the drift coefficient ofeach stock on an averaged effect of the sectors. This leads to a decoupled dynamics in thelimit of large numbers; akin to the “mean field” limit leading to the McKean–Vlasov equationin statistical physics. This gives a more compact description using a time-varying driftcharacterized in terms of a measure-valued process that satisfies a nonlinear parabolicequation. The classical portfolio optimization problem is then addressed in this framework.,Stochastic Analysis and Applications,2010,26

The nodes are assumed to be rational and interested in their performanceseen as a transmitter as well as a receiver. By casting this problem as a non-cooperativegame; we derive conditions for the Nash equilibrium. We also show the existence of a Nashequilibrium when the nodes are constrained by their battery power (for this case; theconstraints on the access rates of the nodes become coupled). For the special case whereall nodes are each other's neighbors; we find that the equilibrium is given by the solution of asystem of linear equations.

Optimal control of sleep periods for wireless terminals,Amar Prakash Azad; Sara Alouf; Eitan Altman; Vivek Borkar; Georgios S Paschos,We consider a mobile connected to a base station; and study how to optimally scheduleshutting off its transceiver. First; we study the model from optimal control perspective. Weconsider off-times (periods of inactivity) of (controlled) duration. We study the question ofscheduling" waking up" instants in which the mobile communicates with the base station andchecks whether the inactivity period is over. There is a cost proportional to the delay from themoment the off-time ends until the mobile discovers it; a (small) running cost while themobile is sleeping and a cost for waking up. We present conditions for optimal sleep periodsto be constant and derive the optimal period. For the case that the conditions do not hold; weobtain suboptimal solutions which perform strictly better than the optimal constant one.

On the diffusion of messages in on-line social networks,Aditya Karnik; Atul Saroop; Vivek Borkar,Abstract In this paper we investigate the message diffusion process in on-line socialnetworks (OSNs) with the aim to understand how and why some messages become viral.We model peculiarities of messaging in OSNs; in particular; information aging andcompeting message streams. We present a mean-field analysis that gives an approximationto the diffusion dynamics in the limit of large N (the number of participants in an OSN). Thisapproach allows us to precisely define the outbreak of a message and derive conditions forit. Our main results are threshold theorems; which imply that a message becomes viral if acertain threshold is crossed. The results show that owing to competing message streams; amessage is required to cross a higher threshold in order to become viral. This; we believe;may be one of the reasons for the low incidence of viral messages in these networks. We …,Performance Evaluation,2013,21
Asymptotics of the invariant measure in mean field models with jumps,Vivek S Borkar; Rajesh Sundaresan,We consider the asymptotics of the invariant measure for the process of the empirical spatialdistribution of N coupled Markov chains in the limit of a large number of chains. Each chainreflects the stochastic evolution of one particle. The chains are coupled through thedependence of the transition rates on this spatial distribution of particles in the variousstates. Our model is a caricature for medium access interactions in wireless local areanetworks. It is also applicable to the study of spread of epidemics in a network. The limitingprocess satisfies a deterministic ordinary differential equation called the McKean-Vlasovequation. When this differential equation has a unique globally asymptotically stableequilibrium; the spatial distribution asymptotically concentrates on this equilibrium. Moregenerally; its limit points are supported on a subset of the ω-limit sets of the McKean …,Stochastic Systems,2013,21

The control law uses a simple and intuitive power adaptationmechanism. We consider as an example the topology requirement of maintaining the out-degrees of each node at prescribed values and keeping the in-degree close to the out-degree. The topology objective is achieved by adapting the transmission power based onlyon local information. This power adaptation algorithm is analyzed using the ode approach tostochastic approximation.

Ergodic and adaptive control of nearest-neighbor motions,Vivek S Borkar; Mrinal K Ghosh,Abstract The self-tuning approach to adaptive control is applied to a class of Markov chainscalled nearest-neighbor motions. These have a countable state space and move from anystate to at most finitely many neighboring states. For compact parameter and control spaces;the almost-sure optimality of the self-tuner for an ergodic cost criterion is established undertwo sets of assumptions.,Mathematics of Control; Signals and Systems,1991,14
A topology for Markov controls,Vivek S Borkar,There are several works establishing the weak sequential compactness of the laws of controlleddiffusions under appropriate classes of controls [3]-[5]; [7]; [8]; [12]. These are; however; of an"existence" kind; ie; any limit of a sequence of controlled diffusion law is shown to be the lawof some controlled diffusion. The relationship between the control appearing in this limit law andthose appearing in the sequence considered is somewhat masked. The aim of this paper is touncover this relationship in the case of Markov relaxed controls. More precisely; we put a compactmetrizable topology on the collection of Markov relaxed controls and show that the map that associatesthe corresponding diffusion law (with fixed initial data) to each such control is thencontinuous. It should be emphasized that these results are in a sense a variant of the main resultsof Section IV of [4]. The main contribution of this paper is an alternative formulation that …,Applied Mathematics and Optimization,1989,14
Evolution of interacting particles in a Brownian medium,Vivek S Borkar,Evolution of interacting particles in a random medium is studied by treating their spatialdistribution as a measure-valued process. Each individual particle is assumed to moveaccording to a stochastic differential equation; the interaction being manifest both throughthe correlation of the driving Wiener processes and through the explicit dependence of the“drift” and “diffusion” coefficients on the overall distribution of the particles. The evolutionequation for the above-mentioned measure-valued process is derived and the uniquenessof its solutions established using the techniques developed by Bismut and Kunita.,Stochastics: An International Journal of Probability and Stochastic Processes,1984,14
Risk-constrained Markov decision processes,Vivek Borkar; Rahul Jain,We propose a new constrained Markov decision process framework with risk-typeconstraints. The risk metric we use is Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR); which is gainingpopularity in finance. It is a conditional expectation but the conditioning is defined in terms ofthe level of the tail probability. We propose an iterative offline algorithm to find the risk-contrained optimal control policy. A two time-scale stochastic approximation-inspiredlearning'variant is also sketched; and its convergence proved to the optimal risk-constrained policy.,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2014,13
Asynchronous gossip for averaging and spectral ranking,Vivek S Borkar; Rahul Makhijani; Rajesh Sundaresan,We consider two variants of the classical gossip algorithm.

We then discuss a potential application toa wireless network setting with simultaneous link activation constraints. The second variantis a gossip algorithm for distributed computation of the Perron-Frobenius eigenvector of anonnegative matrix.

Closed and open loop optimal control of buffer and energy of a wireless device,Vivek S Borkar; Arzad Alam Kherani; BJ Prabhu,We study a decision problem faced by an energy limited wireless device that operates indiscrete time. There is some external arrival to the device's transmit buffer. The possibledecisions are: a) to serve some of the buffer content; b) to reorder a new battery after servingthe maximum possible amount that it can; or c) to remain idle so that the battery charge canincrease owing to diffusion process (which is possible in some commercially availablebatteries). We look at open and closed-loop controls of the system. The closed-loop controlproblem is a using the framework of Markov decision processes.

Self-tuning control of diffusions without the identifiability condition,VS Borkar,Abstract The self-tuning method of adaptive control for diffusions consists of estimating theunknown parameter on line and using its current estimate as the true parameter for theselection of the control at each time. The as optimality of this scheme for the ergodic or long-run average criterion can be established under an identifiability condition on the system; butmay fail otherwise. We present a modified self-tuning scheme along the lines of the Kumar-Becker-Lin scheme for Markov chains and prove its as optimality. Several heuristic issuesrelated to this scheme are also discussed.,Journal of optimization theory and applications,1991,12
A remark on the attainable distributions of controlled diffusions,Vivek S Borkar,It is proved that for controlled diffusions; the sets of attainable laws at a given time and attainableexit distributions; starting from a given initial law; are the same under the family of all nonanticipativecontrols and its subfamily of Markov controls. KEY WORDS: Stochastic controllability; attainabledistributions; exit distributions; nonanticipative control; Markov control … The"controllability" problem in deterministic control consists of studying the reachable set of statesfrom a given initial state under admissible controls. An analogous situation in stochastic controlis to study the set of reachable laws from a given initial law under all admissible controls. (Thisis not the only possible generalization. See [5].) The latter situation is clearly much morecomplex. This note offers some simplification of it by proving that for such problems; one mayrestrict one's attention to Markov controls.

A new Markov selection procedure for degenerate diffusions,VS Borkar; K Suresh Kumar,Abstract A new selection principle is proposed for construction of a Feller solution to an ill-posed degenerate diffusion process. This is based on constructing the Feller transitionkernel from the unique (under suitable conditions) continuous viscosity solutions to thebackward Kolmogorov equation associated with the diffusion. The connection of this Fellerprocess with the small-noise limits of the nondegenerate perturbations of the diffusion andseveral other related phenomena are also discussed.,Journal of Theoretical Probability,2010,11
Optimal sampling for state change detection with application to the control of sleep mode,Amar P Azad; Sara Alouf; Eitan Altman; Vivek Borkar; Georgios Paschos,This work considers systems with inactivity periods of unknown duration. We study thequestion of scheduling “waking up” instants in which a server can check whether theinactivity period is over. There is a cost proportional to the delay from the moment theinactivity period ends until the server discovers it; a (small) running cost while the server isaway and also a cost for waking up. As an application to the problem; we consider theenergy management in WiMax where inactive mobiles reduce their energy consumption byentering a sleep mode. Various standards exist which impose specific waking-up schedulingpolicies at wireless devices. We check these and identify optimal policies under variousstatistical assumptions.

A note on linear function approximation using random projections,Kishor Barman; Vivek S Borkar,This has been put to many uses in reducing problems involving a large number of data pointsor large dimensionality to those with a much smaller one. Many of these use low rank approximationsof matrices justified by the above result [11]. The aim of this note is to underscore the possibleuse of this circle of ideas to large optimization problems. One possible approach to beating downthe curse of dimensionality inherent to these problems is to look for a linear combination of achosen; moderate number of basis functions that well approximates the desired solution. Whilesuch 'linear function approximations' are extensively used in various contexts; the choice of thebasis functions themselves remains something of a grey area. We argue here that random projectionsoffers one possible avenue for selection of basis functions; in addition to any 'priorknowledge' that may dictate some choices thereof.

Recursive self-tuning control of finite Markov chains,Vivek S Borkar,Abstract. A recursive self-tuning control scheme for finite Markov chains is proposed whereinthe unknown parameter is estimated by a stochastic approximation scheme for maximizingthe log-likelihood function and the control is obtained via a relative value iteration algorithm.The analysis uses the asymptotic odes associated with these. 1. Introduction. One popularapproach for adaptive control of Markov chains has been the self-tuning scheme of Mandl[18]. In this approach; a parametrized model set is postulated and the parameter is estimated“on line” by a suitable statistical method. The control used is the corresponding “certaintyequivalent” control; ie; the control that would be optimal at a given time for a given state if thecurrent parameter estimate were the true parameter. Mandl proved the asymptotic optimalityof this scheme under a strong identifiability condition which requires complete model …,Applicationes Mathematicae,1996,11

This paper considers Bayesian parameter estimation and an associated adaptivecontrol scheme for controlled Markov chains and diffusions with time-averaged cost.Asymptotic behaviour of the posterior law of the parameter given the observed trajectory isanalyzed. This analysis suggests a “cost-biased” estimation scheme and associated self-tuning adaptive control. This is shown to be asymptotically optimal in the almost sure sense.I. Introduction. A popular scheme for adaptive control is the so-called “self-tuning” controlwherein a parameterized family of system models is presupposed and the parameter isestimated “on-line”.

Network pricing for QoS: a ‘regulation’approach,Dinesh Garg; Vivek S Borkar; D Manjunath,9.1 Background Increasing stream traffic on the Internet and higher performanceexpectations from the users of services built on the elastic traffic model have meant that thenetwork should provide more predictable performance in terms of delays and loss ofpackets. Further; with increasing variety in applications and in users; the network shouldalso provide different grades of service. Since the supply of network resources; eg; bufferand bandwidth; is fixed over small timescales; predictability of performance requires that thenetwork be capable of controlling the behavior of the demand for these network resources;especially during times of congestion when the instantaneous demand exceeds supply.Allocating network resources among competing demands during periods of congestion isessentially a conflict resolution problem.

In the past; several attempts have been made to formulate this problemand each formulation focuses only on a subset of design criteria such as skill coverage;social compatibility; economy; skill redundancy; etc. In this paper; for the first time; we showthat most of the important design criteria for this problem can be fully modeled within onesingle formulation as an unconstrained submodular function maximization problem. In ourformulation; the submodular function turns out to be non-negative and non-monotone.

On de Finetti coherence and Kolmogorov probability,Vivek S Borkar; Vijay R Konda; Sanjoy K Mitter,De Finetti (1990) develops a subjectivistic theory of probability (De Finetti et al.; 1990). In thistheory; probabilities are viewed as certain proportions of stakes a player chooses to pay to enterinto a lottery in which the stakes are set by a bookie. The probability assignments to various eventsare seen as being purely subjective since they depend on the player's assessment of the likelihoodof various events occurring in the lottery. However; the player has to choose the probabilitiesin such a way that he always has a chance to win whatever the stakes set by the bookie mightbe. De Finetti calls such an assignment of probabilities coherent.

Whittle index policy for crawling ephemeral content,Konstantin E Avrachenkov; Vivek S Borkar,We consider the task of scheduling a crawler to retrieve from several sites their ephemeralcontent. This is content; such as news or posts at social network groups; for which a usertypically loses interest after some days or hours. Thus development of a timely crawlingpolicy for ephemeral information sources is very important. We first formulate this problem asan optimal control problem with average reward. The reward can be measured in terms ofthe number of clicks or relevant search requests. The problem in its exact formulation suffersfrom the curse of dimensionality and quickly becomes intractable even with moderatenumber of information sources. Fortunately; this problem admits a Whittle index; acelebrated heuristics which leads to problem decomposition and to a very simple andefficient crawling policy.

Thus the assetis partially observed through the equity. Then using nonlinear filtering an explicit expressionfor likelihood ratio for underlying parameters in terms of the nonlinear filter is obtained.

Quasi-stationary distributions as centrality measures for the giant strongly connected component of a reducible graph,Konstantin Avrachenkov; Vivek Borkar; Danil Nemirovsky,Abstract A random walk can be used as a centrality measure of a directed graph. However; ifthe graph is reducible the random walk will be absorbed in some subset of nodes and willnever visit the rest of the graph. In Google PageRank the problem was solved by theintroduction of uniform random jumps with some probability. Up to the present; there is nofinal answer to the question about the choice of this probability. We propose to use aparameter-free centrality measure which is based on the notion of a quasi-stationarydistribution. Specifically; we suggest four quasi-stationary based centrality measures;analyze them and conclude that they produce approximately the same ranking.,Journal of computational and applied mathematics,2010,7
Singular perturbations in risk-sensitive stochastic control,Vivek S Borkar; K Suresh Kumar,Control of nondegenerate diffusions with infinite horizon risk-sensitive criterion is studiedwhen the dynamics exhibits two distinct time scales. If the time scales are separated by afactor ϵ>0; then it is shown that under suitable hypotheses; as ϵ\downarrow0; the optimalcost converges to the optimal risk-sensitive cost for a reduced order controlled diffusion. Thedynamics of this diffusion corresponds to the dynamics of the slower variables of the originalprocess; with the dependence on the fast variables averaged out as per the asymptoticbehavior of the latter. The arguments use a logarithmic transformation to convert the risk-sensitive control problem into a two-person zero-sum ergodic game; followed by the smallparameter asymptotics of the associated Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs equation.,SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization,2010,7

Optimal control of semilinear stochastic evolution equations,VS Borkar; TE Govindan,THE AIM of this paper is to initiate a semigroup theory-based approach to characterization ofoptimal Markov controls for controlled semilinear stochastic evolution equations.(It may berecalled that Markov controls are those that depend only on the current state at each time.)For finite dimensional controlled stochastic differential equations with a nondegeneratediffusion matrix; this task is traditionally achieved through the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellmanequation of dynamic programming associated with the problem and an accompanyingverification theorem. The latter states that an optimal Markov control can be explicitlyobtained by the pointwise minimization of a Hamiltonian derivable from the solution of theHJB equation. Moreover; any optimal Markov control is obtainable in this manner.,Nonlinear analysis,1994,7

Risk-sensitive control and an abstract Collatz–Wielandt formula,Ari Arapostathis; Vivek S Borkar; K Suresh Kumar,Abstract The 'value'of infinite horizon risk-sensitive control is the principal eigenvalue of acertain positive operator. For the case of compact domain; Chang has built upon a nonlinearversion of the Krein–Rutman theorem to give a 'min–max'characterization of this eigenvaluewhich may be viewed as a generalization of the classical Collatz–Wielandt formula for thePerron–Frobenius eigenvalue of a nonnegative irreducible matrix. We apply this formula tothe Nisio semigroup associated with risk-sensitive control and derive a variationalcharacterization of the optimal risk-sensitive cost. For the linear; ie; uncontrolled case; this isseen to reduce to the celebrated Donsker–Varadhan formula for principal eigenvalue of asecond-order elliptic operator.,Journal of Theoretical Probability,2016,6

Basics of stochastic approximation algorithms are also sketched; inparticular the 'ode'approach for its stability and convergence; and implications ofasynchrony. The learning schemes give stochastic approximation versions of the traditionaliterative schemes for solving dynamic programs. Two learning schemes; Q-learning and theactor-critic method; are described along with their convergence analysis.

Vacation policy optimization with application to IEEE 802.16 e power saving mechanism,Amar P Azad; Sara Alouf; Eitan Altman; Vivek Borkar; Georgios Paschos,Much research has been devoted to optimizing the power saving mechanism in wirelessmobile devices. Recent advances in wireless radio technology facilitate the implementationof various possible sleep policies. One basic question that arises is: which policy performsbest under a certain condition? Furthermore; what are the optimal parameters for a givenpolicy? To answer these questions; we formulate an optimization problem; which entails costminimization for a given parameterized policy and selection of the best policy among aclass. We propose a cost function which captures the inherent tradeoff of delay and energysaving. This takes into account the cost of response time due to the extra sleep; the energysaving during the sleep; and the cost for periodic waking up (for listening). As an application;we consider IEEE 802.16 e's power saving mechanism. We study various practical …,Wireless Days (WD); 2009 2nd IFIP,2009,6
Reinforcement Learning—A Bridge Between Numerical Methods and Monte Carlo,Vivek S Borkar,Abstract This article advocates the viewpoint that reinforcement learning algorithms;primarily meant for approximate dynamic programming; can also be cast as a technique forestimating stationary averages and stationary distributions of Markov chains. In this role;they lie somewhere between standard deterministic numerical schemes and Markov chainMonte Carlo; and capture a trade-off between the advantages of either–lower per iteratecomputation than the former and lower variance than the latter. Issues arising from the 'curseof dimensionality'and convergence rate are also discussed.,*,2009,6

Control of buffer and energy of a wireless device: Closed and open loop approaches,VS Borkar; AA Kherani; Balakrishna Prabhu,We consider a decision problem faced by an energy limited wireless device that operates indiscrete time. There is some external arrival to the device's transmit buffer. The possibledecisions are a) to serve some of the buffer content; b) to reorder a new battery after servingthe maximum possible amount that it can; and c) to remain idle so that the battery chargecan increase owing to diffusion process (possible in some commercially available battery).We look at both open-loop and closed-loop control of the system. For the closed-loopcontrol; we view the problem in the framework of Markov Decision Processes and addressfinite and infinite horizon discounted costs as well as average cost minimization problems.Without using any second order characteristics; we obtain results that include i) optimality ofbang-bang control; ii) the optimality of threshold based policies; iii) parameteric …,*,2006,6
A convex analytic framework for ergodic control of semi-Markov processes,Shalabh Bhatnagar; Vivek S Borkar,The ergodic control problem for semi-Markov processes is reformulated as an optimizationproblem over the set of suitably defined 'ergodic occupation measures.'This set is shown tobe closed and convex; with its extreme points corresponding to stationary strategies. Thisleads to the existence of optimal stationary strategies under additional hypotheses. Apathwise analysis of the joint empirical occupation measures of the state and controlprocesses shows that this optimality is in the strong (ie; almost sure) sense.,Mathematics of operations research,1995,6
Controlled diffusions with boundary-crossing costs,Vivek S Borkar,In the classical treatment of controlled diffusion processes; we typically consider a cost whichis the expected value of a "nice" functional of the trajectory of the controlled process. This functionalis often the time integral up to a stopping time of a "running cost" function on the state space [1]; [5]. This paper considers a situation where; loosely speaking; the running cost is a Schwartzdistribution rather than a function. The specific case we consider has a natural interpretationas the cost ("toll") associated with the boundary crossings of a prescribed region. The preciseformulation of the problem is as follows: let U be compact metric space and X(-) an Rn-valuedcontrolled diffusion on some probability space described by … * Research supported by AROContract No. DAAG29-84-K-0005 and AFOSR 85-0227. ** Current address: Laboratory for Informationand Decision Systems; Building 35; MIT; Cambridge; MA 02139; USA.,Applied Mathematics and Optimization,1988,6
A stochastic Kaczmarz algorithm for network tomography,Gugan Thoppe; Vivek Borkar; D Manjunath,Abstract We develop a stochastic approximation version of the classical Kaczmarz algorithmthat is incremental in nature and takes as input noisy real time data. Our analysis shows thatwith probability one it mimics the behavior of the original scheme: starting from the sameinitial point; our algorithm and the corresponding deterministic Kaczmarz algorithm convergeto precisely the same point. The motivation for this work comes from network tomographywhere network parameters are to be estimated based upon end-to-end measurements.Numerical examples via Matlab based simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm.,Automatica,2014,5

Risk sensitive optimal control framework applied to delay tolerant networks,Eitan Altman; Veeraruna Kavitha; Francesco De Pellegrini; Vijay Kamble; Vivek Borkar,Epidemics dynamics can describe the dissemination of information in delay tolerantnetworks; in peer to peer networks and in content delivery networks. The control of suchdynamics has thus gained a central role in all of these areas. However; a major difficulty inthis context is that the objective functions to be optimized are often not additive in time butare rather multiplicative. The classical objective function in DTNs; ie; the successful deliveryprobability of a message within a given deadline; falls precisely in this category; because ittakes often the form of the expectation of the exponent of some integral cost. So far; modelsinvolving such costs have been solved by interchanging the order of expectation and theexponential function.

An information theoretic view of stochastic resonance,Venkat Anantharam; Vivek S Borkar,We are motivated by the widely studied phenomenon called stochastic resonance; namelythat in several sensing systems; both natural and engineered; the introduction of noise canenhance the ability of the system to perceive signals in the environment. We adopt aninformation theoretic viewpoint; evaluating the quality of sensing via the mutual informationrate between the environmental signal and the observations. Viewing what would beconsidered noise in stochastic resonance as an open loop control and using Markovdecision theory techniques; we discuss the problem of optimal choice of this control in orderto maximize this mutual information rate. We determine the corresponding dynamicprogramming recursion: it involves the conditional law of certain conditional laws associatedto the dynamics.

Distributed self-tuning of sensor networks,Aditya Karnik; Anurag Kumar; Vivek Borkar,Abstract This work is motivated by the need for an ad hoc sensor network to autonomouslyoptimise its performance for given task objectives and constraints. Arguing thatcommunication is the main bottleneck for distributed computation in a sensor network weformulate two approaches for optimisation of computing rates. The first is a team problem formaximising the minimum communication throughput of sensors and the second is a gameproblem in which cost for each sensor is a measure of its communication time with itsneighbours. We investigate adaptive algorithms using which sensors can tune to the optimalchannel attempt rates in a distributed fashion. For the team problem; the adaptive scheme isa stochastic gradient algorithm derived from the augmented Lagrangian formulation of theoptimisation problem.

Mathematical programming embeddings of logic,Vivek S Borkar; Vijay Chandru; Sanjoy K Mitter,Abstract Can theorem proving in mathematical logic be addressed by classical mathematicaltechniques like the calculus of variations? The answer is surprisingly in the affirmative; andthis approach has yielded rich dividends from the dual perspective of better understandingof the mathematical structure of deduction and in improving the efficiency of algorithms fordeductive reasoning. Most of these results have been for the case of propositional andprobabilistic logics. In the case of predicate logic; there have been successes in adaptingmathematical programming schemes to realize new algorithms for theorem proving usingpartial instantiation techniques.

Hamiltonian cycle problem and Markov chains,Vivek S Borkar; Vladimir Ejov; Jerzy A Filar; Giang T Nguyen,This research monograph summarizes a line of research that maps certain classicalproblems of discrete mathematics and operations research-such as the Hamiltonian Cycleand the Travelling Salesman Problems-into convex domains where continuum analysis canbe carried out. Arguably; the inherent difficulty of these; now classical; problems stemsprecisely from the discrete nature of domains in which these problems are posed. Theconvexification of domains underpinning these results is achieved by assigning probabilisticinterpretation to key elements of the original deterministic problems.

The value function in ergodic control of diffusion processes with partial observations II,Vivek S Borkar,Abstract. The problem of minimizing the ergodic or time-averaged cost for a controlleddiffusion with partial observations can be recast as an equivalent control problem for theassociated nonlinear filter. In analogy with the completely observed case; one may seek thevalue function for this problem as the vanishing discount limit of value functions for theassociated discounted cost problems. This passage is justified here for the scalar caseunder a stability hypothesis; leading in particular to a “martingale” formulation of the dynamicprogramming principle. 1. Introduction. The usual approach to control of partially observeddiffusions is via the equivalent “separated” control problem for the associated nonlinear filter.This approach has proved quite successful for the finite horizon and infinite horizondiscounted costs.(See; eg; Borkar (1989); Chapter V.)

In this spirit; wepropose a reinforcement learning algorithm for PageRank computation that is fashionedafter analogous schemes for approximate dynamic programming.

Under the assumption of uniform stability; weestablish the existence of a solution to the Isaac's equation for the ergodic game andcharacterize the optimal stationary strategies. The data is not assumed to be bounded; nordo we assume geometric ergodicity. Thus our results extend previous work in the literature.We also study a relative value iteration scheme that takes the form of a parabolic Isaac'sequation. Under the hypothesis of geometric ergodicity we show that the relative valueiteration converges to the elliptic Isaac's equation as time goes to infinity. We use theseresults to establish convergence of the relative value iteration for risk-sensitive controlproblems under an asymptotic flatness assumption.,*,2013,3

Some examples of stochastic approximation in communications,Vivek S Borkar,Stochastic approximation [16] is a tried and tested paradigm for adaptive algo- rithms; whichexploit its incrementality (leading to graceful convergence); low per iterate computational andmemory requirements; and its 'averaging' prop- erty which makes it ideal for noisy situations.While it retains its place of pride in its traditional application domains such as adaptive controland signal process- ing; it has also found new applications in communications; such as in adaptiveresource allocation problems arising in wireless and wireline networks. This is a brief summaryof some key paradigms that fall in this category.

Generalized replicator dynamics as a model of specialization and diversity in societies,Vivek S Borkar; Sanjay Jain; Govindan Rangarajan,We consider a generalization of replicator dynamics as a non-cooperative evolutionarygame-theoretic model of a community of N agents. All agents update their individual mixedstrategy profiles to increase their total payoff from the rest of the community. The propertiesof attractors in this dynamics are studied. Evidence is presented that under certainconditions the typical attractors of the system are corners of state space where each agenthas specialized to a pure strategy; and/or the community exhibits diversity; ie; all strategiesare represented in the final states. The model suggests that new pure strategies whosepayoff matrix elements satisfy suitable inequalities with respect to the existing ones candestabilize existing attractors if N is sufficiently large; and be regarded as innovations thatenhance the diversity of the community.,Advances in Complex Systems,1998,3
There’s no such thing as a free lunch,Vivek S Borkar,Many years ago when I was with an institution inhabited by mathematicians andastronomers; a story was making the rounds of the place.

"No"; said the mathematician; "on date suchand such and time so and so; there existed in the Western Ghats a cow the left half of whosebody appeared black at that time" … Clearly; both are missing something. The astronomer makesa simplistic but flawed generalisation. The mathematician is accurate to a fault; but won't makeeven the obvious extrapolations.

On the Milito-Cruz adaptive control scheme for Markov chains,VS Borkar,Abstract Milito and Cruz have introduced a novel adaptive control scheme for finite Markovchains when a finite parametrized family of possible transition matrices is available.

A comparison principle for certain convex functionals of a diffusion process without drift,Vivek S Borkar,Suppose one has two d-dimensional diffusion processes with zero drift and diffusionmatrices trl (-); tr2 (-) respectively such that o'1o-~ x dominates tr2tr~" in the followingsense:]]~(x) Tyll2~>]] tr2 (x) Tyl] 2 for x; y~ R a. Then one would expect the first diffusion to bemore'random'than the second in some precise sense. The results of this note confirm thisintuition for the special case when one of the two is a Brownian motion. The precisestatement of this result (Theorem 1 below) follows after we introduce some notation.

The Nisio semigroup for controlled diffusions with partial observations,Vivek S Borkar,A one parameter semigroup of nonlinear operators on an appropriate Banach space isconstructed in the spirit of Nisio for controlled diffusions with partial observations. Themethod is based upon considering an equivalent problem of controlling a measure-valuedprocess representing the conditional law of the state given past observations. The latterevolves according to the usual equations of nonlinear filtering. By considering anappropriate augmentation of the class of controls; it is shown that the “minimum cost”operators associated with this control problem indeed form a semigroup of nonlinearcontractions on the space of bounded continuous real-valued functions on the state space ofthe above measure-valued process.,Stochastics: An International Journal of Probability and Stochastic Processes,1986,3
Opportunistic scheduling as restless bandits,Vivek S Borkar; Gaurav S Kasbekar; Sarath Pattathil; Priyesh Shetty,In this paper we consider energy efficient scheduling in a multiuser setting where each userhas a finite sized queue and there is a cost associated with holding packets (jobs) in eachqueue (modeling the delay constraints). The packets of each user need to be sent over acommon channel. The channel qualities seen by the users are time-varying and differ acrossusers; also; the cost incurred; ie; energy consumed; in packet transmission is a function ofthe channel quality. We pose the problem as an average cost Markov Decision Problem;and prove that this problem is Whittle Indexable. Based on this result; we propose analgorithm in which the Whittle index of each user is computed and the user who has thelowest value is selected for transmission. We evaluate the performance of this algorithm viasimulations and show that it achieves a lower average cost than the Maximum Weight …,IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems,2017,2
Temporally agnostic rumor-source detection,Ankit Kumar; Vivek S Borkar; Nikhil Karamchandani,We revisit the problem of inferring the source of a rumor on a network; given a snapshot ofthe extent of its spread. We differ from prior work in two aspects: We consider settings whereadditional relative information about the infection times of a fraction of node pairs is alsoavailable to the estimator and instead of only considering the most likely spreading pattern;we take a complementary approach where our estimator for general networks ranks eachnode based on counting the number of possible spreading patterns with a given node asroot that are compatible with the observations. We first consider the case where additionalinformation is available about infection incidents in the form of a set of directed pairs ofneighboring nodes with the implication that the first is known to have infected the second.Under this hypothesis; we derive an estimator for the most likely rumor source based on …,IEEE Transactions on Signal and Information Processing over Networks,2017,2

Fast rumor source identification via random walks,Alankar Jain; Vivek Borkar; Dinesh Garg,Abstract We consider the problem of inferring the source of a rumor in a given large network.We assume that the rumor propagates in the network through a discrete time susceptible-infected model. Input to our problem includes information regarding the entire network; aninfected subgraph of the network observed at some known time instant; and the probabilityof one-hop rumor propagation.

Who is the fairest of them all?,Vivek S Borkar; Rahul M Makhijani,I. INTRODUCTION The so called 'gossip algorithm' has been a popular framework for formulationof distributed schemes for in-network computation. Some of the problems that have been addressedin this framework are: consensus / averaging; finding the maximum or minimum; computationof separable functions; etc.; an excellent survey of which can be found in [30]. A more recentapplication is a scheme for clock synchronization [29]. Our aim here is to broach yet anotherclass of problems that seems amenable to gossip based computation; viz.; computing thePerron-Frobenius eigenvector of a non-negative matrix. The latter has been a popular meansof ranking and related evaluative exercises; particularly with the success of PageRank [22]. Thisalso remains our motivation (and raison d'etre for the title).

Graph enumeration,Vivek S Borkar; Vladimir Ejov; Jerzy A Filar; Giang T Nguyen,Abstract Graph enumeration is a study in graph theory that deals with countingnonisomorphic graphs that have a particular property. Harary and Palmer [58] provide anexcellent introduction to the topic of graph enumeration. On counting labeled cubic graphs;there has been a series of results; most notably Read [86]; Read [87]; Wormald [101]; andWormald [102]; which collectively present various approaches for counting labeled cubicgraphs; and labeled cubic graphs with a given connectivity. In comparison to labeled cubicgraphs; the numeration of unlabeled cubic graphs is a significantly more challengingproblem [102]. In 1977; Robinson [88] presented a method to count unlabeled cubic graphs.,*,2012,2
Convergence analysis for an online recommendation system,Anh Truong; Negar Kiyavash; Vivek Borkar,Online recommendation systems use votes from experts or other users to recommendobjects to customers. We propose a recommendation algorithm that uses an average weightupdating rule and prove its convergence to the best expert and derive an upper bound on itsloss. Often times; recommendation algorithms make assumptions that do not hold in practicesuch as requiring a large number of the good objects; presence of experts with the exactsame taste as the user receiving the recommendation; or experts who vote on all or majorityof objects. Our algorithm relaxes these assumptions. Besides theoretical performanceguarantees; our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms currentstate-of-the-art recommendation algorithm; Dsybil.,Decision and Control and European Control Conference (CDC-ECC); 2011 50th IEEE Conference on,2011,2
Optimal distributed uplink channel allocation: a constrained mdp formulation,Vivek S Borkar; Joy Kuri,Abstract Several users share a common channel for transmission; which has an averagerate constraint. The packets not yet transmitted are queued. The problem of optimal channelallocation to minimize the average sum queue occupancy subject to this constraint splits intoindividual Markov decision processes (MDPs) coupled through the Lagrange multiplier forthe rate constraint. This multiplier can be computed by an on-line stochastic gradient ascentin a centralized or distributed manner. This gives a stochastic dynamic version of Kelly'sdecomposition.

Finite dimensional approximation and Newton-based algorithm for stochastic approximation in Hilbert space,Ankur A Kulkarni; Vivek S Borkar,Abstract This paper presents a finite dimensional approach to stochastic approximation ininfinite dimensional Hilbert space. The problem was motivated by applications in the field ofstochastic programming wherein we minimize a convex function defined on a Hilbert space.We define a finite dimensional approximation to the Hilbert space minimizer. A justification isprovided for this finite dimensional approximation. Estimates of the dimensionality neededare also provided. The algorithm presented is a two time-scale Newton-based stochasticapproximation scheme that lives in this finite dimensional space. Since the finitedimensional problem can be prohibitively large dimensional; we operate our Newtonscheme in a projected; randomly chosen smaller dimensional subspace.,Automatica,2009,2
Convergence of population dynamics in symmetric routing games with a finite number of playersz,Eitan Altman; Vijay Kambley; Vivek Borkar,Routing games; as introduced in the pioneering work of Orda; Rom and Shimkin (1993); arevery closely related to the traffic assignment problems as already studied by Wardrop and tocongestion games; as introduced by Rosenthal. But they exhibit more complex behavior:often the equilibrium is not unique; and computation of equilibria is typically harder. Theycannot be transformed in general into an equivalent global optimization problem as is thecase with congestion games and in the traffic assignment problem which possess a potentialunder fairly general conditions. In this paper we study convergence of various learningschemes to an equilibrium in the problem of routing games. We are able to considerablyextend previous published results [1] that were restricted to routing into two parallel links.

Cooperative dynamics and Wardrop equilibria,Vivek S Borkar,This work considers a network game with large number of users; whereby each individual useris perforce a 'small user'. The user on entering the network sees several alternative routes andpicks one according to a rule which places a high probability on the utility-maximizingroute(s); and a smaller probability on others; depending on their utility. The utility in turn dependson the congestion level. We show that this leads to approximate Wardrop equilibria; ie; to steadystate behavior wherein the traffic concentrates on routes that maximize utility. An accompanyingdynamic pricing scheme is also analyzed and shown to converge to a stable price profile in anappropriate sense … The next section describes the user dynamics and its equilibriumbehavior. The correspondence with Wardrop equilibria is established in Section 3. Section 4describes the dynamic pricing scheme.

A Fresh Look at Markov Decision Processes.,Vivek S Borkar,This paper develops a new framework for the study of Markov decision processes in whichthe control problem is viewed as an optimization problem on the set of canonically inducedmeasures on the trajectory space of the joint state and control process. This set is shown tobe compact convex. One then associates with each of the usual cost criteria (infinite horizondiscounted cost; finite horizon; control up to an exit time) a naturally defined occupationmeasure such that the cost is an integral of some function with reapect to this measure.These measures are shown to form a compact convex set whose extreme points arecharacterized. Classical results about existence of optimal strategies are recovered from thisand several applications to multicriteria and constrained optimization problems are brieflyindicated.,*,1987,2

Using constructs from reinforcement learning for variance reduction in particlefilters; a simulation based scheme is developed for estimating the partially observed log-likelihood function. A Kiefer-Wolfowitz like stochastic approximation scheme maximizes thisfunction over the unknown parameter. The two procedures are performed on two differenttime scales; emulating the alternatingexpectation'andmaximization'operations of the EMalgorithm. Numerical experiments are presented in support of the proposed scheme.,Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA); 2014,2014,1

Markov decision processes,Vivek S Borkar; Vladimir Ejov; Jerzy A Filar; Giang T Nguyen,Abstract Markov chains are useful in describing many discrete event stochastic processes;however; they are not exible enough to model situations where we have to make decisionsto control the future trajectories of the system. For this reason; the theory of Markov decisionprocesses (MDPs); also known as controlled Markov chains; has been developed. Inparticular; in the context of this book; we observe that in any given graph Hamiltonian cycles(if any) correspond to a family of spanning subgraphs inducing very special Markov chainswhose probability transition matrices are a subset of permutation matrices possessing only asingle ergodic class.,*,2012,1
Markov Chains,Vivek S Borkar; Vladimir Ejov; Jerzy A Filar; Giang T Nguyen,Abstract Probabilistic methods have long been applied to solve discrete mathematicsproblems (see; for example; Erdős [38]–[39]; and Alon and Spencer [3] for a recent andcomprehensive treatment on probabilistic methods). Similarly; connections between Markovchains and graph theory have long been made (see Harary [57]). Our contribution here is toapply properties of Markov chains to the Hamiltonian cycle problem and to take advantageof the still emerging theory of perturbed Markov chains in this context.,*,2012,1
Wireless Networks: Model and Optimization based approaches to Clock Synchronization; Random Access MAC and Video Streaming,Nikolaos M Freris,We; via a model and optimization-based approach; address three issues related to wirelessnetworks: clock synchronization; medium access control (MAC) and scalable videostreaming. In Chapter 2 we develop; study and simulate a new model-based distributednetwork clock synchronization protocol. In a network of clocks; a given node is taken asreference and is associated with the time evolution t. We introduce and analyze a stochasticmodel for clocks; in which the relative speedup of a clock with respect to the reference node;called the skew; is characterized by an exponential transformation of an Orstein-Uhlenbeckprocess. We study the properties of our model; namely moment and sample path propertiesof the stochastic processes; and calculate its Allan variance. We show how our model canbe used to translate the time of a clock to another clock's units. We study the problem of …,*,2010,1
Power Efficient Scheduling under Delay Constraints over Multi-user Wireless Channels,Nitin Salodkar; Abhay Karandikar; Vivek S Borkar,Abstract: In this paper; we consider the problem of power efficient uplink scheduling in aTime Division Multiple Access (TDMA) system over a fading wireless channel. The objectiveis to minimize the power expenditure of each user subject to satisfying individual user delay.We make the practical assumption that the system statistics are unknown; ie; the probabilitydistributions of the user arrivals and channel states are unknown. The problem has thestructure of a Constrained Markov Decision Problem (CMDP). Determining an optimal policyunder for the CMDP faces the problems of state space explosion and unknown systemstatistics. To tackle the problem of state space explosion; we suggest determining thetransmission rate of a particular user in each slot based on its channel condition and bufferoccupancy only. The rate allocation algorithm for a particular user is a learning algorithm …,arXiv preprint arXiv:0710.1190,2007,1
Existence of limit occupational measures set used for averaging of singularly perturbed controlled stochastic differential equations,Vivek Borkar; Vladimir Gaitsgory,We establish that; under certain conditions; the set of occupational measures as well as theset of mathematical expectations of occupational measures generated by the admissiblecontrols and the corresponding solutions of a controlled stochastic differential equation(CSDE) converge (with the time horizon tending to infinity) to a set called limit occupationalmeasures set (LOMS) and we show that this limit set coincides with the set of stationarymarginal distributions of the CSDE.

Randomized neural networks for learning stochastic dependences,Vivek S Borkar; Piyush Gupta,We consider the problem of learning the dependence of one random variable on another;from a finite string of independently identically distributed (iid) copies of the pair. Theproblem is first converted to that of learning a function of the latter random variable and anindependent random variable uniformly distributed on the unit interval. However; this cannotbe achieved using the usual function learning techniques because the samples of theuniformly distributed random variables are not available. We propose a novel loss function;the minimizer of which results in an approximation to the needed function. Throughsuccessive approximation results (suggested by the proposed loss function); a suitable classof functions represented by combination feedforward neural networks is selected as theclass to learn from. These results are also extended for countable as well as continuous …,IEEE Transactions on Systems; Man; and Cybernetics; Part B (Cybernetics),1999,1

Logic and mathematical programming,Sanjoy K Mitter; V Borkar; V Chandru; D Micciancio,A fundamental problem in logic is determining whether a formula is satisfiable; ie thereexists a valuation for the variables occurring in the formula that makes the whole formulatrue. Logical deduction can be easily reduced to satisfiability: formula Ē is a logicalconsequence of a set of formulas A if and only if the set of formulas AU {-Ē} is unsatisfiable.Therefore algorithms to decide the satisfiability of formulas can immediately be turned intoprocedures for logical deduction and automated reasoning. In fact; the first serious studies ofspatial embeddings of logic [5; 4] have been primarily aimed to transfer methodologies andalgorithms from the field of mathematical programming to the symbolic world ofcomputational logic. A new perspective on these studies is presented in [3]. In [3] theembedding of logic into mathematical programming is used to prove some well known …,*,1997,1

The objective is that thetime averaged vector cost meets prescribed asymptotic bounds. Under mild assumptions; itis shown that the scheme achieves the desired objective.,Systems & Control Letters,2018,*

Blind; Adaptive and Robust Flow Segmentation in Datacenters,Francesco De Pellegrini; Lorenzo Maggi; Antonio Massaro; J Leguay; D Saucez; Eitan Altman,Abstract—To optimize routing of flows in datacenters; SDN controllers receive a packet-inmessage whenever a new flow appears in the network. Unfortunately; flow arrival rates canpeak to millions per second; impairing the ability of controllers to treat them on time. Flowscheduling copes with such sheer numbers by segmenting the traffic between elephant andmice flows and by treating elephant flows in priority; as they disrupt short lived TCP flowsand create bottlenecks. We propose a learning algorithm called SOFIA and able to performoptimal online flow segmentation. Our solution; based on stochastic approximationtechniques; is implemented at the switch level and updated by the controller; with minimalsignaling over the control channel. SOFIA is blind; ie; it is oblivious to the flow sizedistribution. It is also adaptive; since it can track traffic variations over time.

Metastability in Stochastic Replicator Dynamics,Konstantin Avrachenkov; Vivek S Borkar,Abstract: We consider a novel model of stochastic replicator dynamics for potential gamesthat converts to a Langevin equation on a sphere after a change of variables. This is distinctfrom the models studied earlier. In particular; it is ill-posed due to non-uniqueness ofsolutions; but is amenable to a natural selection principle that picks a unique solution. Themodel allows us to make specific statements regarding metastable states such as smallnoise asymptotics for mean exit times from their domain of attraction; and quasi-stationarymeasures. We illustrate the general results by specializing them to replicator dynamics ongraphs and demonstrate that the numerical experiments support theoretical predictions.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.02161,2018,*
Linear and dynamic programming approaches to degenerate risk-sensitive reward processes,Vivek S Borkar,Risk-sensitive control of finite Markov chains over infinite time horizon has been extensively studiedbeginning with [19]; [20] in the 'cost minimization' framework. It has been extended subsequentlyto more general state spaces and to continuous time problems [4]; [5]; [18]; [21]; [22]; [23];[27]; [28]. The standard approach has been the one pioneered in [19]; [20]; [21]; viz.; to use thecelebrated logarithmic transformation to convert it into an equivalent zero sum ergodic gameand analyze the latter. For compact state spaces; an alternative approach based on nonlinearvariants of the Krein-Rutman theorem was developed in [1]; [2]. Of these; the former considersreward maximization as opposed to cost minimization. Unlike in classical problems such as discountedor ergodic cost; the two are not equivalent in the risk-sensitive case.

The error in approximation of the value function; however; results in suboptimalpolicies.

The latter approach is distributedby its nature and can be easily implemented onseveral processors or over the network. Boththeoretical and practical evaluations areprovided.

Greedy Block Coordinate Descent (GBCD) Method for Quadratic Programming in High Dimensions,Gugan Thoppe; Vivek S Borkar; Dinesh Garg,High dimensional unconstrained quadratic programs (UQPs) involving massive datasets arenow common in application areas such as web; social networks; etc. Unless computationalresources that match up to these datasets are available; solving such problems usingclassical UQP methods is very difficult. This paper discusses alternatives. We first definehigh dimensional compliant (HDC) methods for UQPs—methods that can solve highdimensional UQPs by adapting to available computational resources. We then show that theclass of block Kaczmarz and block coordinate descent (BCD) are the only existing methodsthat can be made HDC. As a possible answer to the question of the 'best'amongst BCDmethods for UQP; we propose a novel greedy BCD (GBCD) method with serial; parallel anddistributed variants.

Model-based clock synchronization protocol for wireless sensor networks,Nikolaos Freris; Vivek Borkar; PR Kumar,Abstract: In a wireless sensor network; nodes communicate time-stamped packets in order tosynchronize their clocks; ie; estimate each other's time display. We introduce and analyze aparametrized stochastic model for clocks and use it to calculate; at any given time; theMaximum-Likelihood (ML) estimate of the relative skew/offset between two communicatingnodes. For network synchronization; event-based Kalman-Bucy filtering gives rise to acentralized scheme; and we propose an efficient distributed suboptimal algorithm. We studythe performance both analytically and experimentally and provide provable guarantees. Wesummarize our findings into defining a new distributed model-based clock synchronizationprotocol (MBCSP); and present a comparative simulation study of its accuracy versus priorart to showcase improvements.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1311.6914,2013,*
Markov chains; Hamiltonian cycles and volumes of convex bodies,Vivek S Borkar; Jerzy A Filar,Abstract In this note the Hamiltonian cycle problem is mapped into an infinite horizondiscounted cost constrained Markov decision problem. The occupation measure basedlinear polytope associated with this control problem defines a convex set which either strictlycontains or is equal to another convex set; depending on whether the underlying graph hasa Hamiltonian cycle or not. This allows us to distinguish Hamiltonian graphs from non-Hamiltonian graphs by comparing volumes of two convex sets.,Journal of Global Optimization,2013,*

A relative value iteration for controlled diffusions under ergodic cost,Ari Arapostathis; Vivek S Borkar,The ergodic control problem for a non-degenerate diffusion controlled through its drift isconsidered under a uniform stability condition that ensures the well-posedness of theassociated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. A nonlinear parabolic evolutionequation is then proposed as a continuous time continuous state space analog ofWhite'srelative value iteration'algorithm for solving the ergodic dynamic programmingequation for the finite state finite action case.

LQG CONTROL WITH,VS Borkar; Sanjoy K Mitter,ABSTRACT The average cost control problem for linear stochastic systems with Gaussiannoise and quadratic cost is considered in the presence of communication constraints. Thelatter take the form of finite alphabet codewords; being transmitted to the controller withensuing delay and distortion. It is shown that if instead of the state observations anassociated “innovations process” is encoded and transmitted; then the separation principleholds; leading to an optimal control linear in state estimate. An associated “off-line”optimization problem for code length selection is formulated. Some possible extensions arealso pointed out.,Communications; Computation; Control; and Signal Processing: a tribute to Thomas Kailath,2012,*

Wefollow the graph terminology and conventions from Harary [57]; where the reader can find anexcellent introduction to graph theory.

Linear Programming Based Algorithms,Vivek S Borkar; Vladimir Ejov; Jerzy A Filar; Giang T Nguyen,Abstract In Chapter 4; we showed that when a graph is embedded in a suitably constructedMarkov decision process; the associated convex domain of discounted occupationalmeasures is a polyhedron with extreme points corresponding to all spanning subgraphs ofthe given graph. Furthermore; from Theorem 4.1 we learned that a simple cut of the abovedomain yields a polyhedron the extreme points of which correspond to only two possibletypes: Hamiltonian cycles and convex combinations of short and noose cycles. Theseproperties; naturally; suggest certain algorithmic approaches to searching for Hamiltoniancycles.,*,2012,*
Illustrative Graphs,Vivek S Borkar; Vladimir Ejov; Jerzy A Filar; Giang T Nguyen,Abstract Sir William Rowan Hamilton (1805–1865) was a famous mathematician andphysicist; well-known for his vast contribution in various fields such as optics; classicalmechanics and algebra. However; it is a lesser known fact that Sir William was the inventorof a commercial game; the mathematically generalised version of which later became one ofthe most difficult graph theoretic problems. Towards the end of his life; in 1857; Sir WilliamRowan Hamilton designed a game called Icosian.,*,2012,*
Interior Point and Cross-Entropy Algorithms,Vivek S Borkar; Vladimir Ejov; Jerzy A Filar; Giang T Nguyen,Abstract In this chapter; we brie y discuss two recent algorithms that exploit two moderntrends in optimisation in the context of our stochastic embedding of the Hamiltonian cycleproblem: the interior point method and the importance sampling method. In particular; thefirst algorithm searches in the interior of the convex domain of doubly stochastic matricesinduced by a given graph; with the goal of converging to an extreme point corresponding toa permutation matrix that coincides with a Hamiltonian cycle.,*,2012,*
Determinants,Vivek S Borkar; Vladimir Ejov; Jerzy A Filar; Giang T Nguyen,Abstract Ejov et al.[34] embed the Hamiltonian cycle problem in a limiting average Markovdecision process model with an asymmetric linear perturbation defined in (3.14). Theauthors prove that for positive and sufficiently small values of ε; determining the Hamiltonicityof a given graph is equivalent to minimising the top-left element of the fundamental matrix Gof an MDP associated with the given graph; over the space of feasible deterministic policiesFD. The conjecture that the same holds for the larger space FS remains open.,*,2012,*
Traces,Vivek S Borkar; Vladimir Ejov; Jerzy A Filar; Giang T Nguyen,Abstract In this chapter; we present an alternative optimisation model that is equivalent to theHamiltonian cycle problem. We show that instead of minimising top-left elements of thefundamental matrices like in Chapter 3; or maximising the determinant of the inverse of thefundamental matrices like in Chapter 5; one can minimise the traces of the fundamentalmatrices to determine the Hamiltonicity of a given graph. While it is unclear whether the tracefunction offers an algorithmic advantage over the top-left element or the determinantfunctions; the trace operator is certainly well studied and frequently employed.,*,2012,*
Self-similar Structure and Hamiltonicity,Vivek S Borkar; Vladimir Ejov; Jerzy A Filar; Giang T Nguyen,Abstract The class of cubic graphs provides a convenient “laboratory” for studyingHamiltonicity. This is because the Hamiltonian cycle problem is already NP-complete for thisclass and because there is freely available; reliable; software for enumerating all connectedcubic graphs with N vertices (see; for example; Meringer [77]). This offers an opportunity tostudy the whole populations of these graphs with the goal of understanding the specialnature of those members of that population that correspond to non-Hamiltonian graphs.,*,2012,*

This is motivated by the emergent applications incommunications. The proofs are based on comparing suitably interpolated iterates with alimiting ordinary differential equation.

Stochastic approximation with ‘bad’noise,VS Borkar,It is well known that the noise processes in the Internet and several other situations arising incommunications exhibit long range dependent and heavy tailed behaviour; a fact which hasalso been theoretically justified through limit theorems such as that of Mikosch; Resnick;Rootzen and Stegeman. Motivated by this; we consider stability and convergence propertiesof stochastic approximation algorithms when the noise includes a long range dependentcomponent (modeled by a fractional Brownian motion) and a heavy tailed component(modeled by a symmetric stable process); in addition to the usual'martingale noise'.

Multiple Timescales,Vivek S Borkar,Abstract In the preceding chapters we have used a fixed stepsize schedule a (n) for allcomponents of the iterations in stochastic approximation. In the 'ode approach'to theanalysis of stochastic approximation; these are viewed as discrete nonuniform time steps.Thus one can conceive of the possibility of using different stepsize schedules for differentcomponents of the iteration; which will then induce different timescales into the algorithm.We shall consider the case of two timescales first; following Borkar (1996). Thus we areinterested in the iterations (6.1. 1) x n+ 1= x n+ a (n) h (xn; yn)+ M n+ 1 (1) x_ n+ 1= x_n+a\left (n\right)\left h\left (x_n; y_n\right)+ M_ n+ 1^\left (1\right)\right;(6.1. 2) y n+ 1= y n+ b (n)g (xn; yn)+ M n+ 1 (2) y_ n+ 1= y_n+ b\left (n\right)\left g\left (x_n; y_n\right)+ M_ n+ 1^\left(2\right)\right; where h: ℛ d+ k→ ℛ d; g: ℛ d+ k→ ℛ k are Lipschitz and M n (1); M n (2) are …,*,2008,*
Lock-in Probability,Vivek S Borkar,Abstract Recall the urn model of Chapter 1. When there are multiple isolated stableequilibria; it turns out that there can be a positive probability of convergence to one of theseequilibria which is not; however; necessarily among the desired ones. This; we recall; wasthe explanation for several instances of adoption of one particular convention or technologyas opposed to another. The idea is that after some initial randomness; the process becomesessentially 'locked into'the domain of attraction of a particular equilibrium; ie; locked into aparticular choice of technology or convention. With this picture in mind; we define the lock-inprobability as the probability of convergence to an asymptotically stable attractor; given thatthe iterate is in a neighbourhood thereof. Our aim here will be to get a lower bound on thisprobability and explore some of its consequences. Our treatment follows the approach of …,*,2008,*
Basic Convergence Analysis,Vivek S Borkar,Abstract In this chapter we begin our formal analysis of the stochastic approximation schemein ℛ d given by (2.1. 1) x n+ 1= x n+ a (n) h (xn)+ M n+ 1; n≥ 0 x_ n+ 1= x_n+ a\left(n\right)\left h\left (x_n\right)+ M_ n+ 1\right; n\geqslant 0; with prescribed x 0 and with thefollowing assumptions which we recall from the last chapter:(A1) The map h: ℛ d→ ℛ d isLipschitz:∥ h (x)—h (y)∥≤ L∥ x− y∥ for some 0< L<∞.(A2) Stepsizes a (n) are positivescalars satisfying (2.1. 2)∑ na (n)=∞;∑ na (n) 2<∞ ∑\limits_n a\left (n\right)= ∞;\; ∑ a\left(n\right)^ 2< ∞.(A3)(A3) M n is a martingale difference sequence with respect to theincreasing family of σ-fields F n= def σ (xm; M m; m≤ n)= σ (x 0; M 1;…; M n); n≥ 0F_n\mathop=\limits^ def σ\left (x_m; M_m; m\leqslant n\right)= σ\left (x_0; M_1; ...; M_n\right);n\geqslant 0.

Stability Criteria,Vivek S Borkar,Abstract In this chapter we discuss a couple of schemes for establishing the asboundedness of iterates assumed above. The convergence analysis of the precedingchapter has some universal applicability; but the situation is different for stability criteria.There are several variations of stability criteria applicable under specific restrictions andsometimes motivated by specific applications for which they are tailor-made.(The secondtest we see below is one such.) We describe only a couple of these variations. The first oneis quite broadly applicable. The second is a bit more specialized; but has been includedbecause it has a distinct flavour and shows how one may tweak known techniques such asstochastic Liapunov functions to obtain new and useful criteria.,*,2008,*
Stochastic Recursive Inclusions,Vivek S Borkar,Abstract This chapter considers an important generalization of the basic stochasticapproximation scheme of Chapter 2; which we call 'stochastic recursive inclusions'. The ideais to replace the map h: ℛ d→ ℛ d in the recursion (2.1. 1) of Chapter 2 by a set-valued maph: ℛ d→ subsets of ℛ d; satisfying the following conditions:(i) For each x∈ ℛ d; h (x) isconvex and compact.(ii) For all x∈ ℛ d;(5.1. 1) sup y∈ h (x)‖ y‖< K (1+‖ x‖)\sup y ∈h\left (x\right)\;\;\left ‖ y\right ‖< K\left (1+\left ‖ x\right ‖\right) for some K> 0.(iii) h is uppersemicontinuous in the sense that if xn→ x and yn→ y with yn∈ h (xn) for n≥ 1; then y∈ h(x).(In other words; the graph of h; defined as (x; y): yh (x); is closed.),*,2008,*
A Limit Theorem for Fluctuations,Vivek S Borkar,Abstract To motivate the results of this chapter; consider the classical strong law of largenumbers: Let X n be iid random variables with EX n= µ; EX n 2<∞. Let S 0= 0; S n= def∑ i=1 n X in; n≥ 1. S_0= 0; S_n\mathop=\limits^ def ∑ _ i= 1^ n X_i n;\; n\geqslant 1.. The stronglaw of large numbers (see; eg; Section 4.2 of Borkar; 1995) states that S nn→ μ; as S_n n →μ;\;\; as. To cast this as a 'stochastic approximation'result; note that some simple algebraicmanipulation leads to S n+ 1= S n+ 1 n+ 1 (X n+ 1− S n)= S n+ 1 n+ 1 (μ− S n+ X n+ 1− μ)= Sn+ a (n)(h (S n)+ M n+ 1)\\quad\quad= S_n+ 1 n+ 1 (μ-S_n+ X_ n+ 1-μ)\\quad\quad= S_n+ a(n)(h (S_n)+ M_ n+ 1) for a (n)= def 1 n+ 1; h (x)= def μ− x∀ x; M n+ 1= def X n+ 1− μ a\left(n\right)\mathop=\limits^ def 1 n+ 1;\;\; h\left (x\right)\mathop=\limits^ def μ-x\; ∀ x; M_ n+1\mathop=\limits^ def X_ n+ 1-μ.

Constant Stepsize Algorithms,Vivek S Borkar,Abstract In many practical circumstances; it is more convenient to use a small constantstepsize a (n)= a∈(0; 1) rather than the decreasing stepsize considered thus far. One suchsituation is when the algorithm is 'hard-wired'and decreasing stepsize may mean additionaloverheads. Another important scenario is when the algorithm is expected to operate in aslowly varying environment (eg; in tracking applications) where it is important that thetimescale of the algorithm remain reasonably faster than the timescale on which theenvironment is changing; for otherwise it would never adapt.,*,2008,*
Asynchronous Schemes,Vivek S Borkar,Abstract Until now we have been considering the case where all components of xn areupdated simultaneously at time n and the outcome is immediately available for the nextiteration. There may; however; be situations when different components are updated bypossibly different processors (these could be in different locations; eg; in remote sensingapplications). Furthermore; each of these components may be running on its own 'clock'andexchanging information with the others with some communication delays. This is thedistributed; asynchronous implementation of the algorithm. The theory we have developedso far does not apply automatically any more and some work is needed to figure out when itdoes and when it doesn't. Another important class of problems which lands us into a similarpredicament consists of the multiagent learning or optimization schemes when each …,*,2008,*
Quasi-stationary distributions as centrality measures of reducible graphs,Konstantin Avrachenkov; Vivek Borkar; Danil Nemirovsky,Abstract: Random walk can be used as a centrality measure of a directed graph. However; ifthe graph is reducible the random walk will be absorbed in some subset of nodes and willnever visit the rest of the graph. In Google PageRank the problem was solved byintroduction of uniform random jumps with some probability. Up to the present; there is noclear criterion for the choice this parameter. We propose to use parameter-free centralitymeasure which is based on the notion of quasi-stationary distribution. Specifically wesuggest four quasi-stationary based centrality measures; analyze them and conclude thatthey produce approximately the same ranking. The new centrality measures can be appliedin spam detection to detect``link farms''and in image search to find photo albums. Subjects:Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.

Power Optimal Opportunistic Scheduling in Fading Wireless Channel,Abhijeet Bhorkar; Abhay Karandikar; Vivek S Borkar,Abstract In this paper; we propose a power optimal opportunistic scheduling scheme for amultiuser single hop Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) system. We formulate theproblem of minimizing average transmission power subject to minimum rate constraints forindividual users. We suggest a stochastic approximation based scheme to implement thepolicy and prove the convergence and stability of this algorithm. We demonstrate throughsimulations that the algorithm converges to optimal policy in reasonable iterations for it to bepractically useful. Our algorithm is applicable for independent and identically distributed (iid)as well as Markovian channel fading. Finally; we extend the power optimal schedulingalgorithm for providing temporal fairness among users.,*,2006,*
HJB Equations for Ergodic Control Problems for Constrained Diffusions in Polyhedral Domains.,Vivek Borkar; Amarjit Budhiraja,Recently in [10] an ergodic control problem for a class of diffusion processes; constrained totake values in a polyhedral cone; was considered. The main result of that paper was thatunder appropriate conditions on the model; there is a Markov control for which the infimumof the cost function is attained. In the current work we characterize the value of the ergodiccontrol problem via a suitable Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. The theory ofexistence and uniqueness of classical solutions; for PDEs in domains with corners andreflection fields which are oblique; discontinuous and multi-valued on corners; is notavailable. We show that the natural HJB equation for the ergodic control problem admits aunique continuous viscosity solution which enables us to characterize the value function ofthe control problem. The existence of a solution to this HJB equation is established via the …,Decision and Control; 2005 and 2005 European Control Conference. CDC-ECC'05. 44th IEEE Conference on,2005,*
Discrete-Time Markov Chains [Book Review],VS Borkar,Perturbation theory of dynamical systems deals with situations in which the dynamics can beviewed as a small perturbation of another underlying dynamics by an additional componentweighted by a small parameter ϵ> 0. As ϵ↓ 0; the dynamics reduce to the underlyingdynamics. The perturbation is said to be regular if there is no drastic qualitative change inthe dynamics during the passage to the limit ϵ↓ 0. If there is such a change; then theperturbation is singular. The precise meaning of this condition depends on the context. Forexample; the perturbation of an ordinary differential equation is singular if; in the limit; thedimension of its state space suddenly drops by one or more. Thus the perturbation of x (t)= f(x (t)) to x (t)= f (x (t))+ ϵg (x (t)) with a nice g (·) is regular; whereas the perturbation of thedifferential-algebraic system x (t)= f (x (t); y (t)); g (x (t); y (t))= 0; to x (t)= f (x (t); y (t)); ϵ y (t) …,IEEE Control Systems,2005,*
Correction To “Transmission Rate Control Over Randomly Varying Channels”,Gauresh Rajadhyaksha; Vivek S Borkar,We consider a system consisting of a server alternating between two service points. At both servicepoints; there is an infinite queue of customers that have to undergo a preparation phase beforebeing served. We are interested in the waiting time of the server. The waiting time of the serversatisfies an equation very similar to Lindley's equation for the waiting time in the GI/G/1queue. We will analyze this Lindley-type equation under the assumptions that the preparationphase follows a phase-type distribution; whereas the service times have a generaldistribution. If we relax the condition that the server alternates between the service points; thenthe model turns out to be the machine repair problem. Although the latter is a well-knownproblem; the distribution of the waiting time of the server has not been studied yet. We derivethis distribution under the same setting and we compare the two models numerically. As …,Probability in the Engineering and Informational Sciences,2005,*

Evolutionary Mechanisms of Organization in Complex Systems,Vivek S Borkar; Sanjay Jain; Govindan Rangarajan,Abstract One of the central themes of present day complex systems research is howorganization emerges in a system of several interacting agents. This involves bothidentification of features associated with our intuitive notions of organization and formulationof simple dynamic models that provide how these might emerge in a model system. One ofthe frontrunners in the latter domain has been evolutionary game dynamics and its variants.These were originally proposed and studied extensively by mathematical biologists assimple models of ecosystems; and in more recent times by economists as models of learningby boundedly rational agents in macroeconomics.

Design and Implementation of SeTiA: Secure Multi Auction System II: Architecture and Implementation Issues,VS Borkar; Mehul S Dave; RK Shyamasundar,ABSTRACT In this two part paper; we describe the design and implementation of a secureonline e-auction system called SeTiA (Secure TIFR Auction System). Various protocols havebeen developed/adapted to cater to different auction mechanisms; negotiations; payments;certified email; etc. Specifically; the system includes the classical auctions (English; Dutch;sealed bid first and second price); multi-unit bids; combinational (bundle) auctions; and callmarkets (wherein buyers and sellers are matched repeatedly over time). Further; the systemprovides features such as bid confidentiality (open or sealed); bid cancellations; identityconfidentiality; auction closure (expiration time or timeout). With the growing number ofonline transactions over the Internet; security of negotiations and transactions is a seriousissue. In this system; we achieve various levels of security using the SPKI/SDSI …,Journal of Intelligent Systems,2005,*
The'ODE'Approach to Stochastic Approximation,VivekS Borkar,ABSTRACT There is a renewed interest in the stochastic approximation algorithmintroduced by Robbins and Monro fifty years ago because of novel applications inengineering (adaptive filters; neural network training; simulation-based optimization) andeconomic modelling (increasing returns; learning by boundedly rational economic agents).This has spurred considerable amount of work on its mathematical analysis. A significantpart of this work draws upon the'ode'(for ordinary differential equations) approach pioneeredby Ljung which analyses the algorithm in terms of a limiting ode This article is an expositorysurvey of this approach; taking stock of some recent developments.,Mathematical Models for Bioengineering and Probabilistic Systems,2005,*

" Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Rm. 35-210,A Nedić; DP Bertsekas; VS Borkar,We propose and analyze a distributed asynchronous subgradient method for minimizing aconvex function that consists of the sum of a large number of component functions. This typeof minimization arises in a dual context from Lagrangian relaxation of the couplingconstraints of large scale separable problems. The idea is to distribute the computation ofthe component subgradients among a set of processors; which communicate only with acoordinator. The coordinator performs the subgradient iteration incrementally andasynchronously; by taking steps along the subgradients of the component functions that areavailable at the update time. The incremental approach has performed very well incentralized computation; and the parallel implementation should improve its performancesubstantially; particularly for typical problems where computation of the component …,Inherently Parallel Algorithms in Feasibility and Optimization and their Applications,2001,*

CORRECTION TO “THE VALUE FUNCTION IN ERGODIC CONTROL OF DIFFUSION PROCESSES WITH PARTIAL OBSERVATIONS II”,VS Borkar,In the above article [1]; there is an error in the proof of Lemma 3.1: The claim that it followsfrom (3.3) that V (x; y)= V (x)+ V (y) is a stochastic Lyapunov function for X (·)= X1 (·)+ X2 (·) isnot correct. One needs the following modification: From (3.1) and the argument that followsit; it follows that the invariant probability distributions under arbitrary Markov controls remaintight.

Method in the madness,Vivek S Borkar,All natural scientists and engineers have to live with ran- dom phenomena; be it because of noisymeasurements; plain ignorance or fundamental physical principles. The silver lining is that thereis a method to the madness; if one is willing to wait long enough- the celebrated 'laws' of probabilitytheory ordain some order in the apparent chaos if we make sufficiently many experiments.Ideally; these should be infinitely many; because it is only in the limit of 'large numbers' that thestructure emerges. This article aims to show how; at least in a discrete set-up; a simple countingargument reveals much of this structure. Specifically; the article shows in this discrete set-uphow the idea of 'large deviations' arises and how a handle on the probabilities thereof allowsone to recover some of the more familiar limit theorems of probability from a differentperspective.

Norbert Wiener and engineering,Vivek S Borkar,Wiener's association with control engineering began when he undertook a project on controlof antiaircraft fire from the National Defense Research Council of USA in 1940; with thesecond world war in full swing. The problem was to estimate the position of an aircraft at afixed time in future given noisy measurements of its past trajectory. An important innovationof Wiener here was to cast the problem as a statistical problem; bringing over the machineryof'time series analysis' of statistics to bear upon control and communication engineering. Inthe abstract; the problem can be stated as: Given a stationaryrandom process consisting of a(desired) signal plus (undesired) noise;'filter out" the noise in an appropriate sense andrecover a process of estimates ofthe signal.

Mathematical programming embeddings of logic,Vivek S Borkar,Serious studies on spatial embeddings of logic were initiated by Robert Jeroslow (cf.[16]) alittle over a decade ago. He essentially showed that; by posing inference in logic asmathematical programming problems; we open up the possibility of transfer of methodologyfrom the geometric techniques of mathematical programming to the symbolic world ofcomputational logic. Further; he demonstrated that these two perspectives can generate asymbiosis that adds both in structural insights and effective algorithm design for inference.These embeddings have yielded beautiful structural results relating forward and backwardchaining of logic with linear programming relaxations [4]; resolvents with cutting planes [10;2] and explanation of inference with mathematical programming duality [16; 27].

Conditioning and Martingales,Vivek S Borkar,Abstract Let (Ω; F; P) be a probability space and A; B∈ F events such that P (B)> 0. In thissection we seek to formalize the intuitive content of the phrase “probability of A given (or;equivalently;“conditioned on”) B”. The words “given B” imply prior knowledge of the fact thatthe sample point ω lies in B. It is then natural to consider the reduced probability space (Ω; Fb; P b) with Ω B= B; FB= A∩ BA∈ F (the “trace σ-field”); PB (C)= P (C)/P (B) for C∈ TB; anddefine the probability of A given B; denoted by P (A/B); as PB (A∩ B)= P (AB)/P (B).

Adaptive Control of Markov Processes,Vivek S Borkar,Adaptive control usually refers to a situation wherein one controls a deterministic orstochastic system whose exact dynamics is unknown and has to be learnt'on-line'. The bookunder review is devoted to a specific approach to the adaptive control of discrete timeMarkov processes on a Borel space. This approach; often called the self-tuning or certaintyequivalence approach; generally presupposes the availability of a parametrized family ofmodels one of which corresponds to the true dynamics.(This is in contrast to'non parametric'approaches such as the learning automation model of Van Hee (1978). The author doesconsider one instance of a nonparametric scheme; but bulk of the book deals with theparametric case.) The optimal control for each combination of parameter and state isprecomputed.

It is called" simulated annealing" in analogy with the physical process of slowlycooling a system to take it to its ground state.,*,*,*
Mathematics and Sports,Vivek S Borkar,An early illustration given in the book of the efficacy of mathematics is the board game ofHex; wherein John Nash (of the Nash equilibrium fame) proved that the player who startswill always have a winning strategy. Moving from board games to'real'sports; the authors goon to describe how a tennis game can be modelled as a Markov chain; allowing us toestimate the probabilities of various outcomes. Among the different issues addressed is thequestion of; why five sets?'. Simply put; if the difference in the level of competence of the twoplayers is small; it will be more pronounced in the outcome of the game if the number of setsis larger. Thus it makes sense to have that number as large as possible. Subject to thenatural constraints put by fatigue etc.; five turns out to be a reasonable solution. latter thatcan be amenable to mathematics; This is followed by an entirely different issue …,*,*,*
Norbert Wiener and Control Engineering,Vivek S Borkar,Wiener's association with control engineering began when he undertook a project on controlof antiaircraft fire from the National Defense Research Council of USA in 1940; with thesecond world war in full swing. The problem was to estimate the position of an aircraft at afixed time in future given noisy measurements of its past trajectory. An important innovati onof Wiener here was to cast the problem as a statistical problem; bringing over the machineryof'time series analysis' of statistics to bear upon control and communication engineering. Inthe abstrad; the problem can be stated as: Given a stationary random process consisting afa(desired) signal plus (undesired) noise;'filter our the noise in an appropriate sense andrecover a process of estimates of the signal. That is; one seeks to design a box that takes theformer as input and yields the latter as output; subjedto natural constraints such as …,*,*,*
Singular perturbations in ergodic control,Vivek Borkar,The ergodic control or 'long run average'control problem is considered for diffusions with twotime scales. It is shown that under suitable hypotheses; it can be approximated by anergodic control problem for the slow time scale process alone; with an averaged dynamics inwhich the controlled ergodic occupation measures for the fast process form the control set.This also has implications for infinite horizon risk-sensitive control; which maps to an ergodictwo person stochastic dynamical game after the 'log'transformation.,*,*,*
Evolutionary games with two timescales Vivek S. Borkar,Vivek S Borkar; Sanjay Jain; Govindan Rangarajan,Abstract We consider a two timescale model of learning by economic agents wherein activeor" ontogenetic” learning by individuals takes place on a fast scale and passive or“phylogenetic'learning by society as a whole on a slow scale; each affecting the evolution ofthe other. The former is modelled by the Monte Carlo dynamics of physics; while the latter ismodelled by the replicator dynamics of evolutionary biology. Various qualitative aspects ofthe dynamics are studied in some simple cases; both analytically and numerically; and itsrole as a useful modelling device is emphasized.(c) 1999 Elsevier Science BV All rightsreserved.,*,*,*

Risk sensitive optimal control framework applied to Multi-dimensional delay tolerant networks,Eitan Altman; Veeraruna Kavitha; Francesco De Pellegrini; Vijay Kamble; Vivek Borkar,Abstract—Epidemics dynamics can describe the dissemination of information in delaytolerant networks; in peer to peer networks and in content delivery networks. The control ofsuch dynamics has thus gained a central role in all of these areas. However; a majordifficulty in this context is that the objective functions to be optimized are often not additive intime but are rather multiplicative. The classical objective function in DTNs; ie; the successfuldelivery probability of a message within a given deadline; falls precisely in this category;because it takes often the form of the expectation of the exponent of some integral cost. Sofar; models involving such costs have been solved by interchanging the order of expectationand the exponential function. While reducing the problem to a standard optimal controlproblem; this interchange is only tight in the mean field limit obtained as the population …,*,*,*
Delay Constrained Point to Multi-Point Scheduling in Wireless Fading Channels,Nitin Salodkar; Abhay Karandikar; VS Borkar,Abstract—In this paper we consider the problem of designing a centralized scheduler on thedownlink for satisfying average delay constraints of users having time varying wirelesschannels. We assume that the information regarding the channel and the arrival processesof the users is not known to the scheduler. We formulate the problem as a constrainedoptimization problem where the objective is to maximize the system throughput under userspecified delay constraints. We suggest an online throughput optimal algorithm that satisfiesthe user delay constraints. The algorithm is based on the stochastic gradient method;specifically; the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm. Itattempts to arrive at the optimal scheduling probabilities of the users. Our simulation resultsshow that the algorithm is able to satisfy the user delay requirements even for users …,*,*,*

STOCHASTIC APPROXIMATION WITH LONG RANGE,V ANANTHARAM; VS BORKAR,ABSTRACT: Stability and convergence properties of stochastic approximation algorithmsare analyzed when the noise includes a long range dependent component (modeled by afractional Brownian motion) and a heavy tailed component (modeled by a symmetric stableprocess); in addition to the usual 'martingale noise'. This is motivated by the emergentapplications in communications. The proofs are based on comparing suitably interpolatediterates with a limiting ordinary differential equation. Related issues such as asynchronousimplementations; Markov noise; etc. are briefly discussed.,*,*,*
