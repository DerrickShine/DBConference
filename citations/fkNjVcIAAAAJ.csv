Web services,Gustavo Alonso; Fabio Casati; Harumi Kuno; Vijay Machiraju,Abstract In previous chapters we have discussed the architecture of information systems(Chapter 1); middleware and enterprise application integration (Chapters 2 and 3); and thebasics of Web technology (Chapter 4). These chapters have shown a chronologicalevolution of the technology used for EAI and for building distributed applications. All thesetechnologies have been rather successful in addressing several of the problems created byapplication integration. The success; however; has been restricted to certain settings (eg;LAN-based systems; homogeneous middleware platforms; etc.). True application integrationrequires tools that go one step beyond what conventional middleware and EAI platformshave achieved. Web services and the associated technology are being leveraged to takesuch a step.,*,2004,3554
Understanding replication in databases and distributed systems,Matthias Wiesmann; Fernando Pedone; André Schiper; Bettina Kemme; Gustavo Alonso,Replication is an area of interest to both distributed systems and databases. The solutionsdeveloped from these two perspectives are conceptually similar but differ in many aspects:model; assumptions; mechanisms; guarantees provided; and implementation. In this paper;we provide an abstract and" neutral" framework to compare replication techniques from bothcommunities. The framework has been designed to emphasize the role played by differentmechanisms and to facilitate comparisons. The paper describes the replication techniquesused in both communities; compares them; and points out ways in which they can beintegrated to arrive to better; more robust replication protocols.,Distributed Computing Systems; 2000.

Advanced transaction models in workflow contexts,Gustavo Alonso; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Mohan Kamath; Roger Gunthor; Chandrasekaran Mohan,In recent years; numerous transaction models have been proposed to address the problemsposed by advanced database applications; but only a few of these models are being used incommercial products. In this paper; we make the case that such models may be too centeredaround databases to be useful in real environments. Advanced applications raise a varietyof issues that are not addressed at all by transaction models. These same issues; however;are the basis for existing workflow systems; which are having considerable success ascommercial products in spite of not having a solid theoretical foundation. We explore someof these issues and show that; in many aspects; workflow models are a superset oftransaction models and have the added advantage of incorporating a variety of ideas thathave so far remained outside the scope of traditional transaction processing.,Data Engineering; 1996.

Exception handling in workflow management systems,Claus Hagen; Gustavo Alonso,Fault tolerance is a key requirement in process support systems (PSS); a class of distributedcomputing middleware encompassing applications such as workflow management systemsand process centered software engineering environments. A PSS controls the flow of workbetween programs and users in networked environments based on a" metaprogram"(theprocess). The resulting applications are characterized by a high degree of distribution and ahigh degree of heterogeneity (properties that make fault tolerance both highly desirable anddifficult to achieve). We present a solution for implementing more reliable processes byusing exception handling; as it is used in programming languages; and atomicity; as it isknown from the transaction concept in database management systems. We describe themechanism incorporating both transactions and exceptions and present a validation …,IEEE Transactions on software engineering,2000,425
Dynamic weaving for aspect-oriented programming,Andrei Popovici; Thomas Gross; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract When using Aspect Oriented Programming in the development of softwarecomponents; a developer must understand the program units actually changed by weaving;how they behave; and possibly correct the aspects used. Support for rapid AOP prototypingand debugging is therefore crucial in such situations. Rapid prototyping is difficult withcurrent aspect weaving tools because they do not support dynamic changes. This paperdescribes PROSE (PROgrammable extenSions of sErvices); a platform based on Javawhich addresses dynamic AOP. Aspects are expressed in the same source language as theapplication (Java); and PROSE allows aspects to be woven; unwoven; or replaced at run-time.,Proceedings of the 1st international conference on Aspect-oriented software development,2002,392
Functionality and limitations of current workflow management systems,Gustavo Alonso; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Carl Mohan,Abstract Work ow systems hold the promise of facilitating the everyday operation of manyenterprises and work environments. As a result; many commercial work ow managementsystems have been developed. These systems; although useful; do not scale well; havelimited fault-tolerance; and are in exible in terms of interoperating with other work owsystems. In this paper; we discuss the limitations of contemporary work ow managementsystems; and then elaborate on various directions for research and potential futureextensions to the design and modeling of work ow management systems.,IEEE expert,1997,382
Don't be lazy; be consistent: Postgres-r; a new way to implement database replication,Bettina Kemme; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Database designers often point out that eager; update everywhere replication suers from high deadlock rates; message overhead and poor response times. In this paper; weshow that these limitations can be circumvented by using a combination of known and noveltechniques. Moreover; we show how the proposed solution can be incorporated into a realdatabase system. The paper discusses the new protocols and their implementation inPostgreSQL. It also provides experimental results proving that many of the dangers andlimitations of replication can be avoided by using the appropriate techniques.,VLDB,2000,376
A new approach to developing and implementing eager database replication protocols,Bettina Kemme; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Database replication is traditionally seen as a way to increase the availability andperformance of distributed databases. Although a large number of protocols providing dataconsistency and fault-tolerance have been proposed; few of these ideas have ever beenused in commercial products due to their complexity and performance implications. Instead;current products allow inconsistencies and often resort to centralized approaches whicheliminates some of the advantages of replication. As an alternative; we propose a suite ofreplication protocols that addresses the main problems related to database replication. Onthe one hand; our protocols maintain data consistency and the same transactionalsemantics found in centralized systems. On the other hand; they provide flexibility andreasonable performance. To do so; our protocols take advantage of the rich semantics of …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2000,329
Calling the cloud: enabling mobile phones as interfaces to cloud applications,Ioana Giurgiu; Oriana Riva; Dejan Juric; Ivan Krivulev; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Mobile phones are set to become the universal interface to online services andcloud computing applications. However; using them for this purpose today is limited to twoconfigurations: applications either run on the phone or run on the server and are remotelyaccessed by the phone. These two options do not allow for a customized and flexible serviceinteraction; limiting the possibilities for performance optimization as well. In this paper wepresent a middleware platform that can automatically distribute different layers of anapplication between the phone and the server; and optimize a variety of objective functions(latency; data transferred; cost; etc.). Our approach builds on existing technology fordistributed module management and does not require new infrastructures. In the paper wediscuss how to model applications as a consumption graph; and how to process it with a …,Proceedings of the 10th ACM/IFIP/USENIX International Conference on Middleware,2009,319
Ganymed: Scalable replication for transactional web applications,Christian Plattner; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Data grids; large scale web applications generating dynamic content and databaseservice providing pose significant scalability challenges to database engines. Replication isthe most common solution but it involves difficult trade-offs. The most difficult one is thechoice between scalability and consistency. Commercial systems give up consistency.Research solutions typically either offer a compromise (limited scalability in exchange forconsistency) or impose limitations on the data schema and the workload. In this paper weintroduce Ganymed; a database replication middleware intended to provide scalabilitywithout sacrificing consistency and avoiding the limitations of existing approaches. The mainidea is to use a novel transaction scheduling algorithm that separates update and read-onlytransactions. Transactions can be submitted to Ganymed through a special JDBC driver …,Proceedings of the 5th ACM/IFIP/USENIX international conference on Middleware,2004,293
Exotica/FMQM: A persistent message-based architecture for distributed workflow management,G. Alonso; C. Mohan; R. Guenthoer; D Agrawal; A El Abbadi; M Kamath,Abstract In the past few years there has been an increasing interest in workflow applicationsas a way of supporting complex business processes in modern corporations. Given thenature of the environment and the technology involved; workflow applications are inherentlydistributed and pose many interesting challenges to the system designer. In most cases; aclient/server architecture is used in which knowledge about the processes being executed iscentralized in one node to facilitate monitoring; auditing; and to simplify synchronization. Inthis paper; we explore a novel distributed architecture; Exotica/FMQM; for workflow systemsin which the need for such a centralized database is eliminated. Instead; we use persistentmessages as the means to store the information relevant to the execution of a businessprocess. Our approach is to completely distribute the execution of a process so individual …,Proceedings of IFIP Working Conference on Information Systems for Decentralised Organizations; Austin; USA,1995,287
R-OSGi: distributed applications through software modularization,Jan S Rellermeyer; Gustavo Alonso; Timothy Roscoe,Abstract In this paper we take advantage of the concepts developed for centralized modulemanagement; such as dynamic loading and unloading of modules; and show how they canbe used to support the development and deployment of distributed applications. We do sothrough R-OSGi; a distributed middleware platform that extends the centralized; industry-standard OSGi specification to support distributed module management. To the developer; R-OSGi looks like a conventional module management tool. However; at deployment time; R-OSGi can be used to turn the application into a distributed application by simply indicatingwhere the different modules should be deployed. At run time; R-OSGi represents distributedfailures as module insertion and withdrawal operations so that the logic to deal with failuresis the same as that employed to deal with dependencies among software modules.

Database replication techniques: A three parameter classification,Matthias Wiesmann; Fernando Pedone; André Schiper; Bettina Kemme; Gustavo Alonso,Data replication is an increasingly important topic as databases are more and moredeployed over clusters of workstations. One of the challenges in database replication is tointroduce replication without severely affecting performance. Because of this difficulty;current database products use lazy replication; which is very efficient but can compromiseconsistency. As an alternative; eager replication guarantees consistency but most existingprotocols have a prohibitive cost. In order to clarify the current state of the art and open upnew avenues for research; this paper analyses existing eager techniques using three keyparameters (server architecture; server interaction and transaction termination). In ouranalysis; we distinguish eight classes of eager replication protocols and; for each category;discuss its requirements; capabilities and cost. The contribution lies in showing when …,Reliable Distributed Systems; 2000. SRDS-2000. Proceedings The 19th IEEE Symposium on,2000,275
Declarative support for sensor data cleaning,Shawn R Jeffery; Gustavo Alonso; Michael J Franklin; Wei Hong; Jennifer Widom,Abstract Pervasive applications rely on data captured from the physical world throughsensor devices. Data provided by these devices; however; tend to be unreliable. The datamust; therefore; be cleaned before an application can make use of them; leading toadditional complexity for application development and deployment. Here we presentExtensible Sensor stream Processing (ESP); a framework for building sensor data cleaninginfrastructures for use in pervasive applications. ESP is designed as a pipeline usingdeclarative cleaning mechanisms based on spatial and temporal characteristics of sensordata. We demonstrate ESP's effectiveness and ease of use through three real-worldscenarios.,International Conference on Pervasive Computing,2006,271
Just-in-time aspects: efficient dynamic weaving for Java,Andrei Popovici; Gustavo Alonso; Thomas Gross,Abstract Recent developments in service architectures suggest that run-time adaptationscould be implemented with dynamic AOP. In this paper we discuss application requirementson run-time AOP support and present a system that addresses these requirements. Weprovide basic support for weaving using the Just-In-Time compiler; while the AOP system istreated as an exchangeable module on top of the basic support. This approach allows us toprovide low run-time overhead; AOP system flexibility; and secure weaving. We provide anextensive empirical evaluation and discuss the tradeoffs resulting from using the JITcompiler and a modularized architecture.,Proceedings of the 2nd international conference on Aspect-oriented software development,2003,260
Consistency rationing in the cloud: pay only when it matters,Tim Kraska; Martin Hentschel; Gustavo Alonso; Donald Kossmann,Abstract Cloud storage solutions promise high scalability and low cost. Existing solutions;however; differ in the degree of consistency they provide. Our experience using suchsystems indicates that there is a non-trivial trade-off between cost; consistency andavailability. High consistency implies high cost per transaction and; in some situations;reduced availability. Low consistency is cheaper but it might result in higher operational costbecause of; eg; overselling of products in a Web shop. In this paper; we present a newtransaction paradigm; that not only allows designers to define the consistency guaranteeson the data instead at the transaction level; but also allows to automatically switchconsistency guarantees at runtime. We present a number of techniques that let the systemdynamically adapt the consistency level by monitoring the data and/or gathering temporal …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,257
A pipelined framework for online cleaning of sensor data streams,Shawn R Jeffery; Gustavo Alonso; Michael J Franklin; Wei Hong; Jennifer Widom,Data captured from the physical world through sensor devices tends to be noisy andunreliable.

WISE: Business to business e-commerce,Gustavo Alonso; Ulrich Fiedler; Claus Hagen; Amaia Lazcano; Heiko Schuldt; Nathalie Weiler,The Internet and the proliferation of inexpensive computing power in the form of clusters ofworkstations or PCs provide the basic hardware infrastructure for business-to-businesselectronic commerce in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Unfortunately; thecorresponding software infrastructure is still missing. In this paper; we show a way todevelop appropriate tools for electronic commerce by describing the approach we havetaken in the WISE (Workflow-based Internet SErvices) project. The goals of WISE are todevelop and deploy the software infrastructure that is necessary to support business-to-business electronic commerce in the form of virtual enterprises.

MIDDLE-R: Consistent database replication at the middleware level,Marta Patiño-Martinez; Ricardo Jiménez-Peris; Bettina Kemme; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract The widespread use of clusters and Web farms has increased the importance ofdata replication. In this article; we show how to implement consistent and scalable datareplication at the middleware level. We do this by combining transactional concurrencycontrol with group communication primitives. The article presents different replicationprotocols; argues their correctness; describes their implementation as part of a genericmiddleware; Middle-R; and proves their feasibility with an extensive performance evaluation.The solution proposed is well suited for a variety of applications including Web farms anddistributed object platforms.,ACM Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS),2005,225
Atomicity and isolation for transactional processes,Heiko Schuldt; Gustavo Alonso; Catriel Beeri; Hans-Jörg Schek,Abstract Processes are increasingly being used to make complex application logic explicit.Programming using processes has significant advantages but it poses a difficult problemfrom the system point of view in that the interactions between processes cannot becontrolled using conventional techniques. In terms of recovery; the steps of a process aredifferent from operations within a transaction. Each one has its own termination semanticsand there are dependencies among the different steps. Regarding concurrency control; theflow of control of a process is more complex than in a flat transaction. A process may; forexample; partially roll back its execution or may follow one of several alternatives. In thisarticle; we deal with the problem of atomicity and isolation in the context of processes. Wepropose a unified model for concurrency control and recovery for processes and show …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2002,199
A suite of database replication protocols based on group communication primitives,Bettina Kemme; Gustavo Alonso,This paper proposes a family of replication protocols based on group communication inorder to address some of the concerns expressed by database designers regarding existingreplication solutions. Due to these concerns; current database systems allowinconsistencies and often resort to centralized approaches; thereby reducing some of thekey advantages provided by replication. The protocols presented in this paper takeadvantage of the semantics of group communication and use related isolation guarantees toeliminate the possibility of deadlocks; reduce the message overhead; and increaseperformance.

Exploiting atomic broadcast in replicated databases,Divyakant Agrawal; Gustavo Alonso; Amr El Abbadi; Ioana Stanoi,In spite of the fact that many applications require replicated databases either forperformance or fault-tolerance; replication has remained a research issue until recently.Today; the demand for practical replication schemes has greatly increased and some simpleprotocols are being implemented in databases (Oracle and Sybase; for instance) or inapplication development tools (Lotus Notes). These; however; are ad hoc implementationsand the issue of replicated data management is still a source of controversy amongdatabase practitioners and researchers. On one hand; traditional synchronous protocols aretoo expensive in terms of message cost and communication latency; and they aresusceptible to deadlocks when compared to non-replicated databases. An alternativeapproach based on asynchronous updates may result in inconsistencies and an ever …,European Conference on Parallel Processing,1997,180
Analysis of caching and replication strategies for web applications,Swaminathan Sivasubramanian; Guillaume Pierre; Maarten Van Steen; Gustavo Alonso,Developers often use replication and caching mechanisms to enhance Web applicationperformance. The authors present a qualitative and quantitative analysis of state-of-the artreplication and caching techniques used to host Web applications. Their analysis shows thatselecting the best mechanism depends heavily on data workload and requires a carefulreview of the application's characteristics. They also propose a technique for Webpractitioners to compare different mechanisms' performance on their own,IEEE Internet Computing,2007,168
Main-memory hash joins on multi-core CPUs: Tuning to the underlying hardware,Cagri Balkesen; Jens Teubner; Gustavo Alonso; M Tamer Özsu,The architectural changes introduced with multi-core CPUs have triggered a redesign ofmain-memory join algorithms. In the last few years; two diverging views have appeared. Oneapproach advocates careful tailoring of the algorithm to the architectural parameters (cachesizes; TLB; and memory bandwidth). The other approach argues that modern hardware isgood enough at hiding cache and TLB miss latencies and; consequently; the carefultailoring can be omitted without sacrificing performance. In this paper we demonstratethrough experimental analysis of different algorithms and architectures that hardware stillmatters. Join algorithms that are hardware conscious perform better than hardware-obliviousapproaches. The analysis and comparisons in the paper show that many of the claimsregarding the behavior of join algorithms that have appeared in literature are due to …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,167
Data processing on FPGAs,Rene Mueller; Jens Teubner; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Computer architectures are quickly changing toward heterogeneous many-coresystems. Such a trend opens up interesting opportunities but also raises immensechallenges since the efficient use of heterogeneous many-core systems is not a trivialproblem. In this paper; we explore how to program data processing operators on top of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). FPGAs are very versatile in terms of how they can beused and can also be added as additional processing units in standard CPU sockets. In thepaper; we study how data processing can be accelerated using an FPGA. Our resultsindicate that efficient usage of FPGAs involves non-trivial aspects such as having the rightcomputation model (an asynchronous sorting network in this case); a careful implementationthat balances all the design constraints in an FPGA; and the proper integration strategy to …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,159
Are quorums an alternative for data replication?,Ricardo Jiménez-Peris; Marta Patiño-Martínez; Gustavo Alonso; Bettina Kemme,Abstract Data replication is playing an increasingly important role in the design of parallelinformation systems. In particular; the widespread use of cluster architectures often requiresto replicate data for performance and availability reasons. However; maintaining theconsistency of the different replicas is known to cause severe scalability problems. Toaddress this limitation; quorums are often suggested as a way to reduce the overalloverhead of replication. In this article; we analyze several quorum types in order to betterunderstand their behavior in practice. The results obtained challenge many of theassumptions behind quorum based replication. Our evaluation indicates that theconventional read-one/write-all-available approach is the best choice for a large range ofapplications requiring data replication. We believe this is an important result for anybody …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2003,157
Flexible exception handling in the OPERA process support system,Claus Hagen; Gustavo Alonso,Exceptions are one of the most pervasive problems in process support systems. Ininstallations expected to handle a large number of processes; having exceptions is bound tobe a normal occurrence. Any programming tool intended for large; complex applications hasto face this problem. However; current process support systems; despite their orientationtowards complex; distributed; and heterogeneous applications; provide almost no supportfor exception handling. This paper shows how flexible mechanisms for failure handling areincorporated into the OPERA process support system using a combination of programminglanguage concepts and transaction processing techniques. The resulting mechanisms allowthe construction of fault-tolerant workflow processes in a transparent and flexible way whileensuring reusability of workflow components.,Distributed Computing Systems; 1998.

Multi-core; main-memory joins: Sort vs. hash revisited,Cagri Balkesen; Gustavo Alonso; Jens Teubner; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract In this paper we experimentally study the performance of main-memory; parallel;multi-core join algorithms; focusing on sort-merge and (radix-) hash join. The relativeperformance of these two join approaches have been a topic of discussion for a long time.With the advent of modern multi-core architectures; it has been argued that sort-merge join isnow a better choice than radix-hash join. This claim is justified based on the width of SIMDinstructions (sort-merge outperforms radix-hash join once SIMD is sufficiently wide); andNUMA awareness (sort-merge is superior to hash join in NUMA architectures). We conductextensive experiments on the original and optimized versions of these algorithms. Theexperiments show that; contrary to these claims; radix-hash join is still clearly superior; andsort-merge approaches to performance of radix only when very large amounts of data are …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,140
Exotica: a research perspective on workflow management systems,C Mohan; G Alonso; R Gunthor; M Kamath,Workflow is probably one of the most exciting areas of research that has emerged in the pastfew years. The concepts and ideas have been around in one form or another for a long time:computer supported cooperative work; form processing; cooperative systems; officeautomation; etc. However; only recently the technology and know-how required toimplement commercial systems have been available. In general; workflow managementsystems (WFMS) are used to coordinate and streamline business processes. Thesebusiness processes are represented as workflows; ie; computerized models of the businessprocess [11]; which specify the individual activity steps; the order and the conditions in whichthe activities must be executed; the flow of data between activities; the users responsible forthe execution of the activities; the tools to use with each activity; etc. A WFMS is the set of …,Data Engineering Bulletin,1995,138
Scalable replication in database clusters,Marta Patiño-Martínez; Ricardo Jiménez-Peris; Bettina Kemme; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract In this paper; we explore data replication pro-tocols that pro-vide both faulttolerance and good performance without compromising consistency. We do this bycombining transactional concurrency control with group communication primitives. In ourapproach; transactions are executed at only one site so that not all nodes incur in theoverhead of producing results. To further reduce latency; we use an optimistic multicasttechnique that overlaps transaction execution with total order message delivery. Theprotocols we present in the paper provide correct executions while minimizing overhead andproviding higher scalability.,International Symposium on Distributed Computing,2000,137
Failure handling in large scale workflow management systems,Gustavo Alonso; Mohan Kamath; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; R Günthör; C Mohan,ABSTRACT: Work ow management deals with the coordinated execution of businessprocesses. These processes are often of long duration; weeks or even months; are verylarge; involving many agents and distributed resources; and critical to the enterprise. Asorganizations adopt work ow technology; they become increasingly dependent on thesystem to carry on their daily business activities. Hence; a work ow management system;WFMS; must provide availability; reliability and scalability to cope with environments wherethe range of potential failures is very broad; from system failures to semantic failures. In thispaper; in the context of IBM's Exotica project; we propose a new architecture to address theavailability and scalability issues; and to deal with system failures such as site andcommunication failures. We also discuss how features of advanced transaction models …,IBM Research Report RJ9913,1994,135
Efficient lineage tracking for scientific workflows,Thomas Heinis; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Data lineage and data provenance are key to the management of scientific data.Not knowing the exact provenance and processing pipeline used to produce a derived dataset often renders the data set useless from a scientific point of view. On the positive side;capturing provenance information is facilitated by the widespread use of workflow tools forprocessing scientific data. The workflow process describes all the steps involved inproducing a given data set and; hence; captures its lineage. On the negative side; efficientlystoring and querying workflow based data lineage is not trivial. All existing solutions userecursive queries and even recursive tables to represent the workflows. Such solutions donot scale and are rather inefficient. In this paper we propose an alternative approach tostoring lineage information captured as a workflow process.

We present Glacier; a componentlibrary and compositional compiler that transforms continuous queries into logic circuits bycomposing library components on an operator-level basis. In the paper we considerselection; aggregation; grouping; as well as windowing operators; and discuss their designas modular elements. We also show how significant performance improvements can beachieved by inserting the FPGA into the system's data path (eg; between the networkinterface and the host CPU).

Using optimistic atomic broadcast in transaction processing systems,Bettina Kemme; Fernando Pedone; Gustavo Alonso; André Schiper; Matthias Wiesmann,Atomic broadcast primitives are often proposed as a mechanism to allow fault-tolerantcooperation between sites in a distributed system. Unfortunately; the delay incurred before amessage can be delivered makes it difficult to implement high performance; scalableapplications on top of atomic broadcast primitives. Recently; a new approach has beenproposed for atomic broadcast which; based on optimistic assumptions about thecommunication system; reduces the average delay for message delivery to the application.We develop this idea further and show how applications can take even more advantage ofthe optimistic assumption by overlapping the coordination phase of the atomic broadcastalgorithm with the processing of delivered messages. In particular; we present a replicateddatabase architecture that employs the new atomic broadcast primitive in such a way that …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2003,120

In the context of a relational databases; the source andintermediate dataitems are relations; tuples and attribute values. The transformations areSQL queries and/or functions on the relational data items. Existing approaches captureprovenance information by extending the underlying data model. This has the intrinsicdisadvantage that the provenance must be stored and accessed using a different modelthan the actual data.

A virtual machine for sensor networks,René Müller; Gustavo Alonso; Donald Kossmann,Abstract Sensor networks are increasingly being deployed for a wide variety of tasks. Today;in these networks; the development; deployment; and maintenance of applications areperformed largely ad-hoc. Existing platforms help somewhat but also introduce implicit trade-offs. In one extreme; low-level programming platforms and languages make programmingcumbersome and error-prone. In the other extreme; declarative approaches greatly facilitateprogramming but restrict what can be done. In both cases; additional limitations include lackof support for concurrency; difficulties in changing applications; and insufficient abstractionsfrom low-level details. This paper presents SwissQM; a virtual machine designed to addressall these limitations. SwissQM offers a platform-independent programming abstraction that isgeared towards data acquisition and in-network data processing.,ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review,2007,110

A new approach has been proposed which; based on optimistic assumptionsabout the communication system; reduces the average delay for message delivery.

Concierge: a service platform for resource-constrained devices,Jan S Rellermeyer; Gustavo Alonso,ABSTRACT As mobile and embedded devices become widespread; the management andconfiguration of the software in the devices is increasingly turning into a critical issue. OSGiis a business standard for the life cycle management of Java software components. It isbased on a service oriented architecture where functional units are decoupled andcomponents can be managed independently of each other. However; the focus continuouslyshifts from the originally intended area of small and embedded devices towards large-scaledenterprise systems. As a result; implementations of the OSGi framework are increasinglybecoming more heavyweight and less suitable for smaller computing devices.

They are a very promisingvenue for collaborative systems but; in most cases; the autonomy of the users is greatlyrestricted due to architectural and design considerations. This is a severe restriction;especially when considering the emergence of mobile computing; and the increase in use oflaptops and small computers which are connected to a network only occasionally. In thispaper; we discuss how disconnected workflow clients can be supported while preserving thecorrectness of the overall execution and allowing coordinated interactions between thedifferent users. Disconnected client support provides a great deal of flexibility in the …,*,1995,102
Predictable performance for unpredictable workloads,Philipp Unterbrunner; Georgios Giannikis; Gustavo Alonso; Dietmar Fauser; Donald Kossmann,Abstract This paper introduces Crescando: a scalable; distributed relational tableimplementation designed to perform large numbers of queries and updates with guaranteedaccess latency and data freshness. To this end; Crescando leverages a number of modernquery processing techniques and hardware trends. Specifically; Crescando is based onparallel; collaborative scans in main memory and so-called" query-data" joins known fromdata-stream processing. While the proposed approach is not always optimal for a givenworkload; it provides latency and freshness guarantees for all workloads. Thus; Crescandois particularly attractive if the workload is unknown; changing; or involves many differentqueries. This paper describes the design; algorithms; and implementation of a Crescandostorage node; and assesses its performance on modern multi-core hardware.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,101
Parallel computing patterns for grid workflows,Cesare Pautasso; Gustavo Alonso,Whereas a consensus has been reached on defining the set of workflow patterns forbusiness process modeling languages; no such patterns exists for workflows applied toscientific computing on the Grid. By looking at different kinds of parallelism; in this paper weidentify a set of workflow patterns related to parallel and pipelined execution. The paperpresents how these patterns can be represented in different Grid workflow languages anddiscusses their implications for the design of the underlying workflow management andexecution infrastructure. A preliminary classification of these patterns is introduced bysurveying how they are supported by several existing advanced scientific and Grid workflowlanguages.,Workflows in Support of Large-Scale Science; 2006.

ASAP: an adaptive QoS protocol for mobile ad hoc networks,Jianbo Xue; Patrick Stuedi; Gustavo Alonso,With the increasing widespread use of wireless technologies; the need arises for QoSprovisioning mechanisms for multimedia applications in wireless networks. However; tosupport QoS in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) is more challenging than in fixed and last-hop wireless access networks. QoS protocols designed for fixed network; eg RSVP; are notapplicable in MANETs; because they cannot cope with MANET's highly dynamic topology.Existing QoS frameworks explicitly built for MANETs are not as flexible and efficient asneeded. In this paper; we propose a new QoS framework for MANETs-adaptive reservationand preallocation protocol (ASAP). By using two signaling messages; ASAP provides fastand efficient QoS support while maintaining adaptation flexibility and minimizing wastedreservations. Simulation of this framework using AODV C.

Geo-Opera: Workflow concepts for spatial processes,Gustavo Alonso; Claus Hagen,Abstract A Process Support System provides the tools and mechanisms necessary to define;implement and control processes; ie; complex sequences of program invocations and dataexchanges. Due to the generality of the notion of process and the high demand for thefunctionality they provide; process support systems are starting to be used in a variety ofapplication areas; from business re-engineering to experiment management. In particular;recent results have shown the advantages of using such systems in scientific applicationsand the work reported in this paper is to be interpreted as one more step in that direction.The paper describes Geo-Opera; a process support system tailored to spatial modeling andGIS engineering. Geo-Opera facilitates the task of coordinating and managing thedevelopment and execution of large; computer-based geographic models.

Sorting networks on FPGAs,Rene Mueller; Jens Teubner; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Computer architectures are quickly changing toward heterogeneous many-coresystems. Such a trend opens up interesting opportunities but also raises immensechallenges since the efficient use of heterogeneous many-core systems is not a trivialproblem. Software-configurable microprocessors and FPGAs add further diversity but alsoincrease complexity. In this paper; we explore the use of sorting networks on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). FPGAs are very versatile in terms of how they can beused and can also be added as additional processing units in standard CPU sockets. Ourresults indicate that efficient usage of FPGAs involves non-trivial aspects such as having theright computation model (a sorting network in this case); a careful implementation thatbalances all the design constraints in an FPGA; and the proper integration strategy to link …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2012,96
Decentralized; distributed internet data management,*,A light-weight architecture is provided; where each component is in itself its own advancedmini-transaction processing monitor. To accomplish this; the system is most readilyimplemented as a set of Java classes. The resulting architecture is as follows. In a compositesystem; each server is an independent component performing its own scheduling andtransaction management. These servers are built using Java and inheriting from the classesprovided by the system according to the invention. The interface to each server defines theservices it implements. An invocation of one of these services (through remote methodinvocation) results in the creation of a local transaction (child of the invoking transaction andparent of any transaction that might be triggered by invoking the services of other servers).Each transaction is a thread that (in an exemplary system) can invoke SQL statements in …,*,2003,96
Concurrency control and recovery in transactional process management,Heiko Schuldt; Gustavo Alonso; Hans-Jörg Schek,Abstract The unified theory of concurrency control and recovery integrates atomicity andisolation within a common framework; thereby avoiding many of the shortcomings resultingfrom treating them as orthogonal problems. This theory can be applied to the traditionalread/write model as well as to semantically rich operations. In this paper; we extend theunified theory by applying it to generalized process structures; ie; arbitrary partially orderedsequences of transaction invocations. lJsing the extended unified theory; our goal is toprovide a more flexible handling of concurrent processes while allowing: as muchparallelism as possible. Unlike in the original unified theory; we take into account that not allactivities of a process might be compensatable and the fact that these process structuresrequire transactional properties more general than in traditional ACID transactions.

SharedDB: killing one thousand queries with one stone,Georgios Giannikis; Gustavo Alonso; Donald Kossmann,Abstract Traditional database systems are built around the query-at-a-time model. Thisapproach tries to optimize performance in a best-effort way. Unfortunately; best effort is notgood enough for many modern applications. These applications require response timeguarantees in high load situations. This paper describes the design of a new databasearchitecture that is based on batching queries and shared computation across possiblyhundreds of concurrent queries and updates. Performance experiments with the TPC-Wbenchmark show that the performance of our implementation; SharedDB; is indeed robustacross a wide range of dynamic workloads.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,95
Non-intrusive; parallel recovery of replicated data,Ricardo Jiménez-Peris; Marta Patiño-Martínez; Gustavo Alonso,The increasingly widespread use of cluster architectures has resulted in many newapplication scenarios for data replication. While data replication is; in principle; a wellunderstood problem. recovery of replicated systems has not yet received enough attention.In the case of clusters; recovery procedures are particularly important since they have tokeep a high level of availability even during recovery. In fact; recovery is part of the normaloperations of any cluster as the cluster is expected to continue working while sites leave orjoin the system. However; traditional recovery techniques usually require stoppingprocessing. Once a quiescent state has been reached; the system proceeds to synchronizethe state of failed or new replicas. In this paper. we concentrate on how to perform recoveryin a replication middleware without having to stop processing. The proposed protocol …,Reliable Distributed Systems; 2002.

Design and evaluation of an autonomic workflow engine,Thomas Heinis; Cesare Pautasso; Gustavo Alonso,In this paper we present the design and evaluate the performance of an autonomic workflowexecution engine. Although there exist many distributed workflow engines; in practice; itremains a difficult problem to deploy such systems in an optimal configuration. Furthermore;when facing an unpredictable workload with high variability; manual reconfiguration is notan option. Thanks to its autonomic controller; the engine features self-configuration; self-tuning and self-healing properties. The engine runs on a cluster of computers using a tuplespace to coordinate its various components. Its autonomic controller monitors itsperformance and responds to workload variations by altering the configuration. In casefailures occur; the controller can recover the workflow execution state from persistent storageand migrate it to a different node of the cluster. Such interventions are carried out without …,Autonomic Computing; 2005. ICAC 2005. Proceedings. Second International Conference on,2005,90

As an alternative; complex interactions patterns and data exchanges betweendifferent Web services can be effectively modeled using a visual language. In this paper; wediscuss the requirements of such an application scenario and we fully describe the JOperaVisual Composition Language. An extensive set of visual editing tools; a compiler and adebugger for the language have been implemented as part of the JOpera system with thegoal of providing a true visual environment for Web service composition with usabilityfeatures emphasizing rapid development and visual scalability.,Journal of Visual Languages & Computing,2005,87

In spite of their limitations; existing products are enjoyingconsiderable success since they are the rst practical implementation of functionality andconcepts studied for many years. The goals may have changed from o ce automation andcomputer supported cooperative work to business processes and re-engineering; but thebasic ideas and concepts have remained the same. It would be a mistake; however; not totry to see beyond current systems and applications.

Complex event detection at wire speed with FPGAs,Louis Woods; Jens Teubner; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Complex event detection is an advanced form of data stream processing where thestream (s) are scrutinized to identify given event patterns. The challenge for many complexevent processing (CEP) systems is to be able to evaluate event patterns on high-volumedata streams while adhering to real-time constraints. To solve this problem; in this paper wepresent a hardware-based complex event detection system implemented on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). By inserting the FPGA directly into the data pathbetween the network interface and the CPU; our solution can detect complex events atgigabit wire speed with constant and fully predictable latency; independently of networkload; packet size; or data distribution. This is a significant improvement over CPU-basedsystems and an architectural approach that opens up interesting opportunities for hybrid …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,84

GlobeDB: Autonomic data replication for web applications,Swaminathan Sivasubramanian; Gustavo Alonso; Guillaume Pierre; Maarten van Steen,Abstract We present GlobeDB; a system for hosting Web applications that performsautonomic replication of application data. GlobeDB offers data-intensive Web applicationsthe benefits of low access latencies and reduced update traffic. The major distinction in oursystem compared to existing edge computing infrastructures is that the process ofdistribution and replication of application data is handled by the system automatically withvery little manual administration. We show that significant performance gains can beobtained this way. Performance evaluations with the TPC-W benchmark over an emulatedwide-area network show that GlobeDB reduces latencies by a factor of 4 compared to non-replicated systems and reduces update traffic by a factor of 6 compared to fully replicatedsystems.,Proceedings of the 14th international conference on World Wide Web,2005,82

Current implementations allow thedefinition and controlled execution of complex and long lived business processes as thebasis for an enterprise-wide collaborative system but; in most cases; the autonomy of theusers is greatly restricted due to architectural and design considerations. In particular;existing systems are built around a centralized server. As a result; users need to maintain anuninterrupted connection with the server to perform the different tasks assigned to them.

Database engines on multicores; why parallelize when you can distribute?,Tudor-Ioan Salomie; Ionut Emanuel Subasu; Jana Giceva; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Multicore computers pose a substantial challenge to infrastructure software such asoperating systems or databases. Such software typically evolves slower than the underlyinghardware; and with multicore it faces structural limitations that can be solved only withradical architectural changes. In this paper we argue that; as has been suggested foroperating systems; databases could treat multicore architectures as a distributed systemrather than trying to hide the parallel nature of the hardware. We first analyze the limitationsof database engines when running on multicores using MySQL and PostgreSQL asexamples. We then show how to deploy several replicated engines within a single multicoremachine to achieve better scalability and stability than a single database engine operatingon all cores. The resulting system offers a low overhead alternative to having to redesign …,Proceedings of the sixth conference on Computer systems,2011,81

Beyond the black box: Event-based inter-process communication in process support systems,Claus Hagen; Gustavo Alonso,We describe the concept and implementation of an inter-process communication facilitybased on the exchange of events between concurrently running processes. In contrast toprevious approaches based on shared data stored in a common database; our approachhas the advantage of being platform independent and providing straightforward support fordistribution. In addition; we also explore the problem of process atomicity and consistencywhen events are revoked due to the abort of processes.

Connectivity in the presence of shadowing in 802.11 ad hoc networks,Patrick Stuedi; Oscar Chinellato; Gustavo Alonso,Connectivity is an important property for QoS support in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs).Recently; there has been a big effort in exploring the critical transmission range (CTR)analytically; based on different network models. While most of these studies rely on ageometric model and come up with asymptotic bounds; their significance regarding finite802.11 based MANETs is unclear. In this paper; we investigate connectivity in MANETs froma layered perspective. We first point out how the transmission range affects the end-to-endconnection probability in a log-normal shadowing model and compare the results totheoretical bounds and measurements in the path loss model. We then show howconnectivity issues behave in 802.11 and IP based networks if the fading effect increases.The paper concludes with an analytical model for the link probability in log-normal …,Wireless Communications and Networking Conference; 2005 IEEE,2005,64
Extending DBMSs with satellite databases,Christian Plattner; Gustavo Alonso; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract In this paper; we propose an extensible architecture for database engines wheresatellite databases are used to scale out and implement additional functionality for acentralized database engine. The architecture uses a middleware layer that offers consistentviews and a single system image over a cluster of machines with database engines. One ofthese engines acts as a master copy while the others are read-only snapshots which we callsatellites. The satellites are lightweight DBMSs used for scalability and to providefunctionality difficult or expensive to implement in the main engine. Our approach alsosupports the dynamic creation of satellites to be able to autonomously adapt to varyingloads.

Flexible binding for reusable composition of web services,Cesare Pautasso; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract In addition to publishing composite services as reusable services; compositions canalso be reused by applying them to orchestrate different component services. To do so; it isimportant to describe compositions using flexible bindings; which define only the minimalconstraints on the syntax and semantics of the services to be composed. This way; thechoice of which service to invoke can be delayed to later stages in the life cycle of thecomposition. In the context of Web service composition; we refine the concept of bindingbeyond the basic distinction of static and dynamic binding. Bindings can be evaluatedduring the design; the compilation; the deployment; the beginning of the execution of acomposition; or just before the actual service invocation takes place. Considering the currentlimited support of dynamic binding in the BPEL service composition language; we show …,International conference on software composition,2005,59
Partial database replication and group communication primitives,Gustavo Alonso,Existing research on replication is generally based on synchronous replication (all copiesare kept consistent at all times) and update everywhere (any replica can be updated)approaches. There is a strong belief among database designers; however; thatsynchronous; update everywhere replication is simply not feasible in a databaseenvironment GBH+96; Gol94; Sta94]. Some of the arguments behind this belief is the highprobability of deadlocks that replication introduces and the problems to scale any replicationapproach beyond a few sites. As a result; most current database replication solutions areasynchronous (copies are not kept consistent at all times) and based on a primary-copyapproach 1 (only one master copy can be updated; all other replicas are read-only) Gol94;Sta94].

Application level ballooning for efficient server consolidation,Tudor-Ioan Salomie; Gustavo Alonso; Timothy Roscoe; Kevin Elphinstone,Abstract Systems software like databases and language runtimes typically manage memorythemselves to exploit application knowledge unavailable to the OS. Traditionally deployedon dedicated machines; they are designed to be statically configured with memory sufficientfor peak load. In virtualization scenarios (cloud computing; server consolidation); however;static peak provisioning of RAM to applications dramatically reduces the efficiency and cost-saving benefits of virtualization. Unfortunately; existing memory" ballooning" techniquesused to dynamically reallocate physical memory between VMs badly impact theperformance of applications which manage their own memory. We address this problem byextending ballooning to applications (here; a database engine and Java runtime) so thatmemory can be efficiently and effectively moved between virtualized instances as the …,Proceedings of the 8th ACM European Conference on Computer Systems,2013,57
Autonomic execution of web service compositions,Cesare Pautasso; Thomas Heinis; Gustavo Alonso,An increasing amount of Web services are being implemented using process managementtools and languages (BPML; BPEL; etc.). The main advantage of processes is that designerscan express complex business conversations at a high level of abstraction; even reusingstandardized business protocols. The downside is that the infrastructure behind the Webservice becomes more complex. This is particularly critical for Web services that may besubjected to high variability in demand and suffer from unpredictable peaks of heavy load. Inthis paper we present a flexible architecture for process execution that has been designed tosupport autonomic scalability. The system runs on a cluster of computers and reacts toworkload variations by altering its configuration in order to optimally use the availableresources.

In practice; families of hardwaredevices or of software platforms have intrinsic characteristics that make it very cumbersometo write applications where arbitrary devices and platforms interact. In this paper we exploreconstructing the software fabric for the “Internet of Things” as an extension of the ideasalready in use for modular software development. In particular; we suggest to generalize theOSGi model to turn the “Internet of Things” into a collection of loosely coupled softwaremodules interacting through service interfaces.

Moreover workflow engines are not very sophisticated in terms ofdata management. Forgetting the fact that workflow is; to a great extent; data flow. In thispaper we propose a novel architecture to address the issue of data management in aWFMS. This architecture is based on a fully distributed workflow engine for control flow; plusa set of loosely synchronized replicated databases for dataflow. The resulting system offersgreater robustness and reliability as well as much better data handling capabilities thanexisting approaches.

A multimedia approach to the efficient implementation and use of emergency plans,José H Canós; Gustavo Alonso; Javier Jaén,Because of the complexity of emergency procedures; the stressful situations during whichthey're executed; the emergency plan must be meticulously designed so that safetymanagers can quickly find needed information. Regardless of the complex procedures itdescribes and the trying situations where it would be used; the plan's success is alwaysmeasured by how effective the evacuation is. Thus; safety-conscious organizationscontinually try to improve their emergency procedures and the way they present them in theemergency plan. Integrating incoming information during an emergency and correlating thisinformation with the plan's procedures is a manual task for many safety managers. Thedanger is that the emergency plan can quickly become a bottleneck during the veryemergency for which it describes procedures to resolve it.

A proactive middleware platform for mobile computing,Andrei Popovici; Andreas Frei; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract An obvious prerequisite for mobile computing devices is the ability to adapt todifferent computing environments. Otherwise the devices are forced to carry with themeverything they may eventually need during their operational life time. This is neitherdesirable nor feasible; thereby hinting at the need for dynamic adaptation. The idea wouldbe to let the environment be proactive and adapt the application rather than forcing theapplication to adapt itself to every possible environment. In this paper we present a platformfor doing exactly this. Applications running on our modified JVM can be extended at run timewith new functionality. Through this platform; mobile devices can acquire on-the-fly anyfunctionality extension they may need to work properly in a given environment.

Visual composition of web services,Cesare Pautasso; Gustavo Alonso,Composing Web services into a coherent application can be a tedious and error prone taskwhen using traditional textual scripting languages. As an alternative; complex interactionspatterns and data exchanges between different Web services can be effectively modeledusing a visual language. In this paper we discuss the requirements of such an applicationscenario and we present the design of the BioOpera Flow Language. This visualcomposition language has been fully implemented in a development environment for Webservice composition with usability features emphasizing rapid development and visualscalability.,Human Centric Computing Languages and Environments; 2003.

Probabilistic protocols for node discovery in ad-hoc; single broadcast channel networks,Gustavo Alonso; Evangelos Kranakis; Roger Wattenhofer; Peter Widmayer,The initial state in an ad-hoc network is a collection of nodes that are unaware of eachother's presence. The very first step in joining and building the ad-hoc network is; thus; todiscover other nodes. This node discovery procedure is a key step in configuring andoptimizing the topology of the network. In spite of its relevance; node discovery has not yetbeen studied in detail and existing protocols are strongly tied to concrete networkimplementations. In this paper; we propose a model for node discovery that facilitates theanalytical treatment of the problem. We concentrate on networks with a single sharedbroadcast channel. For these networks; we propose a number of protocols that shed light onthe problem of node discovery.,Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium; 2003. Proceedings. International,2003,50
How to select a replication protocol according to scalability; availability and communication overhead,Ricardo Jiménez-Peris; Marta Patiño-Martínez; Gustavo Alonso; B Kernme,Data replication is playing an increasingly important role in the design of parallel informationsystems. In particular; the widespread use of cluster architectures in high-performancecomputing has created many opportunities for applying data replication techniques in newareas. For instance; as part of work related to cluster computing in bioinformatics; we havebeen confronted with the problem of having to choose an optimal replication strategy interms of scalability; availability and communication overhead. Thus; we have evaluatedseveral representative replication protocols in order to better understand their behavior inpractice. The results obtained are surprising in that they challenge many of the assumptionsbehind existing protocols. Our evaluation indicates that the conventional read-one/write-allapproach is the best choice for a large range of applications requiring data replication …,Reliable Distributed Systems; 2001.

Services everywhere: Osgi in distributed environments,Jan S Rellermeyer; Gustavo Alonso,ABSTRACT Distribution is increasingly becoming an important issue in both enterpriseapplications and mobile computing. OSGi itself has only rudimental support for distribution;in forms of interfaces for interaction with Jini (R3) or UPnP (R3+ R4) infrastructures. When itcomes to interconnecting different OSGi frameworks; there are only few solutions so far. Inthis paper; we present these existing solutions and compare the different approaches withour own R-OSGi. The goal of our open source project is to provide a seamless andnoninvasive middleware for accessing remote services in OSGi frameworks. We explain thebasic design principles of R-OSGi; such as transparent service access and spontaneousinteraction; and briefly mention the internal structure and techniques used in R-OSGi; suchas service discovery and smart proxies.,EclipseCon 2007,2007,49
Process synchronization in workflow management systems,Gustavo Alonso; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Workflow management systems automate the execution of business processes allowing theconcurrent execution of multiple process instances. Existing systems do not provide amechanism to guarantee correct concurrent execution and; as a result; it is not possible tocoordinate and synchronize different process instances. Part of the problem is thatconventional techniques are not entirely suitable for workflow environments. In databases;locks are the basic mechanism. In operating systems; this is achieved using semaphores ormonitors. Neither of these approaches is appropriate for workflow applications. A method isproposed to enforce correct interleavings and guarantee mutual exclusion; as defined by theuser; between concurrent workflow processes. The proposed protocol takes advantage ofthe semantic constructs associated with workflow management to solve some complex …,Parallel and Distributed Processing; 1996.; Eighth IEEE Symposium on,1996,49
Database replication: a tale of research across communities,Bettina Kemme; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Replication is a key mechanism to achieve scalability and fault-tolerance indatabases. Its importance has recently been further increased because of the role it plays inachieving elasticity at the database layer. In database replication; the biggest challenge liesin the trade-off between performance and consistency. A decade ago; performance couldonly be achieved through lazy replication at the expense of transactional guarantees. Thestrong consistency of eager approaches came with a high cost in terms of reducedperformance and limited scalability. Postgres-R combined results from distributed systemsand databases to develop a replication solution that provided both scalability and strongconsistency.

Ibex: an intelligent storage engine with support for advanced SQL offloading,Louis Woods; Zsolt István; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Modern data appliances face severe bandwidth bottlenecks when moving vastamounts of data from storage to the query processing nodes. A possible solution to mitigatethese bottlenecks is query off-loading to an intelligent storage engine; where partial or wholequeries are pushed down to the storage engine. In this paper; we present Ibex; a prototypeof an intelligent storage engine that supports off-loading of complex query operators.Besides increasing performance; Ibex also reduces energy consumption; as it uses anFPGA rather than conventional CPUs to implement the off-load engine. Ibex is a hybridengine; with dedicated hardware that evaluates SQL expressions at line-rate and a softwarefallback for tasks that the hardware engine cannot handle. Ibex supports GROUP BYaggregation; as well as projection-and selection-based filtering. GROUP BY aggregation …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,47
Unifying concurrency control and recovery of transactions,Gustavo Alonso; Radek Vingralek; Divyakant Agrawal; Yuri Breitbart; Amr El Abbadi; Hans-J Schek; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract Transaction management in shared databases is generally viewed as acombination of two problems; concurrency control and recovery; which have beenconsidered as orthogonal problems. Consequently; the correctness criteria derived for theseproblems are incomparable. Recently a unified theory of concurrency control and recoveryhas been introduced that is based on commutativity and performs transaction recovery bysubmitting inverse operations for operations of aborted transactions. In this paper weprovide a constructive correctness criterion that leads to the design of unified protocols thatguarantee atomicity and serializability.,Information Systems,1994,47
Engineering the cloud from software modules,Jan S Rellermeyer; Michael Duller; Gustavo Alonso,Cloud computing faces many of the challenges and difficulties of distributed and parallelsoftware. While the service interface hides the actual application from the remote user; theapplication developer still needs to come to terms with distributed software that needs to runon dynamic clusters and operate under a wide range of configurations. In this paper; weoutline our vision of a model and runtime platform for the development; deployment; andmanagement of software applications on the cloud. Our basic idea is to turn the notion ofsoftware module into a first class entity used for management and distribution that can beautonomously managed by the underlying software fabric of the cloud. In the paper wepresent our model; outline an initial implementation; and describe a first applicationdeveloped using the ideas presented in the paper.,Software Engineering Challenges of Cloud Computing; 2009.

SIPHoc: Efficient SIP middleware for ad hoc networks,Patrick Stuedi; Marcel Bihr; Alain Remund; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) offer a flexible way to connect mobile devicesto build complex infrastructures. A key issue in MANETs is session set up and managementsince; unlike in conventional networks; there is no centralized component to provide such aservice. Yet; session set up is necessary to provide any form of communication beyondunreliable; single message communication. In this paper we describe SIPHoc; a middlewareinfrastructure for session set up and management in MANETs. SIPHoc provides the sameinterface as the SIP standard but its implementation is fully decentralized. Moreover; SIPsession establishment to and from the Internet is possible as soon as a single node in theMANET has Internet access. The paper presents the architecture and implementation ofSIPHoc and evaluates its performance. The experiments show that SIPHoc is message …,ACM/IFIP/USENIX International Conference on Distributed Systems Platforms and Open Distributed Processing,2007,46
Minimizing the hidden cost of RDMA,Philip Werner Frey; Gustavo Alonso,Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) is a mechanism whereby data is moved directlybetween the application memory of the local and remote computer. In bypassing theoperating system; RDMA significantly reduces the CPU cost of large data transfers andeliminates intermediate copying across buffers; thereby making it very attractive forimplementing distributed applications. With the advent of hardware implementations ofRDMA over Ethernet (iWARP); its advantages have become even more obvious. In thispaper we analyze the applicability of RDMA and identify hidden costs in the setup of itsinteractions that; if not handled carefully; remove any performance advantage; especially inhardware implementations. From an application point of view; the major difference to TCP/IPbased communication is that the buffer management has to be done explicitly by the …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2009.

Probabilistic protocols for node discovery in ad hoc multi-channel broadcast networks,Gustavo Alonso; Evangelos Kranakis; Cindy Sawchuk; Roger Wattenhofer; Peter Widmayer,Abstract Ad hoc networks consist of wireless; self-organizing nodes that can communicatewith each other in order to establish decentralized and dynamically changing networktopologies. Node discovery is a fundamental procedure in the establishment of an ad hocnetwork; as a given node needs to discover what other nodes are in its communicationrange. Existing multi-channel node discovery protocols are typically constrained by thenetwork configuration that will be imposed on the nodes once they are discovered. Wepresent a communication model that is independent of the network configuration that will beestablished after node discovery. We present a pair of node discovery protocols for k≥ 2nodes in a multi-channel system and analyze them using the given communication model.,International Conference on Ad-Hoc Networks and Wireless,2003,43
Correctness and parallelism in composite systems,Gustavo Alonso; Stephen Blott; Armin Fessler; Hans-Jörg Schek,Abstract In recent years; databases have started to be used as intelligent repositories for avariety of semantically-richer systems. A consequence of such architectures is thattransaction scheduling takes place throughout composite systems consisting of layeredsubsystems. Such transaction architectures have been studied extensively. Existing theory;however; limits the degree of parallelism; and makes a number of simplifying assumptionswhich cannot be taken for granted in practice. Thii paper proposes a new model andcorrectness criterion; staclc conflict consistency; for composite transactional systems. Themain contribution of the new model is to establish the correctness conditions under whichhigher degrees of parallelism can be achieved between operations of the same transaction;as well as between conflicting operations of different transactions; in a uniform way.

Dynamic software deployment from clouds to mobile devices,Ioana Giurgiu; Oriana Riva; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract With the functionality of mobile applications ever increasing; designers are oftenconfronted with either the resource limitations of the devices or of the network. As pointedout by recent work; application partitioning between mobile devices and clouds; can be usedto solve some of these issues; improving performance and/or battery life. In this paper; weargue that the static decisions made in existing work cannot leverage the full potential ofapplication partitioning. Thus; to allow for variations in the execution environment; we havedeveloped a system that dynamically adapts the application partition decisions. The systemworks by continuously profiling an applications performance and dynamically updating itsdistributed deployment to accommodate changes in the network bandwidth; devices CPUutilization; and data loads. Using several real applications; we show that our approach …,ACM/IFIP/USENIX International Conference on Distributed Systems Platforms and Open Distributed Processing,2012,42
Myths around web services,Gustavo Alonso,Web services and the technology surrounding them have become the dominant trend in theelectronic commerce arena. XML; SOAP; UDDI; and WSDL; as the foundation of Webservices; are all attracting considerable attention as potential bridges betweenheterogeneous systems distributed across the Internet. The assumption seems to be thatsoon most applications will speak and understand XML; that all systems will support SOAP;that everybody will advertise their services in UDDI registers; and that all services will bedescribed in WSDL. Once that stage is reached; application integration and business tobusiness (B2B) e-commerce will be straightforward. Unfortunately; Web services are onlythe next step in the natural evolution of middleware. Therefore; by design; Web services areevolutionary rather than revolutionary. The most basic form of middleware are RPC …,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2002,42
Autonomic resource provisioning for software business processes,Cesare Pautasso; Thomas Heinis; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Software development nowadays involves several levels of abstraction: startingfrom the programming of single objects; to their combination into components; to theirpublication as services and the overall architecture linking elements at each level. As aresult; software engineering is dealing with a wider range of artifacts and concepts (ie; in thecontext of this paper: services and business processes) than ever before. In this paper weexplore the importance of having an adequate engine for executing business processeswritten as compositions of Web services. The paper shows that; independently of thecomposition language used; the overall scalability of the system is determined by how therun-time engine treats the process execution. This is particularly relevant at the service levelbecause publishing a process through a Web service interface makes it accessible to an …,Information and Software Technology,2007,41
Efficient sharing of sensor networks,Rene Muller; Gustavo Alonso,In this paper we tackle the problem of allowing applications to request different data atdifferent rates from different sensors of the same sensor network while still being able to runthe sensor network in an efficient manner. Our approach is to merge an arbitrary number ofuser queries into a network query. By doing this; traffic is minimised and the sensors havebetter energy consumption behavior than if all user queries would have been directly sent tothe network. In the paper we describe the algorithms for the transformation of queries andthe resulting data streams. We also provide an extensive performance evaluation of thealgorithms using sets of over hundred overlapping user queries executing on the samesensor network,Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems (MASS); 2006 IEEE International Conference on,2006,40
Cooperative modeling in applied geographic research,Gustavo Alonso; AMR EL ABBADI,The characteristics of geographic data and the nature of geographic research require theparticipation of many agents. Data is generated by multiple sources (satellites; groundobservation; weather stations; photography; etc.); accessed; processed and transformed bymany users and available for use to an even larger population of users. Lack of coordinationamong all these different agents may render large amounts of work useless. Most existingGIS (Geographic Information Systems) do not provide any support for cooperative work;which adds to the problem. To overcome this serious limitation while still allowing users totake advantage of GIS technology; we propose GOOSE; a system implemented as a toplayer for existing GIS. GOOSE provides the tools for constructing large geographic models ina cooperative environment with potentially many users and participants.,International Journal of Intelligent and Cooperative Information Systems,1994,40
Flexible and scalable storage management for data-intensive stream processing,Irina Botan; Gustavo Alonso; Peter M Fischer; Donald Kossmann; Nesime Tatbul,Abstract Data Stream Management Systems (DSMS) operate under strict performancerequirements. Key to meeting such requirements is to efficiently handle time-critical taskssuch as managing internal states of continuous query operators; traffic on the queuesbetween operators; as well as providing storage support for shared computation andarchived data. In this paper; we introduce a general purpose storage managementframework for DSMSs that performs these tasks based on a clean; loosely-coupled; andflexible system design that also facilitates performance optimization. An importantcontribution of the framework is that; in analogy to buffer management techniques inrelational database systems; it uses information about the access patterns of streamingapplications to tune and customize the performance of the storage manager.

Spontaneous container services,Andrei Popovici; Gustavo Alonso; Thomas Gross,Abstract Container technology (eg; Enterprise Java Beans) was designed for fixed networkapplications. This is unfortunate; because the ability of containers to adapt componentstransparently (eg; with persistence and transactions) would be of great advantage in mobilecomputing. In this paper; we generalize the container model into a new softwarearchitecture; the spontaneous container. A spontaneous container allows to homogeneouslyextend all applications of a network; even if they spontaneously join or leave the network. Inthe paper we show how to build a spontaneous container by unifying different technologiesinto one coherent architecture:(i) dynamic aspect-oriented programming;(ii) containers; and(iii) infrastructures for mobile computing.

A flexible hash table design for 10gbps key-value stores on fpgas,Zsolt István; Gustavo Alonso; Michaela Blott; Kees Vissers,Common web infrastructure relies on distributed main memory key-value stores to reduceaccess load on databases; thereby improving both performance and scalability of web sites.As standard cloud servers provide sub-linear scalability and reduced power efficiency tothese kinds of scale-out workloads; we have investigated a novel dataflow architecture forkey-value stores with the aid of FPGAs which can deliver consistent 10Gbps throughput. Inthis paper; we present the design of a novel hash table which forms the centre piece of thisdataflow architecture. The fully pipelined design can sustain consistent 10Gbps line-rateperformance by deploying a concurrent mechanism to handle hash collisions. We addressproblems such as support for a broad range of key sizes without stalling the pipeline throughcareful matching of lookup time with packet reception time.

Decentralized; distributed internet data management,*,In a light-weight transactional system architecture; each component providing a serviceperforms its own scheduling and transaction management. An invocation of one of theseservices (through remote method invocation) results in the creation of a local transaction(child of the invoking transaction and parent of any transaction that might be triggered byinvoking the services of other servers). The information that is required to build a globalcomposite transaction is implicitly added by the system to each call. Each transaction is;however; independently handled at each server. That is; the servers neither communicateamong themselves nor rely on a centralized component to make scheduling or recoverydecisions. In this way; components can be dynamically added or removed from the systemwithout compromising correctness. Regardless of the configuration; the system according …,*,2011,34
From web service composition to megaprogramming,Cesare Pautasso; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract With the emergence of Web service technologies; it has become possible to usehigh level megaprogramming models and visual tools to easily build distributed systemsusing Web services as reusable components. However; when attempting to apply the Webservice composition paradigm in practical settings; some limitations become apparent. Firstof all; all kinds of existing “legacy” components must be wrapped as Web services; incurringin additional development; maintenance; and unnecessary runtime overheads. Second;current implementations of Web service protocols guarantee interoperability at high runtimecosts; which justifies the composition of only coarse-grained Web services. To address theselimitations and support the composition of also fine-grained services; in this paper wegeneralize the notion of service by introducing an open service meta-model.

Transactional coordination agents for composite systems,Heiko Schuldt; H-J Schek; Gustavo Alonso,Composite systems are collections of autonomous; heterogeneous and distributed softwareapplications. In these systems; data dependencies are continuously violated by localoperations; and therefore coordination processes are necessary to guarantee overallcorrectness and consistency. Such coordination processes must be endowed with someform of execution guarantees; which require the participating subsystems to have certaindatabase functionality (such as atomicity of local operations; order preservation; and eithercompensation of operations or the deferment of their commit). However; this functionality isnot present in many applications and must be implemented by a transactional coordinationagent coupled with the application.

A low-latency non-blocking commit service,Ricardo Jiménez-Peris; Marta Patiño-Martínez; Gustavo Alonso; Sergio Arévalo,Abstract Atomic commitment is one of the key functionalities of modern information systems.Conventional distributed databases; transaction processing monitors; or distributed objectplatforms are examples of complex systems built around atomic commitment. The vastmajority of such products implement atomic commitment using some variation of 2 PhaseCommit (2PC) although 2PC may block under certain conditions. The alternative would be touse non-blocking protocols but these are seen as too heavy and slow. In this paper wepropose a non-blocking distributed commit protocol that exhibits the same latency as 2PC.The protocol combines several ideas (optimism and replication) to implement a scalablesolution that can be used in a wide range of applications.,International Symposium on Distributed Computing,2001,33
Understanding radio irregularity in wireless networks,Torsten Muetze; Patrick Stuedi; Fabian Kuhn; Gustavo Alonso,In an effort to better understand connectivity and capacity in wireless networks; the log-normal shadowing radio propagation model is used to capture radio irregularities andobstacles in the transmission path. Existing results indicate that log-normal shadowingresults in higher connectivity and interference levels as shadowing (ie; the radio irregularity)increases. In this paper we demonstrate that such a behavior is mainly caused by anunnatural bias of the log-normal shadowing radio propagation model that results in a largertransmission range as shadowing increases. To avoid this effect; we analyze connectivityand interference under log-normal shadowing using a normalization that compensates forthe enlarged radio transmission range. Our analysis shows that log-normal shadowing stillimproves the connectivity of a wireless network and even reduces interference. We …,Sensor; Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks; 2008.

We discuss three design alternatives; each oneof them exploiting different FPGA features and each one providing different performance/scalability trade-offs. An important result of the paper is to demonstrate how the inherentmassive parallelism of FPGAs can improve performance of existing algorithms but only aftera fundamental redesign of the algorithms.

Transparent heterogeneous mobile ad hoc networks,Patrick Stuedi; Gustavo Alonso,Most research on mobile ad hoc networks assumes a medium access (MAC) protocol similarto 802.11. Nevertheless; such networks can be built on top of any medium access scheme.An example are Bluetooth multi-hop networks (so called scatternets). In practice; manydevices support several interfaces although the protocol stack used in each interface tendsto be interface specific at the lower layers. This limits the ability of a device to switch backand forth between networks as need and opportunity dictates.

Using sql for efficient generation and querying of provenance information,Boris Glavic; Renée J Miller; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract In applications such as data warehousing or data exchange; the ability to efficientlygenerate and query provenance information is crucial to understand the origin of data. In thischapter; we review some of the main contributions of Perm; a DBMS that generates differenttypes of provenance information for complex SQL queries (including nested and correlatedsubqueries and aggregation). The two key ideas behind Perm are representing data and itsprovenance together in a single relation and relying on query rewrites to generate thisrepresentation. Through this; Perm supports fully integrated; on-demand provenancegeneration and querying using SQL. Since Perm rewrites a query requesting provenanceinto a regular SQL query and generates easily optimizable SQL code; its performancegreatly benefits from the query optimization techniques provided by the underlying DBMS.,*,2013,30
The perm provenance management system in action,Boris Glavic; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract In this demonstration we present the Perm provenance management system (PMS).Perm is capable of computing; storing and querying provenance information for therelational data model. Provenance is computed by using query rewriting techniques toannotate tuples with provenance information. Thus; provenance data and provenancecomputations are represented as relational data and queries and; hence; can be queried;stored and optimized using standard relational database techniques. This demo shows thecomplete Perm system and lets attendants examine in detail the process of query rewritingand provenance retrieval in Perm; the most complete data provenance system availabletoday. For example; Perm supports lazy and eager provenance computation; externalprovenance and various contribution semantics.,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,30
JOpera: Autonomic Service Orchestration.,Cesare Pautasso; Thomas Heinis; Gustavo Alonso,The increasing interest in new software engineering technologies for application integrationsuch as Service Oriented Computing and Service Orchestration has resulted in aproliferation of workflow management systems as the underlying representation andexecution platform for service composition [7]. Workflow management system are also beingapplied to new domains (eg; virtual scientific laboratories [1]; Grid computing [12]; servicedelivery and provisioning [6]). For these new applications; workflows are seen as themodeling metaphor behind the notion of straight through processing and virtualorganizations where a collection of existing heterogeneous systems are composed into anintegrated solution. In all these settings workflow engines are at the core of a complexcombination of applications and clustered computers. As such; they have become rather …,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2006,30
Software architecture evolution through dynamic aop,Paolo Falcarin; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Modern computing and network environments demand ahigh degree of adaptabilityfrom applications. At run time; an application may have to face many changes: inconfiguration; in protocols used; in terms of the available resources; etc. Many such changescan only be adequately addressed through dynamic evolution of the software architecture ofthe application. In this paper; we propose a novel approach to dynamically evolve a softwarearchitecture based on run-time aspect oriented programming. In our framework; a systemdesigner/administrator can control the architecture of an application by dynamically insertingand removing code extensions. It is even possible to replace a significant part of theunderlying middleware infrastructure without stopping the application. The novelty of thiswork is that it allows for a much more flexible development strategy as it delegates issues …,European Workshop on Software Architecture,2004,30
A flexible system for visual service composition,Cesare Pautasso,Abstract This dissertation brings together ideas of different research areas. First of all; wepropose the applicationof visual languagesto service composition. In order to con-nect basicServices of various kinds into a larger system; their interactions along the time dimensionare defined with the JOperaVisual Composition Language. As opposed to the textual or XML-based syntax of existingapproaches; our language features a very simple graphical notation.This visual syntax is used to specify the data flow and control flow graphs linking the variousservice invocations. This way; it becomes possible to rapidly build distributed applicationsout of a set of reusable Services by literally drawing the interactionsbetween them. Toachieve this; we present how usabilityfeatures such as automatic; incremental graph layoutand visual scalability features such as multiple views have been driving the design of …,*,2004,30
Shared workload optimization,Georgios Giannikis; Darko Makreshanski; Gustavo Alonso; Donald Kossmann,Abstract As a result of increases in both the query load and the data managed; as well aschanges in hardware architecture (multicore); the last years have seen a shift from query-at-a-time approaches towards shared work (SW) systems where queries are executed ingroups. Such groups share operators like scans and joins; leading to systems that processhundreds to thousands of queries in one go. SW systems range from storage engines thatuse in-memory co-operative scans to more complex query processing engines that sharejoins over analytical and star schema queries. In all cases; they rely on either single queryoptimizers; predicate sharing; or on manually generated plans. In this paper we explore theproblem of shared workload optimization (SWO) for SW systems. The challenge in doing sois that the optimization has to be done for the entire workload and that results in a class of …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,29
Dbfarm: A scalable cluster for multiple databases,Christian Plattner; Gustavo Alonso; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract In many enterprise application integration scenarios; middleware has beeninstrumental in taking advantage of the flexibility and cost efficiency of clusters of computers.Web servers; application servers; platforms such as CORBA; J2EE or. NET; messagebrokers; and TP-Monitors; just to mention a few examples; are all forms of middleware thatexploit and are built for distributed deployment. The one piece in the puzzle that largelyremains a centralized solution is the database. There is; of course; much work done onscaling and parallelizing databases. In fact; several products support deployment onclusters. Clustered databases; however; place the emphasis on single applications andtarget very large databases. By contrast; the middleware platforms just mentioned useclustered deployment not only for scalability but also for efficiently supporting multiple …,ACM/IFIP/USENIX International Conference on Distributed Systems Platforms and Open Distributed Processing,2006,29
Rack-scale in-memory join processing using RDMA,Claude Barthels; Simon Loesing; Gustavo Alonso; Donald Kossmann,Abstract Database systems running on a cluster of machines; ie rack-scale databases; are acommon architecture for many large databases and data appliances. As the data movementacross machines is often a significant bottleneck; these systems typically use a low-latency;high-throughput network such as InfiniBand. To achieve the necessary performance; paralleljoin algorithms must take advantage of the primitives provided by the network to speed updata transfer. In this paper we focus on implementing parallel in-memory joins using RemoteDirect Memory Access (RDMA); a communication mechanism to transfer data directly intothe memory of a remote machine. The results of this paper are; to our knowledge; the firstdetailed analysis of parallel hash joins using RDMA. To capture their behaviorindependently of the network characteristics; we develop an analytical model and test our …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,27
TRAMP: Understanding the behavior of schema mappings through provenance,Boris Glavic; Gustavo Alonso; Renée J Miller; Laura M Haas,Abstract Though partially automated; developing schema mappings remains a complex andpotentially error-prone task. In this paper; we present TRAMP (TRAnsformation MappingProvenance); an extensive suite of tools supporting the debugging and tracing of schemamappings and transformation queries. TRAMP combines and extends data provenance withtwo novel notions; transformation provenance and mapping provenance; to explain therelationship between transformed data and those transformations and mappings thatproduced that data. In addition we provide query support for transformations; data; and allforms of provenance. We formally define transformation and mapping provenance; presentan efficient implementation of both forms of provenance; and evaluate the resulting systemthrough extensive experiments.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,27
A unified approach to concurrency control and transaction recovery,Gustavo Alonso; Radek Vingralek; Divyakant Agrawal; Yuri Breitbart; Amr El Abbadi; Hans Schek; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract In this paper; we have addressed an open problem posed by [SWY93]: how tocharacterize the class of histories PRED in a constructive way so that unified schedulingprotocols can be derived from it. We have slightly modified the original definitions ofexpanded histories and PRED to account for certain executions; and we have provided anequivalent class; SOT; with a more constructive definition. This new class is used as thebasis for several protocols that implement unified concurrency control and recovery in anefficient manner. So far; our model is restricted to read and write operations. However; boththe model and the developed protocols can be generalized to transactions with semanticallyrich operations where recovery is based on compensating operations.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,1994,27
Main-memory hash joins on modern processor architectures,Çağrı Balkesen; Jens Teubner; Gustavo Alonso; M Tamer Özsu,Existing main-memory hash join algorithms for multi-core can be classified into two camps.Hardware-oblivious hash join variants do not depend on hardware-specific parameters.Rather; they consider qualitative characteristics of modern hardware and are expected toachieve good performance on any technologically similar platform. The assumption behindthese algorithms is that hardware is now good enough at hiding its own limitations-throughautomatic hardware prefetching; out-of-order execution; or simultaneous multi-threading(SMT)-to make hardware-oblivious algorithms competitive without the overhead of carefullytuning to the underlying hardware. Hardware-conscious implementations; such as (parallel)radix join; aim to maximally exploit a given architecture by tuning the algorithm parameters(eg; hash table sizes) to the particular features of the architecture. The assumption here is …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,26
Correctness in general configurations of transactional components,Gustavo Alonso; Armin Feßler; Guy Pardon; Hans-Jörg Schek,Abstract From a transactional point of view; composite systems are component basedapplications in which each component has its own transaction management logic. Thesesystems are highly relevant in practice since they are likely to be the standard architecturefor many future distributed applications. Unfortunately; there is no appropriate conceptualframework in which to reason about such systems. Following up on existing work thataddressed special cases of composite systems; in this paper we tackle the problem ofgeneral composite systems; ie; those with arbitrary configurations. We propose acorrectness criterion; develop a new proof technique that allows us to address arbitraryconfigurations; and discuss several important issues related to concurrency control indistributed systems.,Proceedings of the eighteenth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1999,26
Provenance for nested subqueries,Boris Glavic; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Data provenance is essential in applications such as scientific computing; curateddatabases; and data warehouses. Several systems have been developed that provideprovenance functionality for the relational data model. These systems support only a subsetof SQL; a severe limitation in practice since most of the application domains that benefit fromprovenance information use complex queries. Such queries typically involve nestedsubqueries; aggregation and/or user defined functions. Without support for these constructs;a provenance management system is of limited use. In this paper we address this limitationby exploring the problem of provenance derivation when complex queries are involved.More precisely; we demonstrate that the widely used definition of Why-provenance fails inthe presence of nested subqueries; and show how the definition can be modified to …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,25
Parallel computation of skyline queries,Louis Woods; Gustavo Alonso; Jens Teubner,Due to stagnant clock speeds and high power consumption of commodity microprocessors;database vendors have started to explore massively parallel co-processors such as FPGAsto further increase performance. A typical approach is to push simple but compute-intensiveoperations (eg; prefiltering;(de) compression) to FPGAs for acceleration. In this paper; weshow how a significantly more complex operation-the computation of the skyline-can beholistically implemented on an FPGA. A skyline query computes the pareto optimal set ofmulti-dimensional data points. These queries have been studied in software extensivelyover the last decade but this paper is the first to examine skyline computation in hardware.We propose a methodology that interleaves data storage and computation; allowing multipleoperations to be executed on the same working set in parallel; while accounting for all …,Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM); 2013 IEEE 21st Annual International Symposium on,2013,24
Control the flow: How to safely compose streaming services into business processes,Biorn Biornstad; Cesare Pautasso; Gustavo Alonso,Although workflow languages are widely used for composing discrete services; these arenot suitable for stream based interactions. In this paper we address the problem of how toextend a conventional Web service composition language with the ability to deal with datastreaming services. The paper discusses several modeling alternatives and presents amarker based semantics for safely dealing with pipelined processing in servicecompositions. The paper also presents application examples that illustrate the advantagesof the proposed approach,Services Computing; 2006. SCC'06. IEEE International Conference on,2006,24
A dynamic lightweight platform for ad-hoc infrastructures,Andreas Frei; Gustavo Alonso,Mobile devices like PDAs or mobile phones have become widespread. Similarly; networkfunctionality like GSM; Bluetooth; or WLAN has become standard. Nevertheless; not manyapplications take mobility into account. The reason may be due to the lack of an appropriateplatform supporting networking; discovery; activation of new behavior; etc. as it is used inenterprise applications. Hence; in this paper we propose a new dynamic lightweight platform-Jadabs-consisting of a small footprint core layer and a modularized pluggable distributedinfrastructure. Jadabs uses the service oriented architecture of OSGi and combines it with adynamic aspect oriented programming approach. In the paper we show how to extend OSGiwith dynamic AOP functionality and made the latter to work in a container. The resultingplatform is about 300 KBytes in size.,Pervasive Computing and Communications; 2005. PerCom 2005. Third IEEE International Conference on,2005,24
Consensus in a Box: Inexpensive Coordination in Hardware.,Zsolt István; David Sidler; Gustavo Alonso; Marko Vukolic,Abstract Consensus mechanisms for ensuring consistency are some of the most expensiveoperations in managing large amounts of data. Often; there is a trade off that involvesreducing the coordination overhead at the price of accepting possible data loss orinconsistencies. As the demand for more efficient data centers increases; it is important toprovide better ways of ensuring consistency without affecting performance. In this paper weshow that consensus (atomic broadcast) can be removed from the critical path ofperformance by moving it to hardware. As a proof of concept; we implement Zookeeper'satomic broadcast at the network level using an FPGA. Our design uses both TCP and anapplication specific network protocol. The design can be used to push more value into thenetwork; eg; by extending the functionality of middleboxes or adding inexpensive …,NSDI,2016,23
Deployment of query plans on multicores,Jana Giceva; Gustavo Alonso; Timothy Roscoe; Tim Harris,Abstract Efficient resource scheduling of multithreaded software on multicore hardware isdifficult given the many parameters involved and the hardware heterogeneity of existingsystems. In this paper we explore the efficient deployment of query plans over a multicoremachine. We focus on shared query systems; and implement the proposed ideas usingSharedDB. The goal of the paper is to explore how to deliver maximum performance andpredictability; while minimizing resource utilization when deploying query plans on multicoremachines. We propose to use resource activity vectors to characterize the behavior ofindividual database operators. We then present a novel deployment algorithm which usesthese vectors together with dataflow information from the query plan to optimally assignrelational operators to physical cores.

Computing throughput capacity for realistic wireless multihop networks,Patrick Stuedi; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Capacity is an important property for QoS support in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks(MANETs) and has been extensively studied. However; most approaches rely on simplifiedmodels (isotropic radio propagation; unidirectional links; perfect scheduling; perfect routing;etc.) and either provide asymptotic bounds or are based on integer linear programmingsolvers. In this paper we present a probabilistic approach to capacity calculation by linkingthe normalized throughput of a communication pair in an ad hoc network to the connectionprobability of the two nodes in a so called schedule graph GT (N; E). The effectivethroughput of a random network is modelled as a random variable and expected values of itare computed using Monte-Carlo methods. A schedule graph GT (N; E) for a given networkdirectly emerges from the physical properties of the network; like node distribution; radio …,Proceedings of the 9th ACM international symposium on Modeling analysis and simulation of wireless and mobile systems,2006,23
Programming for dependability in a service-based grid,Win Bausch; Cesare Pautasso; Gustavo Alonso,Service-based Grid infrastructures emphasize service composition rather than sharing of lowlevel resources. The idea is to build Grid applications out of computational services providedby the different sites of the Grid. Recent developments in the area of Web services havestrengthened this idea by standardizing procedures like service description; publication andinvocation. What is still missing is the infrastructure necessary to support the complete lifecycle of applications running on service based Grids; ie; suitable programming paradigms;execution infrastructure; and the ability to monitor and control such computations. Moreover;once computations are made of composable services; dependability becomes a key issuethat needs to be addressed by the infrastructure as it cannot be addressed separately byeach individual service. To address these concerns; we have developed the BioOpera …,Cluster Computing and the Grid; 2003. Proceedings. CCGrid 2003. 3rd IEEE/ACM International Symposium on,2003,23
Dependable computing in virtual laboratories,Gustavo Alonso; Win Bausch; Cesare Pautasso; Ari Kahn,Many scientific disciplines are shifting from in vitro to in silico research as more physicalprocesses and natural phenomena are examined in a computer (in silico) instead of beingobserved (in vitro). In many of these virtual laboratories; the computations involved are verycomplex and long lived. Currently; users are required to manually handle almost all aspectsof such computations; including their dependability. Not surprisingly; this is a majorbottleneck and a significant source of inefficiencies. To address this issue; we havedeveloped BioOpera; an extensible process support management system for virtuallaboratories. The authors briefly discuss the architecture and functionality of BioOpera andshow how it can be used to efficiently manage long lived computations.,Data Engineering; 2001.

Databases and Web 2.0 panel at VLDB 2007,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Volker Markl; Alon Halevy; AnHai Doan; Gustavo Alonso; Donald Kossmann; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract Web 2.0 refers to a set of technologies that enables indviduals to create and sharecontent on the Web. The types of content that are shared on Web 2.0 are quite varied andinclude photos and videos (eg; Flickr; YouTube); encyclopedic knowledge (eg; Wikipedia);the blogosphere; social book-marking and even structured data (eg; Swivel; Many-eyes).One of the important distinguishing features of Web 2.0 is the creation of communities ofusers. Online communities such as LinkedIn; Friendster; Facebook; MySpace and Orkutattract millions of users who build networks of their contacts and utilize them for social andprofessional purposes. In a nutshell; Web 2.0 offers an architecture of participation anddemocracy that encourages users to add value to the application as they use it.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2008,22
Processes in electronic commerce,G Alonso; C Hagen; A Lazcano,Trading communities; virtual business processes and virtual enterprises are key elements intoday's electronic commerce.

Efficient frequent item counting in multi-core hardware,Pratanu Roy; Jens Teubner; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract The increasing number of cores and the rich instruction sets of modern hardwareare opening up new opportunities for optimizing many traditional data mining tasks. In thispaper we demonstrate how to speed up the performance of the computation of frequentitems by almost one order of magnitude over the best published results by matching thealgorithm to the underlying hardware architecture. We start with the observation that frequentitem counting; like other data mining tasks; assumes certain amount of skew in the data. Weexploit this skew to design a new algorithm that uses a pre-filtering stage that can beimplemented in a highly efficient manner through SIMD instructions. Using pipelining; wethen combine this pre-filtering stage with a conventional frequent item algorithm (Space-Saving) that will process the remainder of the data. The resulting operator can be …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2012,21
Efficient exploration of large scientific databases,Etzard Stolte; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract One of the challenging aspects of scientific data repositories is how to efficientlyexplore the catalogues that describe the data. We have encountered such a problem whiledeveloping HEDC; HESSI Experimental data center; a multi-terabyte repository built for therecently launched HESSI satellite. In HEDC; scientific users will soon be confronted with acatalogue of many million tuples. In this paper we present a novel technique that allowsusers to efficiently explore such a large data space in an interactive manner. Our approachis to store a copy of relevant fields in segmented and wavelet encoded views that arestreamed to specialized clients. These clients use approximated data and adaptivedecoding techniques to allow users to quickly visualize the search space.

Pydron: Semi-Automatic Parallelization for Multi-Core and the Cloud.,Stefan C Müller; Gustavo Alonso; Adam Amara; André Csillaghy,Abstract The cloud; rack-scale computing; and multi-core are the basis for today's computingplatforms. Their intrinsic parallelism is a challenge for programmers; specially in areaslacking the necessary economies of scale in application/code reuse because of the smallnumber of potential users and frequently changing code and data. In this paper; based onan on-going collaboration with several projects in astrophysics; we present Pydron; a systemto parallelize and execute sequential Python code on a cloud; cluster; or multi-coreinfrastructure. While focused on scientific applications; the solution we propose is generaland provides a competitive alternative to moving the development effort to applicationspecific platforms. Pydron uses semi-automatic parallelization and can parallelize with anAPI of only two decorators. Pydron also supports the scheduling and run-time …,OSDI,2014,19
COD: Database/Operating System Co-Design.,Jana Giceva; Tudor-Ioan Salomie; Adrian Schüpbach; Gustavo Alonso; Timothy Roscoe,ABSTRACT Trends in multicore processors and hardware virtualization pose severestructural challenges to system software in general; and databases in particular. On the onehand; machines are becoming increasingly heterogeneous in terms of; ie; cachehierarchies; processor interconnect; instruction sets; etc.; thereby making it increasinglydifficult to develop optimal software for all possible platforms. On the other hand;virtualization forces databases to share resources with other applications without thedatabases having any knowledge about the run-time conditions. As part of a long-term effortin our group to revisit the entire software stack of the data center; in this paper we explorehow to enhance the interaction between databases and OS to allow the database bettercope with varying hardware characteristics and runtime conditions.

This is specially true for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) whereevery node moves arbitrarily causing the multi-hop network topology to change randomlyand at unpredictable times. In this thesis a new framework coping with the specific issues ofMANETs is proposed. The framework includes a QoS signaling protocol and flexibleresource allocation and adaptation mechanisms.

SWissBox: An Architecture for Data Processing Appliances.,Gustavo Alonso; Donald Kossmann; Timothy Roscoe,ABSTRACT Database appliances offer fully integrated hardware; storage; operating system;database; and related software in a single package. Database appliances have a relativelylong history but the advent of multicore architectures and cloud computing have facilitatedand accelerated the demand for such integrated solutions. Database appliances represent asignificant departure from the architecture of traditional systems mainly because of the crosslayer optimizations that are possible. In this paper we describe SwissBox; an architecture fordata processing appliances being developed at the Systems Group of ETH Zurich.

Log-normal shadowing meets SINR: A numerical study of capacity in wireless networks,Patrick Stuedi; Gustavo Alonso,The capacity of wireless multi-hop networks has been studied extensively in recent years.Most existing work tackles the problem from an asymptotic perspective and assumes asimplified physical layer model; as eg; the protocol interference model or the path loss radiopropagation. Real life network planning; provisioning and deployment can only be done withmore precise statements about capacity in finite networks. With this in mind; we adopt anumerical approach based on Monte-Carlo methods to study capacity under variousinterference and radio propagation models; including the physical interference model andlog-normal shadowing radio propagation. Our results indicate that; depending on theinterference model; capacity may experience a three phase transition related to theconnectivity of the network. We further show that throughput capacity increases in the …,Sensor; Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks; 2007. SECON'07. 4th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on,2007,18
Scalable 10Gbps TCP/IP stack architecture for reconfigurable hardware,David Sidler; Gustavo Alonso; Michaela Blott; Kimon Karras; Kees Vissers; Raymond Carley,TCP/IP is the predominant communication protocol in modern networks but also one of themost demanding. Consequently; TCP/IP offload is becoming increasingly popular withstandard network interface cards. TCP/IP Offload Engines have also emerged for FPGAs;and are being offered by vendors such as Intilop; Fraunhofer HHI; PLDA and Dini Group.With the target application being high-frequency trading; these implementations focus onlow latency and support a limited session count. However; many more applications beyondhigh-frequency trading can potentially be accelerated inside an FPGA once TCP with highsession count is available inside the fabric. This way; a network-attached FPGA on ingressand egress to a CPU can accelerate functions such as encryption; compression;memcached and many others in addition to running the complete network stack.

Aop support for mobile systems,Andrei Popovici; Gustavo Alonso; Thomas Gross,Novel forms of networking that either avoid a fixed infrastructure or allow direct interactionsbetween peers are rapidly becoming available for practical use. To support these newcomputing environments; it is critical to have an adequate software infrastructure. However;existing software architectures for distributed systems are tied too closely to traditionalcomputing paradigms. To address the constraints imposed by mobile systems (and to takeadvantage of the opportunities provided by these systems); it is necessary to abandon thecurrent paradigm in software design where software capabilities are determined at buildtime. Indeed; when the ability to react to changes or new environments is fixed in anapplication before it is deployed; the range of flexibility of that application is limited to whatcould be foreseen and was encoded by the designers. The result is that applications are …,Paper at the OOPSLA,2001,17
Highly available process support systems: Implementing backup mechanisms,Claus Hagen; Gustavo Alonso,Availability in process support systems (PSS) can be achieved by using standbymechanisms that allow a backup server to take over in case a primary server fails. Thesemechanisms; resembling the process pair approach used in operating systems; require theprimary to send information about state changes to the backup on a regular basis. In PSSwhere all relevant state information is stored in a database; there are two principal strategiesfor synchronizing a primary-backup pair. One is to use the replication mechanisms providedby the DBMS. Another is to implement a message mechanism to exchange state informationbetween servers above the database level. For both approaches; several variants exist thatallow to trade run-time performance for failover time.

The Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI)-Mission Description and Early Results,Robert P Lin; Brian R Dennis; Arnold O Benz,The Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) satellite waslaunched on 5 February 2002. Its objective is to study the energy release and particleacceleration in solar flares through observations of X-rays and gamma rays. Two noveltechnologies are combined to obtain both spectra and images over a broad energy range.For the spectroscopy; cooled hyperpure germanium detectors are used to cover the energyrange from 3 keV to 17 MeV with unprecedented keV-class resolution. Since focusing opticsare not possible for making images with such high energy photons; tungsten andmolybdenum absorbing grids are used to modulate the X-rays and gamma-rays coming fromthe Sun as the spacecraft rotates. This allows the spatial Fourier components of the sourceto be determined so that images can be made in spectral ranges where astronomical …,*,2013,16
Publishing persistent grid computations as WS resources,Thomas Heinis; Cesare Pautasso; Oliver Deak; Gustavo Alonso,Grid services can be composed into processes; providing a high level definition of thecomputations involved in terms of their data exchanges and control flow dependencies. Inthis paper we show how processes themselves can be efficiently published as grid servicesby mapping the persistent state of the process executions to standard compliant interfacesas defined by the Web Services Resource Framework (WS-RF). Mapping processes toresources is a fundamental step to enable recursive Grid service composition; wherecomposite grid services are themselves published as services. This gives processes astandardized and well-understood interface that enables their management; monitoring;steering and adaptation. Additionally it eases their reusability and simplifies integration intoexisting grid applications and portals. In order to determine the mapping's overhead; we …,e-Science and Grid Computing; 2005.

Histograms as a side effect of data movement for big data,Zsolt Istvan; Louis Woods; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Histograms are a crucial part of database query planning but their computation isresource-intensive. As a consequence; generating histograms on database tables istypically performed as a batch job; separately from query processing. In this paper; we showhow to calculate statistics as a side effect of data movement within a DBMS using ahardware accelerator in the data path. This accelerator analyzes tables as they aretransmitted from storage to the processing unit; and provides histograms on the dataretrieved for queries at virtually no extra performance cost. To evaluate our approach; weimplemented this accelerator on an FPGA. This prototype calculates histograms faster andwith similar or better accuracy than commercial databases. Moreover; the FPGA can providevarious types of histograms such as Equi-depth; Compressed; or Max-diff on the same …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,15
RapiLog: Reducing system complexity through verification,Gernot Heiser; Etienne Le Sueur; Adrian Danis; Aleksander Budzynowski; Tudor-loan Salomie; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Database management systems provide updates with guaranteed durability in thepresence of OS crashes or power failures. Durability is achieved by performing synchronouswrites to a transaction log on stable; non-volatile storage. The procedure is expensive andseveral techniques have been devised to ameliorate the impact on overall performance atthe cost of increased system complexity. In this paper we explore the possibility of reducingthe system complexity around logging by leveraging verification instead of usingspecialised/dedicated hardware or complicated optimisations. The prototype system;RapiLog; uses a dependable hypervisor based on seL4 to buffer log data outside thedatabase system and its OS; and performs the physical disk writes asynchronously withrespect to the operation of the database. RapiLog guarantees that the log data will …,Proceedings of the 8th ACM European Conference on Computer Systems,2013,15
A Dynamic AOPEngine for. NET,Andreas Frei; Patrick Grawehr; Gustavo Alonso,AOP technology is being used in many areas where separation of concern is important.Many systems available today have been developed with Java in mind and are currentlybeing improved on all layers from the interception mechanism and aspect interpreter to thelanguage and component model. The application of AOP paradigms to languages otherthan Java is still not widespread although there are advantages in doing so. For instance byadapting AOP techniques for. NET we can benefit from the multi-language dimension. Anapplication written in managed C++ could be easily crosscut with an aspect written in C# orany other managed language. This leads to a new abstraction of aspects where we are notbound to any language. In this paper we present a system that provides a basic dynamicAOP-Engine. It allows weaving and unweaving at runtime of advices in applications …,Technical reports,2004,15
Ad-hoc transactions for mobile services,Andrei Popovici; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract New developments in battery technology; networking; and devices allow thecreation of new business models based on mobile computing and not requiring any fixedinfrastructure. Mobile electronic commerce is today limited in size but future mobile networkswill grow dramatically. In such environments; the participating nodes must be selforganizedto collaboratively implement all the services a fixed network would provide. In this paper wepresent the design and implementation of a system that supports the development ofadaptive electronic services. We focus our attention on the problem of transactionalinteraction between nodes; which is an essential requirement in electronic commerce.

Shared queries in sensor networks for multi-user support,René Müller; Gustavo Alonso,Wireless sensor networks are still quite limiting in the way they can be programmed andused. For instance; most existing platforms for sensors networks allow only a singleapplication or user to run on them. This makes it difficult to; eg; have mobile usersconnecting to a local sensor network as they arrive at a new location. In this paper we tacklethe problem of supporting different applications over the same sensor network. The idea is toallow applications to request different data at different rates from different sensors of thesame sensor network while still being able to run the sensor network in an efficient manner.Our approach is to merge an arbitrary number of user queries into a single network query.By doing this; traffic is minimised and the sensors have better energy consumption behaviorthan if all user queries would have been directly sent to the network.

The adaptivemiddleware platform described to support the eventizing applications with extensions thatare added at runtime in response to new requirements or necessary adaptations. We arecurrently completing its implementation and exploring more advanced forms of adaptation;including dynamic changes to the event management system itself. Furthermore; theimplementation is still too heavy to run on resource-constrained devices like iPAQs; so weplan to take advantage of lighter virtual machines.,IEEE Distributed Systems Online,2005,14
Virtual devices: An extensible architecture for bridging the physical-digital divide,Shawn R Jeffery; Gustavo Alonso; Michael J Franklin; Wei Hong; Jennifer Widom,Abstract Data captured from the physical world through receptor devices such as wirelesssensor networks and RFID readers tend to be low-level; device-specific; inconsistent; andunreliable. Meanwhile; data management and query processing techniques in the digitalworld rely on understandable; consistent; and complete data. This paper aims to bridge thisphysical-digital divide by introducing Virtual devICEs (VICEs): extensible wrappers thattransform the data captured from the physical world into data that can be operated upon bytoday's data management systems. In this sense; VICEs provide what we term metaphysicaldata independence by shielding the above data processing system from the complexity ofreal-world data. This paper introduces the specific challenges to implementing VICEs; thefunctionality required of them; and outlines the VICE architecture. To validate the VICE …,Computer Science,2005,14

Processes+ transactions= distributed applications,Gustavo Alonso,In addition to the conventional operating system interpretation; the concept of process isstarting to be used to refer to complex sequences of computer programs and dataexchanges controlled by a meta-program. Thus; today one nds notions such as processcentered software engineering; business processes; or process based parallelism. In fact;the idea seems to have widespread acceptance in many areas; in particular in those wherecomputation is based on cluster of PC's and workstations or on environments involvingheterogeneous platforms and applications. A careful analysis of areas such as businessenvironments Fry94]; software engineering BK94] or scienti c data management ILGP96;BSR96] reveals a surprising number of problems that are both pervasive and common to allof them.

Partitioned data objects in distributed databases,Gustavo Alonso; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract In many distributed databases “locality of reference” is crucial to achieve acceptableperformance. However; the purpose of data distribution is to spread the data among severalremote sites. One way to solve this contradiction is to use partitioned data techniques.Instead of accessing the entire data; a site works on a fraction that is made locally available;thereby increasing the site's autonomy. We present a theory of partitioned data thatformalizes the concept and establishes the basis to develop a correctness criterion and aconcurrency control protocol for partitioned databases. Set-serializability is proposed as acorrectness criterion and we suggest an implementation that integrates partitioned and non-partitioned data. To complete this study; the policies required in a real implementation arealso analyzed.,Distributed and Parallel Databases,1995,14
Reducing recovery constraints on locking based protocols,Gustavo Alonso; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Serializability is the standard correctness criterion for concurrency control. Toensure correctness in the presence of failures; recoverability is also imposed. Pragmaticconsiderations result in further constraints; for instance; the existing log-based recoveryimplementations that use before-images warrant that transaction executions be strict. Strictexecutions are restrictive; thus sacrificing concurrency and throughput. In this paper weidentify the relation between the recovery mechanism and the restrictions imposed byconcurrency control protocols. In particular; we propose a new inverse operation that can beintegrated with the underlying recovery mechanism. In order to establish the viability of ourapproach; we demonstrate the new implementation by making minor modifications to theconventional recovery architecture. This inverse operation is also designed to avoid the …,Proceedings of the thirteenth ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1994,14
A hash table for line-rate data processing,Zsolt István; Gustavo Alonso; Michaela Blott; Kees Vissers,Abstract FPGA-based data processing is becoming increasingly relevant in data centers; asthe transformation of existing applications into dataflow architectures can bring significantthroughput and power benefits. Furthermore; a tighter integration of computing and networkis appealing; as it overcomes traditional bottlenecks between CPUs and network interfaces;and dramatically reduces latency. In this article; we present the design of a novel hash table;a fundamental building block used in many applications; to enable data processing onFPGAs close to the network. We present a fully pipelined design capable of sustainingconsistent 10Gbps line-rate processing by deploying a concurrent mechanism to handlehash collisions. We address additional design challenges such as support for a broad rangeof key sizes without stalling the pipeline through careful matching of lookup time with …,ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems (TRETS),2015,13
Demo abstract ad hoc social networking using MAND,Patrick Stuedi; Oriana Riva; Gustavo Alonso,ABSTRACT MAND (Mobile Ad Hoc Network Directory) is a middleware infrastructure for thedistribution; storage; and lookup of key/value pairs in ad hoc networks. The key insight inMAND is to piggyback tuples and requests on the messages that routing protocols exchangeto build and maintain routes in the ad hoc network. MAND can be used with different routingprotocols and does not require any modification to the routing protocols themselves. UsingMAND we have built AdSocial; a social networking application that allows users toexchange messages; set up SIP-based VoIP calls; and communicate common interests withnearby buddies. This demo will show the functionality of AdSocial and how MAND performsin a network of 10-15 Nokia N810 Internet Tablets communicating using AODV or OLSR.Conference participants will be able to interact with AdSocial while moving around thus …,Mobicom 2008,2008,13

With the advent of big data; there is an increasing demand for efficient joinalgorithms that can scale with the input data size and the available hardware resources. Inthis paper; we explore the implementation of distributed join algorithms in systems withseveral thousand cores connected by a low-latency network as used in high performancecomputing systems or data centers. We compare radix hash join to sort-merge joinalgorithms and discuss their implementation at this scale. In the paper; we explain how touse MPI to implement joins; show the impact and advantages of RDMA; discuss theimportance of network scheduling; and study the relative performance of sorting vs …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,12
Augmented sketch: Faster and more accurate stream processing,Pratanu Roy; Arijit Khan; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Approximated algorithms are often used to estimate the frequency of items on highvolume; fast data streams. The most common ones are variations of Count-Min sketch; whichuse sub-linear space for the count; but can produce errors in the counts of the most frequentitems and can misclassify low-frequency items. In this paper; we improve the accuracy ofsketch-based algorithms by increasing the frequency estimation accuracy of the mostfrequent items and reducing the possible misclassification of low-frequency items; while alsoimproving the overall throughput. Our solution; called Augmented Sketch (ASketch); isbased on a pre-filtering stage that dynamically identifies and aggregates the most frequentitems. Items overflowing the pre-filtering stage are processed using a conventional sketchalgorithm; thereby making the solution general and applicable in a wide range of contexts …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,12
Virtualizing stream processing,Michael Duller; Jan S Rellermeyer; Gustavo Alonso; Nesime Tatbul,Abstract Stream processing systems have evolved into established solutions as standaloneengines but they still lack flexibility in terms of large-scale deployment; integration;extensibility; and interoperability. In the last years; a substantial ecosystem of newapplications has emerged that can potentially benefit from stream processing but introducesdifferent requirements on how stream processing solutions can be integrated; deployed;extended; and federated. To address these needs; we present an exoengine architectureand the associated ExoP platform. Together; they provide the means for encapsulatingcomponents of stream processing systems as well as automating the data exchangebetween components and their distributed deployment. The proposed solution can be used;eg; to connect heterogeneous streaming engines; replace operators at runtime; and …,ACM/IFIP/USENIX International Conference on Distributed Systems Platforms and Open Distributed Processing,2011,12

Compared to CPU-based commodity systems; oursolution shows distinctive advantages for stream monitoring tasks; eg; wire-speedprocessing and predictable performance. The demonstration is based on a query-to-hardware compiler for complex event patterns that we presented at VLDB 2010 [1].

Workflows over workflows: practical experiences with the integration of SAP R/3 business workflows in WISE,Christoph Schuler; Heiko Schuldt; Gustavo Alonso; Hans-Jörg Schek,Abstract Business processes within companies are in general well established andsupported by commercially available workflow management systems. However; whenprocesses span multiple companies (such as; for instance; in the case of virtual enterprisesor in business to business electronic commerce); software support quite is limited. In suchcases; processes need to be implemented on top of already existing systems. The WISEproject addresses this problem and provides adequate infrastructure to support the wholelife-cycle of virtual enterprise processes; including the integration of legacy systems;especially of workflow management systems. In this paper; we describe our experience withthe integration of SAP R/3 Business Workflows into WISE.

Modeling and computing throughput capacity of wireless multihop networks,Patrick Stuedi; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Capacity is an important property for QoS support in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks(MANETs) and has been extensively studied. However; most approaches rely on simplifiedmodels (eg; protocol interference; unidirectional links; perfect scheduling or perfect routing)and either provide asymptotic bounds or are based on integer linear programming solvers.In this paper; we present a probabilistic approach to capacity calculation by linking thenormalized throughput of a communicating pair in an ad hoc network to the connectionprobability of the two nodes in a so-called schedule graph GT (N; E). The effectivethroughput of a random network is modeled as a random variable and its expected value iscomputed using Monte-Carlo methods. A schedule graph GT (N; E) for a given network isdirectly derived from the physical properties of the network like node distribution; radio …,Computer networks,2008,11
Autonomic computing for virtual laboratories,Cesare Pautasso; Win Bausch; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Virtual laboratories can be characterized by their long-lasting; large-scalecomputations; where a collection of heterogeneous tools is integrated into data processingpipelines. Such virtual experiments are typically modeled as scientific workflows in order toguarantee their reproduceability. In this chapter we present JOpera; one of the firstautonomic infrastructures for managing virtual laboratories. JOpera provides a sophisticatedEclipse-based graphical environment to design; monitor and debug distributedcomputations at a high level of abstraction. The chapter describes the architecture of theworkflow execution environment; emphasizing its support for the integration ofheterogeneous tools and evaluating its autonomic capabilities; both in terms of reliableexecution (self-healing) and automatic performance optimization (self-tuning).,*,2006,11

High availability; elasticity; and strong consistency for massively parallel scans over relational data,Philipp Unterbrunner; Gustavo Alonso; Donald Kossmann,Abstract An elastic and highly available data store is a key component of many cloudapplications. Existing data stores with strong consistency guarantees are designed andoptimized for small updates; key-value access; and (if supported) small range queries over apredefined key column. This raises performance and availability problems for applicationswhich inherently require large updates; non-key access; and large range queries. Thispaper presents a solution to these problems: Crescando/RB; a distributed; scan-based; mainmemory; relational data store (single table) with robust performance and high availability.The system addresses a real; large-scale industry use case: the Amadeus travelmanagement system.

One such approach that is startingto become more common is using hardware accelerators for stream processing. Typicallythese accelerators are implemented on top of reconfigurable hardware; known as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Though the value of FPGAs for data warehouses isgradually recognized by the database community; their true potential for various businessanalytic tasks is yet unexplored. In this line of research; we investigate FPGA technology inthe context of extreme data processing looking for opportunities where FPGAs can beexploited to improve over classical CPU-based architectures.

Crescando,Georgios Giannikis; Philipp Unterbrunner; Jeremy Meyer; Gustavo Alonso; Dietmar Fauser; Donald Kossmann,Abstract This demonstration presents Crescando; an implementation of a distributedrelational table that guarantees predictable response time on unpredictable workloads. InCrescando; data is stored in main memory and accessed via full-table scans. By using scansinstead of index lookups; Crescando overcomes the read-write contention in indexstructures and eliminates the scalability issues that exist in traditional index-based systems.Crescando is specifically designed to process a large number of queries in parallel; allowinghigh query rates. The goal of this demonstration is to show the ability of Crescando to a)quickly answer arbitrary user-generated queries; and b) execute a large number of queriesand updates in parallel; while providing strict response time and data freshness guarantees.,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,10
Consistently applying updates to compositions of distributed OSGi modules,Jan S Rellermeyer; Michael Duller; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Updating software at runtime is a challenge that covers various aspects of softwaredesign and runtime systems. The OSGi Alliance has proposed and standardized a runtimesystem for composing Java applications out of modules; the OSGi Framework. Thepossibility to update modules at runtime and thereby dynamically change the applicationhas been an intrinsic design decision of the framework architecture. With recent approachesto extend the OSGi model from single Java virtual machines to distributed systems; however;updates no longer only affect a single machine in the system. The specifications of OSGi andthe upcoming proposals for distributed OSGi services do not answer the question how toconsistently apply updates in such environments.

Wireless ad hoc VoIP,Patrick Stuedi; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract VoIP is one of the traditional application scenarios for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks(MANETs) in settings such as emergency response. Ideally; VoIP would be transparent tothe network type such that users would not have to worry whether their machine is currentlypart of a MANET or attached to the Internet. However; setting up a VoIP session using theSession Initiation Protocol (SIP) is difficult in MANETs since SIP relies on centralizedcomponents. In this paper; we show that the goal of transparent VoIP; for both isolated andInternet connected MANETs; can be achieved using SIPHoc; a SIP middleware for MANETs.We further discuss the deployment on laptops and iPAQ handhelds; and we look at variousSIP interoperability issues.,Proceedings of the 2007 Workshop on Middleware for next-generation converged networks and applications,2007,10

In existing systems; persistenceis added to an application at either compile or deployment time by using a variety ofmechanisms.

Backup and process migration mechanisms in process support systems,Claus Hagen; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Availability in Process Support Systems (PSS) can be achieved by using standbymechanisms that allow a backup server to take over in case a primary server fails. Thesemechanisms; resembling the process pair approach used in operating systems; require theprimary to send information about state changes to the backup on a regular basis. In PSSwhere all relevant state information is stored in a database; there are two principal strategiesfor synchronizing a primary–backup pair. One is to use the replication mechanisms providedby the DBMS. Another is to implement a message mechanism to exchange state informationbetween servers above the database level. For both approaches; several variants exist thatallow to trade run-time performance for failover time. This paper discusses the possiblestrategies and evaluates their performance based on an implementation within the …,Technical report,1998,9
Parallelizing data processing on FPGAs with shifter lists,Louis Woods; Gustavo Alonso; Jens Teubner,Abstract Parallelism is currently seen as a mechanism to minimize the impact of the powerand heat dissipation problems encountered in modern hardware. Data parallelism—basedon partitioning the data—and pipeline parallelism—based on partitioning the computation—are the two main approaches to leverage parallelism on a wide range of hardware platforms.Unfortunately; not all data processing problems are susceptible to either of those strategies.An example is the skyline operator [Börzsönyi et al. 2001]; which computes the set of Pareto-optimal points within a multidimensional dataset. Existing approaches to parallelize theskyline operator are based on data parallelism. As a result; they suffer from a high overheadwhen merging intermediate results because of the lack of a global view of the probleminherent to partitioning the input data.,ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems (TRETS),2015,8

Workload optimization using shareddb,Georgios Giannikis; Darko Makreshanski; Gustavo Alonso; Donald Kossmann,Abstract This demonstration presents SharedDB; an implementation of a relational databasesystem capable of executing all SQL operators by sharing computation and resourcesacross all running queries. SharedDB sidesteps the traditional query-at-a-time approachand executes queries in batches. Unlike proposed multi-query optimization ideas; inSharedDB queries do not have to contain common subexpressions in order to be part of thesame batch; which allows for a higher degree of sharing. By sharing as much as possible;SharedDB avoids repeating parts of computation that is common across all running queries.The goal of this demonstration is to show the ability of shared query execution to a) answercomplex and diverse workloads; and b) reduce the interaction among concurrently executedqueries that is observed in traditional systems and leads to performance deterioration and …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,8
Hardware killed the software star,Gustavo Alonso,Until relatively recently; the development of data processing applications took place largelyignoring the underlying hardware. Only in niche applications (supercomputing; embeddedsystems) or in special software (operating systems; database internals; language runtimes)did (some) programmers had to pay attention to the actual hardware where the softwarewould run. In most cases; working atop the abstractions provided by either the operatingsystem or by system libraries was good enough. The constant improvements in processorspeed did the rest.

Database replication: A tutorial,Bettina Kemme; Ricardo Jiménez-Peris; Marta Patiño-Martínez; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract This chapter provides an in-depth introduction to database replication; in particularhow transactions are executed in a replicated environment. We describe a suite ofreplication protocols and illustrate the design alternatives using a two-step approach. Wefirst categorize replication protocols by only two parameters and present a simple exampleprotocol for each of the resulting categories. Further parameters are then introduced; and weillustrate them by the given replication protocols and some variants.,*,2010,8
Service-oriented computing—introduction to the special theme,Jana Koehler; Gustavo Alonso,Service-oriented computing is an emerging cross-disciplinary paradigm for distributedcomputing; which is changing the way software applications are designed; delivered andconsumed. At the heart of service-oriented computing are services that provide autonomous;platform-independent; computational elements that can be described; published;discovered; orchestrated and programmed using standard protocols to build networks ofcollaborating applications distributed within and across organizational boundaries. Gridservices and Web services are currently the most common forms of service for implementingservice-oriented computing. Grid services provide the foundation for the distributedexecution of long-running scientific computations over very large data sets using astandardized and stateful service interface.

WISE: An Infrastructure for E-Commerce,Gustavo Alonso; Ulrich Fiedler; Amaia Lazcano; Heiko Schuldt; Christoph Schuler; N Weiler,Abstract The Internet and the proliferation of inexpensive computing power in the form ofclusters of workstations or PCs provide the basic hardware infrastructure for business tobusiness electronic commerce in small and medium enterprises. Unfortunately; thecorresponding software infrastructure is still missing. As part of the WISE project (Workflowbased Interned SErvices); we have taken concrete steps to address this limitation: withinWISE we have developed and deployed the software infrastructure necessary to supportbusiness to business electronic commerce in the form of virtual enterprises. The startingpoint was the idea to combine the tools and services of different companies as buildingblocks of a higher level system in which a process acts as the blueprint for control and dataflow within the virtual enterprise. From here; the goal has been to build the basic support …,PROCEEDINGS OF THE INFORMATIK'99 WORKSHOP" ENTERPRISE-WIDE AND CROSS-ENTERPRISE WORKFLOW MANAGEMENT: CONCEPTS; SYSTEMS; APPLICATIONS,1999,8
BatchDB: Efficient isolated execution of hybrid OLTP+ OLAP workloads for interactive applications,Darko Makreshanski; Jana Giceva; Claude Barthels; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract In this paper we present BatchDB; an in-memory database engine designed forhybrid OLTP and OLAP workloads. BatchDB achieves good performance; provides a highlevel of data freshness; and minimizes load interaction between the transactional andanalytical engines; thus enabling real time analysis over fresh data under tight SLAs for bothOLTP and OLAP workloads. BatchDB relies on primary-secondary replication with dedicatedreplicas; each optimized for a particular workload type (OLTP; OLAP); and a light-weightpropagation of transactional updates. The evaluation shows that for standard TPC-C andTPC-H benchmarks; BatchDB can achieve competitive performance to specialized enginesfor the corresponding transactional and analytical workloads; while providing a level ofperformance isolation and predictable runtime for hybrid workload mixes (OLTP+ OLAP) …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data,2017,7
Hybrid fpga-accelerated sql query processing,Louis Woods; Zsolt Istvan; Gustavo Alonso,Ibex [1] is a novel database storage engine featuring hybrid; FPGA-accelerated queryprocessing. The first prototype of Ibex has been implemented within the open-source MySQLdatabase. In Ibex; an FPGA is inserted into the data path between disk and CPU to act as aquery off-loading engine; operating on the stream of data towards the query processor. As aresult; the volume of data hitting the CPU is substantially reduced; thereby decreasingenergy consumption while increasing performance at the same time.,Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL); 2013 23rd International Conference on,2013,7
Server-efficient high-definition media dissemination,Philip W Frey; Andreas Hasler; Bernard Metzler; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Internet usage has changed dramatically in the past few years. Content is no longerdominated by static websites; but comprises an increasing number of multimedia streams.With the widespread availability of broadband connections; the quality of the media providedby video-on-demand as well as streaming services increases constantly. Even though todaymost videos are still encoded with a rather low bit rate; large Internet service providersalready foresee high-definition media becoming the predominant format in the near future.However; a larger number of clients requesting media at high bit rates poses a challenge forthe server infrastructure. Conventional stream dissemination methods; such as RTP overUDP or HTTP over TCP; result in high server loads due to excessive local data copy; contextswitching; and interrupt processing overhead. In this paper; we illustrate and discuss this …,Proceedings of the 18th international workshop on Network and operating systems support for digital audio and video,2009,7
Replication and migration of osgi bundles in the virtual osgi framework,Damianos Maragkos; J Rellermeyer; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract The OSGi framework is a Java-based technology which solves the problem ofsoftware modularization. Services are defined through a service interface andmodularization is achieved with the use of bundles interacting through services. The VirtualOSGi Framework project explores the large-scale distribution of OSGi services overheterogeneous computer networks. OSGi bundles and services can be deployed to a virtualframework; which autonomoulsy allocates them to physical nodes. Such an environmentrequires fault-tolerance; high availability and balanced load in order to be functional andresilient to failures which can occur in distributed systems. This can be achieved with the useof service replication and migration. The setup is highly dynamic and it reacts to changes inthe utilization and availability of resources.

Optimizing scientific databases for client side data processing,Etzard Stolte; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Databases are nowadays one more building block in complex multi-tierarchitectures. In general; however; they are still designed and optimized with little regard forthe applications that will run on top of them. This problem is particularly acute in scientificapplications where the data is usually processed at the client and; hence; conventionalserver side optimizations are of limited help. In this paper we present a variety of techniquesand a novel client/server architecture designed to optimize the client side processing ofscientific data. The main building block in our approach is to store frequently accessed dataas relatively small; wavelet encoded segments. These segments can be processed atdifferent qualities and resolutions; thereby enabling efficient processing of very large datavolumes. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2002,7
FPGA-accelerated Dense Linear Machine Learning: A Precision-Convergence Trade-off,Kaan Kara; Dan Alistarh; Gustavo Alonso; Onur Mutlu; Ce Zhang,Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a commonly used algorithm for training linear machinelearning models. Based on vector algebra; it benefits from the inherent parallelism availablein an FPGA. In this paper; we first present a single-precision floating-point SGDimplementation on an FPGA that provides similar performance as a 10-core CPU. We thenadapt the design to make it capable of processing low-precision data. The low-precisiondata is obtained from a novel compression scheme-called stochastic quantization;specifically designed for machine learning applications. We test both full-precision and low-precision designs on various regression and classification data sets. We achieve up to anorder of magnitude training speedup when using low-precision data compared to a full-precision SGD on the same FPGA and a state-of-the-art multi-core solution; while …,Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM); 2017 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on,2017,6
An FPGA-based smart database storage engine,Chongling Nie,Ever increasing database sizes and query complexity presents an opportunity for hybrid;FPGA-based co-processor systems to significantly improve database performance. Althoughperformance opportunities for FPGAs in fast data processing field are well-known; thedesign of a FPGA-based hybrid system still need for compromise between system flexibilityand high FPGA-compilation cost. Elimination of this compilation cost would dramaticallyincrease the efficiency of FPGA-based hybrid systems. An FPGA-based “smart” databasestorage engine is the focus of this thesis. We present a implementation of FPGA-based smartdatabase storage engine in a hybrid database system; which supports on-the-fly selectionand projection based filtering and at-runtime reconfigurations with high throughput and lowlatency.,*,2012,6
A lightweight and extensible platform for processing personal information at global scale,Michael Duller; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Advances in digital devices; computing; and networking have led to an everincreasing number of personal information being exchanged across the globe. Typically; thisis done through centralized; web-based applications like Flickr; YouTube; Twitter; orFacebook. In this paper we propose an alternative architecture for the dissemination ofpersonal information at a global scale. Our solution runs both within a data center as well ason a pool of personal devices such as mobile phones; desktop and laptop computers; orInternet gateways. Our approach leverages idle resources available in millions of devices;allows for much more flexible applications than the predefined services available on theweb; and permits users to exchange personal information in a peer-to-peer manner with thepossibility but not the requirement to store the personal data in a data center.,Journal of internet services and applications,2011,6
The virtual osgi framework,Dimitrios Papageorgiou,Abstract OSGi (Open Service Gateway Initiative) is an open industry standard. The OSGispecifications describe a dynamic module system for Java. It is a platform for managing Javasoftware modules; which are called bundles. Bundles can be combined to form largerapplications. An important aspect of the OSGi framework is the management of thedependencies between bundles. The OSGi framework was intented to operate on amachine. Recently; different approaches have emerged which are trying to facilitate remoteaccess to services through bridging between the otherwise isolated framework instances.The disadvantages of the bridging approach is that it does not provide a unified access tolocal and remote services and it does not provide dynamism. Achieving this wouldunavoidably mean altering the framework implementation. However; the middleware …,*,2008,6
A dynamic and flexible sensor network platform,René Müller; Jan S Rellermeyer; Michael Duller; Gustavo Alonso; Donald Kossmann,Abstract SwissQM is a novel sensor network platform for acquiring data from the real world.Instead of statically hand-crafted programs; SwissQM is a virtual machine capable ofexecuting bytecode programs on the sensor nodes. By using a central and intelligentgateway; it is possible to either push aggregation and other operations into the network; or toexecute them on the gateway. Since the gateway is built in an entirely modular style; it canbe dynamically extended with new functionality such as user interfaces; user definedfunctions; or additional query optimizations. The goal of this demonstration is to show theflexibility and the unique features of SwissQM.,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,6

Mirroring resources or mapping requests: implementing WS-RF for Grid workflows,Thomas Heinis; Cesare Pautasso; Gustavo Alonso,The Web services resource framework (WS-RF) and the Web services notification (WS-N)specifications are a crucial component of grid infrastructures. They provide a standardizedinterface to stateful services so that they can be managed remotely. There are alreadyseveral implementations of these specifications and initial performance studies havecompared them in terms of the overhead observed by a single client. In this paper; weaddress the problem of implementing the WS-RF and WS-N specifications for large scalesystems. In particular; we discuss how to implement WS-RF and WS-N as the managementinterfaces to a grid workflow engine.

Enforcing web services business protocols at run-time: a process-driven approach,Biorn Biornstad; Cesare Pautasso; Gustavo Alonso,Business processes provide abstractions for modelling business protocols that define thecorrect interactions between two or more Web services (WS). It has been shown that it ispossible to automatically derive role-specific processes from a global protocol definition andalso statically verify the compliance of a local process with the corresponding globalbusiness process. In this paper; we show that a similar approach can be used at run-time.We propose to employ process-based tools to enforce that the messages exchangedbetween different WS comply with a given business protocol; both in terms of sequencingconstraints and data flow characteristics. Our solution simplifies the implementation of WSbecause it helps to separate the concern of business protocol compliance from the actualservice implementation. To do so; we show how to transparently add a protocol …,International journal of Web engineering and technology,2006,6

Business processes are noexception and it is not rare to find the term transactional attached to that of businessprocesses. Unfortunately; there is quite a lot of confusion about what transactional means inthis context.

Asynchronous RMI for CentiJ,Douglas A Lyon,Abstract CentiJ is a software synthesis system that; until recently; used synchronous; semi-automatic static proxy delegation to help in the automation of the creation of distributed Javaprograms on NOWS (Networks of Workstations). This paper reports our recent extension toCentiJ so that invocations are asynchronous. Further; we have achieved transparency withrespect to local vs. non-local asynchronous invocations so that software can be properlytested in a local mode. Reflection helps in the creation of bridge pattern code (ie; interfacesand proxies) for asynchronous message forwarding via RMI. The CentiJ technique improvesprogrammer productivity by automating the creation of the housekeeping code. The use ofcompile-time static delegation enables type-safety. CentiJ leaves the part of the code thatforms the core computation unchanged. It generates new code that enables …,Journal of Object Technology,2004,6
Client-Caching Algorithms in a Video-on-Demand System,Defeng Ma; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract A growing number of applications need access to video data (eg; video-on-demand; digital library; multimedia messaging). As a result; the load on continuous mediaservers responsible for the storage and retrieval of videos; either from disks or from tertiarystorage devices; is becoming increasingly signi cant. The capacity of such continuous mediaservers is determined by the number of underlying disk drives as well as on the amount ofmemory available in the system. To increase the number of clients that can be supported;the clients' disks could be used as an alternative caching device in which to store video data.In this way; a client has the option of retrieving data from the server or from a near by client;thereby reducing the load of the server and increasing the overall capacity of the system. Inthis paper; three such clientcache algorithms are proposed. Performance results obtained …,HERMES-ESPRIT Long Term Research Project,1997,6
The role of database technology in workflow management systems (panel position paper),Gustavo Alonso,The main goal is to discuss the role of database technology and research in the new area ofworkflow management systems. There are several hundred workflow products in the marketand the database community has so far had very little impact in this area. Yet; the problemsfaced by workflow systems have a lot in common with problems which have already beensolved for databases. The paper aims to identify which database technology is relevant inthe workflow area and research directions that are most likely to have a significant impact onthe evolution of workflow systems.

FPGA-Based Data Partitioning,Kaan Kara; Jana Giceva; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Implementing parallel operators in multi-core machines often involves a datapartitioning step that divides the data into cache-size blocks and arranges them so to allowconcurrent threads to process them in parallel. Data partitioning is expensive; in some casesup to 90% of the cost of; eg; a parallel hash join. In this paper we explore the use of an FPGAto accelerate data partitioning. We do so in the context of new hybrid architectures where theFPGA is located as a co-processor residing on a socket and with coherent access to thesame memory as the CPU residing on the other socket. Such an architecture reduces datatransfer overheads between the CPU and the FPGA; enabling hybrid operator executionwhere the partitioning happens on the FPGA and the build and probe phases of a joinhappen on the CPU. Our experiments demonstrate that FPGA-based partitioning is …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data,2017,5
Centaur: A framework for hybrid CPU-FPGA databases,Muhsen Owaida; David Sidler; Kaan Kara; Gustavo Alonso,Accelerating relational databases in general and SQL in particular has become an importanttopic given the challenges arising from large data collections and increasingly complexworkloads. Most existing work; however; has been focused on either accelerating a singleoperator (eg; a join) or in data reduction along the data path (eg; from disk to CPU). In thispaper we focus instead on the system aspects of accelerating a relational engine in hybridCPU-FPGA architectures. In particular; we present Centaur; a framework running on theFPGA that allows the dynamic allocation of FPGA operators to query plans; pipelining theseoperators among themselves when needed; and the hybrid execution of operator pipelinesrunning on the CPU and the FPGA.

Scaling astroinformatics: Python+ automatic parallelization,Stefan C Müller; Gustavo Alonso; Andre Csillaghy,Thus; as platforms advance; workflow becomes less effi- cient because scientists cannot evolvetheir data processing and programming practices to keep pace with new pro- cessing techniquesand hardware advances. Changes are happening too rapidly to allow the needed economiesof scale. The cycle of narrower dataset scope; higher platform complexity; and increased availabledata is accelerating. In light of this cycle; rather than proposing new lan- guages or parallel programmingplatforms; computer scientists need to develop immediately practical tools that provide a flexibleinterface between the application domain and parallel computing. Scientists can then per- formtheir research independently without having to worry about modifying the parallel computingcode. In collaboration with several astronomy groups; we have developed such a tool. By insertingjust two decorators in sequential Python code; application developers can use Pydron …,Computer,2014,5
Challenges and opportunities for formal specifications in service oriented architectures,Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) are currently attracting a lot of attention inindustry as the latest conceptual tool for managing large enterprise computinginfrastructures. SOA is interesting from a research perspective for a variety of reasons. Fromthe software engineering side; because it shifts the focus away from conventionalprogramming to application integration; thereby challenging many of the premises aroundimproving development by improving programming languages. From the middleware pointof view; SOA emphasizes asynchronous interaction; away from the RPC/RMI model; andthus brings to the fore many of the inadequacies of existing software and hardwareplatforms.

Unfortunately; there is no clear conceptualframework in which to reason about transactional correctness in such an environment. Thispaper is a first attempt at developing such framework. Unlike most existing systems; whereconcurrent executions are controlled by a centralized scheduler; we will assume that eachelement in the system has its own independent scheduler receiving input from theschedulers of other elements and producing output for the schedules of yet other elementsin the system. In this paper we analyze basic configurations of such composite systems anddevelop correctness criteria for each case.

Quality of service in business-to-business e-commerce applications,Ulrich Fiedler; Bernhard Plattner; Gustavo Alonso,Electronic commerce has attracted a great deal of attention recently. Among the differenttypes of electronic commerce; business-to-business is the one most widespread in terms ofturnover. An important aspect in business-to-business e-commerce scenarios is how to meetthe response time and throughput requirements of applications in spite of execution takingplace across corporate boundaries and; in the future; via the Internet instead of using leasedlines. Given the unpredictable variations of available bandwidth in today's Internet; providingapplication quality-of-service guarantees for these requirements is a complex task.

Managing advanced databases: Concurrency; recovery; and cooperation in scientific applications,Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Transaction management encompasses a broad range of research fields. Filesystems; cache consistency problems; performance evaluation; I/O systems or parallelcomputation; to mention a few; are common issues in the design of a transaction manager.Such a variety of topics makes it very difficult to be comprehensive. This same diversitymakes it almost impossible to limit the research in the area to a unique aspect of transactionprocessing; especially when dealing with advanced (non-traditional) applications.

A unified implementation of concurrency control and recovery,Gustavo Alonso; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract this paper; we discuss the characteristics of such a scheduler and develop efficientschedulers based on a new class of locks. We start by proposing an equivalent definition forPRED. The original definition of PRED was stated in a recursive manner; which hinders itsuse for the development of dynamic schedulers. Our definition is procedural; and providesus with an easy; graph testing protocol for recognizing all PRED executions. However;serialization graph testing is known to be inefficient; and since locking is widely used forconcurrency control; we propose a locking based protocol to recognize a subclass of PRED.The unified theory relied on a specific implementation of the recovery mechanism; viz.; logsand before images. We develop an alternative recovery mechanism; which also uses logsand before images; but allows more concurrency among transactions. This recovery …,*,1993,5
Fast and robust hashing for database operators,Kaan Kara; Gustavo Alonso,Hashing is an essential part of many database operators; such as joins or aggregation;especially when executed in parallel. Often; database engines resort to using easilycomputed hash functions like modulo to prevent that hashing becomes a bottleneck. Thedisadvantage of simple hash functions is that they produce imperfect data distributions;particularly when the data is skewed. Robust hash functions produce balanced distributionsbut they are computationally expensive. Our purpose in this paper is to break the presenttrade-off between robustness and performance. We achieve this by showing how toimplement robust hash functions suitable for database operators on an FPGA. Our targetplatform (Intel QuickAssist QPI-FPGA) provides a shared memory architecture between theCPU and the FPGA; enabling database engines to use the hardware hashing without any …,Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL); 2016 26th International Conference on,2016,4

As aresult; most engines circumvent the OS and manage hardware directly. With the growingcomplexity and heterogeneity of modern hardware; database engines are now facing asteep increase in the complexity they must absorb to achieve good performance.

In this paperwe propose Many-Query Join (MQJoin); a novel method for sharing the execution of a jointhat can efficiently deal with hundreds of concurrent queries. This is achieved by minimizingredundant work and making efficient use of main-memory bandwidth and multi-corearchitectures. Compared to existing proposals; MQJoin is able to efficiently handle largerworkloads regardless of the schema by exploiting more sharing opportunities. We alsocompared MQJoin to two commercial main-memory column-store databases. For a TPC …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,4
Debugging data exchange with vagabond,Boris Glavic; Jiang Du; Renée J Miller; Gustavo Alonso; Laura M Haas,In this paper; we present Vagabond; a system that uses a novel holistic approach to helpusers to understand and debug data exchange scenarios. Developing such a scenario is acomplex and labor-intensive process where errors are often only revealed in the targetinstance produced as the result of this process. This makes it very hard to debug suchscenarios; especially for non-power users. Vagabond aides a user in debugging byautomatically generating possible explanations for target instance errors identified by theuser. Schema mappings are declarative constraints that model the relationship between asource and a target schema.

Distributed client caching for multimedia data,Defeng Ma; Gustavo Alonso,The client/server architecture of most multimedia systems limits their capacity and ability tosupport users. As a result; a signi cant amount of e ort has been devoted to improve thequality of service and overall throughput; mostly in the form of caching algorithms: intervalcaching DS94]; batching AWY96; DSS96]; optimization aspects LYW91; LWY93; SW97]; andcallback-locking FCL92]; among many others. This extended abstract also proposes a newform of caching multimedia data but based on a di erent premise; namely; that multimediadata is as demanding for the servers as it is for the clients and; therefore; it generallyrequires clients with a large storage capacity. Client sites should be able to retain largeamounts of data in their local disks after having accessed it for the rst time. Data may bediscarded only when space in the local disks becomes scarce which; in fact; may not …,Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Multimedia Information Systems (MIS97),1997,4

doppioDB: A hardware accelerated database,David Sidler; Zsolt István; Muhsen Owaida; Kaan Kara; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Relational databases provide a wealth of functionality to a wide range ofapplications. Yet; there are tasks for which they are less than optimal; for instance whenprocessing becomes more complex (eg; matching regular expressions) or the data is lessstructured (eg; text or long strings). In this demonstration we show the benefit of usingspecialized hardware for such tasks and highlight the importance of a flexible; reusablemechanism for extending database engines with hardware-based operators. We presentdoppioDB which consists of MonetDB; a main-memory column store; extended withHardware User Defined Functions (HUDFs). In our demonstration the HUDFs are used toprovide seamless acceleration of two string operators; LIKE and REGEXP_LIKE; and twoanalytics operators; SKYLINE and SGD (stochastic gradient descent).,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data,2017,3
Low-latency TCP/IP stack for data center applications,David Sidler; Zsolt István; Gustavo Alonso,TCP/IP is widely used both in the Internet as well as in data centers. The protocol makesvery few assumptions about the underlying network and provides useful guarantees such asreliable transmission; in-order delivery; or control flow. The price for this functionality iscomplexity; latency; and computational overhead; which is especially pronounced insoftware implementations. While for Internet communication this is acceptable; the overheadis too high in data centers. In this paper; we explore how to optimize a TCP/IP stack runningon an FPGA for data center applications with an emphasis on data processing (eg; key valuestores). Using a key-value store and a low-latency consensus protocol implemented on anFPGA as an example of the requirements that arise in data centers; we provide an extensiveanalysis of the overheads of TCP/IP and the solutions that can be adopted to minimize …,Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL); 2016 26th International Conference on,2016,3
Runtime parameterizable regular expression operators for databases,Zsolt István; David Sidler; Gustavo Alonso,Relational databases execute user queries through operator trees; where each operator hasa well defined interface and a specific task (eg; arithmetic function; pattern matching;aggregation; etc.). Hardware acceleration of compute intensive operators is a promisingprospect but it comes with challenges. Databases execute tens of thousands of differentqueries per second. Thus; if only one specific instantiation of an operator is supported by theaccelerator; it will have little effect on the overall workload. In this paper we explore thetradeoff between resource efficiency and expression complexity for an FPGA acceleratortargeting string-matching operators (LIKE and REGEXP_LIKE in SQL). This tradeoff iscomplex. For instance; the FPGA not always wins: simple queries that can be answered fromindexes run faster on the CPU. On complex regular expressions; the FPGA is faster but …,Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM); 2016 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on,2016,3

Ganymed: Scalable and Flexible Replication.,Christian Plattner; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Transactional web applications play an important role in e-commerce environmentsand lead to significant scalability challenges to existing database architectures. Replicationis an often proposed solution. Existing systems; however; often cannot guaranteeconsistency; scalability while supporting arbitrary access patterns. Ganymed; a middlewarebased replication solution; is intended to add scalability and adaptability to existingdatabases without having to give up consistency or having to change client software.

A dynamic lightweight architecture for ad-hoc infrastructures,Andreas Frei; Gustavo Alonso,Mobile devices like PDAs or mobile phones have become widespread. Similarly; networkfunctionality like GSM; Bluetooth; W-Lan has become standard. On the other hand not manyreal applications have taken the mobility into account. The reason maybe due to the lack ofan appropriate platform for applications which could use generic basic functionalities likenetworking; discovery; activation of new behavior; etc. as it is used in enterpriseapplications. Jini and JXTA have not been able to be adapted to small devices as theirresource usage goes beyond the availabilities of such devices. We propose a new dynamiclightweight platform-Jadabs-consisting of a small footprint core layer and a modularizedpluggable distributed infrastructure.

Service Specification Language,Ricardo Jiménez-Peris; M Patino-Martinez; S Woodman; S Shrivastava; D Palmer; S Wheater; B Kemme; G Alonso,A web service can be either a basic service (BSs) or a composite service (CSs). BSs areprovided by a single organization while CSs can be inter-organizational and are made up ofBSs and other CSs. The composition of BSs and CSs into a new CS requires specifying theproperties of the constituent services in order to predict the properties of the new service.This document deals with a language to specify web services in order to ease thecomposition of CSs. The specification will cover both functional and nonfunctional attributes.The description of functional attributes will follow the widely accepted specification for thedescription of web services; web service description language (WSDL)[1]. An important partof this document will be devoted to the identification of nonfunctional aspects of services thatwill prove helpful to predict the properties of the CSs built out of them.

Integrating Constraint Management and Concurrency Control in Distributed Databases,Gustavo Alonso; Amr El  Abbadi,Database systems often impose constraints on the values data items can take. Theseconstraints are determined by the application semantics. The traditional approach is toassume that user transactions respect such constraints. In particular; most transactionmanagers are based on the assumption that each transaction; if executed by itself on adatabase that meets the constraints; will transfer it to another state that also meets thoseconstraints. Serializability theory was developed to ensure that the interleaved execution ofa set of concurrent transactions is correct. Note that in this traditional model the system is notaware of the database constraints. The constraints are maintained by the transactions; notby the concurrency control protocol. Recently; proposals have been made to generalizethese protocols to shift the burden of constraint management from the transactions to the …,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,1994,3

Proposal of a three level complexity model for office automation,Fernando Sáez Vacas; Gustavo Alonso García,Office automation is one of the fields where the complexity related with technologies andworking environments can be best shown. This is the starting point we have chosen to buildup a theoretical model that shows us a scene quite different from the one traditionallyconsidered. Through the development of the model; the levels of complexity associated withoffice automation and office environments have been identified; establishing a relationshipbetween them. Thus; the model allows to state a general principle for sociotechnical designof office automation systems; comprising the ontological distinctions needed to properlyevaluate each particular technology and its virtual contribution to office automation. Fromthis fact comes the model's taxonomic ability to draw a global perspective of the state-of-artin office automation technologies.,*,1989,3

Shared scans on main memory column stores,Gustavo Alonso; Donald Kossmann; Tudor-Ioan Salomie; Andreas Schmidt,Abstract—Column stores and shared scans have been found to be effective techniques inorder to improve performance for many workloads. Another recent hardware trend makes itpossible to keep most data in main memory. This paper builds upon these trends andexplores how to implement shared scans on column stores in main memory efficiently. Inparticular; this paper proposes new approaches to avoid unnecessary work and to bestimplement position lists in such a query processing architecture. Performance experimentswith real workloads from the travel industry show the advantages of combining columnstores and shared scans in main memory over traditional database architectures.,Technical report/Systems Group; Department of Computer Science; ETH Zurich,2012,2
Exploiting synergies between service discovery and routing in wireless multihop networks,Patrick Stuedi; Manuel Graber; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Services like SIP or DNS are crucial to many applications in Mobile Ad HocNetworks (MANETs). However; most known service discovery mechanisms cannot be usedin MANETs directly since they rely on centralized components. Previous research haspointed out that coupling service discovery with a MANET routing protocol may greatlyenhance the efficiency and the performance of the discovery process. In this paper; wepresent the architecture and implementation of a distributed service discovery (DSD)framework that piggybacks service discovery information to routing layer messages withoutmodifying the routing protocol itself. The architecture is generic; it operates on abstractservices and can be used to implement any kind of service discovery mechanisms in adistributed manner. Furthermore; the DSD framework encapsulates all the routing specific …,Technical report/Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich; Department of Computer Science,2011,2
Recall and Precision in Distributed Bandwidth Allocation,Patrick Stuedi; Gustavo Alonso,Recent work on QoS in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) has shown that bandwidthneeds to be reserved in a distributed manner by also including interfering nodes. However;in practice; QoS protocols have difficulties to locally determine the set of nodes that actuallyinterfere with a given transmission. To solve this problem; it is not uncommon to consider allnodes within a distance of k hops (k-neighbors) as interfering nodes. In this paper we useMonte-Carlo methods to study the correlation between the k-neighborhood of a node andthe set of interfering nodes. We compute expected values for both reservation recall-thefraction of interfering k-neighbors to all interferers-and reservation precision-the fraction ofinterfering k-neighbors to all k-neighbors. The two metrics reflect the quality of a reservationand the loss of resources due to over-reservation. We further investigate the impact of …,Quality of Service; 2007 Fifteenth IEEE International Workshop on,2007,2

Design and evaluation of spontaneous container services,Andrei Popovici; G Alonso,Abstract Technologies like Jini offer spontaneous discovery and utilization of services.Container technology (eg'Enterprise Java Beans) allows the transparent adaptation of theapplication logic at deployment time. These two approaches tackle different sides of thesame problem: how to cope in a flexible manner with dynamic changes in the environmentwhere the application runs. Combining the two approaches leads to a virtual containerservice infrastructure in which services or functionality extensions can be dynamically addedto or removed from an application as needed. This is particular important nowadays giventhe increasing pervasiveness of wireless and ad-hoc networks as well as peer-to-peerinteraction.

The goal of DRAGONis to improve database replication strategies by using group communication primitives. As afirst step in this direction; we have developed a suite of protocols implementing databasereplication based on broadcast primitives. We are currently embedding these protocols intoa database management system to show the feasibility of the approach. In this short paper;we briefly discuss these protocols and analyze how they can be included in a databasesystem. Our contribution is to further clarify the effort involved in the process and to explicitlystate some of the issues commonly not considered by existing work.

Database/Operating System Co-Design,Jana Giceva,Abstract For decades; database engines have found the generic interfaces offered byconventional operating systems at odds with the need for efficient utilization of hardwareresources. This is partly due to the big semantic gap between the two layers. The rigidDB/OS interface does not allow for knowledge to flow between them; and as a result:(1) theoperating system is unaware of the database requirements; and provides a set of generalpurpose policies and mechanisms for all applications running on top;(2) the database can;at best; duplicate a lot of the OS functionality internally at the cost of absorbing significantportion of additional complexity in order to efficiently use the underlying hardware–anapproach that does not scale with the current pace of hardware developments.

In this work we explore the tailoring of standard software components tospecialized hardware as a way to get the energy efficiency of microservers withoutcompromising performance. Our specialized microserver implements memcached; acommon component in many web stacks; on a cluster of FPGAs. The design exploresaspects such as pipelining techniques; tight integration with the network stack; dealing withthe memory bottleneck; and shows how to build a complete system out of individualmicroservers.

Scaling Off-the-Shelf Databases with Vela: An approach based on Virtualization and Replication.,Tudor-Ioan Salomie; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Off-the-Shelf (OTS); relational databases can be challenging when deployed in thecloud. Given their architectures; limitations arise regarding performance (because ofvirtualization); scalability (because of multi-tenancy); and elasticity (because existingengines cannot easily take advantage of the application migration possibilities of virtualizedenvironments). As a result; many database engines tailored to cloud computing differ fromconventional engines in functionality; consistency levels; support for queries or transactions;and even interfaces. Efficiently supporting Off-the-Shelf databases in the cloud would allowto port entire application stacks without rewriting them. In this paper we present a system thatcombines snapshot isolation (SI) replication with virtualization to provide a flexible solutionfor running unmodified databases in the cloud while taking advantage of the opportunities …,IEEE Data Eng.

Exploiting multi-core parallelism with pipelining to solve skyline queries,Patrick Bänziger,Abstract Modern computer processors provide an increasing amount of parallel computationresources. Harnessing the full potential of these resources requires approaches that areadapted to this parallelism; especially as the core count increases. Solving skyline queries isa well-known; computationally intensive problem in the context of database systems. Manysolutions and optimizations have been suggested; most of which optimized parts of theimplementation or used pre-computed data structures to speed up the computation.However; the majority of approaches did not harness the potential of modern multi-coreprocessor architectures. The only approach that exploits multi-core parallelism so far; isbased on an input-partitioning scheme; which is not optimal as we will show in this thesis.,*,2013,1
FPGA-accelerated pattern matching over streams of events,Louis Woods,Abstract High performance computing; for example as required in the financial sector; isconstantly confronted with growing data volumes and an increasing need for fast results.Due to their highly parallel nature and despite their lower clock frequencies; field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) can outperform conventional CPUs on certain tasks.One such task with significant potential for FPGA acceleration is pattern matching withregular expressions. In this thesis we investigate different techniques for implementingregular expression engines on the FPGA. We begin with the most common application ofregular expressions; namely pattern matching in texts; eg as can be performed by grep—thepopular Unix text search utility. Later we generalize the problem of matching patterns in textsto pattern matching in streams of items that can have arbitrary data types. As an example …,*,2009,1
Modular derby,Pawel Kowalski,Abstract Database Management Systems (DBMS) rely on highly optimized engines.However the optimization process was driven by the context of self-contained systems.

While currentapproaches try to achieve performance by replicating or partitioning data in different ways; tominimize concurrent access; we take a different approach by modularizing an existingRDBMS (Apache Derby) into functional units; that are going to be distributed across severalphysical machines.

The OSGi framework describes an infrastructure formanaging the modules at runtime and composing loosely-couples applications throughservices. With R-OSGi; we have extended the scope of OSGi from single applications tonetworks of applications consisting of distributed services. However; the OSGi model isentirely Java-centric and not trivially transferable to other languages; without losinggenerality and interoperability.

ASAP adaptive QoS support with reduced reservation overhead in MANETs,Patrick Stuedi; Jianbo Xue; Gustavo Alonso,Existing QoS approaches for mobile ad hoc networks focus on optimizing end-to-endbandwidth allocation with respect to; eg; node mobility; link-failures and packet-loss.Typically this is achieved through over-reservation. This is specially true in looselyconnected networks or in high mobility scenarios where reservations take place only on partof the path because no end-to-end connection is available. In this paper; we propose ASAP;an Adaptive ReServation and Pre-Allocation Protocol for mobile ad hoc networks. ASAPprovides high service quality and minimizes wasted reservations. It does so by using asimple soft/hard reservation mechanism and a flexible signaling schema.,Technical reports,2004,1

Efficient Main-Memory Hash Joins on Multi-Core CPUs: Does Hardware Still Matter,Cagri Balkesen; Jens Teubner; Gustavo Alonso; M Tamer Ozsu,ABSTRACT The architectural changes introduced with multi-core CPUs have triggered aredesign of main-memory join algorithms. In the last few years; two diverging views haveappeared. One approach advocates careful tailoring of the algorithm to the parameters ofthe architecture (cache sizes; TLB; and memory bandwidth). The other approach argues thatmodern hardware is good enough at hiding cache and TLB miss latencies and;consequently; the careful tailoring can be omitted without sacrificing performance. In thispaper we resolve this conflict through an extensive experimental analysis of the designspace using different algorithms and architectures. We have taken the algorithms presentedin previous work and reimplemented them so that their results are comparable. We have runthese optimized algorithms on the same datasets and compared their performance results …,*,*,1
Reproducible Floating-Point Aggregation in RDBMSs,Ingo Müller; Andrea Arteaga; Torsten Hoefler; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract: Industry-grade database systems are expected to produce the same result if thesame query is repeatedly run on the same input. However; the numerous sources of non-determinism in modern systems make reproducible results difficult to achieve. This isparticularly true if floating-point numbers are involved; where the order of the operationsaffects the final result. As part of a larger effort to extend database engines with datarepresentations more suitable for machine learning and scientific applications; in this paperwe explore the problem of making relational GroupBy over floating-point formats bit-reproducible; ie; ensuring any execution of the operator produces the same result up toevery single bit. To that aim; we first propose a numeric data type that can be used as drop-in replacement for other number formats and is---unlike standard floating-point formats …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.09883,2018,*

3.11 Adaptive FPGA-based Database Accelerators–Achievements; Possibilities; and Challenges,Gustavo Alonso; Michaela Blott; Jens Teubner,In this talk; we show the achievements of our research on adaptive FPGA-based databaseaccelerators as well as possibilities and challenges of such a system. Our approach exploitsthe capabilities of partial dynamic reconfiguration of FPGAs [1; 2; 3; 4]. After the analysis ofan incoming query; a query-specific hardware processing unit is generated on-the-fly andloaded on the FPGA for immediate query execution. With such adaptive accelerator weachieve a 10 times better performance and up to 30 times better energy efficiency comparedto software only solution on an x86-based server [5]. The challenges are the neededflexibility as well as the support of many different operations for accelerate real multi-userdatabase scenarios.,Databases on Future Hardware,2017,*

Systems Group; Department of Computer Science; ETH Zurich,Sabir Akhadov; Ingo Müller; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Data analytics has become the driving force for many industries and scientificresearch. More and more decisions are maid based on statistical analysis of large datasetsand machine learning. Big data data processing frameworks; such as Apache Spark;provide an easy-to-use out-of-the-box solution; scalable to large machine clusters. Python isthe most widespread programming language in the data science field due to its simplicityand the abundance of analytical tools developed for it. Many Spark users would prefer itsPython frontend in their daily work. Multiple studies indicate; however; that there is a widegap between Spark's performance and the best handwritten code. With this thesis we bringthe functional data-flow programs' performance closer to the bare-metal speeds and showthat it is possible to write productively high performance code. i,*,2017,*
Scalable inference of decision tree ensembles: Flexible design for CPU-FPGA platforms,Muhsen Owaida; Hantian Zhang; Ce Zhang; Gustavo Alonso,Decision tree ensembles are commonly used in a wide range of applications and becomingthe de facto algorithm for decision tree based classifiers. Different trees in an ensemble canbe processed in parallel during tree inference; making them a suitable use case for FPGAs.Large tree ensembles; however; require careful mapping of trees to on-chip memory andmanagement of memory accesses. As a result; existing FPGA solutions suffer from theinability to scale beyond tens of trees and lack the flexibility to support different treeensembles. In this paper we present an FPGA tree ensemble classifier together with asoftware driver to efficiently manage the FPGA's memory resources. The classifierarchitecture efficiently utilizes the FPGA's resources to fit half a million tree nodes in on-chipmemory; delivering up to 20× speedup over a 10-threaded CPU implementation when …,Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL); 2017 27th International Conference on,2017,*
Many-query join: efficient shared execution of relational joins on modern hardware,Darko Makreshanski; Georgios Giannikis; Gustavo Alonso; Donald Kossmann,Abstract Database architectures typically process queries one at a time; executingconcurrent queries in independent execution contexts. Often; such a design leads tounpredictable performance and poor scalability. One approach to circumvent the problem isto take advantage of sharing opportunities across concurrently running queries. In thispaper; we propose many-query join (MQJoin); a novel method for sharing the execution of ajoin that can efficiently deal with hundreds of concurrent queries. This is achieved byminimizing redundant work and making efficient use of main-memory bandwidth and multi-core architectures. Compared to existing proposals; MQJoin is able to efficiently handlelarger workloads regardless of the schema by exploiting more sharing opportunities. Wealso compared MQJoin to two commercial main-memory column-store databases. For a …,The VLDB Journal,2017,*

Generalization versus Specialization in Cloud Computing Infrastructures,Gustavo Alonso,Summary form only given. Cloud computing represents a fundamental change in thebusiness model behind IT: a shift from manufacturing of software and hardware productstowards packaging infrastructure; processing; and storage as services. Cloud data centers;given their intended use for general purpose computing; would seem to push towardshomogeneity in architectures and platforms. Modern applications and use cases; fromscientific computing to big data; push in exactly the opposite direction: an increase inspecialization as a way to efficiently meet demanding requirements. In this talk I will illustrateboth trends and argue that; contradictory as they seem to be; there are many opportunities incombining them. Doing so requires to work in two areas.

Performance Analysis of Decision Tree Learning Algorithms on Multicore CPUs,Jingyi Wang,Abstract Decision trees are widely-used in data mining and machine learning. They are easyto interpret and are key components of ensemble methods like random forests and gradientboosting decision trees. The main tasks of growing a decision tree include: scanning thedata at each tree node; computing a class frequency-based metric to find the best splittingpoint; and splitting the node into child nodes. As multicore CPUs are commonly usednowadays; we investigate in this thesis various ways to parallelize the C4. 5 decision treealgorithm to improve its running speed on multicore CPUs. One challenge in parallelizingthe growing of a decision tree is the difficulty to achieve efficient memory bandwidthutilization throughout the whole algorithm. This is due to the need to sort numerical attributes(ie attributes that potentially have continuous numerical values) in order to find the …,*,2016,*
Basslet: an OS runtime for parallel data processing,Jana Giceva; Gerd Zellweger; Gustavo Alonso; Timothy Roscoe,We revisit the problem of scheduling multiple parallel programs on modern hardware; in thelight of new OS and application designs. Current operating systems are oblivious to theapplication-level information needed to efficiently schedule and execute parallel dataapplications (eg [2]). Traditionally they decide on the allocation of threads unaware of theinternal properties of the application's algorithm; relations between threads or thecharacteristics of the input data; often leading to unpredictable and sub-optimalperformance. As a result; operating systems either open up their interfaces so that theapplication can take over the management of resources (two-level scheduling [1; 4; 5]); ormake use of parallel runtime systems to perform this task on behalf of the operating system.This approach works for a single application (albeit at a high cost for the developer) but it …,Workshop on Multicore and Rack-scale Systems (MaRS'16),2016,*

Decentralized; distributed internet data management,*,In a light-weight transactional system architecture; each component providing a serviceperforms its own scheduling and transaction management. An invocation of one of theseservices (through remote method invocation) results in the creation of a local transaction(child of the invoking transaction and parent of any transaction that might be triggered byinvoking the services of other servers). The information that is required to build a globalcomposite transaction is implicitly added by the system to each call. Each transaction is;however; independently handled at each server. That is; the servers neither communicateamong themselves nor rely on a centralized component to make scheduling or recoverydecisions. In this way; components can be dynamically added or removed from the systemwithout compromising correctness. Regardless of the configuration; the system according …,*,2013,*

Optimization of concurrent queries in wireless sensor networks,René Müller; Gustavo Alonso,ABSTRACT The lessons learned so far from a variety of deployments of wireless sensornetworks is that they are still expensive and complex systems to deploy; run; and maintain.One way to make sensor networks more cost effective is to support concurrent queries ratherthan a single static query from a single application as it is today the case in most systemsand deployments. To this end; in this paper we describe how to perform multi-queryoptimization in wireless sensor networks. The optimizer we propose takes a constant streamof queries as input and dynamically determines what is the best execution plan (or small setof plans) to run at the sensors while still being able to answer (a potentially much larger setof) user queries. As queries arrive and depart; our optimizer tries to merge and split thequeries to optimize the work done at the sensor level.

Guest Editors’ message,Gustavo Alonso; David Lomet; Umesh Dayal,The 2006 VLDB Conference in Seoul; Korea; was another very successful instance of aVLDB conference and also one that set several new records. The Program Committeereceived a record number of submissions in all its tracks: 334 papers in the core track; 292 inthe information infrastructure track; and 59 in the industry and applications track. To putthese data into perspective; VLDB 2006 got 300 more submissions in total than any of theconferences in the 1990s and between 200 and 300 more papers than the previousconferences in the new millennium. Attendance at the conference reached a new all timehigh with 685 registered attendees. As PC Track Chairs; we worked hard to ensure that allpapers were treated fairly. We wanted the final program to be the strongest possible;covering the exciting new areas as well as the more traditional; reflecting the best …,The VLDB Journal,2008,*
VM-based event-processing in sensor networks,Jun Li,Abstract Due to the lack of suitable programming model and adequate infrastructure support;building sensor networks to detect complex events is still complex and time-consuming. Tofacilitate the development of event processing applications on sensor networks; weproposed a middleware architecture which includes a programming language and a runtimesupport. SNEPL (SensorNet Event Pattern Language) is a declarative language which canbe used to recognize complex events through pattern matching. Event processingapplications are then expressed in the form of SNEPL patterns which are further compiledinto state machines. State machines are interpreted and executed by SwissEM (ScalableWIrelesS Sensor network Event Machine)-a bytecode virtual machine running on top ofsensor networks. With the help of this middleware infrastructure; programming sensor …,*,2008,*

D6: Specification of Unified Service Composition Language (USCL),Cesare Pautasso; Thomas Heinis; Gustavo Alonso,Executive Summary The purpose of this deliverable is to specify the SODIUM UnifiedService Composition Language (USCL). USCL documents are written using the XML syntax;in order to facilitate the development of the related SODIUM tools. The main feature of thelanguage consists of providing support for composing an open set of services; includingWeb; Grid and P2P services. The description of the compositions is kept separate from thedescription of the components; in order to enhance the reusability of both. Compositions aremodelled as processes; whose structure defines the data and control flow dependenciesbetween the service invocations; as well as the required exception handling behaviour.Components are modelled as services; an abstraction that makes the mechanism used toaccess the corresponding implementation transparent.,*,2005,*

A Probabilistic Model for Capacity in Wireless Multihop Networks,Patrick Stuedi; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract—Capacity is an important property for QoS sup-port in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks(MANETs) and has recently attracted considerable attention in research. However; mostapproaches rely on simplified models (infinite network; isotropic radio propagation;unidirectional links; perfect scheduling; etc.) and provide only asymptotic bounds or integerlinear programming equations. In this paper we take a probabilistic approach and modelcapacity as a random variable that depends on node distribution; communication pattern;radio propagation and channel assignment. Expected values for the random variable at agiven point within the parameter space are then computed using Monte-Carlo simulation.The modularity of the approach allows for capacity analysis under more realistic networkmodels. We demonstrate the potential of such a model by showing that for …,Technical report/Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich; Department of Computer Science,2005,*

Dynamic software adaptation: middleware for pervasive computing,Gustavo Alonso,Abstract The many different application scenarios found in pervasive and ubiquitouscomputing have one aspect in common: software will be confronted with continuouslychanging execution environments. To guarantee seamless service; protocols; infrastructure;and applications will have to be able to adapt to changes in; eg; networks; systemconfiguration; available resources; varying policies; etc. In other words; adaptation will haveto be a key feature of any mobile software system. In this talk I will discuss the problemsencountered when designing middleware for pervasive computing and the role that softwareengineering could play in solving those problems. I will mostly focus on dynamic softwareadaptation and how it can be used to great effect to provide much more flexible softwareplatforms. The talk will revolve around the work done on the PROSE system; a modified …,International Workshop on Software Engineering and Middleware,2004,*

Distributed Information Systems,Gustavo Alonso; Fabio Casati; Harumi Kuno; Vijay Machiraju,Abstract Web services are a form of distributed information system. Many of the problemsthat Web services try to solve; as well as the design constraints encountered along the way;can be understood by considering how distributed information systems evolved in the past.As part of this evolution process; a key aspect to keep in mind is that while the technologyhas changed; the problems that need to be solved are to a large extent the same. Thus; thefirst step toward looking at Web services from the correct perspective is to develop acomprehensive understanding of distributed information systems.,*,2004,*
Basic Web Services Technology,Gustavo Alonso; Fabio Casati; Harumi Kuno; Vijay Machiraju,Abstract Many Web services architectures today are based on three components: the servicerequester; the service provider; and the service registry; thereby closely following aclient/server model with an explicit name and directory service (the service registry). Albeitsimple; such an architecture illustrates quite well the basic infrastructure necessary toimplement Web services: a way to communicate (SOAP); a way to describe services(WSDL); and a name and directory server (UDDI). SOAP; WSDL and UDDI are nowadaysthe core of Web services. Specifications covering other aspects are typically designed basedon SOAP; WSDL and UDDI. This is similar to the way conventional middleware platforms arebuilt; where the basic components are interaction protocols; IDLs; and name and directoryservices.,*,2004,*
Web Technologies,Gustavo Alonso; Fabio Casati; Harumi Kuno; Vijay Machiraju,Abstract In Chapter 3; we have studied the need for integrating enterprise applications inorder to achieve business process automation. The need to integrate; however; is not limitedto the systems within a single company. The same advantages that can be derived fromautomating a company's business processes can be obtained from automating businessprocesses encompassing several companies. Hence; it should not come as a surprise thatthere is as much interest in inter-enterprise application integration as there is in intra-enterprise application integration. This chapter serves as a transition between the chaptersthat precede; which focus on intra-enterprise application integration and on middlewareservices; and the chapters that follow; which describe Web services for inter-enterpriseapplication integration. The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the basic Web …,*,2004,*
Service coordination protocols,Gustavo Alonso; Fabio Casati; Harumi Kuno; Vijay Machiraju,Abstract The basic Web services infrastructure presented in the previous chapter suffices toimplement simple interactions. In particular; it supports interactions where the client invokesa single operation on a Web service. When the interaction involves coordinated sequencesof operations; additional abstractions and tools are needed to ensure the correctness andconsistency of the interactions. This is no different from how conventional middlewareevolved. RPCs support simple; one-call-at-a-time interactions between clients and servers.Adding guarantees to the interactions (eg; transactions); requires additional protocols (egtwo-phase commit) and an infrastructure that supports the necessary abstractions and thecorresponding protocols (eg; a TP monitor). The same applies to Web services. Once we gobeyond simple; independent service invocations; new protocols; abstractions; and …,*,2004,*
A Context-based Transformation of Highlevel Conceptual Query Trees,David Bär,Abstract Creating a unified view on structured data residing in different; heterogeneous datasources is a problem that exists in many application domains. Various approaches havebeen proposed to address it. In this thesis; a different approach is taken by using an existing;ontology based querying tool and extending it to cope with heterogeneous data sources.The approach uses a mapping from ontology symbols to data source symbols on a high-level query tree. A RDF (Resource Description Framework) compliant description of datasources is proposed. Furthermore; a prototype implementation is presented. The approachis compared with other; description logic based; data integration approaches.,*,2004,*
Improving the efficiency of adaptive middleware based on dynamic AOP,Angela Nicoarǎ; Johann Gyger; Gustavo Alonso,Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is used to express modular and orthogonalfunctionality in software components. The orthogonal functionality is programmed into anaspect; join points are used to describe where in the code the aspect should be inserted.Then the aspect is woven into the original program. Unlike compile time based strategies;dynamic AOP allows aspects to be woven at runtime. This has been shown to be very usefulto adapt applications without interrupting service in a wide range of settings (businessapplications; wireless networks; robotics; etc.); thereby making dynamic AOP a primecandidate for supporting advanced; adaptive middleware platforms. A potential drawback ofdynamic AOP is the performance overhead. In this paper; we tackle the performanceproblem by proposing a mechanism to implement dynamic AOP through method code …,Technical reports,2004,*

Large scale processing of microarray data,Reto Schaeppi,In the last decade various projects; such as the Human Genome Project; have beenlaunched to clone; map and sequence the genome of different organisms. The genome ofseveral organisms; like Homo Sapiens or mouse; has already been determined and ispublicly available. The ultimate goal of these efforts is the understanding of how anorganisms genome acts as blueprint for defining its vital functions. Within the HumanGenome Project; the researchers have catalogued over 4 million expressed sequence tags(ESTs)[1]. These ESTs correspond to a not yet determined number of unique human genes.Recent estimations range between 25'000 and 40'000 [2; 3].

Reducing the Latency of Non-Blocking Commitment using Optimism and Replication,R Jiménez-Peris; M Patino-Martınez; G Alonso; S Arévalo; Escuela de Ciencias Experimentales,Atomic commitment protocols are used to ensure the atomicity of atomic transactions. Thebest known and most widely used atomic commitment protocol is two phase commit (2PC).The main idea behind 2PC is to perform two rounds of voting under the guidance of a siteacting as coordinator. The coordinator asks first for votes on whether to commit (yes vote) orabort (no vote) the transaction. The participants send their vote and the coordinator decidesto commit if all participants voted yes. Otherwise the decision is to abort. The main drawbackof 2PC is that it might block. This happens when the coordinator fails after having receivedyes votes from all participants but before sending the commit message. In that situation; theparticipants cannot make a decision among themselves because they do not know what thecoordinator decided before it failed. By deciding to commit or abort; they could be doing …,IEEE Int. Conf. on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN). Goteborg; Sweden,2001,*
Dependable Computing in Virtual Laboratories,Cesare Pautasso,Abstract: Many scientific disciplines are shifting from in vitro to in silico research as morephysical processes and natural phenomena are examined in a computer (in silico) insteadof being observed (in vitro). In many of these virtual laboratories; the computations involvedare very complex and long lived. Currently; users are required to manually handle almost allaspects of such computations; including their dependability. Not surprisingly; this is a majorbottleneck and a significant source of inefficiencies. To address this issue; we havedeveloped BioOpera; an extensible process support management system for virtuallaboratories. In this paper; we briefly discuss the architecture and functionality of Bio-Operaand show how it can be used to efficiently manage long lived computations.,Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Data Engineering,2001,*

These computations typicallyrun for long periods of time and produce vast amounts of data. Currently; users are requiredto manage system resources; data; and the distribution of each process throughout theentire computation. Not surprisingly; this introduces a major bottleneck in the wholeprocedure. This paper describes the architecture of BioOpera; a process managementsystem that controls the distribution; execution; and monitoring of large-scale computationson clusters of computers.

Integrating Synchronous Update-Everywhere Replication into the PostgreSQL Database Engine,Gustavo Alonso; Bettina Kemme; Win Bausch,A replicated database is a distributed database in which multiple copies of the same dataitems are stored at several different sites. In contrast to non-replicated databases whereeach data item is only stored at a single site; a replicated database offers the advantage ofincreased fault tolerance and performance. Fault tolerance is achieved since data is not onlystored at one single database node; whereas performance is gained because transactionsdo not have to access remote sites; they can execute on their local copy of the database.This mechanism works as long as a transaction issues read operations. If it executes a writeoperation; the database is inconsistent since data items at different sites; which logicallyrepresent one single data item; have different values. Obviously some mechanism has to beprovided to synchronize the different copies so as to preserve consistency. Several …,*,1999,*
Workflows over Workflows: Practical Experiences with the Integration of SAP R/3 Business Workflows in,Christoph Schuler Heiko; Heiko Schuldt; Gustavo Alonso; Hans-jorg Schek,Abstract Business processes within companies are in general well established andsupported by commercially available workflow management systems. However; whenprocesses span multiple companies (such as; for instance; in the case of virtual enterprisesor in business to business electronic commerce); software support quite is limited. In suchcases; processes need to be implemented on top of already existing systems. The Wiseproject addresses this problem and provides adequate infrastructure to support the wholelife-cycle of virtual enterprise processes; including the integration of legacy systems;especially of workflow management systems. In this paper; we describe our experience withthe integration of SAP R/3 Business Workflows into Wise.

Flexible Exception Handling in Process Support Systems* Technical Report No. 290 ETH Z urich; Department of Computer Science,Claus Hagen; Gustavo Alonso,Exceptions are one of the most pervasive problems in process support systems. Ininstallations expected to handle a large number of processes; having exceptions is bound tobe a normal occurrence. Any programming tool intended for large; complex applications hasto face this problem. However; current process support systems; despite their orientationtowards complex; distributed; and heterogeneous applications; provide almost no supportfor exception handling. This paper shows how flexible mechanisms for failure handling areincorporated into the OPERA process support system using a combination of programminglanguage concepts and transaction processing techniques. The resulting mechanisms allowthe construction of fault-tolerant workflow processes in a transparent and flexible way whileensuring reusability of workflow components.,*,1998,*

Beyond the black box,Claus Hagen; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Existing workflow management systems encapsulate the data and behavior of aprocess within its execution scope; preventing other processes from accessing thisinformation until the process terminates. There are; however; many situations in whichallowing running processes to exchange information would be a great help to speed upprocessing time; improve service quality; and increase customer satisfaction. This paperdescribes the concept and implementation of an inter-process-communication facility basedon the exchange of events between concurrently running processes. In contrast to previousapproaches based on shared data stored in a common database; our approach has theadvantage of being platform independent and providing straightforward support fordistribution. In addition; we also explore the problem of process atomicity and consistency …,Technical report/ETH Zürich; Department of Computer Science,1998,*
Network capacity for data intensive applications on clusters of workstations,Guy Pardon; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Component software; distribution; and the use of clusters of workstations are all keytrends in today's technology. Little attention has been paid; however; to the networkbandwidth required for data intensive applications. In the context of databases; much workhas been done in parallelization strategies for monolithic architectures with dedicated;specialized networks or over disk arrays. We envision; however; data intensive applicationsover clusters of PCs or workstations connected by a commodity LAN. For such scenarios;this paper evaluates and analyzes the network requirements of a data processingapplication built from stand-alone components connected by a LAN. Using Amdahl's law inthe context of a serial run of complex data-manipulating tasks (TPC-D like); we derive anestimate of the required network bandwidth as a function of the number of nodes involved …,Technical report/Departement Informatik; ETH Zürich,1998,*
Set-Serializability: A Formal Theory for Partitioned Data,Gustavo Alonso; Amr El Abbadi,High transaction throughput in a distributed database system can be achieved by increasingthe autonomy of each site. This can be achieved by making more data available locally. Oneway to ensure this is to partition data items in several subsets and allocate one subset toeach site. As long as a transaction can execute locally using the data items allocated to asingle site; it will not need to access data at other sites. An example of partitioned data is aticket reservation system in which instead of locating all the tickets for an event in one centralsite; they are divided into several lots and each lot is allocated to a site. In that way; sites canproceed locally without communication with the central site or with other sites; speeding upthe processing of transactions BGM92; GT92; SS90].

An integrated framework for office information systems design and management,Fernando Sáez Vacas; Gustavo Alonso García,Information Technologies are complex and this is true even in the smallest piece ofequipment. But this kind of complexity is nothing comparejwith the one that arises when thistechnology interact with society. Office Automation has been traditionally considered as atechnical field but there is no way to find solutions from a technical point of view when theproblems are primarily social in their origin. Technology management has to change itsfocus from a pure technical perspective to a sociotechnical point of view. To facilitate thischange; we propose a model that allows a better understanding between the managerialand the technical world; offering a coherent; complete and integrated perspective of both.The base for this model is an unfolding of the complexity found in information Technologiesand a matching of these complexities with several levels considered within the Office …,*,1992,*

Correctness and Parallelism in Composite Systems Gustavo Alonso Stephen Blott* Armin Fessler Hans-Jáorg Schek Database Research Group Lucent Technologie...,Gustavo Alonso,Abstract In recent years; databases have started to be used as intelligent repositories for avariety of semantically-richer systems. A consequence of such architectures is thattransaction scheduling takes place throughout composite systems consisting of layeredsubsystems. Such transaction architectures have been studied extensively. Existing theory;however; limits the degree of parallelism; and makes a number of simplifying assumptionswhich cannot be taken for granted in practice. This paper proposes a new model andcorrectness criterion; stack conflict consistency; for composite transactional systems. Themain contribution of the new model is to establish the correctness conditions under whichhigher degrees of parallelism can be achieved between operations of the same transaction;as well as between conflicting operations of different transactions; in a uniform way.

Advanced Systems Lab,Gustavo Alonso; D Kossmann; T Roscoe,This is a project based course operating on a self-study principle. The course relies on thestudent's own initiative rather than on covering every single detail of everything needed forthe course. The course will include several supporting lectures and exercise sessions tointroduce the project and to provide the basic knowledge for the milestones to be completed.There will be 7 or 8 such lectures at the beginning of the semester. The project as well as thecourse requires that the student complements the material covered in the lecture with his/herown study as not all relevant material will be covered.,*,*,*

Specialized Microservers for the Data Center,Zsolt István; David Sidler; Gustavo Alonso,Our work is motivated by two trends: the continuous growth of data centers that promptsmore energy-conscious thinking; and the prevalence of scale-out workloads in the moderndata center. Keyvalue stores are a good example of such workloads: services such asmemcached are often used to ease the demand on the hard to scale relational databases;but since these key-value stores are more network heavy than computationally intensive;they do not utilize modern server hardware efficiently. The root of this inefficiency comesfrom the fact that while regular servers have high computational capacity; they consumepower on various levels of caches; multiple cores; and external devices. When the workloadis mostly I/O bound; the large cores and additional devices will waste power withoutproviding more performance [1]. A solution proposed both by academia and industry is to …,*,*,*

W-KAOS: a Data Warehouse for Mining Business Processes,José H Canós; Gustavo Alonso; Mª Carmen Penadés; Jorge Ferrer,Abstract Besides the automation of business processes; one of the biggest advantages ofworkflow management systems is that the nature and structure of the application logic ismade explicit in the form of a process that can be documented; executed; modified; andanalyzed. Of these aspects; the analysis of processes has received relatively little attentionfrom researchers; especially in comparison with issues like execution and languageformalisms. We believe; however; that process analysis is a very important part of theworkflow cycle. In particular; as workflows are used in more complex environments such asinter-enterprise scenarios; the ability to analyze a heterogeneous collection of processhistories and extract knowledge from this information will play a crucial role in the workflowarea. In this paper; we present W-KAOS; a deductive; object oriented data warehouse for …,*,*,*

Demo Abstract: Bytecode and Virtual Machine for Sensor Networks,Rene Mueller; Michael Duller; Gustavo Alonso; Donald Kossmann,Abstract—The development of applications for sensor networks is often a cumbersome; time-consuming; and difficult task typically involving low-level programming. Application changessuch as bug-fixes and code updates are expensive as; in general; the complete binaryapplication image has to be replaced and disseminated through the network. In this demowe present SwissQM; a virtual machine for sensor networks. SwissQM addresses many ofthese problems by raising the abstraction level available at the sensor network interface.Due to its compact bytecode; the resulting short programs can be easily updated anddisseminated.,*,*,*

A dynamic Architecture for Pervasive Computing,Andreas Frei; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract Pervasive Computing infrastructures have become widespread and sensors aregetting increasingly smaller. PDAs or mobile phones are already used everywhere. Butmany applications have not yet taken mobility and pervasiveness into account. Due to tehlack of an appropriate supporting infrastructure. At ETHZ we have developed a newinfrastructure for pervasive computing-Jadabs. Jadabs has a small footprint core layer and amodularized pluggable distributed architecture. It builds upon the service orientedarchitecture of OSGi and combines it with a dynamic Aspect Oriented Programmingapproach. The combination allows designers to dynamically plugin and adapt distributedapplications.,*,*,*

Workflow based Internet Services (WISE),Gustavo Alonso; Amaia Lazcano,Such infrastructure will include an Internet workflow engine acting as the underlyingdistributed operating system controlling the execution of distributed applications; a set ofbrokers enabling the interaction with already existing systems that are to be used as buildingblocks; and tools for programming in the large to allow final users to configure and developdistributed applications. This will require innovative solutions to several problems. Amongthem; solving the limitations of current workflow systems and extending their applicability tothe Internet; providing a broker based platform for interacting with heterogeneous; stand-alone applications; providing a language adequate to the target environment (applicationsdistributed over the Internet); and implementing transactional mechanisms as a way toprovide execution guarantees.These solutions will be integrated into a robust; reliable …,*,*,*
Statistically-derived flaring chromospheric-coronal density structure from non-thermal X-ray observations of the Sun View all abstracts by submitter,P Saint-Hilaire; Säm Krucker; Robert P Lin,For the first time; we have used RHESSI's spatial and energy resolution to determine thecombined chromospheric and coronal density pro file of the flaring solar atmosphere in astatistical manner; using a dataset of 838 flares observable in hard X-rays above 25 keV.Assuming the thick-target beam model; our''average flaring atmosphere''was found to havedensity scale heights of 131±16 km at low altitudes (chromosphere; up to~ 1-1.5 Mm abovephotosphere); and of 5-6 Mm at high altitudes (corona; above~ 2-3 Mm). Assuming a unitstep change in ionization level; modeling yields a height of 1.3±0.2 Mm for the transitionbetween fully neutral to fully-ionized atmosphere. Furthermore; centroids of emission above50 keV; produced by electrons of similar or higher energies; are located mostly in a smallregion~ 0.5 Mm in vertical extent; where neutral densities are beyond 3x10 13 cm-3.,*,*,*
Looking forward to seeing you in Mannheim!,Gustavo Alonso; Pedro Jose Marron,The last two decades have seen a radical change in the way computers and computing are embeddedin society. Historically; the Personal Computer and the Internet were the milestones that changedboth the computer industry and the way society perceived computers. Today; mobility and thepervasive use of computing devices have resulted in a fundamental change in paradigm. Datais no longer static; residing on a disk and on a personal computer. Now data is something availableeverywhere; through a multitude of commodity devices and constantly broadcast through a varietyof channels. The impact on industry and on the way we work with data has become obvious.For instance; portable digital music players are forcing the music industry to change its businessmodel; soon the same will happen with video and television. Similarly; some major telecommunicationcompanies have recently embarked in an effort to replace the old phone network with an …,*,*,*

A Tuple Space for Social Networking on Mobile Phones,Emre Sarigöl Oriana Riva; Gustavo Alonso,Abstract—Social networking is increasingly becoming a popular means of communicationfor online users. The trend is also true for offline scenarios where people use their mobilephones to network with nearby buddies. In this paper; we propose a distributed tuple spacefor social networking on ad hoc networks. We describe the tuple space model and itsoperations and give evidence of its advantages for ad hoc social networking through severalapplications implemented on top of the tuple space.,*,*,*

Exploiting Atomic Broadcast in Replicated,Divyakant Agrawal; Gustavo Alonso; Amr El Abbadi; Ioana Stanoi,In spite of the fact that many applications require replicated databases either forperformance or fault-tolerance; replication has remained a research issue until recently.Today; the demand for practical replication schemes has greatly increased and some simpleprotocols are being implemented in databases (Oracle and Sybase; for instance) or inapplication development tools (Lotus Notes). These; however; are ad hoc implementationsand the issue of replicated data management is still a source of controversy amongdatabase practitioners and researchers. On one hand; traditional synchronous protocols aretoo expensive in terms of message cost and communication latency; and they aresusceptible to deadlocks when compared to non-replicated databases. An alternativeapproach based on asynchronous updates may result in inconsistencies and an ever …,*,*,*

Is Reliable Multicast too Expensive? Let's be optimistic,G Alonso,Abstract Reliable multicast is one of the main abstractions behind fault-tolerant distributedsystems. However; and in spite of the intensive research done in the area; performanceconsiderations (mainly the high latency) have prevented its widespread use in practicalsystems such as databases. Performance problems are particularly acute in the cases oftotal ordered multicast and uniform multicast; the versions that provide higher fault-tolerance.Fortunately; it has been recently shown that it is possible to hide the cost of the multicastoperation behind the processing of the message. Such optimistic protocols can be used veryeffectively in a wide variety of applications. In this paper; we discuss the benefits of optimisticmulticast and describe its potential use in data replication and atomic commitment.,*,*,*

OS design for non-cache-coherent systems,Simon Peter; Jana Giceva; Pravin Shinde; Gustavo Alonso; Timothy Roscoe,Which operating system structures are appropriate for machines with either no cachecoherence; or else a number of distinct “coherence islands”? While a clear consensus onthe architecture of future multicore processors has yet to emerge; it seems that machineswithout system-wide cache coherence are likely. Some research chips; like the Intel Single-Chip Cloud computer [3] and the Beehive computer [5]; have already emerged. This posterpresents early work exploring the tradeoffs which characterize the OS design space for suchmachines which share system memory; but do not provide cache coherence across thewhole machine. The trend driving the re-emergence of non-cachecoherent systems ingeneral-purpose computer architecture is the quest for greater scalability from multi-coreprocessors; and the bottlenecks inherent in a globallycoherent shared-memory model [4 …,*,*,*
DRAGON: Database Replication based on Group Communication,Gustavo Alonso; Bettina Kemme,Database replication is a topic that has attracted considerable attention during the last tenyears and still keeps reappearing under different disguises (data warehousing; disasterrecovery in workflow management systems or cooperative tools; to mention a few). In spite ofthe many theoretical results; ity is generally accepted that eager and symmetric replication isnot feasible in a database environment due to the performance penalties of distributed locksand 2 phase commit; as well as to the increase in deadlock rate. At the same time;commercial databases are started to provide limited forms of replication; most of them basedon the primary copy approach. There are also other products; the best exampe being LotusNotes; where cooperative environments are constructed on the basis of replicateddatabases implementing a lazy replication approach.Parallel to these developments; the …,*,*,*

Demo Proposal–VoIP for isolated and Internet-connected Mobile Ad Hoc Networks,Patrick Stuedi; Gustavo Alonso,ABSTRACT SIPHoc is a middleware infrastructure for session set up and management inMANETs. SIPHoc is compliant to the SIP standard; does not require any centralizedcomponents; is message efficient (through routing message piggybacking); andindependent of the routing protocol (currently; SIPHoc supports both AODV and OLSR).Moreover; SIPHoc allows seamless interaction with the Internet by treating nodes connectedto the Internet as gateway services and making this information known across the MANET. Inthis demo we will show how SIPHoc can be used to build a wireless multihop VoIP network.Using iPAQ handhelds; participants of the demo can set up VoIP calls between each other;as well as to and from the Internet if a gateway can be discovered. As part of the demo wewill further use a protocol analyzer to show how the SIP contact information is …,*,*,*
