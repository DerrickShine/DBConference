Differentially private histogram publication,Jia Xu; Zhenjie Zhang; Xiaokui Xiao; Yin Yang; Ge Yu; Marianne Winslett,Abstract Differential privacy (DP) is a promising scheme for releasing the results of statisticalqueries on sensitive data; with strong privacy guarantees against adversaries with arbitrarybackground knowledge. Existing studies on differential privacy mostly focus on simpleaggregations such as counts. This paper investigates the publication of DP-complianthistograms; which is an important analytical tool for showing the distribution of a randomvariable; eg; hospital bill size for certain patients. Compared to simple aggregations whoseresults are purely numerical; a histogram query is inherently more complex; since it mustalso determine its structure; ie; the ranges of the bins. As we demonstrate in the paper; a DP-compliant histogram with finer bins may actually lead to significantly lower accuracy than acoarser one; since the former requires stronger perturbations in order to satisfy DP …,The VLDB Journal,2013,176
Functional mechanism: regression analysis under differential privacy,Jun Zhang; Zhenjie Zhang; Xiaokui Xiao; Yin Yang; Marianne Winslett,Abstract ε-differential privacy is the state-of-the-art model for releasing sensitive informationwhile protecting privacy. Numerous methods have been proposed to enforce ε-differentialprivacy in various analytical tasks; eg; regression analysis. Existing solutions for regressionanalysis; however; are either limited to non-standard types of regression or unable toproduce accurate regression results. Motivated by this; we propose the FunctionalMechanism; a differentially private method designed for a large class of optimization-basedanalyses. The main idea is to enforce ε-differential privacy by perturbing the objectivefunction of the optimization problem; rather than its results. As case studies; we apply thefunctional mechanism to address two most widely used regression models; namely; linearregression and logistic regression. Both theoretical analysis and thorough experimental …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,120
Authenticated join processing in outsourced databases,Yin Yang; Dimitris Papadias; Stavros Papadopoulos; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Database outsourcing requires that a query server constructs a proof of resultcorrectness; which can be verified by the client using the data owner's signature. Previousauthentication techniques deal with range queries on a single relation using anauthenticated data structure (ADS). On the other hand; authenticated join processing isinherently more complex than ranges since only the base relations (but not theircombination) are signed by the owner. In this paper; we present three novel join algorithmsdepending on the ADS availability:(i) Authenticated Indexed Sort Merge Join (AISM); whichutilizes a single ADS on the join attribute;(ii) Authenticated Index Merge Join (AIM) thatrequires an ADS (on the join attribute) for both relations; and (iii) Authenticated Sort MergeJoin (ASM); which does not rely on any ADS. We experimentally demonstrate that the …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,110
An enhanced model for searching in semantic portals,Lei Zhang; Yong Yu; Jian Zhou; ChenXi Lin; Yin Yang,Abstract Semantic Portal is the next generation of web portals that are powered by SemanticWeb technologies for improved information sharing and exchange for a community of users.Current methods of searching in Semantic Portals are limited to keyword-based searchusing information retrieval (IR) techniques; ontology-based formal query and reasoning; or asimple combination of the two. In this paper; we propose an enhanced model that tightlyintegrates IR with formal query and reasoning to fully utilize both textual and semanticinformation for searching in Semantic Portals. The model extends the search capabilities ofexisting methods and can answer more complex search requests. The ideas in a fuzzydescription logic (DL) IR model and a formal DL query method are employed and combinedin our model. Based on the model; a semantic search service is implemented and …,Proceedings of the 14th international conference on World Wide Web,2005,102
Query by document,Yin Yang; Nilesh Bansal; Wisam Dakka; Panagiotis Ipeirotis; Nick Koudas; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract We are experiencing an unprecedented increase of content contributed by users inforums such as blogs; social networking sites and microblogging services. Such abundanceof content complements content on web sites and traditional media forums such as newspapers; news and financial streams; and so on. Given such plethora of information there is apressing need to cross reference information across textual services. For example;commonly we read a news item and we wonder if there are any blogs reporting relatedcontent or vice versa. In this paper; we present techniques to automate the process of crossreferencing online information content. We introduce methodologies to extract phrases froma given" query document" to be used as queries to search interfaces with the goal to retrievecontent related to the query document. In particular; we consider two techniques to extract …,Proceedings of the Second ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2009,98
Spatial outsourcing for location-based services,Yin Yang; Stavros Papadopoulos; Dimitris Papadias; George Kollios,The embedding of positioning capabilities in mobile devices and the emergence of location-based applications have created novel opportunities for utilizing several types of multi-dimensional data through spatial outsourcing. In this setting; a data owner (DO) delegates itsdata management tasks to a location-based service (LBS) that processes queries originatingfrom several clients/subscribers. Because the LBS is not the real owner of the data; it mustprove (to each client) the correctness of query output using an authenticated structuresigned by the DO. Currently there is very narrow selection of multi-dimensionalauthenticated structures; among which the VR-tree is the best choice. Our first contribution isthe MR-tree; a novel index suitable for spatial outsourcing. We show; analytically andexperimentally; that the MR-tree outperforms the VR-tree; usually by orders of magnitude …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,92
Keyword search on relational data streams,Alexander Markowetz; Yin Yang; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Increasing monitoring of transactions; environmental parameters; homelandsecurity; RFID chips and interactions of online users rapidly establishes new data sourcesand application scenarios. In this paper; we propose keyword search on relational datastreams (S-KWS) as an effective way for querying in such intricate and dynamicenvironments. Compared to conventional query methods; S-KWS has several benefits. First;it allows search for combinations of interesting terms without a-priori knowledge of the datastreams in which they appear. Second; it hides the schema from the user and allows it tochange; without the need for query re-writing. Finally; keyword queries are easy to express.Our contributions are summarized as follows.(i) We provide formal semantics for S-KWS;addressing the temporal validity and order of results.(ii) We propose an efficient algorithm …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,91
Authenticated indexing for outsourced spatial databases,Yin Yang; Stavros Papadopoulos; Dimitris Papadias; George Kollios,Abstract In spatial database outsourcing; a data owner delegates its data management tasksto a location-based service (LBS); which indexes the data with an authenticated datastructure (ADS). The LBS receives queries (ranges; nearest neighbors) originating fromseveral clients/subscribers. Each query initiates the computation of a verification object (VO)based on the ADS. The VO is returned to the client that can verify the result correctnessusing the public key of the owner. Our first contribution is the MR-tree; a space-efficient ADSthat supports fast query processing and verification. Our second contribution is the MR*-tree;a modified version of the MR-tree; which significantly reduces the VO size through a novelembedding technique. Finally; whereas most ADSs must be constructed and maintained bythe owner; we outsource the MR-and MR*-tree construction and maintenance to the LBS …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2009,90

Low-rank mechanism: optimizing batch queries under differential privacy,Ganzhao Yuan; Zhenjie Zhang; Marianne Winslett; Xiaokui Xiao; Yin Yang; Zhifeng Hao,Abstract Differential privacy is a promising privacy-preserving paradigm for statistical queryprocessing over sensitive data. It works by injecting random noise into each query result;such that it is provably hard for the adversary to infer the presence or absence of anyindividual record from the published noisy results. The main objective in differentially privatequery processing is to maximize the accuracy of the query results; while satisfying theprivacy guarantees. Previous work; notably the matrix mechanism [16]; has suggested thatprocessing a batch of correlated queries as a whole can potentially achieve considerableaccuracy gains; compared to answering them individually. However; as we point out in thispaper; the matrix mechanism is mainly of theoretical interest; in particular; several inherentproblems in its design limit its accuracy in practice; which almost never exceeds that of …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,67
Differential privacy in data publication and analysis,Yin Yang; Zhenjie Zhang; Gerome Miklau; Marianne Winslett; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract Data privacy has been an important research topic in the security; theory anddatabase communities in the last few decades. However; many existing studies haverestrictive assumptions regarding the adversary's prior knowledge; meaning that theypreserve individuals' privacy only when the adversary has rather limited backgroundinformation about the sensitive data; or only uses certain kinds of attacks. Recently;differential privacy has emerged as a new paradigm for privacy protection with veryconservative assumptions about the adversary's prior knowledge. Since its proposal;differential privacy had been gaining attention in many fields of computer science; and isconsidered among the most promising paradigms for privacy-preserving data publicationand analysis. In this tutorial; we will motivate its introduction as a replacement for other …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,65
Compressive mechanism: Utilizing sparse representation in differential privacy,Yang D Li; Zhenjie Zhang; Marianne Winslett; Yin Yang,Abstract Differential privacy provides the first theoretical foundation with provable privacyguarantee against adversaries with arbitrary prior knowledge. The main idea to achievedifferential privacy is to inject random noise into statistical query results. Besidescorrectness; the most important goal in the design of a differentially private mechanism is toreduce the effect of random noise; ensuring that the noisy results can still be useful. Thispaper proposes the compressive mechanism; a novel solution on the basis of state-of-the-artcompression technique; called compressive sensing. Compressive sensing is a decenttheoretical tool for compact synopsis construction; using random projections. In this paper;we show that the amount of noise is significantly reduced from O (n) to O (log (n)); when thenoise insertion procedure is carried on the synopsis samples instead of the original …,Proceedings of the 10th annual ACM workshop on Privacy in the electronic society,2011,60
Continuous k-means monitoring over moving objects,Zhenjie Zhang; Yin Yang; Anthony KH Tung; Dimitris Papadias,Given a data set P; a k-means query returns k points in space (called centers); such that theaverage squared distance between each point in P and its nearest center is minimized.Since this problem is NP-hard; several approximate algorithms have been proposed andused in practice. In this paper; we study continuous k-means computation at a server thatmonitors a set of moving objects. Reevaluating k-means every time there is an object updateimposes a heavy burden on the server (for computing the centers from scratch) and theclients (for continuously sending location updates). We overcome these problems with anovel approach that significantly reduces the computation and communication costs; whileguaranteeing that the quality of the solution; with respect to the reevaluation approach; isbounded by a user-defined tolerance. The proposed method assigns each moving object …,Knowledge and Data Engineering; IEEE Transactions on,2008,51
Hybmig: A hybrid approach to dynamic plan migration for continuous queries,Yin Yang; Jurgen Kramer; Dimitris Papadias; Bernhard Seeger,In data stream environments; the initial plan of a long-running query may gradually becomeinefficient due to changes of the data characteristics. In this case; the query optimizergenerates a more efficient plan based on the current statistics. The online transition from theold to the new plan is called dynamic plan migration. In addition to correctness; an effectivetechnique for dynamic plan migration should achieve the following objectives: 1) minimizethe memory and CPU overhead of the migration; 2) reduce the duration of the transition; and3) maintain a steady output rate. The only known solutions for this problem are the movingstates (MS) and parallel track (PT) strategies; which have some serious shortcomingsrelated to the above objectives. Motivated by these shortcomings; we first propose HybMig;which combines the merits of MS and PT and outperforms both in every aspect.

Kernel-based skyline cardinality estimation,Zhenjie Zhang; Yin Yang; Ruichu Cai; Dimitris Papadias; Anthony Tung,Abstract The skyline of a d-dimensional dataset consists of all points not dominated byothers. The incorporation of the skyline operator into practical database systemsnecessitates an efficient and effective cardinality estimation module. However; existingtheoretical work on this problem is limited to the case where all d dimensions areindependent of each other; which rarely holds for real datasets. The state of the art LogSampling (LS) technique simply applies theoretical results for independent dimensions tonon-independent data anyway; sometimes leading to large estimation errors. To solve thisproblem; we propose a novel Kernel-Based (KB) approach that approximates the skylinecardinality with nonparametric methods. Extensive experiments with various real datasetsdemonstrate that KB achieves high accuracy; even in cases where LS fails. At the same …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,42
PrivGene: differentially private model fitting using genetic algorithms,Jun Zhang; Xiaokui Xiao; Yin Yang; Zhenjie Zhang; Marianne Winslett,Abstract epsilon-differential privacy is rapidly emerging as the state-of-the-art scheme forprotecting individuals' privacy in published analysis results over sensitive data. The mainidea is to perform random perturbations on the analysis results; such that any individual'spresence in the data has negligible impact on the randomized results. This paper focuses onanalysis tasks that involve model fitting; ie; finding the parameters of a statistical model thatbest fit the dataset. For such tasks; the quality of the differentially private results dependsupon both the effectiveness of the model fitting algorithm; and the amount of perturbationsrequired to satisfy the privacy guarantees. Most previous studies start from a state-of-the-art;non-private model fitting algorithm; and develop a differentially private version.Unfortunately; many model fitting algorithms require intensive perturbations to satisfy …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,38
DRS: dynamic resource scheduling for real-time analytics over fast streams,Tom ZJ Fu; Jianbing Ding; Richard TB Ma; Marianne Winslett; Yin Yang; Zhenjie Zhang,In a data stream management system (DSMS); users register continuous queries; andreceive result updates as data arrive and expire. We focus on applications with real-timeconstraints; in which the user must receive each result update within a given period after theupdate occurs. To handle fast data; the DSMS is commonly placed on top of a cloudinfrastructure. Because stream properties such as arrival rates can fluctuate unpredictably;cloud resources must be dynamically provisioned and scheduled accordingly to ensure real-time response. It is essential; for the existing systems or future developments; to possess theability of scheduling resources dynamically according to the current workload; in order toavoid wasting resources; or failing in delivering correct results on time. Motivated by this; wepropose DRS; a novel dynamic resource scheduler for cloud-based DSMSs. DRS …,Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS); 2015 IEEE 35th International Conference on,2015,34
Skyline Processing on Distributed Vertical Decompositions,George Trimponias; Ilaria Bartolini; Dimitris Papadias; Yin Yang,We assume a data set that is vertically decomposed among several servers; and a client thatwishes to compute the skyline by obtaining the minimum number of points. Existing solutionsfor this problem are restricted to the case where each server maintains exactly onedimension. This paper proposes a general solution for vertical decompositions of arbitrarydimensionality. We first investigate some interesting problem characteristics regarding thepruning power of points. Then; we introduce vertical partition skyline (VPS); an algorithmicframework that includes two steps. Phase 1 searches for an anchor point P anc thatdominates; and hence eliminates; a large number of records. Starting with P anc; Phase 2constructs incrementally a pruning area using an interesting union-intersection property ofdominance regions. Servers do not transmit points that fall within the pruning area in their …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,30
Reachability indexes for relational keyword search,Alexander Markowetz; Yin Yang; Dimitris Papadias,Due to its considerable ease of use; relational keyword search (R-KWS) has becomeincreasingly popular. Its simplicity; however; comes at the cost of intensive query processing.Specifically; R-KWS explores a vast search space; comprised of all possible combinations ofkeyword occurrences in any attribute of every table. Existing systems follow two generalmethodologies for query processing:(i) graph based; which traverses a materialized datagraph; and (ii) operator based; which executes relational operator trees on an underlyingDBMS. In both cases; computations are largely wasted on graph traversals or operator treeexecutions that fail to return results. Motivated by this observation; we introduce acomprehensive framework for reachability indexing that eliminates such fruitless operations.We describe a range of indexes that capture various types of join reachability.

An efficient approach to support querying secure outsourced XML information,Yin Yang; Wilfred Ng; Ho Lau; James Cheng,Abstract Data security is well-recognized a vital issue in an information system that issupported in an outsource environment. However; most of conventional XML encryptionproposals treat confidential parts of an XML document as whole blocks of text and applyencryption algorithms directly on them. As a result; queries involving the encrypted partcannot be efficiently processed. In order to address these problems; we propose XQEnc; anovel approach to support querying encrypted XML. XQEnc is based on two importanttechniques of vectorization and skeleton compression. Essentially; vectorization; which is ageneralization of columns of a relational table; makes use the basic path of an XML tree tolabel the data values. Skeleton compression collapses the redundant paths into a multiplicityattribute. Our analysis and experimental study shows that XQEnc achieves both better …,Advanced Information Systems Engineering,2006,23
Optimal route queries with arbitrary order constraints,Jing Li; Yin David Yang; Nikos Mamoulis,Given a set of spatial points DS; each of which is associated with categorical information; eg;restaurant; pub; etc.; the optimal route query finds the shortest path that starts from the querypoint (eg; a home or hotel); and covers a user-specified set of categories (eg;{pub;restaurant; museum}). The user may also specify partial order constraints between differentcategories; eg; a restaurant must be visited before a pub. Previous work has focused on aspecial case where the query contains the total order of all categories to be visited (eg;museum→ restaurant→ pub). For the general scenario without such a total order; the onlyknown solution reduces the problem to multiple; total-order optimal route queries. As weshow in this paper; this naive approach incurs a significant amount of repeatedcomputations; and; thus; is not scalable to large data sets. Motivated by this; we propose …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2013,22
Heavy Hitter Estimation over Set-Valued Data with Local Differential Privacy,Zhan Qin; Yin Yang; Ting Yu; Issa Khalil; Xiaokui Xiao; Kui Ren,Abstract In local differential privacy (LDP); each user perturbs her data locally beforesending the noisy data to a data collector. The latter then analyzes the data to obtain usefulstatistics. Unlike the setting of centralized differential privacy; in LDP the data collector nevergains access to the exact values of sensitive data; which protects not only the privacy of datacontributors but also the collector itself against the risk of potential data leakage. ExistingLDP solutions in the literature are mostly limited to the case that each user possesses atuple of numeric or categorical values; and the data collector computes basic statistics suchas counts or mean values. To the best of our knowledge; no existing work tackles morecomplex data mining tasks such as heavy hitter discovery over set-valued data. In this paper;we present a systematic study of heavy hitter mining under LDP. We first review existing …,Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2016,21
DP-tree: indexing multi-dimensional data under differential privacy,Shangfu Peng; Yin Yang; Zhenjie Zhang; Marianne Winslett; Yong Yu,Abstract e-differential privacy (e-DP) is a strong and rigorous scheme for protectingindividuals' privacy while releasing useful statistical information. The main idea is to injectrandom noise into the results of statistical queries; such that the existence of any singlerecord has negligible impact on the distributions of query results. The accuracy of suchrandomized results depends heavily upon the query processing technique; which has beenan active research topic in recent years. So far; most existing methods focus on 1-dimensional queries. The only work that handles multi-dimensional query processing undere-DP is [1]; which indexes the sensitive data using variants of the quad-tree and the kd-tree.As we point out in this paper; these structures are inherently suboptimal for answeringqueries under e-DP. Consequently; the solutions in [1] suffer from several serious …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,18
Authenticated multistep nearest neighbor search,Stavros Papadopoulos; Lixing Wang; Yin Yang; Dimitris Papadias; Panagiotis Karras,Multistep processing is commonly used for nearest neighbor (NN) and similarity search inapplications involving high-dimensional data and/or costly distance computations. Today;many such applications require a proof of result correctness. In this setting; clients issue NNqueries to a server that maintains a database signed by a trusted authority. The serverreturns the NN set along with supplementary information that permits result verification usingthe data set signature. An adaptation of the multistep NN algorithm incurs prohibitivenetwork overhead due to the transmission of false hits; ie; records that are not in the NN set;but are nevertheless necessary for its verification. In order to alleviate this problem; wepresent a novel technique that reduces the size of each false hit. Moreover; we generalizeour solution for a distributed setting; where the database is horizontally partitioned over …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,17
Continuous spatial authentication,Stavros Papadopoulos; Yin Yang; Spiridon Bakiras; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Recent advances in wireless communications and positioning devices havegenerated a tremendous amount of interest in the continuous monitoring of spatial queries.However; such applications can incur a heavy burden on the data owner (DO); due to veryfrequent location updates. Database outsourcing is a viable solution; whereby the DOdelegates its database functionality to a service provider (SP) that has the infrastructure andresources to handle the high workload. In this framework; authenticated query processingenables the clients to verify the correctness of the query results that are returned by the SP.In addition to correctness; the dynamic nature of the monitored data requires the provisionfor temporal completeness; ie; the clients must be able to verify that there are no missingresults in between data updates. This paper constitutes the first work that deals with the …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2009,17
Dynamic plan migration for snapshot-equivalent continuous queries in data stream systems,Jürgen Krämer; Yin Yang; Michael Cammert; Bernhard Seeger; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract A data stream management system executes a large number of continuous queriesin parallel. As stream characteristics and query workload change over time; the plan initiallyinstalled for a continuous query may become inefficient. As a consequence; the queryoptimizer will re-optimize this plan based on the current statistics. The replacement of therunning plan with a more efficient but semantically equivalent plan at runtime is calleddynamic plan migration. In order to have a sound semantic foundation for queryoptimization; we investigate dynamic plan migration for snapshot-equivalent plans. Wedevelop a general method for dynamic plan migration that treats the old and new plan assnapshot-equivalent black boxes. This enables the query optimizer to apply theconventional transformation rules during re-optimization. As a consequence; our …,Current Trends in Database Technology–EDBT 2006,2006,16

Our contributions aresummarized as follows:(i) We provide formal semantics; addressing the temporal validityand order of results; spanning uniformly over tables and streams;(ii) we investigate twogeneral methodologies for query processing; graph based and operator based; that resolveseveral problems of previous approaches; and (iii) we develop a range of algorithms andoptimizations covering both methodologies.

Just-in-time processing of continuous queries,Yin Yang; Dimitris Papadias,In a data stream management system; a continuous query is processed by an executionplan consisting of multiple operators connected via the" consumer-producer" relationship; ie;the output of an operator (the" producer") feeds to another downstream operator (the"consumer") as input. Existing techniques execute each operator separately and push allresults to its consumers; without considering whether the consumers need them.Consequently; considerable CPU and memory resources are wasted on producing andstoring useless intermediate results. Motivated by this; we propose just-in-time (JIT)processing; a novel methodology that enables a consumer to return feedback expressing itscurrent demand to the producer. The latter selectively generates results based on thisinformation. We show; through extensive experiments; that JIT achieves significant …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008.

Durable queries over historical time series,Hao Wang; Yilun Cai; Yin Yang; Shiming Zhang; Nikos Mamoulis,This paper studies the problem of finding objects with durable quality over time in historicaltime series databases. For example; a sociologist may be interested in the top 10 websearch terms during the period of some historical events; the police may seek for vehiclesthat move close to a suspect 70 percent of the time during a certain time period and so on.Durable top-k (DTop-k) and nearest neighbor (DkNN) queries can be viewed as naturalextensions of the standard snapshot top-k and NN queries to timestamped sequences ofvalues or locations. Although their snapshot counterparts have been studied extensively; toour knowledge; there is little prior work that addresses this new class of durable queries.Existing methods for DTop-k processing either apply trivial solutions; or rely on domain-specific properties. Motivated by this; we propose efficient and scalable algorithms for the …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,13
C-Cube: Elastic continuous clustering in the cloud,Zhenjie Zhang; Hu Shu; Zhihong Chong; Hua Lu; Yin Yang,Continuous clustering analysis over a data stream reports clustering results incrementally asupdates arrive. Such analysis has a wide spectrum of applications; including trafficmonitoring and topic discovery on microblogs. A common characteristic of streamingapplications is that the amount of workload fluctuates; often in an unpredictable manner. Onthe other hand; most existing solutions for continuous clustering assume either a centralserver; or a distributed setting with a fixed number of dedicated servers. In other words; theyare not ELASTIC; meaning that they cannot dynamically adapt to the amount ofcomputational resources to the fluctuating workload. Consequently; they incur considerablewaste of resources; as the servers are under-utilized when the amount of workload is low.This paper proposes C-Cube; the first elastic approach to continuous streaming clustering …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,12
ABACUS: An auction-based approach to cloud service differentiation,Zhenjie Zhang; Richard TB Ma; Jianbing Ding; Yin Yang,The emergence of the cloud computing paradigm has greatly enabled innovative servicemodels; such as Platform as a Service (PaaS); and distributed computing frameworks; suchas Map Reduce. However; most existing cloud systems fail to distinguish users with differentpreferences; or jobs of different natures. Consequently; they are unable to provide servicedifferentiation; leading to inefficient allocations of cloud resources. Moreover; contentions onthe resources exacerbate this inefficiency; when prioritizing crucial jobs is necessary; butimpossible. Motivated by this; we propose Abacus; a generic resource managementframework addressing this problem. Abacus interacts with users through an auctionmechanism; which allows users to specify their priorities using budgets; and jobcharacteristics via utility functions.

Optimal Operator State Migration for Elastic Data Stream Processing,Jianbing Ding; Tom ZJ Fu; Richard TB Ma; Marianne Winslett; Yin Yang; Zhenjie Zhang; Hongyang Chao,Abstract: A cloud-based data stream management system (DSMS) handles fast data byutilizing the massively parallel processing capabilities of the underlying platform. Animportant property of such a DSMS is elasticity; meaning that nodes can be dynamicallyadded to or removed from an application to match the latter's workload; which may fluctuatein an unpredictable manner. For an application involving stateful operations such asaggregates; the addition/removal of nodes necessitates the migration of operator states.Although the importance of migration has been recognized in existing systems; two keyproblems remain largely neglected; namely how to migrate and what to migrate; ie; themigration mechanism that reduces synchronization overhead and result delay duringmigration; and the selection of the optimal task assignment that minimizes migration costs …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1501.03619,2015,11
Query optimization for differentially private data management systems,Shangfu Peng; Yin Yang; Zhenjie Zhang; Marianne Winslett; Yong Yu,Differential privacy (DP) enables publishing statistical query results over sensitive data; withrigorous privacy guarantees; and very conservative assumptions about the adversary'sbackground knowledge. This paper focuses on the interactive DP framework; whichprocesses incoming queries on the fly; each of which consumes a portion of the user-specified privacy budget. Existing systems process each query independently; which oftenleads to considerable privacy budget waste. Motivated by this; we propose Pioneer; a queryoptimizer for an interactive; DP-compliant DBMS. For each new query; Pioneer creates anexecution plan that combines past query results and new results from the underlying data.When a query has multiple semantically equivalent plans; Pioneer automatically selects onewith minimal privacy budget consumption. Extensive experiments confirm that Pioneer …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,11

Optimizing Batch Linear Queries under Exact and Approximate Differential Privacy,Ganzhao Yuan; Zhenjie Zhang; Marianne Winslett; Xiaokui Xiao; Yin Yang; Zhifeng Hao,Abstract Differential privacy is a promising privacy-preserving paradigm for statistical queryprocessing over sensitive data. It works by injecting random noise into each query resultsuch that it is provably hard for the adversary to infer the presence or absence of anyindividual record from the published noisy results. The main objective in differentially privatequery processing is to maximize the accuracy of the query results while satisfying the privacyguarantees. Previous work; notably Li et al.[2010]; has suggested that; with an appropriatestrategy; processing a batch of correlated queries as a whole achieves considerably higheraccuracy than answering them individually.

Deterministic identification of specific individuals from GWAS results,Ruichu Cai; Zhifeng Hao; Marianne Winslett; Xiaokui Xiao; Yin Yang; Zhenjie Zhang; Shuigeng Zhou,Abstract Motivation: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are commonly applied onhuman genomic data to understand the causal gene combinations statistically connected tocertain diseases. Patients involved in these GWASs could be re-identified when the studiesrelease statistical information on a large number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms.Subsequent work; however; found that such privacy attacks are theoretically possible butunsuccessful and unconvincing in real settings. Results: We derive the first practical privacyattack that can successfully identify specific individuals from limited published associationsfrom the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) dataset. For GWAS resultscomputed over 25 randomly selected loci; our algorithm always pinpoints at least onepatient from the WTCCC dataset. Moreover; the number of re-identified patients grows …,Bioinformatics,2015,8
OceanRT: real-time analytics over large temporal data,Shiming Zhang; Yin Yang; Wei Fan; Liang Lan; Mingxuan Yuan,Abstract We demonstrate OceanRT; a novel cloud-based infrastructure that performs onlineanalytics in real time; over large-scale temporal data such as call logs from atelecommunication company. Apart from proprietary systems for which few details havebeen revealed; most existing big-data analytics systems are built on top of an offline;MapReduce-style infrastructure; which inherently limits their efficiency. In contrast; OceanRTemploys a novel computing architecture consisting of interconnected Access Query Engines(AQEs); as well as a new storage scheme that ensures data locality and fast access fortemporal data. Our preliminary evaluation shows that OceanRT can be up to 10x faster thanImpala [10]; 12x faster than Shark [5]; and 200x faster than Hive [13].

Elastic Pipelining in an In-Memory Database Cluster,Li Wang; Minqi Zhou; Zhenjie Zhang; Yin Yang; Aoying Zhou; Dina Bitton,Abstract An in-memory database cluster consists of multiple interconnected nodes with alarge capacity of RAM and modern multi-core CPUs. As a conventional query processingstrategy; pipelining remains a promising solution for in-memory parallel database systems;as it avoids expensive intermediate result materialization and parallelizes the dataprocessing among nodes. However; to fully unleash the power of pipelining in a cluster withmulti-core nodes; it is crucial for the query optimizer to generate good query plans withappropriate intra-node parallelism; in order to maximize CPU and network bandwidthutilization. A suboptimal plan; on the contrary; causes load imbalance in the pipelines andconsequently degrades the query performance. Parallelism assignment optimization atcompile time is nearly impossible; as the workload in each node is affected by numerous …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,7
Collecting and Analyzing Data from Smart Device Users with Local Differential Privacy,Thông T Nguyên; Xiaokui Xiao; Yin Yang; Siu Cheung Hui; Hyejin Shin; Junbum Shin,Abstract: Organizations with a large user base; such as Samsung and Google; canpotentially benefit from collecting and mining users' data. However; doing so raises privacyconcerns; and risks accidental privacy breaches with serious consequences. Localdifferential privacy (LDP) techniques address this problem by only collecting randomizedanswers from each user; with guarantees of plausible deniability; meanwhile; the aggregatorcan still build accurate models and predictors by analyzing large amounts of suchrandomized data. So far; existing LDP solutions either have severely restricted functionality;or focus mainly on theoretical aspects such as asymptotical bounds rather than practicalusability and performance. Motivated by this; we propose Harmony; a practical; accurate andefficient system for collecting and analyzing data from smart device users; while satisfying …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.05053,2016,7
LiveTraj: real-time trajectory tracking over live video streams,Tom ZJ Fu; Jianbing Ding; Richard TB Ma; Marianne Winslett; Yin Yang; Zhenjie Zhang; Yong Pei; Bingbing Ni,Abstract We present LiveTraj; a novel system for tracking trajectories in a live video stream inreal time; backed by a cloud platform. Although trajectory tracking is a well-studied topic incomputer vision; so far most attention has been devoted to improving the accuracy oftrajectory tracking; rather than the efficiency. To our knowledge; LiveTraj is the first thatachieves real-time efficiency in trajectory tracking; which can be a key enabler in manyimportant applications such as video surveillance; action recognition and robotics. LiveTrajis based on a state-of-the-art approach to (offline) trajectory tracking; its main innovation is toadapt this base solution to run on an elastic cloud platform to achieve real-time trackingspeed at an affordable cost. The video demo shows the offline base solution and LiveTrajside by side; both running on a video stream containing human actions.

Design and implementation of a real-time interactive analytics system for large spatio-temporal data,Shiming Zhang; Yin Yang; Wei Fan; Marianne Winslett,Abstract In real-time interactive data analytics; the user expects to receive the results of eachquery within a short time period such as seconds. This is especially challenging when thedata is big (eg; on the scale of petabytes); and the analytics system runs on top of cloudinfrastructure (eg; thousands of interconnected commodity servers). We have been buildingsuch a system; called OceanRT; for managing large spatio-temporal data such as call logsand mobile web browsing records collected by a telecommunication company. Althoughthere already exist systems for querying big data in real time; OceanRT's performancestands out due to several novel designs and components that address key efficiency andscalability issues that were largely overlooked in existing systems. First; OceanRT makesextensive use of software RDMA one-sided operations; which reduce networking costs …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,7
Effective indexing for approximate constrained shortest path queries on large road networks,Sibo Wang; Xiaokui Xiao; Yin Yang; Wenqing Lin,Abstract In a constrained shortest path (CSP) query; each edge in the road network isassociated with both a length and a cost. Given an origin s; a destination t; and a costconstraint θ; the goal is to find the shortest path from s to t whose total cost does not exceedθ. Because exact CSP is NP-hard; previous work mostly focuses on approximate solutions.Even so; existing methods are still prohibitively expensive for large road networks. Two mainreasons are (i) that they fail to utilize the special properties of road networks and (ii) thatmost of them process queries without indices; the few existing indices consume largeamounts of memory and yet have limited effectiveness in reducing query costs. Motivated bythis; we propose COLA; the first practical solution for approximate CSP processing on largeroad networks. COLA exploits the facts that a road network can be effectively partitioned …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,5
Integrating web services into ontology-based web portal,Jian Zhou; Yong Yu; Lei Zhang; Chenxi Lin; Yin Yang,Abstract With the explosive emerged Web services; the Web becomes a world of informationand applications. So portals whose goal is presenting a structured view onto the Web shouldprovide users with a single point access to multiple types of not only information but alsoservices. Recently; many systems have been developed using ontology-driven approachesto automatically generate and manage Web portals. However; all of them lack the integrationof Web services. In this paper; we describe SPortS; an OWL-DL (Web Ontology Language-Description Logics) based portal generation system that integrates semantic Web servicesinto generated portals at the presentation level; the data level and the function level.

Convex optimization for linear query processing under approximate differential privacy,Ganzhao Yuan; Yin Yang; Zhenjie Zhang; Zhifeng Hao,Abstract Differential privacy enables organizations to collect accurate aggregates oversensitive data with strong; rigorous guarantees on individuals' privacy. Previous work hasfound that under differential privacy; computing multiple correlated aggregates as a batch;using an appropriate strategy; may yield higher accuracy than computing each of themindependently. However; finding the best strategy that maximizes result accuracy is non-trivial; as it involves solving a complex constrained optimization program that appears to benon-convex. Hence; in the past much effort has been devoted in solving this non-convexoptimization program. Existing approaches include various sophisticated heuristics andexpensive numerical solutions. None of them; however; guarantees to find the optimalsolution of this optimization problem.

Auction-based cloud service differentiation with service level objectives,Jianbing Ding; Zhenjie Zhang; Richard TB Ma; Yin Yang,Abstract The emergence of the cloud computing paradigm has greatly enabled innovativeservice models; such as Platform as a Service (PaaS); and distributed computingframeworks; such as MapReduce. However; most existing cloud systems fail to distinguishusers with different preferences; or jobs of different natures. Consequently; they are unableto provide service differentiation; leading to inefficient allocations of cloud resources.Moreover; contentions on the resources exacerbate this inefficiency; when prioritizing crucialjobs is necessary; but impossible. Motivated by this; we propose Abacus; a generic resourcemanagement framework addressing this problem. Abacus interacts with users through anauction mechanism; which allows users to specify their priorities using budgets; and jobcharacteristics via utility functions. Based on this information; Abacus computes the …,Computer Networks,2016,4
HubPPR: effective indexing for approximate personalized pagerank,Sibo Wang; Youze Tang; Xiaokui Xiao; Yin Yang; Zengxiang Li,Abstract Personalized PageRank (PPR) computation is a fundamental operation in websearch; social networks; and graph analysis. Given a graph G; a source s; and a target t; thePPR query Π (s; t) returns the probability that a random walk on G starting from s terminatesat t. Unlike global PageRank which can be effectively pre-computed and materialized; thePPR result depends on both the source and the target; rendering results materializationinfeasible for large graphs. Existing indexing techniques have rather limited effectiveness; infact; the current state-of-the-art solution; BiPPR; answers individual PPR queries without pre-computation or indexing; and yet it outperforms all previous index-based solutions.Motivated by this; we propose HubPPR; an effective indexing scheme for PPR computationwith controllable tradeoffs for accuracy; query time; and memory consumption.

PrivSuper: A Superset-First Approach to Frequent Itemset Mining under Differential Privacy,Ning Wang; Xiaokui Xiao; Yin Yang; Zhenjie Zhang; Yu Gu; Ge Yu,Differential privacy; which has been applied in Google Chrome and Apple iOS; providesstrong privacy assurance to users while retaining the capability to discover statisticalpatterns from sensitive data. We focus on top-k frequent itemset mining on sensitive data;with the goal of obtaining high result utility while satisfying differential privacy. There are twobasic methodologies to design a high-utility solution: one uses generic differential privacymechanisms as building blocks; and minimizes result error through algorithm design. Mostexisting work follows this approach. The other methodology is to devise a new building blockcustomized for frequent itemset mining. This is much more challenging: to our knowledge;only one recent work; NoisyCut; attempts to do so; unfortunately; Noisycut has been found toviolate differential privacy.

DRS: Auto-Scaling for Real-Time Stream Analytics,Tom ZJ Fu; Jianbing Ding; Richard TB Ma; Marianne Winslett; Yin Yang; Zhenjie Zhang,In a stream data analytics system; input data arrive continuously and trigger the processingand updating of analytics results. We focus on applications with real-time constraints; inwhich; any data unit must be completely processed within a given time duration. To handlefast data; it is common to place the stream data analytics system on top of a cloudinfrastructure. Because stream properties; such as arrival rates can fluctuate unpredictably;cloud resources must be dynamically provisioned and scheduled accordingly to ensure real-time responses. It is essential; for existing systems or future developments; to possess theability of scaling resources dynamically according to the instantaneous workload; in order toavoid wasting resources or failing in delivering the correct analytics results on time.Motivated by this; we propose DRS; a dynamic resource scaling framework for cloud …,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,2017,*

Lowrank mechanism,Ganzhao Yuan; Zhenjie Zhang; Marianne Winslett; Xiaokui Xiao; Yin Yang; Zhifeng Hao,Abstract Differential privacy is a promising privacy-preserving paradigm for statistical queryprocessing over sensitive data. It works by injecting random noise into each query result;such that it is provably hard for the adversary to infer the presence or absence of anyindividual record from the published noisy results. The main objective in differentially privatequery processing is to maximize the accuracy of the query results; while satisfying theprivacy guarantees. Previous work; notably the matrix mechanism [16]; has suggested thatprocessing a batch of correlated queries as a whole can potentially achieve considerableaccuracy gains; compared to answering them individually. However; as we point out in thispaper; the matrix mechanism is mainly of theoretical interest; in particular; several inherentproblems in its design limit its accuracy in practice; which almost never exceeds that of …,*,2012,*
Algorithms for local sensor synchronization,Lixing Wang; Yin Yang; Xin Miao; Dimitris Papadias; Yunhao Liu,In a wireless sensor network (WSN); each sensor monitors environmental parameters; andreports its readings to a base station; possibly through other nodes. A sensor works incycles; in each of which it stays active for a fixed duration; and then sleeps until the nextcycle. The frequency of such cycles determines the portion of time that a sensor is active;and is the dominant factor on its battery life. The majority of existing work assumes globallysynchronized WSN where all sensors have the same frequency. This leads to waste ofbattery power for applications that entail different accuracy of measurements; orenvironments where sensor readings have large variability. To overcome this problem; wepropose LS; a query processing framework for locally synchronized WSN.

An Iterative Algorithm for Graph De-anonymization,Jun Zhang; Youze Tang; Xiaokui Xiao; Yin Yang; Zhenjie Zhang; Marianne Winslett,ABSTRACT The availability of social network data is indispensable for numerous types ofresearch. Nevertheless; data owners are often reluctant to release social network data; asthe release may reveal the private information of the individuals involved in the data. Toaddress this problem; several techniques have been proposed to anonymize socialnetworks for privacy preserving publications. To evaluate the privacy protection of existingtechniques; this paper presents an algorithm designed for de-anonymizing the anonymizedgraphs produced by the existing techniques. With experiments on a large set of anonymizedgraphs generated by the existing techniques; we demonstrate that our algorithm can re-identify a large portion of individuals in many anonymized graphs; which sheds light on theireffectiveness and relative superiority.,*,*,*
