INTRODUCTION Due largely to the nature of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms(MOEAs); their behaviors and performances are mainly studied experimentally. In the past20 years; Several continuous multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) test suites havebeen proposed the evolutionary computation community [1]-[9]; which have played ancrucial role in developing and studying MOEAs. However; more test instances are needed toresemble complicated real-life problems and thus stimulate the MOEA research. This reportsuggest a set of unconstrained (bound constrained) MOP test instances and a set of generalconstrained test instances for the CEC09 algorithm contest. It also provides performanceassessment guidelines.,University of Essex; Colchester; UK and Nanyang technological University; Singapore; special session on performance assessment of multi-objective optimization algorithms; technical report,2008,518
RM-MEDA: A regularity model-based multiobjective estimation of distribution algorithm,Qingfu Zhang; Aimin Zhou; Yaochu Jin,Under mild conditions; it can be induced from the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition that thePareto set; in the decision space; of a continuous multiobjective optimization problem is apiecewise continuous (m-1)-D manifold; where m is the number of objectives. Based on thisregularity property; we propose a regularity model-based multiobjective estimation ofdistribution algorithm (RM-MEDA) for continuous multiobjective optimization problems withvariable linkages. At each generation; the proposed algorithm models a promising area inthe decision space by a probability distribution whose centroid is a (m-1)-D piecewisecontinuous manifold. The local principal component analysis algorithm is used for buildingsuch a model. New trial solutions are sampled from the model thus built.

Combining model-based and genetics-based offspring generation for multi-objective optimization using a convergence criterion,Aimin Zhou; Yaochu Jin; Qingfu Zhang; Bernhard Sendhoff; Edward Tsang,In our previous work conducted by Aimin Zhou et. al.;(2005); it has been shown that theperformance of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms can be greatly enhanced if theregularity in the distribution of Pareto-optimal solutions is used. This paper suggests a newhybrid multi-objective evolutionary algorithm by introducing a convergence based criterionto determine when the model-based method and when the genetics-based method shouldbe used to generate offspring in each generation. The basic idea is that the genetics-basedmethod; ie; crossover and mutation; should be used when the population is far away fromthe Pareto front and no obvious regularity in population distribution can be observed. Whenthe population moves towards the Pareto front; the distribution of the individuals will showincreasing regularity and in this case; the model-based method should be used to …,Evolutionary Computation; 2006.

Prediction-based population re-initialization for evolutionary dynamic multi-objective optimization,Aimin Zhou; Yaochu Jin; Qingfu Zhang; Bernhard Sendhoff; Edward Tsang,Abstract Optimization in changing environment is a challenging task; especially whenmultiple objectives are to be optimized simultaneously. The basic idea to address dynamicoptimization problems is to utilize history information to guide future search. In this paper;two strategies for population re-initialization are introduced when a change in theenvironment is detected. The first strategy is to predict the new location of individuals fromthe location changes that have occurred in the history. The current population is thenpartially or completely replaced by the new individuals generated based on prediction. Thesecond strategy is to perturb the current population with a Gaussian noise whose variance isestimated according to previous changes. The prediction based population re-initializationstrategies; together with the random re-initialization method; are then compared on two bi …,International Conference on Evolutionary Multi-Criterion Optimization,2007,103
Approximating the set of Pareto-optimal solutions in both the decision and objective spaces by an estimation of distribution algorithm,Aimin Zhou; Qingfu Zhang; Yaochu Jin,Most existing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms aim at approximating the Pareto front(PF); which is the distribution of the Pareto-optimal solutions in the objective space. In manyreal-life applications; however; a good approximation to the Pareto set (PS); which is thedistribution of the Pareto-optimal solutions in the decision space; is also required by adecision maker. This paper considers a class of multiobjective optimization problems(MOPs); in which the dimensionalities of the PS and the PF manifolds are different so that agood approximation to the PF might not approximate the PS very well. It proposes aprobabilistic model-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm; called MMEA; forapproximating the PS and the PF simultaneously for an MOP in this class.

A population prediction strategy for evolutionary dynamic multiobjective optimization,A. Zhou; Y. Jin; Q. Zhang,This paper investigates how to use prediction strategies to improve the performance ofmultiobjective evolutionary optimization algorithms in dealing with dynamic environments.Prediction-based methods have been applied to predict some isolated points in bothdynamic single objective optimization and dynamic multiobjective optimization. We extendthis idea to predict a whole population by considering the properties of continuous dynamicmultiobjective optimization problems. In our approach; called population prediction strategy(PPS); a Pareto set is divided into two parts: a center point and a manifold. A sequence ofcenter points is maintained to predict the next center; and the previous manifolds are used toestimate the next manifold. Thus; PPS could initialize a whole population by combining thepredicted center and estimated manifold when a change is detected. We systematically …,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2014,74
A model-based evolutionary algorithm for bi-objective optimization,Aimin Zhou; Qingfu Zhang; Yaochu Jin; Edward Tsang; Tatsuya Okabe,The Pareto optimal solutions to a multi-objective optimization problem often distribute veryregularly in both the decision space and the objective space. Most existing evolutionaryalgorithms do not explicitly take advantage of such a regularity. This paper proposed amodel-based evolutionary algorithm (M-MOEA) for bi-objective optimization problems.Inspired by the ideas from estimation of distribution algorithms; M-MOEA uses a probabilitymodel to capture the regularity of the distribution of the Pareto optimal solutions. The localprincipal component analysis (local PCA) and the least-squares method are employed forbuilding the model. New solutions are sampled from the model thus built. At alternategenerations; M-MOEA uses crossover and mutation to produce new solutions.

A fast particle swarm optimization algorithm with cauchy mutation and natural selection strategy,Changhe Li; Yong Liu; Aimin Zhou; Lishan Kang; Hui Wang,Abstract The standard Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is a novel evolutionaryalgorithm in which each particle studies its own previous best solution and the group'sprevious best to optimize problems. One problem exists in PSO is its tendency of trappinginto local optima. In this paper; a fast particle swarm optimization (FPSO) algorithm isproposed by combining PSO and the Cauchy mutation and an evolutionary selectionstrategy. The idea is to introduce the Cauchy mutation into PSO in the hope of preventingPSO from trapping into a local optimum through long jumps made by the Cauchy mutation.FPSO has been compared with another improved PSO called AMPSO [12] on a set ofbenchmark functions. The results show that FPSO is much faster than AMPSO on all the testfunctions.,International Symposium on Intelligence Computation and Applications,2007,59
Solving dynamic TSP with evolutionary approach in real time,Aimin Zhou; Lishan Kang; Zhenyu Yan,Many real world optimization problems are time-dependent and some of them can bemodeled by the dynamic TSPs (DTSPs). A DTSP is harder than a general TSP; which is aNP-hard problem; because the city number and the cost matrix of a DTSP are time varying.Although DTSP is a very common and important model in real world systems; few literatureshave discussed this related issues. There are many open questions about DTSP urgentlyneeded to be answered. We first give a mathematical model and the optimization objectivefor DTSP. Then we discuss why evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are effective for solvingDTSPs and give some key points for designing efficient DTSP EAs. By defining threedynamic operators; we proposed an evolutionary algorithm for DTSPs. The experimentsshow the new algorithm is suitable for solving DTSPs.

A replacement scheme; which assigns a new solution to asubproblem; plays a key role in balancing diversity and convergence in MOEA/D. This paperproposes a global replacement scheme which assigns a new solution to its most suitablesubproblems. We demonstrate that the replacement neighborhood size is critical forpopulation diversity and convergence; and develop an approach for adjusting this sizedynamically.

A multioperator search strategy based on cheap surrogate models for evolutionary optimization,Wenyin Gong; Aimin Zhou; Zhihua Cai,It is well known that in evolutionary algorithms (EAs); different reproduction operators maybe suitable for different problems or in different running stages. To improve the algorithmperformance; the ensemble of multiple operators has become popular. Most ensembletechniques achieve this goal by choosing an operator according to a probability learnedfrom the previous experience. In contrast to these ensemble techniques; in this paper wepropose a cheap surrogate model-based multioperator search strategy for evolutionaryoptimization. In our approach; a set of candidate offspring solutions are generated by usingthe multiple offspring reproduction operators; and the best one according to the surrogatemodel is chosen as the offspring solution.

Are all the subproblems equally important? Resource allocation in decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms,Aimin Zhou; Qingfu Zhang,Decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) decompose amultiobjective optimization problem into a set of scalar objective subproblems and solvethem in a collaborative way. A naïve way to distribute computational effort is to treat all thesubproblems equally and assign the same computational resource to each subproblem.This paper proposes a generalized resource allocation (GRA) strategy for decomposition-based MOEAs by using a probability of improvement vector. Each subproblem is chosen toinvest according to this vector. An offline measurement and an online measurement of thesubproblem hardness are used to maintain and update this vector. Utility functions areproposed and studied for implementing a reasonable and stable online resource allocationstrategy.

Constrained subproblems in a decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm,Luping Wang; Qingfu Zhang; Aimin Zhou; Maoguo Gong; Licheng Jiao,A decomposition approach decomposes a multiobjective optimization problem into anumber of scalar objective optimization subproblems. It plays a key role in decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. However; many widely used decompositionapproaches; originally proposed for mathematical programming algorithms; may not be verysuitable for evolutionary algorithms. To help decomposition-based multiobjectiveevolutionary algorithms balance the population diversity and convergence in an appropriatemanner; this letter proposes to impose some constraints on the subproblems. Experimentshave been conducted to demonstrate that our proposed constrained decompositionapproach works well on most test instances.

Benchmarking algorithms for dynamic travelling salesman problems,Lishan Kang; Aimin Zhou; Bob McKay; Yan Li; Zhuo Kang,Dynamic optimisation problems are becoming increasingly important; meanwhile; progressin optimisation techniques and in computational resources are permitting the developmentof effective systems for dynamic optimisation; resulting in a need for objective methods toevaluate and compare different techniques. The search for effective techniques may be seenas a multi-objective problem; trading off time complexity against effectiveness; hencebenchmarks must be able to compare techniques across the Pareto front; not merely at asingle point. We propose benchmarks for the dynamic travelling salesman problem; adaptedfrom the CHN-144 benchmark of 144 Chinese cities for the static travelling salesmanproblem. We provide an example of the use of the benchmark; and illustrate the informationthat can be gleaned from analysis of the algorithm performance on the benchmarks.,Evolutionary Computation; 2004.

Multi-objective mobile agent-based sensor network routing using MOEA/D,Andreas Konstantinidis; Christoforos Charalambous; Aimin Zhou; Qingfu Zhang,Mobile agents are often used in wireless sensor networks for distributed target detection withthe goal of minimizing the transmission of non-critical data that negatively affects theperformance of the network. A challenge is to find optimal mobile agent routes for minimizingthe data path loss and the sensors energy consumption as well as maximizing the dataaccuracy. Existing approaches deal with the objectives individually; or by optimizing oneand constraining the others or by combining them into a single objective. This often results inmissing “good” tradeoff solutions.

It isa very challenging problem to evolutionary computation. In this paper; we propose asurrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm; Minimax SAEA; for tackling minimax optimizationproblems. In Minimax SAEA; a surrogate model based on Gaussian process is built toapproximate the mapping between the decision variables and the objective value. In eachgeneration; most of the new solutions are evaluated based on the surrogate model and onlythe best one is evaluated by the actual objective function.

In this paper; we suggest to combinean EDA with cheap and expensive local search (LS) methods for making use of both globalstatistical information and individual location information. In our approach; part of a newsolution is sampled from a modified univariate histogram probabilistic model and the rest isgenerated by refining a parent solution through a cheap LS method that does not need anyfunction evaluation.

At eachgeneration; a self-organizing mapping method with (m-1) latent variables is applied toestablish the neighborhood relationship among current solutions. A solution is only allowedto mate with its neighboring solutions to generate a new solution. To reduce thecomputational overhead; the self-organizing training step and the evolution step areconducted in an alternative manner. In other words; the self-organizing training is performedonly one single step at each generation.

Then dynamic constrainedmulti-objective evolutionary algorithms (DCMOEAs) can be used to solve the COP problemby solving the DCMOP problem. Seemingly; a complex DCMOEA algorithm is used to solvea relatively simple COP problem. However; the DCMOEA algorithm can adopt Paretodomination to achieve a good trade off between fast converging and global searching; andtherefore a DCMOEA algorithm can effectively solve a COP problem by solving the DCMOPproblem.

Onemain difficulty in model-based optimization is constructing a probabilistic model that is ableto effectively capture the structure of the problems to enable efficient search. This chapteradvocates a new type of probabilistic model that takes the regularity in the distribution ofPareto-optimal solutions into account.

Usually the preselection process is based on the real orestimated objective values; which might be expensive. It is arguable that the preselection isdoing classification in nature; which requires to know a solution is good or not instead ofknowing how good it is. In this paper we apply a classification based preselection (CPS) to amultiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). In eachgeneration; a set of candidate solutions are generated for each subproblem and only a goodone is chosen as the offspring by the CPS. The modified MOEA/D; denoted as MOEA/D-CPS; is applied to a set of test instances; and the experimental results suggest that the CPScan successfully improve the performance of MOEA/D.,Bio-Inspired Computing-Theories and Applications,2015,4
On neighborhood exploration and subproblem exploitation in decomposition based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms,Aimin Zhou; Yuting Zhang; Guixu Zhang; Wenyin Gong,The decomposition based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm; denoted as MOEA/D; is anopen framework for multiobjective optimization. This paper addresses the reproductionoperation in MOEA/D. Generally; the solutions from a neighborhood of a subproblem arechosen as the mating pool for offspring reproduction. Since the Pareto set of an MOP showssome kind of structure in the decision space; the newly generated solutions based on themating pool are arguable more likely to distribute along the population structure; which iscalled neighborhood exploration; and less likely to push a solution forward along thesubproblem; which is called subproblem exploitation. To balance neighborhood explorationand subproblem exploitation; we propose to utilize both history and neighbor solutions foroffspring reproduction. This idea is implemented through two operators based on the …,Evolutionary Computation (CEC); 2015 IEEE Congress on,2015,4
A clustering based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm,Hu Zhang; Shenmin Song; Aimin Zhou; Xiao-Zhi Gao,In this paper; we propose a clustering based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm(CLUMOEA) to deal with the multiobjective optimization problems with irregular Pareto frontshapes. CLUMOEA uses a k-means clustering method to discover the population structureby partitioning the solutions into several clusters; and it only allows the solutions in the samecluster to do the reproduction. To reduce the computational cost and balance the explorationand exploitation; the clustering process and evolutionary process are integrated togetherand they are performed simultaneously. In addition to the clustering; CLUMOEA also uses adistance tournament selection to choose the more similar mating solutions to accelerate theconvergence.

Simulated annealing with probabilistic neighborhood for traveling salesman problems,Yang Li; Aimin Zhou; Guixu Zhang,The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a classical combinatorial optimization problem.Due to its NP-hard nature; modern heuristic methods are usually applied to find anapproximation of the best tour of a TSP. It has been proved that most of the edges of a besttour are linked by neighbor cities. By using this heuristic information; a probabilisticneighborhood model is defined in this paper to guide the tour constructing in a heuristicmethod. This probabilistic neighborhood model is then applied in the framework of asimulated annealing (SA) algorithm. The proposed algorithm is compared to a basic SAalgorithm on a set of test instances. The preliminary results show that an SA withprobabilistic neighborhood can outperform a generic SA.,Natural Computation (ICNC); 2011 Seventh International Conference on,2011,4

Simultaneous Bayesian Clustering and Feature Selection Through Student's t Mixtures Model,Jianyong Sun; Aimin Zhou; Simeon Keates; Shengbin Liao,In this paper; we proposed a generative model for feature selection under the unsupervisedlearning context.

A locally weighted metamodel for pre-selection in evolutionary optimization,Qiuxiao Liao; Aimin Zhou; Guixu Zhang,The evolutionary algorithms are usually criticized for their slow convergence. To address thisweakness; a variety of strategies have been proposed. Among them; the metamodel orsurrogate based approaches are promising since they replace the original optimizationobjective by a metamodel. However; the metamodel building itself is expensive andtherefore the metamodel based evolutionary algorithms are commonly applied to expensiveoptimization. In this paper; we propose an alternative metamodel; named locally weightedmetamodel (LWM); for the pre-selection in evolutionary optimization. The basic idea is toestimate the objective values of candidate offspring solutions for an individual; and choosethe most promising one as the offspring solution. Instead of building a global model as manyother algorithms do; a LWM is built for each candidate offspring solution in our approach …,Evolutionary Computation (CEC); 2014 IEEE Congress on,2014,3

Modelling the regularity in an estimation of distribution algorithm for continuous multiobjective optimisation with variable linkages,Qingfu Zhang; Aimin Zhou; Yaochu Jin,Abstract Under mild conditions; it can be induced from the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditionthat the Pareto set; in the decision space; of a continuous multiobjective optimizationproblem is (m− 1)-D piecewise continuous; where m is the number of objectives. Based onthis regularity property; we propose a Regularity Model based Multiobjective Estimation ofDistribution Algorithm (RM-MEDA) for continuous multiobjective optimization problems withvariable linkages. At each generation; the proposed algorithm models a promising area inthe decision space by a probability distribution whose centroid is a (m− 1)-D piecewisecontinuous manifold.

A Novel Blind Spectral Unmixing Method Based on Error Analysis of Linear Mixture Model,Chunzhi Li; Faming Fang; Aimin Zhou; Guixu Zhang,It is well known that the linear mixture model (LMM) is attracting much attention due to itssimplicity. However; some theoretical analysis reveals that the traditional LMM also impedesthe improvement of blind spectral unmixing. For this reason; we propose a novel blindspectral unmixing method (NBSUM) in this letter. NBSUM utilizes the conjugate gradient tocalculate end-member spectral and abundance; which can not only overcome someshortcomings of the traditional LMM but also provide more accurate results.

Combining model-based and genetics-based offspring generation for multi-objective optimization using a convergence criterion,*,A system and method for combining the model-based and genetics-based methods arecombined according to a convergence criterion. When the population is not converged; thegenetics-based approach is used; and when the population is converged; the model-basedmethod is used to generate offspring. The algorithm benefits from using a model-basedoffspring generation only when the population shows a certain degree of regularity; ie;converged in a stochastic sense. In addition; a more sophisticated method to construct thestochastic part of the model can be used. Also a biased Gaussian noise (the mean of thenoise is not zero); as well as a white Gaussian noise (the mean of the noise is zero) can bepreferably used for the stochastic part of the model.,*,2010,2
A hybrid estimation of distribution algorithm with differential evolution for global optimization,Bing Dong; Aimin Zhou; Guixu Zhang,In evolutionary algorithms; it is difficult to balance the exploration and exploitation. Usually;global search is utilized to find promising solutions; and local search is beneficial to theconvergence of the solutions in the population. Combing different search strategies is apromising way to take advantages of different methods. Following the idea of DE/EDA; thispaper proposes another way to combine estimation of distribution algorithm and differentialevolution for global optimization. The basic idea is to choose either differential evolution orestimation of distribution algorithm for generating new trial solutions.

An Evolutionary Approach for Image Registration,Jing Zhang; Aimin Zhou; Guixu Zhang,Abstract Image registration plays an important role in many real-world applications such asremote sensing. A key issue of image registration is to find the hidden relationship betweenthe input image and the reference image. In many cases; the hidden relationship ispresented by a coordinate transformation matrix. Therefore; an image registration can beformulated as an optimization problem. In this paper; we propose to use evolutionaryalgorithms to optimize the transformation matrix. Instead of finding an optimal mappingbetween each pixel in the input and reference images; some local image features which areexpressed as control points; are firstly extracted from the two images. An evolutionaryalgorithm is then applied to find the optimal mapping between the control points. Finally; theinput image is registrated by the optimal transformation.

Preselection via Classification: A Case Study on Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization,Jinyuan Zhang; Aimin Zhou; Ke Tang; Guixu Zhang,Abstract: In evolutionary algorithms; a preselection operator aims to select the promisingoffspring solutions from a candidate offspring set. It is usually based on the estimated or realobjective values of the candidate offspring solutions. In a sense; the preselection can betreated as a classification procedure; which classifies the candidate offspring solutions intopromising ones and unpromising ones.
