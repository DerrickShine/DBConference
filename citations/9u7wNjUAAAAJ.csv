Graph pattern matching: from intractable to polynomial time,Wenfei Fan; Jianzhong Li; Shuai Ma; Nan Tang; Yinghui Wu; Yunpeng Wu,Abstract Graph pattern matching is typically defined in terms of subgraph isomorphism;which makes it an np-complete problem. Moreover; it requires bijective functions; which areoften too restrictive to characterize patterns in emerging applications. We propose a class ofgraph patterns; in which an edge denotes the connectivity in a data graph within apredefined number of hops. In addition; we define matching based on a notion of boundedsimulation; an extension of graph simulation. We show that with this revision; graph patternmatching can be performed in cubic-time; by providing such an algorithm. We also developalgorithms for incrementally finding matches when data graphs are updated; withperformance guarantees for dag patterns. We experimentally verify that these algorithmsscale well; and that the revised notion of graph pattern matching allows us to identify …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,204
Incremental graph pattern matching,Wenfei Fan; Xin Wang; Yinghui Wu,Abstract Graph pattern matching is commonly used in a variety of emerging applicationssuch as social network analysis. These applications highlight the need for studying thefollowing two issues. First; graph pattern matching is traditionally defined in terms ofsubgraph isomorphism or graph simulation. These notions; however; often impose toostrong a topological constraint on graphs to identify meaningful matches. Second; in practicea graph is typically large; and is frequently updated with small changes. It is oftenprohibitively expensive to recompute matches starting from scratch via batch algorithmswhen the graph is updated. This article studies these two issues.(1) We propose to definegraph pattern matching based on a notion of bounded simulation; which extends graphsimulation by specifying the connectivity of nodes in a graph within a predefined number …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2013,124
Adding regular expressions to graph reachability and pattern queries,Wenfei Fan; Jianzhong Li; Shuai Ma; Nan Tang; Yinghui Wu,It is increasingly common to find graphs in which edges bear different types; indicating avariety of relationships. For such graphs we propose a class of reachability queries and aclass of graph patterns; in which an edge is specified with a regular expression of a certainform; expressing the connectivity in a data graph via edges of various types. In addition; wedefine graph pattern matching based on a revised notion of graph simulation. On graphs inemerging applications such as social networks; we show that these queries are capable offinding more sensible information than their traditional counterparts. Better still; theirincreased expressive power does not come with extra complexity. Indeed;(1) we investigatetheir containment and minimization problems; and show that these fundamental problemsare in quadratic time for reachability queries and are in cubic time for pattern queries.(2) …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,112
Query preserving graph compression,Wenfei Fan; Jianzhong Li; Xin Wang; Yinghui Wu,Abstract It is common to find graphs with millions of nodes and billions of edges in; eg; socialnetworks. Queries on such graphs are often prohibitively expensive. These motivate us topropose query preserving graph compression; to compress graphs relative to a class Λ ofqueries of users' choice. We compute a small G r from a graph G such that (a) for any queryQ Ε Λ Q; Q (G)= Q'(G r); where Q'Ε Λ can be efficiently computed from Q; and (b) anyalgorithm for computing Q (G) can be directly applied to evaluating Q'on G r as is. That is;while we cannot lower the complexity of evaluating graph queries; we reduce data graphswhile preserving the answers to all the queries in Λ. To verify the effectiveness of thisapproach;(1) we develop compression strategies for two classes of queries: reachability andgraph pattern queries via (bounded) simulation. We show that graphs can be efficiently …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,110
Nema: Fast graph search with label similarity,Arijit Khan; Yinghui Wu; Charu C Aggarwal; Xifeng Yan,Abstract It is increasingly common to find real-life data represented as networks of labeled;heterogeneous entities. To query these networks; one often needs to identify the matches ofa given query graph in a (typically large) network modeled as a target graph. Due to noiseand the lack of fixed schema in the target graph; the query graph can substantially differ fromits matches in the target graph in both structure and node labels; thus bringing challenges tothe graph querying tasks. In this paper; we propose NeMa (Network Match); a neighborhood-based subgraph matching technique for querying real-life networks.(1) To measure thequality of the match; we propose a novel subgraph matching cost metric that aggregates thecosts of matching individual nodes; and unifies both structure and node label similarities.(2)Based on the metric; we formulate the minimum cost subgraph matching problem.

Graph homomorphism revisited for graph matching,Wenfei Fan; Jianzhong Li; Shuai Ma; Hongzhi Wang; Yinghui Wu,Abstract In a variety of emerging applications one needs to decide whether a graph Gmatches another G p; ie; whether G has a topological structure similar to that of G p. Thetraditional notions of graph homomorphism and isomorphism often fall short of capturing thestructural similarity in these applications. This paper studies revisions of these notions;providing a full treatment from complexity to algorithms.(1) We propose p-homomorphism (p-hom) and 1-1 p-hom; which extend graph homomorphism and subgraph isomorphism;respectively; by mapping edges from one graph to paths in another; and by measuring thesimilarity of nodes.(2) We introduce metrics to measure graph similarity; and severaloptimization problems for p-hom and 1-1 p-hom.(3) We show that the decision problems forp-hom and 1-1 p-hom are NP-complete even for DAGs; and that the optimization …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,89
Diversified top-k graph pattern matching,Wenfei Fan; Xin Wang; Yinghui Wu,Abstract Graph pattern matching has been widely used in eg; social data analysis. A numberof matching algorithms have been developed that; given a graph pattern Q and a graph G;compute the set M (Q; G) of matches of Q in G. However; these algorithms often return anexcessive number of matches; and are expensive on large real-life social graphs. Moreover;in practice many social queries are to find matches of a specific pattern node; rather than theentire M (Q; G). This paper studies top-k graph pattern matching.(1) We revise graph patternmatching defined in terms of simulation; by supporting a designated output node u o. GivenG and Q; it is to find those nodes in M (Q; G) that match uo; instead of the large set M (Q;G).(2) We study two classes of functions for ranking the matches: relevance functions δ r ()based on; eg; social impact; and distance functions δ d () to cover diverse elements.(3) …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,48
Schemaless and structureless graph querying,Shengqi Yang; Yinghui Wu; Huan Sun; Xifeng Yan,Abstract Querying complex graph databases such as knowledge graphs is a challengingtask for non-professional users. Due to their complex schemas and variational informationdescriptions; it becomes very hard for users to formulate a query that can be properlyprocessed by the existing systems. We argue that for a user-friendly graph query engine; itmust support various kinds of transformations such as synonym; abbreviation; and ontology.Furthermore; the derived query results must be ranked in a principled manner.

Propagating functional dependencies with conditions,Wenfei Fan; Shuai Ma; Yanli Hu; Jie Liu; Yinghui Wu,Abstract The dependency propagation problem is to determine; given a view defined ondata sources and a set of dependencies on the sources; whether another dependency isguaranteed to hold on the view. This paper investigates dependency propagation forrecently proposed conditional functional dependencies (CFDs). The need for this study isevident in data integration; exchange and cleaning since dependencies on data sourcesoften only hold conditionally on the view. We investigate dependency propagation for viewsdefined in various fragments of relational algebra; CFDs as view dependencies; and forsource dependencies given as either CFDs or traditional functional dependencies (FDs).(a)We establish lower and upper bounds; all matching; ranging from PTIME to undecidable.These not only provide the first results for CFD propagation; but also extend the classical …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,43
Performance guarantees for distributed reachability queries,Wenfei Fan; Xin Wang; Yinghui Wu,Abstract In the real world a graph is often fragmented and distributed across different sites.This highlights the need for evaluating queries on distributed graphs. This paper proposesdistributed evaluation algorithms for three classes of queries: reachability for determiningwhether one node can reach another; bounded reachability for deciding whether thereexists a path of a bounded length between a pair of nodes; and regular reachability forchecking whether there exists a path connecting two nodes such that the node labels on thepath form a string in a given regular expression. We develop these algorithms based onpartial evaluation; to explore parallel computation. When evaluating a query Q on adistributed graph G; we show that these algorithms possess the following performanceguarantees; no matter how G is fragmented and distributed:(1) each site is visited only …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,35
Distributed graph simulation: Impossibility and possibility,Wenfei Fan; Xin Wang; Yinghui Wu; Dong Deng,Abstract This paper studies fundamental problems for distributed graph simulation. Given apattern query Q and a graph G that is fragmented and distributed; a graph simulationalgorithm A is to compute the matches Q (G) of Q in G. We say that A is parallel scalable in(a) response time if its parallel computational cost is determined by the largest fragment F mof G and the size| Q| of query Q; and (b) data shipment if its total amount of data shipped isdetermined by| Q| and the number of fragments of G; independent of the size of graph G.(1)We prove an impossibility theorem: there exists no distributed graph simulation algorithmthat is parallel scalable in either response time or data shipment.(2) However; we show thatdistributed graph simulation is partition bounded; ie; its response time depends only on| Q|;|F m| and the number| V f| of nodes in G with edges across different fragments; and its data …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,33
Querying big graphs within bounded resources,Wenfei Fan; Xin Wang; Yinghui Wu,Abstract This paper studies the problem of querying graphs within bounded resources.Given a query Q; a graph G and a small ratio α; it aims to answer Q in G by accessing only afraction GQ of G of size| GQ|≤ α| G|. The need for this is evident when G is big while ouravailable resources are limited; as indicated by α. We propose resource-bounded queryanswering via a dynamic scheme that reduces big G to G Q. We investigate when we canfind the exact answers Q (G) from GQ; and if GQ cannot accommodate enough information;how accurate the approximate answers Q (GQ) are. To verify the effectiveness of theapproach; we study two types of queries. One consists of pattern queries that have datalocality; such as subgraph isomorphism and strong simulation. The other is the class ofreachability queries; without data locality. We show that it is hard to get resource-bounded …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,29
Answering graph pattern queries using views,Wenfei Fan; Xin Wang; Yinghui Wu,Answering queries using views has proven an effective technique for querying relationaland semistructured data. This paper investigates this issue for graph pattern queries basedon (bounded) simulation; which have been increasingly used in; eg; social network analysis.We propose a notion of pattern containment to characterize graph pattern matching usinggraph pattern views. We show that a graph pattern query can be answered using a set ofviews if and only if the query is contained in the views. Based on this characterization wedevelop efficient algorithms to answer graph pattern queries. In addition; we identify threeproblems associated with graph pattern containment. We show that these problems rangefrom quadratic-time to NP-complete; and provide efficient algorithms for containmentchecking (approximation when the problem is intractable).

Association rules with graph patterns,Wenfei Fan; Xin Wang; Yinghui Wu; Jingbo Xu,Abstract We propose graph-pattern association rules (GPARs) for social media marketing.Extending association rules for item-sets; GPARs help us discover regularities betweenentities in social graphs; and identify potential customers by exploring social influence. Westudy the problem of discovering top-k diversified GPARs. While this problem is NP-hard; wedevelop a parallel algorithm with accuracy bound. We also study the problem of identifyingpotential customers with GPARs. While it is also NP-hard; we provide a parallel scalablealgorithm that guarantees a polynomial speedup over sequential algorithms with theincrease of processors. Using real-life and synthetic graphs; we experimentally verify thescalability and effectiveness of the algorithms.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,19
Ontology-based subgraph querying,Yinghui Wu; Shengqi Yang; Xifeng Yan,Subgraph querying has been applied in a variety of emerging applications. Traditionalsubgraph querying based on subgraph isomorphism requires identical label matching;which is often too restrictive to capture the matches that are semantically close to the querygraphs. This paper extends subgraph querying to identify semantically related matches byleveraging ontology information.(1) We introduce the ontology-based subgraph querying;which revises subgraph isomorphism by mapping a query to semantically related subgraphsin terms of a given ontology graph. We introduce a metric to measure the similarity of thematches. Based on the metric; we introduce an optimization problem to find top K bestmatches.(2) We provide a filtering-and-verification framework to identify (top-K) matches forontology-based subgraph queries. The framework efficiently extracts a small subgraph of …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,19
Summarizing answer graphs induced by keyword queries,Yinghui Wu; Shengqi Yang; Mudhakar Srivatsa; Arun Iyengar; Xifeng Yan,Abstract Keyword search has been popularly used to query graph data. Due to the lack ofstructure support; a keyword query might generate an excessive number of matches;referred to as" answer graphs"; that could include different relationships among keywords.An ignored yet important task is to group and summarize answer graphs that share similarstructures and contents for better query interpretation and result understanding. This paperstudies the summarization problem for the answer graphs induced by a keyword query Q.(1)A notion of summary graph is proposed to characterize the summarization of answer graphs.Given Q and a set of answer graphs G; a summary graph preserves the relation of thekeywords in Q by summarizing the paths connecting the keywords nodes in G.(2) A qualitymetric of summary graphs; called coverage ratio; is developed to measure information …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,17
Emerging graph queries in linked data,Arijit Khan; Yinghui Wu; Xifeng Yan,In a wide array of disciplines; data can be modeled as an interconnected network of entities;where various attributes could be associated with both the entities and the relations amongthem. Knowledge is often hidden in the complex structure and attributes inside thesenetworks. While querying and mining these linked datasets are essential for variousapplications; traditional graph queries may not be able to capture the rich semantics in thesenetworks. With the advent of complex information networks; new graph queries areemerging; including graph pattern matching and mining; similarity search; ranking andexpert finding; graph aggregation and OLAP. These queries require both the topology andcontent information of the network data; and hence; different from classical graph algorithmssuch as shortest path; reach ability and minimum cut; which depend only on the structure …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,17
SLQ: a user-friendly graph querying system,Shengqi Yang; Yanan Xie; Yinghui Wu; Tianyu Wu; Huan Sun; Jian Wu; Xifeng Yan,Abstract Querying complex graph databases such as knowledge graphs is a challengingtask for non-professional users. In this demo; we present SLQ; a user-friendly graphquerying system enabling schemales and structures graph querying; where a user need notdescribe queries precisely as required by most databases. SLQ system combines searchingand ranking: it leverages a set of transformation functions; including abbreviation; ontology;synonym; etc.; that map keywords and linkages from a query to their matches in a datagraph; based on an automatically learned ranking model. To help users better understandsearch results at different levels of granularity; it supports effective result summarization with"drill-down" and" roll-up" operations. Better still; the architecture of SLQ is elastic for newtransformation functions; query logs and user feedback; to iteratively refine the ranking …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2014,14
Fast top-k search in knowledge graphs,Shengqi Yang; Fangqiu Han; Yinghui Wu; Xifeng Yan,Given a graph query Q posed on a knowledge graph G; top-k graph querying is to find kmatches in G with the highest ranking score according to a ranking function. Fast top-ksearch in knowledge graphs is challenging as both graph traversal and similarity search areexpensive. Conventional top-k graph search is typically based on threshold algorithm (TA);which can no long fit the demand in the new setting. This work proposes STAR; a top-kknowledge graph search framework. It has two components:(a) a fast top-k algorithm for starqueries; and (b) an assembling algorithm for general graph queries. The assemblingalgorithm uses star query as a building block and iteratively sweeps the star match lists witha dynamically adjusted bound. For top-k star graph query where an edge can be matched toa path with bounded length d; we develop a message passing algorithm; achieving time …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,13
Functional dependencies for graphs,Wenfei Fan; Yinghui Wu; Jingbo Xu,Abstract We propose a class of functional dependencies for graphs; referred to as GFDs.GFDs capture both attribute-value dependencies and topological structures of entities; andsubsume conditional functional dependencies (CFDs) as a special case. We show that thesatisfiability and implication problems for GFDs are coNP-complete and NP-complete;respectively; no worse than their CFD counterparts. We also show that the validationproblem for GFDs is coNP-complete. Despite the intractability; we develop parallel scalablealgorithms for catching violations of GFDs in large-scale graphs. Using real-life and syntheticdata; we experimentally verify that GFDs provide an effective approach to detectinginconsistencies in knowledge and social graphs.,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,12
Making SQL queries correct on incomplete databases: A feasibility study,Paolo Guagliardo; Leonid Libkin,Abstract Multiple issues with SQL's handling of nulls have been well documented. Havingefficiency as its key goal; evaluation of SQL queries disregards the standard notion ofcorrectness on incomplete databases-certain answers-due to its high complexity. As a result;it may produce answers that are just plain wrong. It was recently shown that SQL evaluationcan be modified; at least for first-order queries; to return only correct answers. But whilethese modifications came with good theoretical complexity bounds; they have not beentested in practice. The goals of this proof-of-concept paper are to understand whether wronganswers can be produced by SQL queries in real-world scenarios; and whether proposedtechniques for avoiding them can be made practically feasible. We use the TPC-Hbenchmark; and show that for some typical queries involving negation; wrong answers …,Proceedings of the 35th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems,2016,11
Towards scalable critical alert mining,Bo Zong; Yinghui Wu; Jie Song; Ambuj K Singh; Hasan Cam; Jiawei Han; Xifeng Yan,Abstract Performance monitor software for data centers typically generates a great numberof alert sequences. These alert sequences indicate abnormal network events. Given a set ofobserved alert sequences; it is important to identify the most critical alerts that are potentiallythe causes of others. While the need for mining critical alerts over large scale alertsequences is evident; most alert analysis techniques stop at modeling and mining thecausal relations among the alerts. This paper studies the critical alert mining problem: Givena set of alert sequences; we aim to find a set of k critical alerts such that the number of alertspotentially triggered by them is maximized. We show that the problem is intractable;therefore; we resort to approximation and heuristic algorithms. First; we develop anapproximation algorithm that obtains a near-optimal alert set in quadratic time; and …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2014,11

While theimportance of studying cascades has been recognized in various applications; it is difficult toobserve the complete structure of cascades in practice. In this paper we study the cascadeinference problem following the independent cascade model; and provide a full treatmentfrom complexity to algorithms:(a) we propose the idea of consistent trees as the inferredstructures for cascades; these trees connect source nodes and observed nodes with pathssatisfying the constraints from the observed temporal information.(b) We introduce metrics tomeasure the likelihood of consistent trees as inferred cascades; as well as severaloptimization problems for finding them.(c) We show that the decision problems for consistenttrees are in general NP-complete; and that the optimization problems are hard to …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on,2012,10

GRAPEdiffers from prior systems in its ability to parallelize existing sequential graph algorithms as awhole. Underlying GRAPE are a simple programming model and a principled approach;based on partial evaluation and incremental computation. We show that sequential graphalgorithms can be" plugged into" GRAPE with minor changes; and get parallelized. As longas the sequential algorithms are correct; their GRAPE parallelization guarantees toterminate with correct answers under a monotonic condition.

On the aggregation problem for synthesized web services,Ting Deng; Wenfei Fan; Leonid Libkin; Yinghui Wu,Abstract The paper introduces and investigates the aggregation problem for synthesizedmediators of Web services (SWMs). An SWM is a deterministic finite-state transducer definedin terms of templates for component services. Upon receiving an artifact; an SWM selects aset of available services from a library to realize its templates; and invokes those services tooperate on the artifact; in parallel; it produces a numeric value as output (eg; the total price ofa package) by applying synthesis rules. Given an SWM; a library and an input artifact; theaggregation problem is to find a mapping from the component templates of the SWM toavailable services in the library that maximizes (or minimizes) the output. As opposed to thecomposition syntheses of Web services; the aggregation problem aims to optimize therealization of a given mediator; to best serve the usersʼ need.

Adding counting quantifiers to graph patterns,Wenfei Fan; Yinghui Wu; Jingbo Xu,Abstract This paper proposes quantified graph patterns (QGPs); an extension of graphpatterns by supporting simple counting quantifiers on edges. We show that QGPs naturallyexpress universal and existential quantification; numeric and ratio aggregates; as well asnegation. Better still; the increased expressivity does not come with a much higher price. Weshow that quantified matching; ie; graph pattern matching with QGPs; remains NP-completein the absence of negation; and is DP-complete for general QGPs. We show how quantifiedmatching can be conducted by incorporating quantifier checking into conventional subgraphisomorphism methods. We also develop parallel scalable algorithms for quantified matching.As an application of QGPs; we introduce quantified graph association rules defined withQGPs; to identify potential customers in social media marketing.

GRAPE: parallelizing sequential graph computations,Wenfei Fan; Jingbo Xu; Yinghui Wu; Wenyuan Yu; Jiaxin Jiang,Abstract We demonstrate GRAPE; a parallel< u> GRAP</u> h query< u> E</u> ngine.GRAPE advocates a parallel model based on a simultaneous fixed point computation interms of partial and incremental evaluation. It differs from prior systems in its ability toparallelize existing sequential graph algorithms as a whole; without the need for recastingthe entire algorithms into a new model. One of its unique features is that under a monotoniccondition; GRAPE parallelization guarantees to terminate with correct answers as long asthe sequential algorithms" plugged in" are correct. We demonstrate its parallel computations;ease-of-use and performance compared with the start-of-the-art graph systems.

Performance Prediction for Graph Queries,Mohammad Hossein Namaki; Keyvan Sasani; Yinghui Wu; Assefaw H Gebremedhin,Abstract Query performance prediction has shown benefits to query optimization andresource allocation for relational databases. Emerging applications are leading to searchscenarios where workloads with heterogeneous; structure-less analytical queries areprocessed over large-scale graph and network data. This calls for effective models to predictthe performance of graph analytical queries; which are often more involved than theirrelational counterparts. In this paper; we study and evaluate predictive techniques for graphquery performance prediction. We make several contributions.(1) We propose a generallearning framework that makes use of practical and computationally efficient statistics fromquery scenarios and employs regression models.(2) We instantiate the framework with tworoutinely issued query classes; namely; reachability and graph pattern matching; that …,Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Network Data Analytics,2017,1

How to Define Certain Answers.,Leonid Libkin,Abstract The standard way of answering queries over incomplete databases is to computecertain answers; defined as the intersection of query answers on all complete databases thatthe incomplete database represents. But is this universally accepted definition correct? Weargue that this “one-size-fitsall” definition can often lead to counterintuitive or just plainwrong results; and propose an alternative framework for defining certain answers. Wecombine three previously used approaches; based on the semantics and representationsystems; on ordering incomplete databases in terms of their informativeness; and on viewingdatabases as knowledge expressed in a logical language; to come up with a well justifiedand principled notion of certain answers. Using it; we show that for queries satisfying somenatural conditions (like not losing information if a more informative input is given) …,IJCAI,2015,1
Extending graph homomorphism and simulation for real life graph matching,Yinghui Wu,Among the vital problems in a variety of emerging applications is the graph matchingproblem; which is to determine whether two graphs are similar; and if so; find all the validmatches in one graph for the other; based on specified metrics. Traditional graph matchingapproaches are mostly based on graph homomorphism and isomorphism; falling short ofcapturing both structural and semantic similarity in real life applications. Moreover; it ispreferable while difficult to find all matches with high accuracy over complex graphs. Worsestill; the graph structures in real life applications constantly bear modifications.

Percolator: Scalable Pattern Discovery in Dynamic Graphs,Sutanay Choudhury; Sumit Purohit; Peng Lin; Yinghui Wu; Lawrence Holder; Khushbu Agarwal,Abstract We demonstrate\perco; a distributed system for graph pattern discovery in dynamicgraphs. In contrast to conventional mining systems; Percolator advocates efficient patternmining schemes that (1) support pattern detection with keywords;(2) integrate incrementaland parallel pattern mining; and (3) support analytical queries such as trend analysis. Thecore idea of\perco is to dynamically decide and verify a small fraction of patterns and theirinstances that must be inspected in response to buffered updates in dynamic graphs; with atotal mining cost independent of graph size. We demonstrate a (the feasibility of incrementalpattern mining by walking through each component of\perco; b) the efficiency and scalabilityof\perco over the sheer size of real-world dynamic graphs; and c) how the user-friendly\guiof\perco interacts with users to support keyword-based queries that detect; browse and …,Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2018,*
Discovering Graph Temporal Association Rules,Mohammad Hossein Namaki; Yinghui Wu; Qi Song; Peng Lin; Tingjian Ge,ABSTRACT Detecting regularities between complex events in temporal graphs is critical foremerging applications. This paper proposes graph temporal association rules (GTAR). AGTAR extends traditional association rules to discover temporal associations for complexevents captured by a class of temporal pattern queries. We introduce notions of support andcon dence for GTARs; and formalize the discovery problem for GTARs. We show that despitethe enhanced expressive power; GTARs discovery is feasible over large temporal graphs.We develop an e ective rule discovery algorithm; which integrates event mining and rulediscovery as a single process; and reduces the redundant computation by leveraging theirinteraction. Using real-life and synthetic data; we experimentally verify the e ectiveness andscalability of the algorithms. Our case study also veri es that GTARs demonstrate highly …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2017,*

Method and apparatus for association rules with graph patterns,*,Graph pattern association rules (GPARs) are proposed for social media marketing.Extending association rules for item-sets; GPARs help discover regularities between entitiesin social graphs; and identify potential customers by exploring social influence. The problemof discovering top-k diversified GPARs is NP-hard. A parallel algorithm is thus disclosed withaccuracy bound. A parallel scalable algorithm is further disclosed that guarantees apolynomial speedup over sequential algorithms with the increase of processors.,*,2017,*
GRAPE: Conducting Parallel Graph Computations without Developing Parallel Algorithms,Wenfei Fan; Jingbo Xu; Xiaojian Luo; Yinghui Wu; Wenyuan Yu; Ruiqi Xu,Abstract Developing parallel graph algorithms with correctness guarantees is nontrivial evenfor experienced programmers. Is it possible to parallelize existing sequential graphalgorithms; without recasting the algorithms into a parallel model? Better yet; can theparallelization guarantee to converge at correct answers as long as the sequentialalgorithms provided are correct? GRAPE tackles these questions; to make parallel graphcomputations accessible to a large group of users. This paper presents (a) the parallelmodel of GRAPE; based on partial evaluation and incremental computation; and (b) aperformance study; showing that GRAPE achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art systems.,*,2017,*
Data Engineering,Eui-Hong Han; George Karypis; Vipin Kumar; Bamshad Mobasher; Claudio Bettini; X Sean Wang; Sushil Jajodia,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) are rapidly evolving areas ofresearch that are at the intersection of several disciplines; including statistics; databases;pattern recognition/AI; optimization; visualization; and high-performance and parallelcomputing. The increased recent attention is primarily because many more people nowhave “databases”. This is turn is driven by two factors: the ever decreasing cost of computersand storage media; and the success of database systems in becoming a mainstay of manyactivities in business; science; and government. With the widespread use of databases andthe explosive growth in their sizes; individuals and organizations are faced with the problemof making use of this data. Traditionally;“use” of data has been limited to querying a reliablestore via some well-circumscribed application or canned report-generating entity. While …,*,1997,*
Event Pattern Discovery by Keywords in Graph Streams,Mohammad Hossein Namaki; Peng Lin; Yinghui Wu,Abstract—Given an evolving network and a set of userspecified keywords; how to discoverand maintain the active events specified by the keywords? In this paper; we study theproblem of event pattern discovery by keywords in graph streams.(1) We propose a class ofevent patterns to captures events relevant to user-specified keywords; by integrating(approximate) topological and value bindings from keywords. We also introduce anactiveness measure; to balance the pattern expressiveness and the cost of patterndiscovery.(2) We develop both from-scratch and incremental algorithms to discover andmaintain active events in graph streams.(a) We show that it is feasible to discover eventpatterns in large graph streams from scratch; by extending constrained pattern mining with,*,*,*
Improving Graph Querying Usability,Yinghui Wu,Among the vital issues to make big graphs useful is graph searching. Generally speaking;given a query and a large data graph; graph searching computes best answers for the queryfrom the data graph. Two real-life examples are Google's Knowledge graph search overentire Web graph1; and Facebook's Graph Search over social networks2. Nevertheless;searching heterogeneous graph data; such as knowledge graphs; is a challenging task fornon-professional users. Due to the complex schemas and variational information; itbecomes very hard for users to formulate queries that can be properly processed by existingsystems. Traditional keyword queries are of high usability; but also come with highambiguity. On the other hand; structured graph query languages (such as SPARQL) providemore specified semantics by supporting relationships; but are hard to write for end users …,*,*,*
BEAMS: Bounded Event Detection over Graph Streams,Mohammad Hossein Namaki; Keyvan Sasani; Yinghui Wu; Tingjian Ge,Abstract—This demo presents BEAMS; a system that automatically discovers and monitorstop-k complex events over graph streams. Unlike conventional event detection over streamsof items; BEAMS is able to (1) characterize and detect complex events in dynamic networksas graph patterns; and (2) perform online event discovery with a class of boundedalgorithms that compute changes to top-k events in response to the transactions in graphstreams; and incurs a minimized time cost determined by the changes; independent of thesize of graph streams. We demonstrate: a) how BEAMS identifies top-k complex events asgraph patterns in graph streams; and supports ad-hoc event queries online; b) how it copeswith the sheer size of realworld graph streams by supporting bounded event detection andmaintenance algorithm; and c) how the GUI of BEAMS interacts with users to help them …,*,*,*

WENFEI FAN; Informatics; University of Edinburgh & RCBD and SKLSDE Lab; Beihang University XIN WANG; Informatics; University of Edinburgh & Southwest Jiaot...,YINGHUI WU,Graph pattern matching is commonly used in a variety of emerging applications such associal network analysis. These applications highlight the need for studying the following twoissues. First; graph pattern matching is traditionally defined in terms of subgraphisomorphism or graph simulation. These notions; however; often impose too strong atopological constraint on graphs to identify meaningful matches. Second; in practice a graphis typically large; and is frequently updated with small changes. It is often prohibitivelyexpensive to recompute matches starting from scratch via batch algorithms when the graphis updated. This paper studies these two issues.(1) We propose to define graph patternmatching based on a notion of bounded simulation; which extends graph simulation byspecifying the connectivity of nodes in a graph within a predefined number of hops.
