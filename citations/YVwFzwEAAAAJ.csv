XPath: looking forward,Dan Olteanu; Holger Meuss; Tim Furche; François Bry,Abstract The location path language XPath is of particular importance for XML applicationssince it is a core component of many XML processing standards such as XSLT or XQuery. Inthis paper; based on axis symmetry of XPath; equivalences of XPath 1.0 location pathsinvolving reverse axes; such as anc and prec; are established. These equivalences areused as rewriting rules in an algorithm for transforming location paths with reverse axes intoequivalent reverse-axis-free ones. Location paths without reverse axes; as generated by thepresented rewriting algorithm; enable efficient SAX-like streamed data processing of XPath.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2002,302
Web and semantic web query languages: A survey,James Bailey; François Bry; Tim Furche; Sebastian Schaffert,Abstract A number of techniques have been developed to facilitate powerful data retrieval onthe Web and Semantic Web. Three categories of Web query languages can bedistinguished; according to the format of the data they can retrieve: XML; RDF and TopicMaps. This article introduces the spectrum of languages falling into these categories andsummarises their salient aspects. The languages are introduced using common sample dataand query types. Key aspects of the query languages considered are stressed in aconclusion.,Proceedings of the First international conference on Reasoning Web,2005,131
RDF querying: Language constructs and evaluation methods compared,Tim Furche; Benedikt Linse; François Bry; Dimitris Plexousakis; Georg Gottlob,Abstract This article is firstly an introduction into query languages for the Semantic Web;secondly an in-depth comparison of the languages introduced. Only RDF query languagesare considered because; as of the writing of this paper; query languages for other SemanticWeb data modeling formalisms; especially OWL; are still an open research issue; and only avery small number of; furthermore incomplete; proposals for querying Semantic Web datamodeled after other formalisms than RDF exist. The limitation to a few RDF query languagesis motivated both by the objective of an in-depth comparison of the languages addressedand by space limitations. During the three years before the writing of this article; more thanthree dozen proposals for RDF query languages have been published! Not only such alarge number; but also the often immature nature of the proposals makes the focus on few …,Reasoning Web International Summer School,2006,75
OXPath: A language for scalable data extraction; automation; and crawling on the deep web,Tim Furche; Georg Gottlob; Giovanni Grasso; Christian Schallhart; Andrew Sellers,Abstract The evolution of the web has outpaced itself: A growing wealth of information andincreasingly sophisticated interfaces necessitate automated processing; yet existingautomation and data extraction technologies have been overwhelmed by this very growth.To address this trend; we identify four key requirements for web data extraction; automation;and (focused) web crawling:(1) interact with sophisticated web application interfaces;(2)precisely capture the relevant data to be extracted;(3) scale with the number of visitedpages; and (4) readily embed into existing web technologies. We introduce OXPath as anextension of XPath for interacting with web applications and extracting data thus revealed—matching all the above requirements. OXPath's page-at-a-time evaluation guaranteesmemory use independent of the number of visited pages; yet remains polynomial in time …,The VLDB Journal,2013,66
Querying the web reconsidered: Design principles for versatile web query languages,François Bry; Christoph Koch; Tim Furche; Sebastian Schaffert; Liviu Badea; Sacha Berger,Abstract A decade of experience with research proposals as well as standardized querylanguages for the conventional Web and the recent emergence of query languages for theSemantic Web call for a reconsideration of design principles for Web and Semantic Webquery languages. This chapter first argues that a new generation of versatile Web querylanguages is needed for solving the challenges posed by the changing Web: We callversatile those query languages able to cope with both Web and Semantic Web dataexpressed in any (Web or Semantic Web) markup language. This chapter further suggeststhat well-known referential transparency and novel answer-closedness are essentialfeatures of versatile query languages. Indeed; they allow queries to be considered like formsand answers like form-fillings in the spirit of the query-by-example paradigm.

The XML stream query processor SPEX,François Bry; Fatih Coskun; Serap Durmaz; Tim Furche; Dan Olteanu; Markus Spannagel,Data streams are an emerging technology for data dissemination in cases where the datathroughput or size makes it unfeasible to rely on the conventional approach based onstoring the data before processing it. SPEX evaluates XPath queries against XML datastreams. SPEX is built upon formal frameworks for (1) rewriting XPath queries intoequivalent XPath queries without reverse axes and (2) correct query evaluation withpolynomial combined complexity using networks of pushdown transducers. Suchtransducers are simple; independent; and can be connected in a flexible manner; thusallowing not only easy extensions but also extensive query optimization. Querying XMLstreams with SPEX consists in four steps: first; the input XPath query is rewritten into anXPath query without reverse axes. Second; the forward XPath query is compiled into a …,Data Engineering; 2005. ICDE 2005. Proceedings. 21st International Conference on,2005,46
DIADEM: domain-centric; intelligent; automated data extraction methodology,Tim Furche; Georg Gottlob; Giovanni Grasso; Omer Gunes; Xiaoanan Guo; Andrey Kravchenko; Giorgio Orsi; Christian Schallhart; Andrew Sellers; Cheng Wang,Abstract Search engines are the sinews of the web. These sinews have become strained;however: Where the web's function once was a mix of library and yellow pages; it hasbecome the central marketplace for information of almost any kind. We search more andmore for objects with specific characteristics; a car with a certain mileage; an affordableapartment close to a good school; or the latest accessory for our phones. Search engines alltoo often fail to provide reasonable answers; making us sift through dozens of websites withthousands of offers--never to be sure a better offer isn't just around the corner. What searchengines are missing is understanding of the objects and their attributes published onwebsites. Automatically identifying and extracting these objects is akin to alchemy:transforming unstructured web information into highly structured data with near perfect …,Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on World Wide Web,2012,43
An efficient single-pass query evaluator for XML data streams,Dan Olteanu; Tim Furche; François Bry,Abstract Data streams might be preferable to data stored in memory in contexts where thedata is too large or volatile; or a standard approach to data processing based on dataparsing and/or storing is too time or space consuming. Emerging applications such aspublish-subscribe systems; data monitoring in sensor networks [6]; financial and trafficmonitoring; and routing of MPEG-7 [7] call for querying data streams. In many suchapplications; XML streams are arguably more appropriate than flat data streams; for XMLdata is record-like; though not precluding multiple occurrences of fields with the same name.Evaluating selection queries against XML streams is especially challenging because XMLdata is structured (like records) and might have unbounded size. This paper proposes anefficient single-pass evaluator of XPath queries against XML data streams unbounded …,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2004,41
Foundations of rule-based query answering,François Bry; Norbert Eisinger; Thomas Eiter; Tim Furche; Georg Gottlob; Clemens Ley; Benedikt Linse; Reinhard Pichler; Fang Wei,Abstract This survey article introduces into the essential concepts and methods underlyingrule-based query languages. It covers four complementary areas: declarative semanticsbased on adaptations of mathematical logic; operational semantics; complexity andexpressive power; and optimisation of query evaluation. The treatment of these areas isfoundation-oriented; the foundations having resulted from over four decades of research inthe logic programming and database communities on combinations of query languages andrules. These results have later formed the basis for conceiving; improving; and implementingseveral Web and Semantic Web technologies; in particular query languages such asXQuery or SPARQL for querying relational; XML; and RDF data; and rule languages like the"Rule Interchange Framework (RIF)" currently being developed in a working group of the …,Proceedings of the Third international summer school conference on Reasoning Web,2007,40
Deqa: deep web extraction for question answering,Jens Lehmann; Tim Furche; Giovanni Grasso; Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo; Christian Schallhart; Andrew Sellers; Christina Unger; Lorenz Bühmann; Daniel Gerber; Konrad Höffner; David Liu; Sören Auer,Abstract Despite decades of effort; intelligent object search remains elusive. Neither searchengine nor semantic web technologies alone have managed to provide usable systems forsimple questions such as “find me a flat with a garden and more than two bedrooms near asupermarket.” We introduce deqa; a conceptual framework that achieves this elusive goalthrough combining state-of-the-art semantic technologies with effective data extraction. Tothat end; we apply deqa; to the UK real estate domain and show that it can answer asignificant percentage of such questions correctly. deqa achieves this by mapping naturallanguage questions to Sparql patterns. These patterns are then evaluated on an RDFdatabase of current real estate offers. The offers are obtained using OXPath; a state-of-the-art data extraction system; on the major agencies in the Oxford area and linked through …,International Semantic Web Conference,2012,37
Evaluating complex queries against XML streams with polynomial combined complexity,Dan Olteanu; Tim Furche; François Bry,Abstract Querying XML streams is receiving much attention due to its growing range ofapplications from traffic monitoring to routing of media streams. Existing approaches toquerying XML streams consider restricted query language fragments; in most cases withexponential worst-case complexity in the size of the query. This paper gives correctness andcomplexity results for a query evaluator against XML streams called SPEX [8]. Its combinedcomplexity is shown to be polynomial in the size of the data and the query. Extensiveexperimental evaluation with a prototype confirms the theoretical complexity results.,British National Conference on Databases,2004,36
DIADEM: thousands of websites to a single database,Tim Furche; Georg Gottlob; Giovanni Grasso; Xiaonan Guo; Giorgio Orsi; Christian Schallhart; Cheng Wang,Abstract The web is overflowing with implicitly structured data; spread over hundreds ofthousands of sites; hidden deep behind search forms; or siloed in marketplaces; onlyaccessible as HTML. Automatic extraction of structured data at the scale of thousands ofwebsites has long proven elusive; despite its central role in the" web of data". Through anextensive evaluation spanning over 10000 web sites from multiple application domains; weshow that automatic; yet accurate full-site extraction is no longer a distant dream. diadem isthe first automatic full-site extraction system that is able to extract structured data fromdifferent domains at very high accuracy.

Opal: automated form understanding for the deep web,Tim Furche; Georg Gottlob; Giovanni Grasso; Xiaonan Guo; Giorgio Orsi; Christian Schallhart,Abstract Forms are our gates to the web. They enable us to access the deep content of websites. Automatic form understanding unlocks this content for applications ranging fromcrawlers to meta-search engines and is essential for improving usability and accessibility ofthe web. Form understanding has received surprisingly little attention other than ascomponent in specific applications such as crawlers. No comprehensive approach to formunderstanding exists and previous works disagree even in the definition of the problem. Inthis paper; we present OPAL; the first comprehensive approach to form understanding. Weidentify form labeling and form interpretation as the two main tasks involved in formunderstanding. On both problems OPAL pushes the state of the art: For form labeling; itcombines signals from the text; structure; and visual rendering of a web page; yielding …,Proceedings of the 21st international conference on World Wide Web,2012,25
A RPL through RDF: expressive navigation in RDF graphs,Harald Zauner; Benedikt Linse; Tim Furche; François Bry,Abstract RPL (pronounced “ripple”) is the most expressive path language for navigating inRDF graphs proposed to date that can still be evaluated with polynomial combinedcomplexity. RPL is a lean language well-suited for integration into RDF rule languages. Thisintegration enables a limited form of recursion for traversing RDF paths of unknown length atalmost no additional cost over conjunctive triple patterns. We demonstrate the power; ease;and efficiency of RPL with two applications on top of the RPL Web interface. Thedemonstrator implements RPL by transformation to extended nested regular expressions(NREs). For these extended NREs we have implemented an evaluation algorithm withpolynomial data complexity. To the best of our knowledge; this demo is the firstimplementation of NREs (or similarly expressive RDF path languages) with this …,International Conference on Web Reasoning and Rule Systems,2010,25
Xcerpt and visxcerpt: Twin query languages for the semantic web,Sacha Berger; François Bry; Oliver Bolzer; Tim Furche; Sebastian Schaffert; Christoph Wieser,Abstract Query and transformation languages such as XPath; XQuery and XSLT haveevolved to standard development tools for Web applications. Arguably those languages arenot fully suited for Semantic Web applications. The query and transformation languagesXcerpt and visXcerpt have been conceived with both Standard Web and Semantic Webapplications in mind. They are twin languages both based on the same paradigms andprinciples. Xcerpt realizes these paradigms and principles textually; visXcerpt visually. Amixed standard Web and Semantic Web application scenario implemented in Xcerpt andvisXcerpt is presented. Xcerpt and visXcerpt are ongoing research projects; A prototypicimplementation of Xcerpt is publicly available (licensed under GPL) at http://www. xcerpt.org.

RDFLog: It's like Datalog for RDF,François Bry; Tim Furche; Clemens Ley; Benedikt Linse; Bruno Marnette,Abstract: RDF data is set apart from relational or XML data by its support of rich existentialinformation in the form of blank nodes. Where SQL null values are always scoped over asingle statement; blank nodes in RDF can span over any number of statements and thus canbe seen as existentially quantified variables scoped over conjunctions of RDF triples. ForRDF querying blank node querying is considered in most query languages; but blank nodeconstruction; ie; the introduction of new blank nodes has been mostly ignored (eg; in Triple)or treated in a very limited form (eg; in SPARQL). In this paper; we classify three kinds ofblank node in RDF query languages and introduce the recursive; rule-based RDF querylanguage RDFLog. RDFLog is the first RDF query languages with full arbitrary quantifieralternation: blank nodes may occur in the scope of all; some; or none of the universal …,Workshop on (Constraint) Logic Programming,2008,23

Survey over existing query and transformation languages,Tim Furche; François Bry; Sebastian Schaffert; Renzo Orsini; Ian Horrocks; Michael Kraus; Oliver Bolzer,Abstract A widely acknowledged obstacle for realizing the vision of the Semantic Web is theinability of many current Semantic Web approaches to cope with data available in suchdiverging representation formalisms as XML; RDF; or Topic Maps. A common querylanguage is the first step to allow transparent access to data in any of these formats. Tofurther the understanding of the requirements and approaches proposed for querylanguages in the conventional as well as the Semantic Web; this report surveys a largenumber of query languages for accessing XML; RDF; or Topic Maps. This is the firstsystematic survey to consider query languages from all these areas. From the detailedsurvey of these query languages; a common classification scheme is derived that is usefulfor understanding and differentiating languages within and among all three areas.,*,2004,19
Little knowledge rules the web: Domain-centric result page extraction,Tim Furche; Georg Gottlob; Giovanni Grasso; Giorgio Orsi; Christian Schallhart; Cheng Wang,Abstract Web extraction is the task of turning unstructured HTML into structured data.Previous approaches rely exclusively on detecting repeated structures in result pages.These approaches trade intensive user interaction for precision. In this paper; we introducethe Amber (“Adaptable Model-based Extraction of Result Pages”) system that replaces thehuman interaction with a domain ontology applicable to all sites of a domain. It modelsdomain knowledge about (1) records and attributes of the domain;(2) low-level (textual)representations of these concepts; and (3) constraints linking representations to records andattributes.

Once decided; one cannever be sure not to have missed an even better offer which would have been just one clickaway. Form understanding is key to automatically access and process all the relevant---andnowadays readily available---data. We introduce opal (ontology-based web pattern analysiswith logic); a novel; purely logical approach to web form understanding: opal labels;structures; and groups form fields according to a domain-specific ontology linked throughphenomenological rules to a logical representation of a DOM. The phenomenological rulesdescribe how ontological concepts appear on the web; the ontology formalizes andstructures common patterns of web pages observed in a domain. A unique feature of opal isthat all domain-independent assumptions about web forms are represented in rules …,Proceedings of the International Conference on Web Intelligence; Mining and Semantics,2011,18
Efficient evaluation of n-ary conjunctive queries over trees and graphs,François Bry; Tim Furche; Benedikt Linse; Andreas Schroeder,Abstract N-ary conjunctive queries; ie; queries with any number of answer variables; are theformal core of many Web query languages including XSLT; XQuery; SPARQL; and Xcerpt.Despite a considerable body of research on the optimization of such queries over tree-shaped XML data; little attention has been paid so far to efficient access to graph-shapedXML; RDF; or Topic Maps. We propose the first evaluation technique for n-ary conjunctivequeries that applies to both tree-and graph-shaped data and retains the same complexity asthe best known approaches that are restricted to tree-shaped data only. Furthermore; theapproach treats tree and graph-shaped queries uniformly without sacrificing evaluationcomplexity on the restricted query class. The core of the evaluation technique is based ondynamic programming using a memoization data structure; called" memoization matrix".

Implementation of Web Query Languages Reconsidered—Beyond Tree and Single-Language Algebras at (almost) No Cost,Tim Furche,ABSTRACT Visions of the next generation Web such as the “Semantic Web” or the “Web.”have triggered the emergence of a multitude of data formats. ese formats have differentcharacteristics as far as the shape of data is concerned (for example tree-vs. graph-shaped).ey are accompanied by a puzzlingly large number of query languages each limited to onedata format. us; a key feature of the Web; namely to make it possible to access anythingpublished by anyone; is compromised. is thesis is devoted to versatile query languagescapable of accessing data in a variety of Web formats. e issue is addressed from threeangles: language design; common; yet uniform semantics; and common; yet uniformevaluation.

Modular web queries—from rules to stores,Uwe Aßmann; Sacha Berger; François Bry; Tim Furche; Jakob Henriksson; Jendrik Johannes,Abstract Even with all the progress in Semantic technology; accessing Web data remains achallenging issue with new Web query languages and approaches appearing regularly. Yetmost of these languages; including W3C approaches such as XQuery and SPARQL; do littleto cope with the explosion of the data size and schemata diversity and richness on the Web.In this paper we propose a straightforward step toward the improvement of this situation thatis simple to realize and yet effective: Advanced module systems that make partitioning of (a)the evaluation and (b) the conceptual design of complex Web queries possible. Theyprovide the query programmer with a powerful; but easy to use high-level abstraction forpackaging; encapsulating; and reusing conceptually related parts (in our case; rules) of aWeb query.

Semantic web query languages,James Bailey; François Bry; Tim Furche; Sebastian Schaffert,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}. A query Q is called domain independent if the value of Qwhen applied to any database is the same for any two domains containing the databasevalues or; equivalently; if the value of Q when applied to a database contains only values …,*,2009,13
Data Wrangling for Big Data: Challenges and Opportunities.,Tim Furche; Georg Gottlob; Leonid Libkin; Giorgio Orsi; Norman W Paton,ABSTRACT Data wrangling is the process by which the data required by an application isidentified; extracted; cleaned and integrated; to yield a data set that is suitable forexploration and analysis. Although there are widely used Extract; Transform and Load (ETL)techniques and platforms; they often require manual work from technical and domainexperts at different stages of the process. When confronted with the 4 V's of big data(volume; velocity; variety and veracity); manual intervention may make ETL prohibitivelyexpensive. This paper argues that providing cost-effective; highly-automated approaches todata wrangling involves significant research challenges; requiring fundamental changes toestablished areas such as data extraction; integration and cleaning; and to the ways inwhich these areas are brought together.

Visual OXPath: robust wrapping by example,Jochen Kranzdorf; Andrew Sellers; Giovanni Grasso; Christian Schallhart; Tim Furche,Abstract Good examples are hard to find; particularly in wrapper induction: Picking even onewrong example can spell disaster by yielding overgeneralized or overspecialized wrappers.Such wrappers extract data with low precision or recall; unless adjusted by human experts atsignificant cost. Visual OXPath is an open-source; visual wrapper induction system thatrequires minimal examples and eases wrapper refinement: Often it derives the intendedwrapper from a single example through sophisticated heuristics that determine the best setof similar examples. To ease wrapper refinement; it offers a list of wrappers ranked byexample similarity and robustness. Visual OXPath offers extensive visual feedback for thisrefinement which can be performed without any knowledge of the underlying wrapperlanguage.

SPARQLog: SPARQL with rules and quantification,François Bry; Tim Furche; Bruno Marnette; Clemens Ley; Benedikt Linse; Olga Poppe,Abstract SPARQL has become the gold-standard for RDF query languages. Nevertheless;we believe there is further room for improving RDF query languages. In this chapter; weinvestigate the addition of rules and quantifier alternation to SPARQL. That extension; calledSPARQLog; extends previous RDF query languages by arbitrary quantifier alternation: blanknodes may occur in the scope of all; some; or none of the universal variables of a rule. Inaddition; SPARQLog is aware of important RDF features such as the distinction betweenblank nodes; literals and IRIs or the RDFS vocabulary. The semantics of SPARQLog isclosed (every answer is an RDF graph); but lifts RDF's restrictions on literal and blank nodeoccurrences for intermediary data.

Automatically learning gazetteers from the deep web,Tim Furche; Giovanni Grasso; Giorgio Orsi; Christian Schallhart; Cheng Wang,Abstract Wrapper induction faces a dilemma: To reach web scale; it requires automaticallygenerated examples; but to produce accurate results; these examples must have the qualityof human annotations. We resolve this conflict with AMBER; a system for fully automateddata extraction from result pages. In contrast to previous approaches; AMBER employsdomain specific gazetteers to discern basic domain attributes on a page; and leveragesrepeated occurrences of similar attributes to group related attributes into records rather thanrelying on the noisy structure of the DOM. With this approach AMBER is able to identifyrecords and their attributes with almost perfect accuracy (> 98%) on a large sample ofwebsites. To make such an approach feasible at scale; AMBER automatically learns domaingazetteers from a small seed set.

How the Minotaur turned into Ariadne: ontologies in Web data extraction,Tim Furche; Georg Gottlob; Xiaonan Guo; Christian Schallhart; Andrew Sellers; Cheng Wang,Abstract Humans require automated support to profit from the wealth of data nowadaysavailable on the web. To that end; the linked open data initiative and others have beenasking data providers to publish structured; semantically annotated data. Small dataproviders; such as most UK real-estate agencies; however; are overburdened with this task—often just starting to move from simple; table-or list-like directories to web applications withrich interfaces. We argue that fully automated extraction of structured data can help resolvethis dilemma. Ironically; automated data extraction has seen a recent revival thanks toontologies and linked open data to guide data extraction. First results from the DIADEMproject illustrate that high quality; fully automated data extraction at a web scale is possible;if we combine domain ontologies with a phenomenology describing the representation of …,International Conference on Web Engineering,2011,10

Quo vadis; web queries,Klara Weiand; Tim Furche; François Bry,Abstract—Various query languages for Web and Semantic Web data; both for practical useand as an area of research in the scientific community; have emerged in recent years. At thesame time; the broad adoption of the internet where keyword search is used in manyapplications; eg search engines; has familiarized casual users with using keyword queriesto retrieve information on the internet. Unlike this easy-to-use querying; traditional querylanguages require knowledge of the language itself as well as of the data to be queried.Keyword-based query languages for XML and RDF bridge the gap between the two; aimingat enabling simple querying of semi-structured data; which is relevant eg in the context of theemerging Semantic Web.

Marriages of convenience: Triples and graphs; RDF and XML in Web querying,Tim Furche; François Bry; Oliver Bolzer,Abstract Metadata processing is recognized as a central challenge for database research inthe next decade. Already; novel desktop data management and search applications (cf.Apple's Spotlight and Microsoft's WinFS) are enabled by rich metadata. Efficient andeffective access to such data becomes a crucial issue for more and more applicationscenarios. In this article; we focus on metadata represented in RDF. A number of querylanguages for RDF have been presented in recent years. This article argues that most ofthese approaches fail to address properly two core issues: the provision of rich operatorsand constructs to adequately support RDF's graph data model and the ability to intertwineaccess to metadata (in RDF format) and data (in XML format).

pest: Fast approximate keyword search in semantic data using eigenvector-based term propagation,Klara Weiand; Fabian Kneißl; Tim Furche; François Bry,Abstract We present pest; a novel approach to the approximate querying of graph-structureddata such as RDF that exploits the data's structure to propagate term weights betweenrelated data items. We focus on data where meaningful answers are given through theapplication semantics; eg; pages in wikis; persons in social networks; or papers in aresearch network such as Mendeley. The pest matrix generalizes the Google Matrix used inPageRank with a term-weight dependent leap and accommodates different levels of(semantic) closeness for different relations in the data; eg; friend vs. co-worker in a socialnetwork. Its eigenvectors represent the distribution of a term after propagation. Theeigenvectors for all terms together form a (vector space) index that takes the structure of thedata into account and can be used with standard document retrieval techniques.

Simulation subsumption is crucial ingeneral for query optimization; in particular for optimizing pattern-based search engines;and for the termination of recursive rule-based web languages such as the XML and RDFquery language Xcerpt. This paper first motivates and formalizes simulation subsumption.Then; it establishes decidability of simulation subsumption for advanced query patternsfeaturing descendant constructs; regular expressions; negative subterms (or subtermexclusions); and multiple variable occurrences. Finally; we show that subsumption betweentwo query terms can be decided in O(n!^n) where n is the sum of the sizes of both query …,International Conference on Web Reasoning and Rule Systems,2008,9
Optimizing multiple queries against XML streams,Tim Furche,Abstract Processing and querying streams; XML streams in particular; has recently becomea widely recognized area of interest both in research and in industry. In contrast to traditionalquery evaluation for databases; where multiple queries against the same data can beevaluated sequentially; for a streamed environment only the simultaneous execution ofmultiple queries is feasible; as the sequential evaluation requires multiple passes over thestream. This work presents an overview of techniques for optimizing multiple queries posedagainst a stream of XML data. Building upon the SPEX query engine [79; 105]; the problemhow to find a cost-optimal query plan that allows the simultaneous evaluation of multiplequeries against the same stream is presented and shown to be not only hard to solve butalso hard to approximate; if arbitrary parts; and not only common prefixes as in previous …,Diplomar-beit/diploma thesis; Institute of Computer Science; LMU; Munich,2003,9
G-Store: a storage manager for graph data,Robin Steinhaus; Dan Olteanu; Tim Furche,ABSTRACT Graph data is ubiquitous: Social networks; Semantic Web; pointer analysis insoftware engineering; and biological and chemical networks all rely on a graphrepresentation of data. This paper makes the case for a native storage layer for graph data;rather than relying on relational or columnar stores. We propose a lightweight storagemanager for graph data called G-Store. It exploits the structure of the graph for placement ofdata in pages that is optimized for a wide range of access patterns found in graph queries.Our placement approach partitions the data into pages using a multilevel partitioningalgorithm and arranges the pages on disk to minimize the distance on disk betweenadjacent vertices. Initial experiments show that G-Store can outperform existing graphdatabase solutions by orders of magnitude. We believe that these results justify a …,*,2010,8
The perfect match: RPL and RDF rule languages,François Bry; Tim Furche; Benedikt Linse,Abstract Path query languages have been previously shown to complement RDF rulelanguages in a natural way and have been used as a means to implement the RDFSderivation rules. RPL is a novel path query language specifically designed to beincorporated with RDF rules and comes in three flavors: Node-; edge-and path-flavoredexpressions allow to express conditional regular expressions over the nodes; edges; ornodes and edges appearing on paths within RDF graphs. Providing regular stringexpressions and negation; RPL is more expressive than other RDF path languages thathave been proposed. We give a compositional semantics for RPL and show that it can beevaluated efficiently; while several possible extensions of it cannot.,International Conference on Web Reasoning and Rule Systems,2009,8
Data model and query constructs for versatile web query languages: State-of-the-art and challenges for Xcerpt,François Bry; Tim Furche; Benedikt Linse,Abstract As the Semantic Web is gaining momentum; the need for truly versatile querylanguages becomes increasingly apparent. A Web query language is called versatile if itcan access in the same query program data in different formats (eg XML and RDF). Mostquery languages are not versatile: they have not been specifically designed to cope withboth worlds; providing a uniform language and common constructs to query and transformdata in various formats. Moreover; most mainstream query languages do not provide aflexible data model that is powerful enough to naturally convey both Semantic Web dataformats (especially RDF and Topic Maps) and XML. This article highlights challengesrelated to the data model and language constructs for querying both standard Web andSemantic Web data with an emphasis on facilitating sophisticated reasoning. It is shown …,International Workshop on Principles and Practice of Semantic Web Reasoning,2006,8

Turn the page: automated traversal of paginated websites,Tim Furche; Giovanni Grasso; Andrey Kravchenko; Christian Schallhart,Abstract Content-intensive web sites; such as Google or Amazon; paginate their results toaccommodate limited screen sizes. Thus; human users and automatic tools alike have totraverse the pagination links when they crawl the site; extract data; or automate commontasks; where these applications require access to the entire result set. Previous approaches;as well as existing crawlers and automation tools; rely on simple heuristics (eg; consideringonly the link text); falling back to an exhaustive exploration of the site where those heuristicsfail. In particular; focused crawlers and data extraction systems target only fractions of theindividual pages of a given site; rendering a highly accurate identification of pagination linksessential to avoid the exhaustive exploration of irrelevant pages. We identify pagination linksin a wide range of domains and sites with near perfect accuracy (99%). We obtain these …,International Conference on Web Engineering,2012,7
Not so creepy crawler: easy crawler generation with standard XML queries,Franziska Von Dem Bussche; Klara Weiand; Benedikt Linse; Tim Furche; François Bry,Abstract Web crawlers are increasingly used for focused tasks such as the extraction of datafrom Wikipedia or the analysis of social networks like last. fm. In these cases; pages are farmore uniformly structured than in the general Web and thus crawlers can use the structure ofWeb pages for more precise data extraction and more expressive analysis. In thisdemonstration; we present a focused; structure-based crawler generator; the" Not so CreepyCrawler"(nc2). What sets nc2 apart; is that all analysis and decision tasks of the crawlingprocess are delegated to an (arbitrary) XML query engine such as XQuery or Xcerpt.Customizing crawlers just means writing (declarative) XML queries that can access thecurrently crawled document as well as the metadata of the crawl process. We identify fourtypes of queries that together sufice to realize a wide variety of focused crawlers.,Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web,2010,7
Four lessons in versatility or how query languages adapt to the web,François Bry; Tim Furche; Benedikt Linse; Alexander Pohl; Antonius Weinzierl; Olga Yestekhina,Abstract Exposing not only human-centered information; but machine-processable data onthe Web is one of the commonalities of recent Web trends. It has enabled a new kind ofapplications and businesses where the data is used in ways not foreseen by the dataproviders. Yet this exposition has fractured the Web into islands of data; each in differentWeb formats: Some providers choose XML; others RDF; again others JSON or OWL; for theirdata; even in similar domains. This fracturing stifles innovation as application builders haveto cope not only with one Web stack (eg; XML technology) but with several ones; each ofconsiderable complexity. With Xcerpt we have developed a rule-and pattern based querylanguage that aims to give shield application builders from much of this complexity: In asingle query language XML and RDF data can be accessed; processed; combined; and …,*,2009,7

Wadar: joint wrapper and data repair,Stefano Ortona; Giorgio Orsi; Marcello Buoncristiano; Tim Furche,Abstract Web scraping (or wrapping) is a popular means for acquiring data from the web.Recent advancements have made scalable wrapper-generation possible and enabled dataacquisition processes involving thousands of sources. This makes wrapper analysis andmaintenance both needed and challenging as no scalable tools exists that support thesetasks. We demonstrate WADaR; a scalable and highly automated tool for joint wrapper anddata repair. WADaR uses off-the-shelf entity recognisers to locate target entities in wrapper-generated data. Markov chains are used to determine structural repairs; that are thenencoded into suitable repairs for both the data and corresponding wrappers.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,6

Bitemporal complex event processing of web event advertisements,Tim Furche; Giovanni Grasso; Michael Huemer; Christian Schallhart; Michael Schrefl,Abstract The web is the largest bulletin board of the world. Events of all types; from flightarrivals to business meetings; are announced on this board. Tracking and reacting to suchevent announcements; however; is a tedious manual task; only slightly alleviated by email orsimilar notifications. Announcements are published with human readers in mind; andupdates or delayed announcements are frequent. These characteristics have hamperedattempts at automatic tracking. PeaCE provides the first integrated framework for eventprocessing on top of web event ads. Given a schema of events to be tracked; the frameworkpopulates this schema through compact wrappers for event announcement sources. Thesewrappers produce events including updates and retractions.

Amber: Automatic supervision for multi-attribute extraction,Tim Furche; Georg Gottlob; Giovanni Grasso; Giorgio Orsi; Christian Schallhart; Cheng Wang,Abstract: The extraction of multi-attribute objects from the deep web is the bridge betweenthe unstructured web and structured data. Existing approaches either induce wrappers froma set of human-annotated pages or leverage repeated structures on the page withoutsupervision. What the former lack in automation; the latter lack in accuracy. Thus accurate;automatic multi-attribute object extraction has remained an open challenge. AMBERovercomes both limitations through mutual supervision between the repeated structure andautomatically produced annotations. Previous approaches based on automatic annotationshave suffered from low quality due to the inherent noise in the annotations and haveattempted to compensate by exploring multiple candidate wrappers. In contrast; AMBERcompensates for this noise by integrating repeated structure analysis with annotation …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1210.5984,2012,6
Forms form patterns: reusable form understanding,Tim Furche; Georg Gottlob; Xiaonan Guo; Giorgio Orsi; Christian Schallhart,ABSTRACT Forms are our gates to the web. They enable us to access the deep content ofweb sites. Automatic form understanding unlocks this content for applications ranging fromcrawlers to meta-search engines and is essential for improving usability and accessibility ofthe web. Form understanding has received surprisingly little attention other than ascomponent in specific applications such as crawlers. No comprehensive approach to formunderstanding exists and previous works disagree even in the definition of the problem. Inthis paper; we present OPAL; the first comprehensive approach to form understanding. Weidentify form labeling and form interpretation as the two main tasks involved in formunderstanding. On both problems OPAL pushes the state of the art: For form labeling; itcombines signals from the text; structure; and visual rendering of a web page; yielding …,Proc. WWW,2012,6
OXPath: little language; little memory; great value,Andrew Jon Sellers; Tim Furche; Georg Gottlob; Giovanni Grasso; Christian Schallhart,Abstract Data about everything is readily available on the web-but often only accessiblethrough elaborate user interactions. For automated decision support; extracting that data isessential; but infeasible with existing heavy-weight data extraction systems. In thisdemonstration; we present OXPath; a novel approach to web extraction; with a system thatsupports informed job selection and integrates information from several different web sites.By carefully extending XPath; OXPath exploits its familiarity and provides a light-weightinterface; which is easy to use and embed. We highlight how OXPath guarantees optimalpage buffering; storing only a constant number of pages for non-recursive queries.,Proceedings of the 20th international conference companion on World wide web,2011,6
Taking the OXPath down the deep web,Andrew Sellers; Tim Furche; Georg Gottlob; Giovanni Grasso; Christian Schallhart,Abstract Although deep web analysis has been studied extensively; there is no succinctformalism to describe user interactions with AJAX-enabled web applications. Toward thisend; we introduce OXPath as a superset of XPath 1.0. Beyond XPath; OXPath is able (1) tofill web forms and trigger DOM events;(2) to access dynamically computed CSS attributes;(3)to navigate between visible form fields; and (4) to mark relevant information for extraction.This way; OXPath expressions can closely simulate the human interaction relevant fornavigation rather than rely exclusively on the HTML structure. Thus; they are quite resilientagainst technical changes.,Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2011,6
A generic module system for web rule languages: Divide and rule,Uwe Aßmann; Sacha Berger; François Bry; Tim Furche; Jakob Henriksson; Paula-Lavinia Pătrânjan,Abstract An essential feature in practically usable programming languages is the ability toencapsulate functionality in reusable modules. Modules make large scale projects tractableby humans. For Web and Semantic Web programming; many rule-based languages; egXSLT; CSS; Xcerpt; SWRL; SPARQL; and RIF Core; have evolved or are currently evolving.Rules are easy to comprehend and specify; even for non-technical users; eg businessmanagers; hence easing the contributions to the Web. Unfortunately; those contributions arearguably doomed to exist in isolation as most rule languages are conceived withoutmodularity; hence without an easy mechanism for integration and reuse. In this paper ageneric module system applicable to many rule languages is presented.

OPAL: a passe-partout for web forms,Xiaonan Guo; Jochen Kranzdorf; Tim Furche; Giovanni Grasso; Giorgio Orsi; Christian Schallhart,Abstract Web forms are the interfaces of the deep web. Though modern web browsersprovide facilities to assist in form filling; this assistance is limited to prior form fillings orkeyword matching. Automatic form understanding enables a broad range of applications;including crawlers; meta-search engines; and usability and accessibility support forenhanced web browsing. In this demonstration; we use a novel form understandingapproach; OPAL; to assist in form filling even for complex; previously unknown forms. OPALassociates form labels to fields by analyzing structural properties in the HTML encoding andvisual features of the page rendering. OPAL interprets this labeling and classifies the fieldsaccording to a given domain ontology. The combination of these two properties; allowsOPAL to deal effectively with many forms outside of the grasp of existing form filling …,Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on World Wide Web,2012,5
GRDDLing with Xcerpt: Learn one; get one free!,François Bry; Tim Furche; Alina Hang; Benedikt Linse,In the last years; the Semantic Web has significantly gained momentum; and the amount ofRDF data on the Web has been increasing exponentially ever since the publication of theRDF recommendation. A great amount of this data is intermingled with HTML and XML at thehelp of microformats; embedded RDF and RDF/A. To deal with this situation; the W3C haspublished an editor's draft soliciting a mechanism called GRDDL1; an acronym for GleaningResource Descriptions From Dialects of Languages to the problem of extracting SemanticWeb information from HTML and XML documents. The idea behind GRDLL is to associatean XML document containing embedded RDF information with one or more transformationprograms–which the editor's draft proposes to write in XSLT. These transformation programsare specifically written to extract the RDF information from the document. Moreover; the …,Proc. European Semantic Web Conf.(ESWC),2007,5
AMa χ oS—Abstract Machine for Xcerpt: Architecture and Principles,François Bry; Tim Furche; Benedikt Linse,Abstract Web query languages promise convenient and efficient access to Web data such asXML; RDF; or Topic Maps.

XML Perspectives on RDF Querying: Towards integrated Access to Data and Metadata on the Web.,Tim Furche; François Bry; Oliver Bolzer,Abstract The integral processing of data and metadata is starting to get recognized as acentral challenge for the next decade (eg in Pat Selinger's ICDE 2005 Keynote) not only aspart of realizing the Semantic Web vision; but also on a smaller scale as part of the nextgeneration of desktop data management (cf. Apple's Spotlight and Microsoft's WinFS). In thisarticle; we focus on metadata represented in the W3C's RDF formalism. We illustrate firststeps towards integrating access to RDF metadata and access to standard Web data in XMLformat. For this; two XML views over RDF data are expressed in the query language Xcerptand discussed. These views illustrate two different approaches for integrating RDF metadataprocessing and current data processing techniques.,Grundlagen von Datenbanken,2005,5
Reasoning and ontologies in data extraction,Sergio Flesca; Tim Furche; Linda Oro,Abstract The web has become a pig sty—everyone dumps information at random places andin random shapes. Try to find the cheapest apartment in Oxford considering rent; travel; taxand heating costs; or a cheap; reasonable reviewed 11” laptop with an SSD drive. Dataextraction flushes structured information out of this sty: It turns mostly unstructured webpages into highly structured knowledge. In this chapter; we give a gentle introduction to dataextraction including pointers to existing systems. We start with an overview and classificationof data extraction systems along two primary dimensions; the level of supervision and theconsidered scale. The rest of the chapter is organized along the major division of theseapproaches into site-specific and supervised versus domain-specific and unsupervised.

Datalog relaunched: Simulation unification and value invention,Fran Bry; Tim Furche; Clemens Ley; Bruno Marnette; Benedikt Linse; Sebastian Schaffert,Abstract For reasoning on the Web; Datalog is lacking data extraction and value invention.This article proposes to overcome these limitations with" simulation unification" and"RDFLog". Simulation unification is a non-standard unification inspired from regular pathqueries. Like standard unification; it yields bindings for variables in both terms to unify.Unlike standard unification; it does not try to make the two terms identical but instead toembed the query into the data. Simulation unification is decidable. Without variables; it haspolynomial complexity. With variables it is; like standard unification; np-complete. We identifya number of interesting special cases of unification; eg; in presence or absence of terminjectivity. In particular; we show that simulation unification without term injectivity on treedata is linear and in presence of injectivity it is still polynomial even on unordered trees in …,Proceedings of the First international conference on Datalog Reloaded,2010,4
Robust and noise resistant wrapper induction,Tim Furche; Jinsong Guo; Sebastian Maneth; Christian Schallhart,Abstract Wrapper induction is the problem of automatically inferring a query from annotatedweb pages of the same template. This query should not only select the annotated contentaccurately but also other content following the same template. Beyond accurately matchingthe template; we consider two additional requirements:(1) wrappers should be robustagainst a large class of changes to the web pages; and (2) the induction process should benoise resistant; ie; tolerate slightly erroneous (eg; machine generated) samples. Key to ourapproach is a query language that is powerful enough to permit accurate selection; butlimited enough to force noisy samples to be generalized into wrappers that select the likelyintended items. We introduce such a language as subset of XPATH and show that even forsuch a restricted language; inducing optimal queries according to a suitable scoring is …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,3
Data wrangling for big data: Towards a lingua franca for data wrangling,Tim Furche; Georg Gottlob; Bernd Neumayr; Emanuel Sallinger,We are dealing with ever growing amounts of data; or as some like to call it; we are at thebeginning of the era of big data. The value gained from the analysis of big data is expectedto be huge. Yet data analytics needs well-organized; clean data to work on. The process oftransforming raw data from various sources into a form suitable for data analytics is calleddata wrangling [15; 12]. It is estimated that up to 80% of the time spent gaining value frombig data is spent on data wrangling as opposed to data analytics itself [20]. Hence; there is aclear need for data wrangling to be more effective. While the term data wrangling is relativelynew; transforming data from one format into another has been a focus of the datamanagement community for many years now. There are systems that handle data extractionvery well [11]. Data integration [19] and data exchange [9] have been studied in detail. We …,*,2016,3
Eager: extending automatically gazetteers for entity recognition,Omer Gunes; Christian Schallhart; Tim Furche; Jens Lehmann; Axel Ngonga,Abstract Key to named entity recognition; the manual gazetteering of entity lists is a costly;errorprone process that often yields results that are incomplete and suffer from samplingbias. Exploiting current sources of structured information; we propose a novel method forextending minimal seed lists into complete gazetteers. Like previous approaches; we valueWikipedia as a huge; well-curated; and relatively unbiased source of entities. However; incontrast to previous work; we exploit not only its content; but also its structure; as exposed inDBPedia. We extend gazetteers through Wikipedia categories; carefully limiting the impactof noisy categorizations. The resulting gazetteers easily outperform previous approaches onnamed entity recognition.,Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on the People's Web Meets NLP: Collaboratively Constructed Semantic Resources and Their Applications to NLP,2012,3
Labeling RDF graphs for linear time and space querying,Tim Furche; Antonius Weinzierl; François Bry,Abstract Indices and data structures for web querying have mostly considered tree shapeddata; reflecting the view of XML documents as tree-shaped. However; for RDF (and whenquerying ID/IDREF constraints in XML) data is indisputably graph-shaped. In this chapter;we first study existing indexing and labeling schemes for RDF and other graph datawithfocus on support for efficient adjacency and reachability queries. For XML; labeling schemesare an important part of the widespread adoption of XML; in particular for mapping XML toexisting (relational) database technology. However; the existing indexing and labelingschemes for RDF (and graph data in general) sacrifice one of the most attractive propertiesof XML labeling schemes; the constant time (and per-node space) test for adjacency (child)and reachability (descendant). In the second part; we introduce the first labeling scheme …,*,2010,3
Visual Languages: A Matter of Style.,Sacha Berger; François Bry; Tim Furche; Christoph Wieser,Abstract Styling has become a widespread technique with the advent of the Web and of themarkup language XML. With XML; application data can be modeled after the applicationlogic regardless of the intended rendering. Rendering of XML documents is specified usingstyle sheet languages like CSS. Provided the styling language offers the necessarycapabilities; style sheets can similarly specify a visual rendering of modeling andprogramming languages. The approach described in this article considers visual languagesthat can be defined as a 1-to-1 visualization of (an abstract syntax of) a textual language.Though the approach is obviously limited by the employed style sheet language; itsadvantages are manifold:(a) visualization is achieved in a systematic manner from a textualcounterpart which allows the same paradigms to be used in several languages and …,VLL,2007,3
Completing queries: rewriting of incomplete web queries under schema constraints,Sacha Berger; François Bry; Tim Furche; Andreas J Häusler,Abstract Web queries have been and will remain an essential tool for accessing; processing;and; ultimately; reasoning with data on the Web. With the vast data size on the Web andSemantic Web; reducing costs of data transfer and query evaluation for Web queries iscrucial. To reduce costs; it is necessary to narrow the data candidates to query; simplifycomplex queries and reduce intermediate results. This article describes a static approach tooptimization of web queries. We introduce a set of rules which achieves the desiredoptimization by schema and type based query rewriting. The approach consists in usingschema information for removing incompleteness (as expressed by 'descendant'constructsand disjunctions) from queries.

Let’s Mix It: Versatile Access to Web Data in Xcerpt∗,François Bry; Tim Furche; Benedikt Linse,Abstract Applications and services that access Web data are becoming in-creasingly moreuseful and wide-spread. Web query languages provide efficient and effective means toaccess and process data published on the Web. Conventional Web query languages suchas XQuery; XSLT; or SPARQL; however; focus only on one of the dif-ferent data formatsused on the Web and provide little to ease the integration of heterogeneous schemata orrepresentations. Xcerpt is a versatile semi-structured query language; ie; a query languageable to access all kinds of Web data such as XML and RDF in the same language reusingcommon concepts and language constructs. In this article; we demonstrate how Xcerpt'sfeatures ease the in-tegration of data sources that are heterogeneous in (a) data format (eg;XML vs. RDF);(b) schema; and (c) concrete representation (if the schema allows …,*,2006,3

Joint repairs for web wrappers,Stefano Ortona; Giorgio Orsi; Tim Furche; Marcello Buoncristiano,Automated web scraping is a popular means for acquiring data from the web. Scrapers (orwrappers) are derived from either manually or automatically annotated examples; oftenresulting in under/over segmented data; together with missing or spurious content.Automatic repair and maintenance of the extracted data is thus a necessary complement toautomatic wrapper generation. Moreover; the extracted data is often the result of a long-termdata acquisition effort and thus jointly repairing wrappers together with the generated datareduces future needs for data cleaning. We study the problem of computing joint repairs forXPath-based wrappers and their extracted data. We show that the problem is NP-completein general but becomes tractable under a few natural assumptions. Even tractable solutionsto the problem are still impractical on very large datasets; but we propose an optimal …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,2
Structured aspect extraction,Omer Gunes; Tim Furche; Giorgio Orsi,Abstract Aspect extraction identifies relevant features of an entity from a textual descriptionand is typically targeted to product reviews; and other types of short text; as an enabling taskfor; eg; opinion mining and information retrieval. Current aspect extraction methods mostlyfocus on aspect terms; often neglecting associated modifiers or embedding them in theaspect terms without proper distinction. Moreover; flat syntactic structures are oftenassumed; resulting in inaccurate extractions of complex aspects. This paper studies theproblem of structured aspect extraction; a variant of traditional aspect extraction aiming at afine-grained extraction of complex (ie; hierarchical) aspects. We propose an unsupervisedand scalable method for structured aspect extraction consisting of statistical noun phraseclustering; cPMI-based noun phrase segmentation; and hierarchical pattern induction …,Proceedings of COLING 2016; the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers,2016,2
Profound: program-analysis-based form understanding,Michael Benedikt; Tim Furche; Andreas Savvides; Pierre Senellart,Abstract An important feature of web search interfaces are the restrictions enforced on inputvalues-those reflecting either the semantics of the data or requirements specific to theinterface. Both integrity constraints and" access restrictions" can be of great use to webexploration tools. We demonstrate here a novel technique for discovering constraints thatrequires no form submissions whatsoever. We work via statically analyzing the JavaScriptclient-side code used to enforce the constraints; when such code is available. We combinecustom recognizers for JavaScript functions relevant to constraint checking with a genericprogram analysis layer. Integrated with a web browser; our system shows the constraintsdetected on accessed web forms; and allows a user to see the corresponding JavaScriptcode fragment.,Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on World Wide Web,2012,2
Term-specific eigenvector-centrality in multi-relation networks,François Bry; Fabian Kneissl; Klara Weiand; Tim Furche,Fuzzy matching and ranking are two information retrieval techniques widely used in websearch. Their application to structured data; however; remains an open problem. This articleinvestigates how eigenvector-centrality can be used for approximate matching in multi-relation graphs; that is; graphs where connections of many different types may exist. Basedon an extension of the PageRank matrix; eigenvectors representing the distribution of a termafter propagating term weights between related data items are computed. The result is anindex which takes the document structure into account and can be used with standarddocument retrieval techniques. As the scheme takes the shape of an index transformation;all necessary calculations are performed during index time.,International Journal of Social Network Mining,2012,2
KWilt: a semantic patchwork for flexible access to heterogeneous knowledge,Klara Weiand; Steffen Hausmann; Tim Furche; François Bry,Abstract Semantic wikis and other modern knowledge management systems deviate fromtraditional knowledge bases in that information ranges from unstructured (wiki pages) oversemi-formal (tags) to formal (RDF or OWL) and is produced by users with varying levels ofexpertise. KWQL is a query language for semantic wikis that scales with a user's level ofexpertise by combining ideas from keyword query languages with aspects of formal querylanguages such as SPARQL. In this paper; we discuss KWQL's implementation KWilt: Ituses; for each data format and query type; technology tailored to that setting and combines;in a patchwork fashion; information retrieval; structure matching and constraint evaluationtools with only lightweight “glue”.

Web queries: from a web of data to a semantic web,François Bry; Tim Furche; Klara Weiand,Abstract One significant effort towards combining the virtues of Web search; viz. beingaccessible to untrained users and able to cope with vastly heterogeneous data; with those ofdatabase-style Web queries is the development of keyword-based Web query languages.These languages operate essentially in the same setting as XQuery or SPARQL but with aninterface for untrained users. Keyword-based query languages trade some of the precisionthat languages like XQuery enable by allowing to formulate exactly what data to select andhow to process it; for an easier interface accessible to untrained users. The yardstick forthese languages becomes an easily accessible interface that does not sacrifice the essentialpremise of database-style Web queries; that selection and construction are precise enoughto fully automate data processing tasks.

Model theory and entailment rules for rdf containers; collections and reification,François Bry; Tim Furche; Benedikt Linse,Abstract An RDF graph is; at its core; just a set of statements consisting of subjects;predicates and objects. Nevertheless; since its inception practitioners have asked for richerdata structures such as containers (for open lists; sets and bags); collections (for closed lists)and reification (for quoting and provenance). Though this desire has been addressed in theRDF primer and RDF Schema specification; they are explicitely ignored in its model theory.In this paper we formalize the intuitive semantics (as suggested by the RDF primer; the RDFSchema and RDF semantics specifications) of these compound data structures by twoorthogonal extensions of the RDFS model theory (RDFCC for RDF containers andcollections; and RDFR for RDF reification). Second; we give a set of entailment rules that issound and complete for the RDFCC and RDFR model theories. We show that complexity …,*,2009,2
Reasoning & Querying--State of the Art: Keyword-based querying for XML and RDF,Klara Weiand; Francois Bry; Tim Furche,Abstract Various query languages for Web and Semantic Web data; both for practical useand as an area of research in the scientific community; have emerged in recent years.

How to query the geneontology,Andreas Doms; Tim Furche; Albert Burger; Michael Schroeder,ABSTRACT Ontologies; which are structured; hierarchical vocabularies; are widely used inmolecular biology to annotate sequence and structure data. One such ontology; theGeneOntology; contains some 18000 terms on biological processes; molecular function; andcellular components. GeneOntology is available as flat file; in web formats such as XML andRDF; and as database. Using these formats we compare three different reasoners to querythe GeneOntology. Prolog is the classical logic programming approach to reason over theontology; Prova is a rule-based Java scripting language; and Xcerpt a query language forXML and RDF. We conclude by discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the threeapproaches.,Symposium on Knowledge Representation in Bioinformatics (KRBIO),2005,2

Historically; this has requiredtremendous effort by the data providers and whoever is collecting the data: Vertical searchengines aggregate offers through specific interfaces which provide suitably structured data.The semantic web vision replaces the specific interfaces with a single one; but still requiresproviders to publish structured data. Attempts to turn human-oriented HTML interfaces backinto their underlying databases have largely failed due to the variability of web sources.

Keyword-Based Search over Semantic Data,Klara Weiand; Andreas Hartl; Steffen Hausmann; Tim Furche; François Bry,Abstract Enabling nonexperts to publish structured or semantic data on the web is animportant achievement of the social web and one of the primary goals of the social semanticweb. Making this data easily accessible in turn has received only little attention. Querying insemantic wikis typically uses full-text search for the textual content and a web querylanguage for the annotations. This has two shortcomings: combined queries over contentand annotations are not possible; and users either are restricted to simple but vaguekeyword queries or have to learn a complex web query language.

Think before you Act!

Though the (semi-) automatic induction and maintenance ofsuch wrappers has been extensively studied; the efficient execution and optimization ofwrappers has seen far less attention. We demonstrate that static and adaptive optimisationtechniques; as used for query languages; significantly improve the wrapper executionperformance. At the same time; we highlight difference between wrapper optimisation andcommon query optimisation for databases:(1) The runtime of wrappers is entirely dominatedby page loads; while other operations (such as querying DOMs) have almost no impact;requiring a new cost model to guide the optimisation.(2) While adaptive query planning is …,VLDS,2012,*

Not So Creepy Crawler: Crawling the Web with XQuery,Franziska Von Dem Bussche; Klara Weiand; Benedikt Linse; Tim Furche; François Bry,Abstract. Web crawlers are increasingly used for focused tasks such as the extraction of datafrom Wikipedia or the analysis of social networks like last. fm. In these cases; pages are farmore uniformly structured than in the general Web and thus crawlers can use the structure ofWeb pages for more precise data extraction and more expressive analysis. In thisdemonstration; we present a focused; structure-based crawler generator; the “Not so CreepyCrawler”(nC2). What sets nC2 apart; is that all analysis and decision tasks of the crawlingprocess are delegated to an (arbitrary) XML query engine such as XQuery or Xcerpt.Customizing crawlers just means writing (declarative) XML queries that can access thecurrently crawled document as well as the metadata of the crawl process. We identify fourtypes of queries that together suffice to realize a wide variety of focused crawlers.,*,2010,*

With the plethora of differentdata formats available on the Web; there is no single sensible notion of matching or unifyingqueries with data. We introduce the notion of rich unification; which generalizes standardunification in logic programming; matching SPARQL query patterns with RDF graphs;evaluation of XPath or XQuery expressions on XML documents; and simulation of Xcerptterms with RDF or XML data. On top of rich unification; we introduce a rule language Xcerptswith recursion and negation as failure which is a variant of Xcerpt.

Implementation of Web Query Languages Reconsidered,Tim Furche,Abstract Visions of the next generation Web such as the" Semantic Web" or the" Web 2.0"have triggered the emergence of a multitude of data formats. These formats have differentcharacteristics as far as the shape of data is concerned (for example tree-vs. graph-shaped).They are accompanied by a puzzlingly large number of query languages each limited to onedata format. Thus; a key feature of the Web; namely to make it possible to access anythingpublished by anyone; is compromised. This thesis is devoted to versatile query languagescapable of accessing data in a variety of Web formats. The issue is addressed from threeangles: language design; common; yet uniform semantics; and common; yet uniformevaluation.% Thus it is divided in three parts: First; we consider the query language Xcerptas an example of the advocated class of versatile Web query languages.

Browserless web data extraction: challenges and opportunities,R Fayzrakhmanov; E Sallinger; B Spencer; T Furche; G Gottlob,Abstract: Most modern web scrapers use an embedded browser to render web pages and tosimulate user actions. Such scrapers (or wrappers) are therefore expensive to execute; interms of time and network traffic. In contrast; it is magnitudes more resource-efficient to use a“browserless” wrapper which directly accesses a web server through HTTP requests; andtakes the desired data directly from the raw replies. However; creating and maintainingbrowserless wrappers of high precision requires specialists; and is prohibitivelylaborintensive at scale. In this paper; we demonstrate the principal feasibility of automaticallytranslating browser-based wrappers into “browserless” wrappers.

Furthermore; Xcerpt and visXcerpt;short (vis) Xcerpt; have been conceived for querying both standard Web data such as XMLand HTML and Semantic Web data such as RDF and Topic Maps. This paper describes ademonstration focusing on three aspects of (vis) Xcerpt. First its core features; especially thepattern-oriented queries and answer-constructors; its rules or views; and its specificlanguage constructs for incomplete specifications. Incomplete specifications are essential forretrieving semi-structured data. Second; the integrated querying of standard Web andSemantic Web data to ease the accessing of the two kinds of data in a same query …,*,*,*
Xcerpt Open Issues: №; February nd; Node Identity in Xcerpt,Tim Furche,Abstract—Xcerpt so far has considered identity a function of the structure and value of a dataitem (extensional identity). In this paper another approach to identity; viz. surrogate or objectidentity as in object-oriented programming languages and databases is investigated. It isdemonstrated how this approach can solve a number of problems raised by the currentXcerpt; including object updates and their tracking as well as unrestricted occurrencequeries such as “How many title elements occur at any depth in section?”.,*,*,*
