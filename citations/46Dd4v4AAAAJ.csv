Effective multi-modal retrieval based on stacked auto-encoders,Wei Wang; Beng Chin Ooi; Xiaoyan Yang; Dongxiang Zhang; Yueting Zhuang,Abstract Multi-modal retrieval is emerging as a new search paradigm that enables seamlessinformation retrieval from various types of media. For example; users can simply snap amovie poster to search relevant reviews and trailers. To solve the problem; a set of mappingfunctions are learned to project high-dimensional features extracted from data of differentmedia types into a common low-dimensional space so that metric distance measures can beapplied. In this paper; we propose an effective mapping mechanism based on deep learning(ie; stacked auto-encoders) for multi-modal retrieval. Mapping functions are learned byoptimizing a new objective function; which captures both intra-modal and inter-modalsemantic relationships of data from heterogeneous sources effectively. Compared withprevious works which require a substantial amount of prior knowledge such as similarity …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,82
Effective deep learning-based multi-modal retrieval,Wei Wang; Xiaoyan Yang; Beng Chin Ooi; Dongxiang Zhang; Yueting Zhuang,Abstract Multi-modal retrieval is emerging as a new search paradigm that enables seamlessinformation retrieval from various types of media. For example; users can simply snap amovie poster to search for relevant reviews and trailers. The mainstream solution to theproblem is to learn a set of mapping functions that project data from different modalities intoa common metric space in which conventional indexing schemes for high-dimensionalspace can be applied. Since the effectiveness of the mapping functions plays an essentialrole in improving search quality; in this paper; we exploit deep learning techniques to learneffective mapping functions. In particular; we first propose a general learning objective thateffectively captures both intramodal and intermodal semantic relationships of data fromheterogeneous sources. Given the general objective; we propose two learning algorithms …,The VLDB Journal,2016,41
SINGA: A distributed deep learning platform,Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Sheng Wang; Wei Wang; Qingchao Cai; Gang Chen; Jinyang Gao; Zhaojing Luo; Anthony KH Tung; Yuan Wang; Zhongle Xie; Meihui Zhang; Kaiping Zheng,Abstract Deep learning has shown outstanding performance in various machine learningtasks. However; the deep complex model structure and massive training data make itexpensive to train. In this paper; we present a distributed deep learning system; calledSINGA; for training big models over large datasets. An intuitive programming model basedon the layer abstraction is provided; which supports a variety of popular deep learningmodels. SINGA architecture supports both synchronous and asynchronous trainingframeworks. Hybrid training frameworks can also be customized to achieve good scalability.SINGA provides different neural net partitioning schemes for training large models.

SINGA: Putting deep learning in the hands of multimedia users,Wei Wang; Gang Chen; Anh Tien Tuan Dinh; Jinyang Gao; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Sheng Wang,Abstract Recently; deep learning techniques have enjoyed success in various multimediaapplications; such as image classification and multi-modal data analysis. Two key factorsbehind deep learning's remarkable achievement are the immense computing power and theavailability of massive training datasets; which enable us to train large models to capturecomplex regularities of the data. There are two challenges to overcome before deeplearning can be widely adopted in multimedia and other applications. One is usability;namely the implementation of different models and training algorithms must be done by non-experts without much effort. The other is scalability; that is the deep learning system must beable to provision for a huge demand of computing resources for training large models withmassive datasets. To address these two challenges; in this paper; we design a distributed …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM international conference on Multimedia,2015,22
Cross-media hashing with neural networks,Yueting Zhuang; Zhou Yu; Wei Wang; Fei Wu; Siliang Tang; Jian Shao,Abstract Cross-media hashing; which conducts cross-media retrieval by embedding datafrom different modalities into a common low-dimensional hamming space; has attractedintensive attention in recent years. This is motivated by the facts a) the multi-modal data iswidespread; eg; the web images on Flickr are associated with tags; and b) hashing is aneffective technique towards large-scale high-dimensional data processing; which is exactlythe situation of cross-media retrieval. Inspired by recent advances in deep learning; wepropose a cross-media hashing approach based on multi-modal neural networks. Byrestricting in the learning objective a) the hash codes for relevant cross-media data beingsimilar; and b) the hash codes being discriminative for predicting the class labels; thelearned Hamming space is expected to well capture the cross-media semantic …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Multimedia,2014,17

Continuously monitoring the correlations of massive discrete streams,Yueguo Chen; Wei Wang; Xiaoyong Du; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract The problem of monitoring the correlations of discrete streams is to continuouslymonitor the temporal correlations among massive discrete streams. A temporal correlation oftwo streams is defined as a tracking behavior; ie; the most recent pattern of one stream isvery similar to a historical pattern of another stream. The challenge is that both the trackingstream and the tracked stream are evolving; which causes the frequent updates of thecorrelation-ships. The straightforward way of monitoring correlations by brute-forcesubsequence matching will be very expensive for massive streams. We propose techniquesthat are able to significantly reduce the number of expensive subsequence matching calls;by continuously pruning and refining the correlated streams. Extensive experiments on thestreaming trajectories show the significant performance improvement achieved by the …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,3
Cross-Domain Image Retrieval with Attention Modeling,Xin Ji; Wei Wang; Meihui Zhang; Yang Yang,Abstract: With the proliferation of e-commerce websites and the ubiquitousness of smartphones; cross-domain image retrieval using images taken by smart phones as queries tosearch products on e-commerce websites is emerging as a popular application. Onechallenge of this task is to locate the attention of both the query and database images. Inparticular; database images; eg of fashion products; on e-commerce websites are typicallydisplayed with other accessories; and the images taken by users contain noisy backgroundand large variations in orientation and lighting. Consequently; their attention is difficult tolocate. In this paper; we exploit the rich tag information available on the e-commercewebsites to locate the attention of database images. For query images; we use eachcandidate image in the database as the context to locate the query attention. Novel deep …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.01784,2017,*
