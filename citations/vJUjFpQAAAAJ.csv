Improving data quality: Consistency and accuracy,Gao Cong; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Xibei Jia; Shuai Ma,Abstract Two central criteria for data quality are consistency and accuracy. Inconsistenciesand errors in a database often emerge as violations of integrity constraints. Given a dirtydatabase D; one needs automated methods to make it consistent; ie; find a repair D'thatsatisfies the constraints and" minimally" differs from D. Equally important is to ensure that theautomatically-generated repair D'is accurate; or makes sense; ie; D'differs from the" correct"data within a predefined bound. This paper studies effective methods for improving bothdata consistency and accuracy. We employ a class of conditional functional dependencies(CFDs) proposed in [6] to specify the consistency of the data; which are able to captureinconsistencies and errors beyond what their traditional counterparts can catch. To improvethe consistency of the data; we propose two algorithms: one for automatically computing a …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,305
Graph pattern matching: From intractable to polynomial time,Wenfei Fan; Jianzhong Li; Shuai Ma; Nan Tang; Yinghui Wu; Yunpeng Wu,Abstract Graph pattern matching is typically defined in terms of subgraph isomorphism;which makes it an np-complete problem. Moreover; it requires bijective functions; which areoften too restrictive to characterize patterns in emerging applications. We propose a class ofgraph patterns; in which an edge denotes the connectivity in a data graph within apredefined number of hops. In addition; we define matching based on a notion of boundedsimulation; an extension of graph simulation. We show that with this revision; graph patternmatching can be performed in cubic-time; by providing such an algorithm. We also developalgorithms for incrementally finding matches when data graphs are updated; withperformance guarantees for dag patterns. We experimentally verify that these algorithmsscale well; and that the revised notion of graph pattern matching allows us to identify …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,204

Reasoning about record matching rules,Wenfei Fan; Xibei Jia; Jianzhong Li; Shuai Ma,Abstract To accurately match records it is often necessary to utilize the semantics of the data.Functional dependencies (FDs) have proven useful in identifying tuples in a clean relation;based on the semantics of the data. For all the reasons that FDs and their inference areneeded; it is also important to develop dependencies and their reasoning techniques formatching tuples from unreliable data sources. This paper investigates dependencies andtheir reasoning for record matching.(a) We introduce a class of matching dependencies(MDs) for specifying the semantics of data in unreliable relations; defined in terms ofsimilarity metrics and a dynamic semantics.(b) We identify a special case of MDs; referred toas relative candidate keys (RCKs); to determine what attributes to compare and how tocompare them when matching records across possibly different relations.(c) We propose …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,132
Extending dependencies with conditions,Loreto Bravo; Wenfei Fan; Shuai Ma,Abstract This paper introduces a class of conditional inclusion dependencies (CINDs); whichextends traditional inclusion dependencies (INDs) by enforcing bindings of semanticallyrelated data values. We show that CINDs are useful not only in data cleaning; but are also incontextual schema matching [7]. To make effective use of CINDs in practice; it is oftennecessary to reason about them. The most important static analysis issue concernsconsistency; to determine whether or not a given set of CINDs has conflicts. Another issueconcerns implication; ie; deciding whether a set of CINDs entails another CIND. We give afull treatment of the static analyses of CINDs; and show that CINDs retain most niceproperties of traditional INDs:(a) CINDs are always consistent;(b) CINDs are finitelyaxiomatizable; ie; there exists a sound and complete inference system for implication of …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,114
Adding Regular Expressions to Graph Reachability and Pattern Queries.,Wenfei Fan; Jianzhong Li; Shuai Ma; Nan Tang; Yinghui Wu,It is increasingly common to find graphs in which edges bear different types; indicating avariety of relationships.

Graph homomorphism revisited for graph matching,Wenfei Fan; Jianzhong Li; Shuai Ma; Hongzhi Wang; Yinghui Wu,Abstract In a variety of emerging applications one needs to decide whether a graph Gmatches another G p; ie; whether G has a topological structure similar to that of G p. Thetraditional notions of graph homomorphism and isomorphism often fall short of capturing thestructural similarity in these applications. This paper studies revisions of these notions;providing a full treatment from complexity to algorithms.(1) We propose p-homomorphism (p-hom) and 1-1 p-hom; which extend graph homomorphism and subgraph isomorphism;respectively; by mapping edges from one graph to paths in another; and by measuring thesimilarity of nodes.(2) We introduce metrics to measure graph similarity; and severaloptimization problems for p-hom and 1-1 p-hom.(3) We show that the decision problems forp-hom and 1-1 p-hom are NP-complete even for DAGs; and that the optimization …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,92
Capturing topology in graph pattern matching,Shuai Ma; Yang Cao; Wenfei Fan; Jinpeng Huai; Tianyu Wo,Abstract Graph pattern matching is often defined in terms of subgraph isomorphism; an np-complete problem. To lower its complexity; various extensions of graph simulation havebeen considered instead. These extensions allow pattern matching to be conducted in cubic-time. However; they fall short of capturing the topology of data graphs; ie; graphs may have astructure drastically different from pattern graphs they match; and the matches found areoften too large to understand and analyze. To rectify these problems; this paper proposes anotion of strong simulation; a revision of graph simulation; for graph pattern matching.(1) Weidentify a set of criteria for preserving the topology of graphs matched. We show that strongsimulation preserves the topology of data graphs and finds a bounded number ofmatches.(2) We show that strong simulation retains the same complexity as earlier …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,90

Towards Certain Fixes with Editing Rules and Master Data.,Wenfei Fan; Jianzhong Li; Shuai Ma; Nan Tang; Wenyuan Yu,Abstract A variety of integrity constraints have been studied for data cleaning. While theseconstraints can detect the presence of errors; they fall short of guiding us to correct theerrors. Indeed; data repairing based on these constraints may not find certain fixes that areabsolutely correct; and worse; may introduce new errors when repairing the data. Wepropose a method for finding certain fixes; based on master data; a notion of certain regions;and a class of editing rules. A certain region is a set of attributes that are assured correct bythe users. Given a certain region and master data; editing rules tell us what attributes to fixand how to update them. We show how the method can be used in data monitoring andenrichment.

A new fast clustering algorithm based on reference and density,Shuai Ma; TengJiao Wang; ShiWei Tang; DongQing Yang; Jun Gao,Abstract Density-based clustering is a sort of clustering analysis methods; which candiscover clusters with arbitrary shape and is insensitive to noise data. The efficiency of datamining algorithms is strongly needed with data becoming larger and larger. In this paper; wepresent a new fast clustering algorithm called CURD; which means Clustering UsingReferences and Density. Its creativity is capturing the shape and extent of a cluster withreferences; and then it analyzes the data based on the references. CURD preserves theability of density based clustering method's good advantages; and it is much efficientbecause of its nearly linear time complexity; so it can be used in mining very largedatabases. Both our theoretic analysis and experimental results confirm that CURD candiscover clusters with arbitrary shape and is insensitive to noise data.

Increasing the expressivity of conditional functional dependencies without extra complexity,Loreto Bravo; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Shuai Ma,The paper proposes an extension of CFDs [1]; referred to as extended ConditionalFunctional Dependencies (eCFDs). In contrast to CFDs; eCFDs specify patterns ofsemantically related values in terms of disjunction and inequality; and are capable ofcatching inconsistencies that arise in practice but cannot be detected by CFDs. The increasein expressive power does not incur extra complexity: we show that the satisfiability andimplication analyses of eCFDs remain NP-complete and coNP-complete; respectively; thesame as their CFDs counterparts. In light of the intractability; we present an algorithm thatapproximates the maximum number of eCFDs that are satisfiable. In addition; we revise SQLtechniques for detecting CFD violations; and show that violations of multiple eCFDs can becaptured via a single pair of SQL queries. We also introduce an incremental SQL …,2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering,2008,63
Towards certain fixes with editing rules and master data,Wenfei Fan; Jianzhong Li; Shuai Ma; Nan Tang; Wenyuan Yu,Abstract A variety of integrity constraints have been studied for data cleaning.

As opposed to static constraints for schema design; mds aredeveloped for record matching; and are defined in terms of similarity predicates and adynamic semantics.(b) We identify a special case of mds; referred to as relative candidatekeys (rcks); to determine what attributes to compare and how to compare them whenmatching records across possibly different relations.(c) We propose a mechanism forinferring mds; a departure from traditional implication analysis; such that when we cannotmatch records by comparing attributes that contain errors; we may still find matches by usingother; more reliable attributes.

Distributed Graph Pattern Matching,Shuai Ma; Yang Cao; Jinpeng Huai; Tianyu Wo,Abstract Graph simulation has been adopted for pattern matching to reduce the complexityand capture the need of novel applications. With the rapid development of the Web andsocial networks; data is typically distributed over multiple machines. Hence a naturalquestion raised is how to evaluate graph simulation on distributed data. To our knowledge;no such distributed algorithms are in place yet. This paper settles this question by providingevaluation algorithms and optimizations for graph simulation in a distributed setting.(1) Westudy the impacts of components and data locality on the evaluation of graph simulation.(2)We give an analysis of a large class of distributed algorithms; captured by a message-passing model; for graph simulation.

Detecting inconsistencies in distributed data,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Shuai Ma; Heiko Müller,One of the central problems for data quality is inconsistency detection. Given a database Dand a set¿ of dependencies as data quality rules; we want to identify tuples in D that violatesome rules in¿. When D is a centralized database; there have been effective SQL-basedtechniques for finding violations. It is; however; far more challenging when data in D isdistributed; in which inconsistency detection often necessarily requires shipping data fromone site to another. This paper develops techniques for detecting violations of conditionalfunctional dependencies (CFDs) in relations that are fragmented and distributed acrossdifferent sites.(1) We formulate the detection problem in various distributed settings asoptimization problems; measured by either network traffic or response time.(2) We show thatit is beyond reach in practice to find optimal detection methods: the detection problem is …,2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE 2010),2010,45
Propagating functional dependencies with conditions,Wenfei Fan; Shuai Ma; Yanli Hu; Jie Liu; Yinghui Wu,Abstract The dependency propagation problem is to determine; given a view defined ondata sources and a set of dependencies on the sources; whether another dependency isguaranteed to hold on the view. This paper investigates dependency propagation forrecently proposed conditional functional dependencies (CFDs). The need for this study isevident in data integration; exchange and cleaning since dependencies on data sourcesoften only hold conditionally on the view. We investigate dependency propagation for viewsdefined in various fragments of relational algebra; CFDs as view dependencies; and forsource dependencies given as either CFDs or traditional functional dependencies (FDs).(a)We establish lower and upper bounds; all matching; ranging from PTIME to undecidable.These not only provide the first results for CFD propagation; but also extend the classical …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,43
Enhancing reliability to boost the throughput over screen-camera links,Anran Wang; Shuai Ma; Chunming Hu; Jinpeng Huai; Chunyi Peng; Guobin Shen,Abstract With the rapid proliferation of camera-equipped smart devices (eg; smartphones;pads; tablets); visible light communication (VLC) over screen-camera links emerges as anovel form of near-field communication. Such communication via smart devices is highlycompetitive for its user-friendliness; security; and infrastructure-less (ie; no dependency onWiFi or cellular infrastructure). However; existing approaches mostly focus on improving thetransmission speed and ignore the transmission reliability. Considering the interplaybetween the transmission speed and reliability towards effective end-to-end communication;in this paper; we aim to boost the throughput over screen-camera links by enhancing thetransmission reliability. To this end; we propose RDCode; a robust dynamic barcode whichenables a novel packet-frame-block structure.

Informally;such event organizers comprise a small group of people who not only have the relevantskills or expertise that are required for an event (eg conference) but they are also able toinfluence largest number of people to actively contribute to it.

Analyses and validation of conditional dependencies with built-in predicates,Wenguang Chen; Wenfei Fan; Shuai Ma,Abstract This paper proposes a natural extension of conditional functional dependencies(cfd s 14) and conditional inclusion dependencies (cind s 8); denoted by cfd ps and cind ps;respectively; by specifying patterns of data values with≠;<;≤;> and≥ predicates. As dataquality rules; cfd ps and cind ps are able to capture errors that commonly arise in practicebut cannot be detected by cfd s and cind s. We establish two sets of results for centraltechnical problems associated with cfd ps and cind p s.(a) One concerns the satisfiabilityand implication problems for cfd ps and cind ps; taken separately or together. These areimportant for; eg; deciding whether data quality rules are dirty themselves; and for removingredundant rules.

On the other hand; various applicationsof social computing trigger the pressing need of a new search paradigm. In this article; weargue that big graph search is the one filling this gap. We first introduce the application ofgraph search in various scenarios. We then formalize the graph search problem; and givean analysis of graph search from an evolutionary point of view; followed by the evidencesfrom both the industry and academia. After that; we analyze the difficulties and challenges ofbig graph search. Finally; we present three classes of techniques towards big graph search:query techniques; data techniques and distributed computing techniques.,Frontiers of Computer Science,2016,14
Scaling up Link Prediction with Ensembles,Liang Duan; Charu Aggarwal; Shuai Ma; Renjun Hu; Jinpeng Huai,Abstract A network with $ n $ nodes contains O (n 2) possible links. Even for networks ofmodest size; it is often difficult to evaluate all pairwise possibilities for links in a meaningfulway. Furthermore; even though link prediction is closely related to missing value estimationproblems; such as collaborative filtering; it is often difficult to use sophisticated models suchas latent factor methods because of their computational complexity over very large networks.Due to this computational complexity; most known link prediction methods are designed forevaluating the link propensity over a specified subset of links; rather than for performing aglobal search over the entire networks. In practice; however; it is essential to perform anexhaustive search over the entire networks. In this paper; we propose an ensemble enabledapproach to scaling up link prediction; which is able to decompose traditional link …,Proceedings of the Ninth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2016,13

CerFix: A System for Cleaning Data with Certain Fixes,Wenfei Fan; Jianzhong Li; Shuai Ma; Nan Tang; Wenyuan Yu,Abstract We present CerFix; a data cleaning system that finds certain fixes for tuples at thepoint of data entry; ie; fixes that are guaranteed correct. It is based on master data; editingrules and certain regions. Given some attributes of an input tuple that are validated (assuredcorrect); editing rules tell us what other attributes to fix and how to correct them with masterdata. A certain region is a set of attributes that; if validated; warrant a certain fix for the entiretuple. We demonstrate the following facilities provided by Cer-Fix:(1) a region finder toidentify certain regions;(2) a data monitor to find certain fixes for input tuples; by guidingusers to validate a minimal number of attributes; and (3) an auditing module to show whatattributes are fixed and where the correct values come from.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,10

In the context of mobilecomputing; moving sequential patterns that reflects the moving behavior of mobile usersattracted researchers' interests recently. In this paper a novel and efficient technique isproposed to mine moving sequential patterns. Firstly the idea of clustering is introduced toprocess the original moving histories into moving sequences as a preprocessing step. Thenan efficient algorithm called PrefixTree is presented to mine the moving sequences.Performance study shows that PrefixTree outperforms LM algorithm; which is revised to minemoving sequences; in mining large moving sequence databases.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2004,10
Incremental maintenance of discovered mobile user maximal moving sequential patterns,Shuai Ma; Shiwei Tang; Dongqing Yang; Tengjiao Wang; Chanjun Yang,Abstract In the context of mobile computing; a special sequential pattern; moving sequentialpattern that reflects the moving behavior of mobile users attracted researchers' interestsrecently. While there have been a number of efficient moving sequential pattern miningalgorithms reported; this paper concentrates on the maintenance of mined maximal movingsequential patterns. In particular; we developed an incremental approach; where maximalmoving sequential patterns are stored in prefix trees; and new moving sequences can beeasily combined with the existing patterns. A performance study indicated that the proposedapproach performs significantly faster than straightforward approaches that mine from thewhole updated database.,*,2004,10
Data Quality Problems beyond Consistency and Deduplication,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Shuai Ma; Nan Tang; Wenyuan Yu,Abstract Recent work on data quality has primarily focused on data repairing algorithms forimproving data consistency and record matching methods for data deduplication. This paperaccentuates several other challenging issues that are essential to developing data cleaningsystems; namely; error correction with performance guarantees; unification of data repairingand record matching; relative information completeness; and data currency. We provide anoverview of recent advances in the study of these issues; and advocate the need fordeveloping a logical framework for a uniform treatment of these issues.,*,2013,9
An embedding approach to anomaly detection,Renjun Hu; Charu C Aggarwal; Shuai Ma; Jinpeng Huai,Network anomaly detection has become very popular in recent years because of theimportance of discovering key regions of structural inconsistency in the network. In additionto application-specific information carried by anomalies; the presence of such structuralinconsistency is often an impediment to the effective application of data mining algorithmssuch as community detection and classification. In this paper; we study the problem ofdetecting structurally inconsistent nodes that connect to a number of diverse influentialcommunities in large social networks. We show that the use of a network embeddingapproach; together with a novel dimension reduction technique; is an effective tool todiscover such structural inconsistencies. We also experimentally show that the detection ofsuch anomalous nodes has significant applications: one is the specific use of detected …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,6

Then; wedesign a linear-time algorithm to compute routing proxies and their corresponding DRAs.Finally; we experimentally verify that our solution is a general technique for reducing graphsizes and speeding-up shortest path and distance queries; using real-life large graphs.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,5

PRATA: A system for XML publishing; integration and view maintenance,Gao Cong; Wenfei Fan; Xibei Jia; Shuai Ma,Abstract We present PRATA; a system that supports the following in a uniform framework:(a)XML publishing; ie; converting data from databases to an XML document;(b) XMLintegration; ie; extracting data from multiple; distributed databases; and integrating the datainto a single XML document; and (c) incremental maintenance of published or integratedXML data (view); ie; in response to changes to the source databases; efficiently propagatingthe source changes to the XML view by computing the corresponding XML changes. Asalient feature of the system is that publishing; integration and view maintenance areschema-directed: they are conducted strictly following a user-specified (possibly recursiveand complex) XML schema; and guarantee that the generated or modified XML documentconforms to the predefined schema.

Combining pos tagging; lucene search and similarity metrics for entity linking,Shujuan Zhao; Chune Li; Shuai Ma; Tiejun Ma; Dianfu Ma,Abstract Entity linking is to detect proper nouns or concrete concepts (aka mentions) fromdocuments; and to map them to the corresponding entries in a given knowledge base. In thispaper; we propose an entity linking framework POSLS consisting of three components:mention detection; candidate selection and entity disambiguation. First; we use part ofspeech tagging and English syntactic rules to detect mentions. We then choose candidateswith Lucene search. Finally; we identify the best matchings with a similarity baseddisambiguation method. Experimental results show that our approach has an acceptableaccuracy.,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2013,4

One-pass error bounded trajectory simplification,Xuelian Lin; Shuai Ma; Han Zhang; Tianyu Wo; Jinpeng Huai,Abstract Nowadays; various sensors are collecting; storing and transmitting tremendoustrajectory data; and it is known that raw trajectory data seriously wastes the storage; networkband and computing resource. Line simplification (LS) algorithms are an effective approachto attacking this issue by compressing data points in a trajectory to a set of continuous linesegments; and are commonly used in practice. However; existing LS algorithms are notsufficient for the needs of sensors in mobile devices. In this study; we first develop a one-pass error bounded trajectory simplification algorithm (OPERB); which scans each datapoint in a trajectory once and only once. We then propose an aggressive one-pass errorbounded trajectory simplification algorithm (OPERB-A); which allows interpolating new datapoints into a trajectory under certain conditions. Finally; we experimentally verify that our …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,3
TGraph: A Temporal Graph Data Management System.,Haixing Huang; Jinghe Song; Xuelian Lin; Shuai Ma; Jinpeng Huai,Abstract Temporal graphs are a class of graphs whose nodes and edges; together with theassociated properties; continuously change over time. Recently; systems have beendeveloped to support snapshot queries over temporal graphs. However; these systemsbarely support aggregate time range queries. Moreover; these systems cannot guaranteeACID transactions; an important feature for data management systems as long as concurrentprocessing is involved. To solve these issues; we design and develop TGraph; a temporalgraph data management system; that assures the ACID transaction feature; and supportsfast temporal graph queries.,The ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM); Indianapolis; USA; 2016.,2016,3

It is critical to data centers for coping with dynamic cloud workloads. This papershows that VNM VNM can be approached by graph pattern matching; a well-studieddatabase topic.(1) We propose to model a virtual network request as a graph patterncarrying various constraints; and treat a substrate network as a graph in which nodes andedges bear attributes specifying their capacity.(2) We show that a variety of mappingrequirements can be expressed in this model; such as virtual machine placement; networkembedding and priority mapping.(3) In this model; we formulate VNM VNM and itsoptimization problem with a mapping cost function.

Distance Landmarks Revisited for Road Graphs,Shuai Ma; Kaiyu Feng; Haixun Wang; Jianxin Li; Jinpeng Huai,Abstract: Computing shortest distances is one of the fundamental problems on graphs; andremains a {\em challenging} task today.{\em Distance}{\em landmarks} have been recentlystudied for shortest distance queries with an auxiliary data structure; referred to as {\emlandmark}{\em covers}. This paper studies how to apply distance landmarks for fast {\emexact} shortest distance query answering on large road graphs. However; the {\em direct}application of distance landmarks is {\em impractical} due to the high space and time cost.To rectify this problem; we investigate novel techniques that can be seamlessly combinedwith distance landmarks. We first propose a notion of {\em hybrid landmark covers}; arevision of landmark covers.

MRPacker: An SQL to MapReduce Optimizer,Xuelian Lin; Yue Ye; Shuai Ma,Abstract There have been recently quite a few works on optimizing the MapReduceexecution plans; which either optimize the join operators or apply a set of translation rules toreduce the number of MapReduce jobs in an execution plan. However; none of these workshas put into consideration and utilized how MapReduce jobs are generated and combined.To further improve the efficiency of MapReduce execution plans; we incorporate into ouroptimization approach the way how MapReduce jobs are generated and combined. In thispaper; we propose MRPacker; a novel SQL-to-MapReduce optimizer by (a) using a set oftransformation rules to reduce the number of MapReduce jobs; and (b) merging MapReducejobs in a more reasonable way. We have finally experimentally demonstrated theeffectiveness and efficiency of MRPacker; using the TPC-H benchmark.,The ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM); San Francisco; CA; USA; 2013.,2013,3
Extending dependencies for improving data quality,Shuai Ma,This doctoral thesis presents the results of my work on extending dependencies forimproving data quality; both in a centralized environment with a single database and in adata exchange and integration environment with multiple databases. The first part of thethesis proposes five classes of data dependencies; referred to as CINDs; eCFDs; CFDcs;CFDps and CINDps; to capture data inconsistencies commonly found in practice in acentralized environment. For each class of these dependencies; we investigate two centralproblems: the satisfiability problem and the implication problem. The satisfiability problem isto determine given a set Σ of dependencies defined on a database schema R; whether ornot there exists a nonempty database D of R that satisfies Σ.

An Ensemble Approach to Link Prediction,Liang Duan; Shuai Ma; Charu Aggarwal; Tiejun Ma; Jinpeng Huai,A network with $ n $ nodes contains $ O (n^ 2) $ possible links. Even for networks of modestsize; it is often difficult to evaluate all pairwise possibilities for links in a meaningful way.Further; even though link prediction is closely related to missing value estimation problems;it is often difficult to use sophisticated models such as latent factor methods because of theircomputational complexity on large networks. Hence; most known link prediction methodsare designed for evaluating the link propensity on a specified subset of links; rather than onthe entire networks. In practice; however; it is essential to perform an exhaustive search overthe entire networks. In this article; we propose an ensemble enabled approach to scaling uplink prediction; by decomposing traditional link prediction problems into subproblems ofsmaller size. These subproblems are each solved with latent factor models; which can be …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,2
TOPIC: TOward Perfect InfluenCe Graph Summarization,Lei Shi; Sibai Sun; Yuan Xuan; Yue Su; Hanghang Tong; Shuai Ma; Yang Chen,Summarizing large influence graphs is crucial for many graph visualization and miningtasks. Classical graph clustering and compression algorithms focus on summarizing thenodes by their structural-level or attribute-level similarities; but usually are not designed tocharacterize the flow-level pattern which is the centerpiece of influence graphs. On the otherhand; the social influence analysis has been intensively studied; but little is done on thesummarization problem without an explicit focus on social networks. Building on the recentstudy of the Influence Graph Summarization (IGS); this paper presents a new perspective ofthe underlying flow-based heuristic. It establishes a direct linkage between the optimalsummarization and the classic eigenvector centrality of the graph nodes.

Landmark Image Retrieval by Jointing Feature Refinement and Multi-modal Classifier Learning,Xiaoming Zhang; Senzhang Wang; Zhoujun Li; Shuai Ma,Landmark retrieval is to return a set of images with their landmarks similar to those of thequery images. Existing studies on landmark retrieval focus on exploiting the geometries oflandmarks for visual similarity matches. However; the visual content of social images is oflarge diversity in many landmarks; and also some images share common patterns overdifferent landmarks. On the other side; it has been observed that social images usuallycontain multimodal contents; ie; visual content and text tags; and each landmark has theunique characteristic of both visual content and text content. Therefore; the approachesbased on similarity matching may not be effective in this environment. In this paper; weinvestigate whether the geographical correlation among the visual content and the textcontent could be exploited for landmark retrieval. In particular; we propose an effective …,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2017,1
Fast Computation of Dense Temporal Subgraphs,Shuai Ma; Renjun Hu; Luoshu Wang; Xuelian Lin; Jinpeng Huai,Dense subgraph discovery has proven useful in various applications of temporal networks.We focus on a special class of temporal networks whose nodes and edges are kept fixed;but edge weights constantly and regularly vary with timestamps. However; finding densesubgraphs in temporal networks is nontrivial; and its state of the art solution uses a filter-and-verification framework; which is not scalable on large temporal networks. In this study; wepropose a data-driven approach to finding dense subgraphs in large temporal networks withT timestamps.(1) We first develop a data-driven approach employing hidden statistics toidentifying k time intervals; instead of T*(T+ 1)/2 ones (k is typically much smaller than T);which strikes a balance between quality and efficiency.(2) After proving that the problem hasno constant factor approximation algorithms; we design better heuristic algorithms to …,The 33rd IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE); San Diego; California; USA; 2017.,2017,1

One-Pass Trajectory Simplification Using the Synchronous Euclidean Distance,Xuelian Lin; Jiahao Jiang; Shuai Ma; Yimeng Zuo; Chunming Hu,Abstract: Various mobile devices have been used to collect; store and transmit tremendoustrajectory data; and it is known that raw trajectory data seriously wastes the storage; networkband and computing resource. To attack this issue; one-pass line simplification (LS)algorithms have are been developed; by compressing data points in a trajectory to a set ofcontinuous line segments. However; these algorithms adopt the perpendicular Euclideandistance; and none of them uses the synchronous Euclidean distance (SED); and cannotsupport spatio-temporal queries. To do this; we develop two one-pass error boundedtrajectory simplification algorithms (CISED-S and CISED-W) using SED; based on a novelspatio-temporal cone intersection technique. Using four real-life trajectory datasets; weexperimentally show that our approaches are both efficient and effective. In terms of …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.05360,2018,*

Outlier Detection in Sparse Data with Factorization Machines,Mengxiao Zhu; Charu C Aggarwal; Shuai Ma; Hui Zhang; Jinpeng Huai,Abstract In sparse data; a large fraction of the entries take on zero values. Some examples ofsparse data include short text snippets (such as tweets in Twitter) or some featurerepresentations of categorical data sets with a large number of values; in which traditionalmethods for outlier detection typically fail because of the difficulty of computing distances. Toaddress this; it is important to use the latent relations between such values. Factorizationmachines represent a natural methodology for this; and are naturally designed for themassive-domain setting because of their emphasis on sparse data sets. In this study; wepropose an outlier detection approach for sparse data with factorization machines.Factorization machines are also efficient due to their linear complexity in the number of non-zero values. In fact; because of their efficiency; they can even be extended to traditional …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2017,*

In this study; we first formalize taxonomysimulation; a natural matching semantics combing graph simulation with taxonomy; andpropose its pattern relaxation to enrich graph pattern matching results with taxonomyinformation. We also design topological ranking and diversified topological ranking for top-krelaxations.

A Robust Barcode System for Data Transmissions over Screen-Camera Links,Anran Wang; Shuai Ma; Chunming Hu; Jinpeng Huai; Chunyi Peng; Guobin Shen,Abstract Visible light communication (VLC) over screen-camera links emerges as a novelform of near-field communication; and it offers a user-friendly; infrastructure-less and securecommunication; which is highly competitive for one-time file transfer [1-4]. However; thelimitations of smart devices and the uncertainty of user behaviors seriously impair thetransmission reliability and hinder its applicability. Worse still; existing approaches [1; 2; 4]mostly focus on improving the transmission speed and ignore the transmission reliability.Hence; RDCode is proposed to boost the throughput over screen-camera links; by makinguse of a novel barcode design and several effective techniques to enhance the transmissionreliability.
