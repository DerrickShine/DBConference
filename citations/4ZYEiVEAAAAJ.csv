Using collaborative filtering to weave an information tapestry,David Goldberg; David Nichols; Brian M Oki; Douglas Terry,Tapestry is an experimental mail system developed at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.The motivation for Tapestry comes from the increasing use of electronic mail; which isresulting in users being inundated by a huge stream of incoming documents [2; 7; 12]. Oneway to handle large volumes of mail is to provide mailing lists; enabling users to subscribeonly to those lists of interest to them. However; as illustrated in Figure 1; the set ofdocuments of interest to a particular user rarely map neatly to existing lists. A better solutionis for a user to specify afi'lter that scans all lists; selecting interesting documents no matterwhat list they are in. Several mail systems support filtering based on a document's contents[3; 5; 6; 8]. A basic tenet of the Tapestry work is that more effective filtering can be done byinvolving humans in the filtering process. In addition to content-based filtering; the …,Communications of the ACM,1992,4267

Managing update conflicts in Bayou; a weakly connected replicated storage system,Douglas B Terry; Marvin M Theimer; Karin Petersen; Alan J Demers; Mike J Spreitzer; Carl H Hauser,Abstract Bayou is a replicated; weakly consmtent storage system designed for a mobilecomputing environment that includes portable machines with less than ideal networkconnectivity. To maximize availabdity; users can read and write any accessible replica.Bayou's design has focused on supporting apphcation-specific mechanisms to detect andresolve the update conflicts that naturally arise in such a system; ensuring that replicas movetowards eventual consistency; and defining a protocol by which the resolution of updateconflicts stabilizes; It includes novel methods for confhct detection; called dependencychecks; and per-write conflict resolution based on client-provided merge procedures.

Selective delivery of electronic messages in a multiple computer system based on context and environment of a user,*,The present invention describes a method for selectively delivering electronic messages toan identified user or users in a system of mobile and fixed devices; including multiple displaydevices and multiple users; based on the context of the system and the environment of theidentified user. Electronic messages intended for an identified user or users may be given alevel of privacy and a level priority; and contextual attributes for its delivery may be specified.The system perceives contextual attributes for the recipient user or users; including displaydevices in close proximity to the identified users; and determines a display property for saidelectronic message based on the contextual attributes; the user profile properties of eachuser; and the level of privacy and level of priority of the electronic message.

Flexible update propagation for weakly consistent replication,Karin Petersen; Mike J Spreitzer; Douglas B Terry; Marvin M Theimer; Alan J Demers,Abstract Bayou's anti-entropy protocol for update propagation between weakly consistentstorage replicas is based on pair-wise communication; the propagation of write operations;and a set of ordering and closure. constraints on the propagation of the writes. The simplicityof the design makes the protocol very flexible; thereby providing support for diversenetworking environments and usage scenarios. It accommodates a variety of policies forwhen and where to propagate updates. It operates over diverse network topologies;including low-bandwidth links. It is incremental. It enables replica convergence; and updatescan be propagated using floppy disks and similar transportable media. Moreover; theprotocol handles replica creation and retirement in a light-weight manner. Each of thesefeatures is enabled by only one or two of the protocol's design choices; and can be …,ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review,1997,656
Continuous queries over append-only databases,Douglas Terry; David Goldberg; David Nichols; Brian Oki,Abstract In a database to which data is continually added; users may wish to issue apermanent query and be notified whenever data matches the query. If such continuousqueries examine only single records; this can be implemented by examining each record asit arrives. This is very efficient because only the incoming record needs to be scanned. Thissimple approach does not work for queries involving joins or time. The Tapestry systemallows users to issue such queries over a database of mail and bulletin board messages.The user issues a static query; such as “show me all messages that have been replied to byJones;” as though the database were fixed and unchanging. Tapestry converts the queryinto an incremental query that efficiently finds new matches to the original query as newmessages are added to the database.

Session guarantees for weakly consistent replicated data,Douglas B Terry; Alan J Demers; Karin Petersen; Mike J Spreitzer; Marvin M Theimer; Brent B Welch,Four per-session guarantees are proposed to aid users and applications of weaklyconsistent replicated data:" read your writes";" monotonic reads";" writes follow reads"; and"monotonic writes". The intent is to present individual applications with a view of the databasethat is consistent with their own actions; even if they read and write from various; potentiallyinconsistent servers. The guarantees can be layered on existing systems that employ a read-any/write-any replication scheme while retaining the principal benefits of such a scheme;namely high availability; simplicity; scalability; and support for disconnected operation.These session guarantees were developed in the context of the Bayou project at XeroxPARC in which we are designing and building a replicated storage system to support theneeds of mobile computing users who may be only intermittently connected.,Parallel and Distributed Information Systems; 1994.; Proceedings of the Third International Conference on,1994,453

Extending document management systems with user-specific active properties,Paul Dourish; W Keith Edwards; Anthony LaMarca; John Lamping; Karin Petersen; Michael Salisbury; Douglas B Terry; James Thornton,Abstract Document properties are a compelling infrastructure on which to develop documentmanagement applications. A property-based approach avoids many of the problems oftraditional heierarchical storage mechanisms; reflects document organizations meaningful touser tasks; provides a means to integrate the perspectives of multiple individuals andgroups; and does this all within a uniform interaction framework. Document properties canreflect not only categorizations of documents and document use; but also expressions ofdesired system activity; such as sharing criteria; replication management; and versioning.Augmenting property-based document management systems with active properties thatcarry executable code enables the provision of document-based services on a propertyinfrastructure.

Method for delegating access rights through executable access control program without delegating access rights not in a specification to any intermediary nor compri...,*,A method in which access control programs (ACPs) permit controlled delegation of accessrights from clients to untrusted intermediaries. ACPs are programs that encode arbitraryspecifications of delegated access rights. In the method; a client creates an ACP andassociates it with a request to a server; the request being made through one or moreintermediaries. When processing a request received from an intermediary; the serverexecutes the access control program to determine whether or not to grant the request.,*,1997,297
Garbage collector for hypermedia systems,*,A database of interests is maintained in a distributed computing system to register theindividual interests of users in centrally stored non-textual media files; such as digital voice;music; scanned-in image; and video files. Uniquely named piece table style persistent datastructures are employed to give users controlled access to the underlying non-textual mediafiles by embedded name reference to such piece tables in ordinary messages or text files; soa database of piece tables is also maintained. A garbage collector periodically enumeratesthe interest database to delete interest entries which have been invalidated. Aged piecetables are deleted from the reference database when there no longer are any recordedinterests referring to them; and non-textual media files are deleted to reclaim the storagespace allocated to them when there no longer are any piece tables referring to them.,*,1990,289
User level controlled mechanism inter-positioned in a read/write path of a property-based document management system,*,A user-level controlled mechanism is interposed into a read/write path of a computer system.The mechanism can be implemented as properties attached to documents. Documentshaving properties attached thereto have the capability of separating the content of thedocument from the properties which describe the document. This separation of thedocument content from its properties allows for a user-level access and control of theproperties thereby allowing a user flexibility in organizing; storing and retrieving documents.The mechanism allows a user to arrange collections of documents wherein a singledocument may appear in multiple collections. The properties of the present invention areuser and document specific in the sense that they are associated with the user whichattached the properties and are directed to control of specific documents.,*,2001,195
Consistency-based service level agreements for cloud storage,Douglas B Terry; Vijayan Prabhakaran; Ramakrishna Kotla; Mahesh Balakrishnan; Marcos K Aguilera; Hussam Abu-Libdeh,Abstract Choosing a cloud storage system and specific operations for reading and writingdata requires developers to make decisions that trade off consistency for availability andperformance. Applications may be locked into a choice that is not ideal for all clients andchanging conditions. Pileus is a replicated key-value store that allows applications todeclare their consistency and latency priorities via consistency-based service levelagreements (SLAs). It dynamically selects which servers to access in order to deliver thebest service given the current configuration and system conditions. In application-specificSLAs; developers can request both strong and eventual consistency as well as intermediateguarantees such as read-my-writes.

Virtual documents generated via combined documents or portions of documents retrieved from data repositories,*,A virtual document generated within the environment of a document management system.The document management system provides for the separation of the document contentfrom properties which describe the content. Bit providers are implemented to retrieve thecontent for a document in a manner such that the document is unaware of the location of thecontent which is retrieved. Generation of a virtual document recognizes that a one-to-onecorrelation between a document and the contents which make up that document are notrequired. Therefore; content for a single DMS document may be dispersed across numerousstorage repositories. Alternatively; a virtual document may be a sub-portion of a file on asingle repository; or a combination of such contents.,*,2002,149
Designing and implementing asynchronous collaborative applications with Bayou,W Keith Edwards; Elizabeth D Mynatt; Karin Petersen; Mike J Spreitzer; Douglas B Terry; Marvin M Theimer,ABSTRACT. Asynchronous collaboration is characterized by the degree of independencecollaborators have from one another. In particular; collaborators working asynchronouslytypically have little need for frequent and finegrained coordination with one another; andtypically do not need to be notified immediately of changes made by others to any sharedartifacts they are working with. We present an infrastructure; called Bayou; designed tosupport the construction of asynchronous collaborative applications. Bayou provides areplicated; weakly-consistent; data storage engine to application writers. The systemsupports a number of mechanisms for leveraging application semantics; using thesemechanisms; applications can implement complex conflict detection and resolution policies;and choose the level of consistency and stability they will see in their databases.

Managing stored voice in the Etherphone system,Douglas B Terry; Daniel C Swinehart,Abstract The voice manager in the Etherphone system provides facilities for recording;editing; and playing stored voice in a distributed personal-computing environment. Itprovides the basis for applications such as voice mail; annotation of multimedia documents;and voice editing using standard text-editing techniques. To facilitate sharing; the voicemanager stores voice on a special voice file server that is accessible via the local internet.Operations for editing a passage of recorded voice simply build persistent data structures torepresent the edited voice. These data structures; implementing an abstraction called voiceropes; are stored in a server database and consist of lists of intervals within voice files.Clients refer to voice ropes solely by reference.

A property attachment mechanismallows a user to define and attach static properties and/or active properties to a document.The active properties include executable code which control the behavior of the documentcontents. Upon transferring a document to another user; system; or environment; thedocument management system combines the document content and properties as a self-contained document which can interpret and manipulate its own contents. In this manner; areceiving user does not require additional applications in order to manipulate the documentcontents into a usable format. The self-contained document interprets and manipulates itselfusing its active properties to provide a useful document to the receiving user.,*,2001,134

Cimbiosys: A platform for content-based partial replication,Venugopalan Ramasubramanian; Thomas L Rodeheffer; Douglas B Terry; Meg Walraed-Sullivan; Ted Wobber; Catherine C Marshall; Amin Vahdat,Abstract Increasingly people manage and share information across a wide variety ofcomputing devices from cell phones to Internet services. Selective replication of content isessential because devices; especially portable ones; have limited resources for storage andcommunication. Cimbiosys is a novel replication platform that permits each device to defineits own content-based filtering criteria and to share updates directly with other devices. In theface of fluid network connectivity; redefinable content filters; and changing content;Cimbiosys ensures two properties not achieved by previous systems. First; every deviceeventually stores exactly those items whose latest version matches its filter. Second; everydevice represents its replication-specific metadata in a compact form; with state proportionalto the number of devices rather than the number of items.

Caching hints in distributed systems,Douglas B.  Terry,Caching reduces the average cost of retrieving data by amortizing the lookup cost overseveral references to the data. Problems with maintaining strong cache consistency in adistributed system can be avoided by treating cached information as hints. A new approachto managing caches of hints suggests maintaining a minimum level of cache accuracy;rather than maximizing the cache hit ratio; in order to guarantee performance improvements.The desired accuracy is based on the ratio of lookup costs to the costs of detecting andrecovering from invalid cache entries. Cache entries are aged so that they get purged whentheir estimated accuracy falls below the desired level. The age thresholds are dictated solelyby clients' accuracy requirements instead of being suggested by data storage servers orsystem administrators.,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,1987,104

For example; some applications may require that updates propagateamongst replicas with tight time constraints; whereas other applications may be able totolerate longer propagation delays. Some applications only require replicas to interoperatewith a few centralized replicas for data synchronization purposes; while other applicationsneed communication between arbitrary replicas. Similarly; the type of update conflictscaused by data replication varies amongst applications; and the mechanisms to resolvethem differ as well.

Dealing with server corruption in weakly consistent replicated data systems,Mike J Spreitzer; Marvin M Theimer; Karin Petersen; Alan J Demers; Douglas B Terry,Abstract Providing high availability and the ability to share data despite the weakconnectivity of mobile computing raises the problem of trusting replicated data servers thatmay be corrupt. This is because servers must be run on portable computers; and thesemachines are less secure and thus less trustworthy than those traditionally used to runservers. We describe the kinds of problems one must be prepared to deal with; noting thateven users of secured; non‐portable computers are at risk if servers trust all authorizedpeers.

Concise version vectors in WinFS,Dahlia Malkhi; Doug Terry,Abstract Conflicts naturally arise in optimistically replicated systems. The common way todetect update conflicts is via version vectors; whose storage and communication overheadare number of replicas× number of objects. These costs may be prohibitive for largesystems. This paper presents predecessor vectors with exceptions (PVEs); a novel optimisticreplication technique developed for Microsoft's WinFS system.

Contrail: Enabling decentralized social networks on smartphones,Patrick Stuedi; Iqbal Mohomed; Mahesh Balakrishnan; Z Morley Mao; Venugopalan Ramasubramanian; Doug Terry; Ted Wobber,Abstract Mobile devices are increasingly used for social networking applications; where datais shared between devices belonging to different users. Today; such applications areimplemented as centralized services; forcing users to trust corporations with their personaldata. While decentralized designs for such applications can provide privacy; they are difficultto achieve on current devices due to constraints on connectivity; energy and bandwidth.Contrail is a communication platform that allows decentralized social networks to overcomethese challenges. In Contrail; a user installs content filters on her friends' devices thatexpress her interests; she subsequently receives new data generated by her friends thatmatch the filters. Both data and filters are exchanged between devices via cloud-basedrelays in encrypted form; giving the cloud no visibility into either.

Replication protocol for data stores,*,A protocol for replicating replicas in a sync community. Each replica maintains a knowledgethat represents changes that the replica is aware of. Each replica does not typically maintainknowledge about other replicas. The protocol includes messages that include knowledgeabout changes on the various replicas. Using the knowledge; the replicas can enumeratechanges and send the changes using asynchronous messages that do not need to bereceived in any particular order. The protocol enables filters to ensure that a valid replicationis possible using a minimum knowledge argument. The protocol also enables replicas topartially replicate using filtered knowledge.,*,2008,36
A programming model for active documents,Paul Dourish; W Keith Edwards; Jon Howell; Anthony LaMarca; John Lamping; Karin Petersen; Michael Salisbury; Doug Terry; Jim Thornton,ABSTRACT Traditionally; designers organize software system as active end-points (egapplications) linked by passive infrastructures (eg networks). Increasingly; however;networks and infrastructures are becoming active components that contribute directly toapplication behavior. Amongst the various problems that this presents is the question of howsuch active infrastructures should be programmed. We have been developing an activedocument management system called Placeless Documents. Its programming model isorganized in terms of properties that actively contribute to the functionality and behavior ofthe documents to which they are attached. This paper discusses active properties and theiruse as a programming model for active infrastructures. We have found that active propertiesenable the creation of persistent; autonomous active entities in document systems …,Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,2000,36
Policy-based access control for weakly consistent replication,Ted Wobber; Thomas L Rodeheffer; Douglas B Terry,Abstract Combining access control with weakly consistent replication presents a challenge ifthe resulting system is to support eventual consistency. If authorization policy can betemporarily inconsistent; any given operation may be permitted at one node and yet deniedat another. This is especially troublesome when the operation in question involves a changein policy. Without a careful design; permanently divergent state can result. We describe andevaluate the design and implementation of an access control system for weakly consistentreplication where peers are not uniformly trusted. Our system allows for the specification offine-grained access control policy over a collection of replicated items. Policies areexpressed using a logical assertion framework and access control decisions are logicalproofs. Policy can grow to encompass new nodes through fine-grain delegation of …,Proceedings of the 5th European conference on Computer systems,2010,34
Managing stored voice in the etherphone system,D Terry; D Swinehart,Abstract The Etherphone™ system was developed at Xerox PARC to explore methods ofintegrating voice into existing distributed personal computing environments. An importantcomponent of the Etherphone system; the voice manager; provides operations for recording;playing; editing; and otherwise manipulating digitized voice based on an abstraction that wecall voice ropes. It was designed to allow: unrestricted use of voice in client applications;sharing among various clients; editing of voice by programs; integration of diverseworkstations into the system; security at least as good as that of conventional file servers;and automatic reclamation of the storage occupied by unneeded voice. As with text; we wantthe ability to incorporate voice easily into electronic mail messages; voice-annotateddocuments; user interfaces; and other interactive applications.

Systems and methods for replicating data stores,*,Systems and methods for replicating replicas in a sync community. Each replica in the synccommunity stores knowledge that represents changes the replica is aware of. Because eachreplica has its own knowledge; each replica does not need to know how many replicas arein the sync community or the topology of the sync community. By sending the knowledgewith a request for changes; a replicating replica can enumerate the changes to replicate bycomparing its knowledge with the received knowledge. After replication; the knowledge isupdated. Knowledge may also include made-with-knowledge change IDs that permit eachresolution to identify what a replica was aware of when a particular change was made. Themade-with-knowledge values are used to detect conflicts during replication.,*,2008,31
An analysis of naming conventions for distributed computer systems,Douglas B Terry,Abstract Name servers that collectively manage a global name space facilitate sharing ofresources in a large internetwork by providing means of locating named objects. Theefficiency with which the name space can be managed is strongly influenced by the adoptednaming convention. Structured name spaces are shown to simplify name spacemanagement from both an administrative and system viewpoint. Formulae have beenderived which allow one to quantitatively measure the effect of the distributed name serverconfiguration on a given client's level of performance. In general; the cost of a name serverquery can be reduced by distributing replicated copies of name server database entries in away that exploits the locality of clients' reference patterns.,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,1984,31
Peer-to-peer replication in WinFS,Lev Novik; Irena Hudis; Doug Terry; Sanjay Anand; Vivek J Jhaveri; Ashish Shah; Yunxin Wu,Abstract WinFS; Microsoft's new application storage platform; incorporates a novel peer-to-peer; knowledge-driven; state-based replication protocol. The goal is to support diverseapplications requiring replication for easy sharing; high availability; and offline access. Thesystem was designed to scale from a handful of personal computing devices in a homeenvironment to thousands of servers that are globally distributed. Like other weaklyconsistent replicated systems; the WinFS replication model allows update operations to beperformed on any machine without locking. Updated data items are sent between replicas ina lazy fashion via a pair-wise synchronization protocol. The technical contributions of theprotocol's design include minimizing replication-specific state and efficiently propagatingupdates while allowing arbitrary synchronization topologies; detecting conflicting updates …,*,2006,29
Docx2go: collaborative editing of fidelity reduced documents on mobile devices,Krishna PN Puttaswamy; Catherine C Marshall; Venugopalan Ramasubramanian; Patrick Stuedi; Douglas B Terry; Ted Wobber,Abstract Docx2Go is a new framework to support editing of shared documents on mobiledevices. Three high-level requirements influenced its design--namely; the need to adaptcontent; especially textual content; on the fly according to the quality of the networkconnection and the form factor of each device; support for concurrent; uncoordinated editingon different devices; whose effects will later be merged on all devices in a convergent andconsistent manner without sacrificing the semantics of the edits; and a flexible replicationarchitecture that accommodates both device-to-device and cloud-mediated synchronization.Docx2Go supports on-the-go editing for XML documents; such as documents in MicrosoftWord and other commonly used formats.

Concise version vectors in WinFS,Dahlia Malkhi; Doug Terry,Abstract Conflicts naturally arise in optimistically replicated systems. The common way todetect update conflicts is via version vectors; whose storage and communication overheadare number of replicas× number of objects. These costs may be prohibitive for largesystems. This paper presents predecessor vectors with exceptions (PVEs); a novel optimisticreplication technique developed for Microsoft's WinFS system. The paper contains asystematic study of PVE's performance gains over traditional schemes.

Systems and methods for the propagation of conflict resolution to enforce item convergence (ie; data convergence),*,Various embodiments of the present invention are directed to systems and method fordetecting conflicts and applying conflict resolutions during manual and automatic conflictresolution operations. Several embodiments are directed to preventing both:(a) non-convergence of conflict resolutions; where partners can end up in a divergent steady state(ie have different data in the absence of outstanding conflicts); and (b) a non-terminatingping-pong of conflict resolutions between partners (which can occur with certain inefficientsolutions that continuously update metadata for each conflict resolution without end). Certainspecific embodiments of the present invention are directed to a method for maintainingknowledge that guarantees convergence of data; even when different partners applydifferent conflict resolutions.,*,2009,26
Dealing with tentative data values in disconnected work groups,Marvin Theimer; Alan Demers; Karin Petersen; Mike Spreitzer; Douglas Terry; Brent Welch,The paper describes a problem of weakly consistent replicated data systems used in supportof disconnected groups of people. The problem concerns actions and updates derived fromtentative data updates that are ultimately determined to be in conflict. While some suchactions and updates can be automatically resolved; many require human intervention.Furthermore; although some file and database systems support internal conflict detectionand resolution; derived actions may be external to those systems; implying that human usersmust ensure that proper consistency is maintained between independent components of thesystem. The entire problem becomes exacerbated when disconnected work groups aretaken into account; where tentative data values may be seen and acted upon by multiplepeople.,Mobile Computing Systems and Applications; 1994.

Active Tioga documents: an exploration of two paradigms,Douglas B.  Terry; Donald G.  Baker,SUMMARY The advent of electronic media has changed the way we think about documents.Documents with illustrations; spreadsheets; and mathematical formulae have becomecommonplace; but documents with active components have been rare. This paper focuseson our extensions to the Tioga editor to support two very different styles of active documents.One paradigm involves dynamically computing; or at least transforming; the contents of adocument as it is displayed. A second paradigm uses notifications of edits to a document totrigger activities. Document activities can include database queries; which are evaluatedand placed in the document upon opening the document; or constraints between portions ofa document; which are maintained as the user edits the document. The resulting activedocuments can be viewed; edited; filed; and mailed in the same way as regular …,Electronic Publishing,1990,25
StarTrack Next Generation: A Scalable Infrastructure for Track-Based Applications.,Maya Haridasan; Iqbal Mohomed; Doug Terry; Chandramohan A Thekkath; Li Zhang,Abstract StarTrack was the first service designed to manage tracks of GPS locationcoordinates obtained from mobile devices and to facilitate the construction of track-basedapplications. Our early attempts to build practical applications on StarTrack revealedsubstantial efficiency and scalability problems; including frequent client-server roundtrips;unnecessary data transfers; costly similarity comparisons involving thousands of tracks; andpoor fault-tolerance. To remedy these limitations; we revised the overall system architecture;API; and implementation. The API was extended to operate on collections of tracks ratherthan individual tracks; delay query execution; and permit caching of query results. New datastructures; namely track trees; were introduced to speed the common operation of searchingfor similar tracks. Map matching algorithms were adopted to convert each track into a …,OSDI,2010,24
Replicated data management for mobile computing,Douglas B Terry,Abstract Managing data in a mobile computing environment invariably involves caching orreplication. In many cases; a mobile device has access only to data that is stored locally; andmuch of that data arrives via replication from other devices; PCs; and services. Givenportable devices with limited resources; weak or intermittent connectivity; and securityvulnerabilities; data replication serves to increase availability; reduce communication costs;foster sharing; and enhance survivability of critical information. Mobile systems haveemployed a variety of distributed architectures from client–server caching to peer-to-peerreplication. Such systems generally provide weak consistency models in which read andupdate operations can be performed at any replica without coordination with other devices.The design of a replication protocol then centers on issues of how to record; propagate …,Synthesis Lectures on Mobile and Pervasive Computing,2008,24
Delegation through access control programs,Marvin M Theimer; David A Nichols; Douglas B Terry,Access control programs (ACPs); which permit controlled delegation of access rights tountrusted computer hosts; are discussed. Existing delegation protocols for distributedsystems provide a way for a client to transfer its access rights to an intermediary; but provideonly limited facilities for restricting the rights granted to the intermediary. ACPs are smallprograms that encode arbitrary specifications of delegated access rights. They are createdand digitally signed by a client and passed to a server through an intermediary. Whenprocessing a request from the intermediary; the server executes the access control programto decide whether or not to grant the intermediary's request. Examples of ACPs used in avariety of applications are presented. A sample implementation of ACPs in the Andrew FileSystem is described.,Distributed Computing Systems; 1992.; Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on,1992,24
Structure-free Name Management for Evolving Distributed Environments.,Douglas B Terry,Abstract: Name services facilitate sharing in distributed environments by allowing objects tobe named unambiguously and maintaining a set of application-defined attributes for eachnamed object. Existing distributed name services; which manage names based on theirsyntactic structure; may lack the flexibility needed by large; diverse; and evolving computingcommunities. A new approach; structure-free name management; separates three activities:choosing names; selecting the storage sites for object attributes; and resolving an object'sname to its attributes. Administrative entities apportion the responsibility for managingvarious names; while the name service's information needed to locate an object's attributescan be independently reconfigured to improve performance or meet changing demands.,ICDCS,1986,19
Fidelity-aware replication for mobile devices,Kaushik Veeraraghavan; Venugopalan Ramasubramanian; Thomas L Rodeheffer; Douglas B Terry; Ted Wobber,Abstract Mobile devices often store data in reduced resolutions or custom formats in order toaccommodate resource constraints and tailor-made software.

Exo-leasing: Escrow synchronization for mobile clients of commodity storage servers,Liuba Shrira; Hong Tian; Doug Terry,Abstract Escrow reservations is a well-known synchronization technique; useful for inventorycontrol; that avoids conflicts by taking into account the semantics of fragmentable objecttypes. Unfortunately; current escrow techniques cannot be used on generic" commodity"servers because they require the servers to run the type-specific synchronization code. Thisis a severe limitation for systems that require application-specific synchronization but needto rely on generic components. Our exo-leasing method provides a new way to implementescrow synchronization without running any type-specific code in the servers. Instead;escrow synchronization code runs in the client providing the ability to use commodityservers. Running synchronization code in the client provides an additional benefit. Unlikeany other system; our system allows a disconnected client to obtain escrow reservation …,Proceedings of the 9th ACM/IFIP/USENIX International Conference on Middleware,2008,18
Effective and efficient compromise recovery for weakly consistent replication,Prince Mahajan; Ramakrishna Kotla; Catherine C Marshall; Venugopalan Ramasubramanian; Thomas L Rodeheffer; Douglas B Terry; Ted Wobber,Abstract Weakly consistent replication of data has become increasingly important both forloosely-coupled collections of personal devices and for large-scale infrastructure services.Unfortunately; automatic replication mechanisms are agnostic about the quality of the datathey replicate. Inappropriate updates; whether malicious or simply the result of misuse;propagate automatically and quickly. The consequences may not be noticed until days later;when the corrupted data has been fully replicated; thereby deleting or overwriting all tracesof the valid data. In this sort of situation; it can be hard or impossible to restore an entiredistributed system to a clean state without losing data and disrupting users. Polygraph is asoftware layer that extends the functionality of weakly consistent replication systems tosupport compromise recovery.

Weakly-consistent distributed collection compromised replica recovery,*,A system is disclosed for recovery from a compromise of a replica in a weakly-consistentdistributed collection. The system employs a collection manager for revoking a compromisedreplica; and one or more archival replicas for storing time-stamped versions. Upon acompromise; versions tainted by the compromised replica may be expunged from thecollection. Thereafter; versions determined to be unaffected by the compromise may bereturned to the collection using the time-stamped versions stored in the one or more archivalreplicas.,*,2008,17

The Walnut mail system built at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center wasrecently redesigned to take better advantage of its underlying database facilities. The abilityto pose ad-hoc queries with a" fill-in-the-form" browser allows people to browse their mailquickly and effectively; while database access paths guarantee fast retrieval of storedinformation. Careful consideration of the systems' usage was reflected in both the databaseschema representation and the user-interface for browsing mail.,VLDB,1988,15

Caching of XML Web Services for Disconnected Operation,Rama Ramasubramanian; Doug Terry,Abstract Caching can permit mobile applications to utilize XML Web services in the face ofintermittent connectivity. However; Web services present a number of challenges to cachemanagers since they have generally been designed without regard to caching and henceprovide little support. The WSDL description of a Web service; for instance; specifies theSOAP message formats needed to invoke service operations but does not indicate whichoperations modify the service's persistent state or will likely produce different results ondifferent invocations. We developed tools for generating custom cache managers that tailortheir behavior based on annotations added to a Web service's WSDL specification. Anexperiment to transparently interject a cache between existing XML Web services and theirclients running on mobile devices demonstrated that disconnected operation could be …,*,2004,10
Caching documents with active properties,Eyal De Lara; Karin Petersen; Douglas B Terry; Anthony LaMarca; Jim Thornton; Michael Salisbury; Paul Dourish; Keith Edwards; John Lamping,Caching in the Placeless Documents system poses new challenges because users canattach active properties to documents. Active properties can modify the document's contentas seen by a user. Thus; the caching mechanisms must take into account that a document'scontent not only depends on when the document was last modified; but also on the set ofpersonal and universal properties attached to the document and the information on whichthese properties depend. Interestingly; active properties can be used to help cachesmanage their contents by notifying them of events that affect cache consistency; by providingcaches with document-specific verifiers to further check on a document's consistency; and byreturning information that can aid in decisions of which documents to cache.,Hot Topics in Operating Systems; 1999.

Hierarchical synchronization of replicas,*,A hierarchical system is disclosed for synchronizing partially-replicated collections thatprovides guaranteed paths of information to all replicas in a collection. Each partial replica isassigned a parent replica to act as a proxy on its behalf; and with which the replicasynchronizes regularly. Each parent replica is responsible for one or more child replicas.Parent replicas have filters which are either the same as; or more inclusive than; their childreplicas; and parent replicas thus store and synchronize all objects that are of interest totheir one or more child replicas.,*,2009,7
Item-set knowledge for partial replica synchronization,*,A system is disclosed for synchronizing partially-replicated collections while keepingsynchronization overhead low by using the concept of item-set knowledge. Item-setknowledge uses knowledge fragments; which associate knowledge vectors with item-sets.An item-set consists of an explicitly represented list of items. In a partial replica; this item setmay be the items known to a replica within which a filter is applied limiting the items knownto some subset of the overall items in the collection.,*,2008,7
Replication in an information filtering system,Douglas B Terry,In the Tapestry system developed at Xerox PARC; users provide queries to filter incomingstreams of documents.

If IoT systems aren't as reliable as thetraditional systems they're replac- ing; they will fall short of user expectations. In this article; DougTerry of Samsung Research America discusses the core issues that need to be addressed andsome potential solutions. –Roy Want … EDITOR ROY WANT Google; roywant@google.com… › the motion sensor cou ld fail to detect a person; perhaps because the sensor's battery isdead; or it could detect a person but fail to inform the application due to communicationoutages; › the light bulb could fail to turn on because it has burned out or lost the network connectionto its hub; › either hub could fail; cutting o communication to the attached devices; › the …,Computer,2016,3
Consistency-based service-level agreements in cloud storage environments,*,An application programming interface is provided that allows applications to assign multipleservice-level agreements to their data transactions. The service-level agreements includelatency bounds and consistency guarantees. The applications may assign utility values toeach of the service-level agreements. A monitor component monitors the various replicanodes in a cloud storage system for latency and consistency; and when a transaction isreceived from an application; the monitor determines which of the replica nodes can likelyfulfill the transaction in satisfaction of any of the service-level agreements. Where multipleservice-level agreements can be satisfied; the replica node that can fulfill the transactionaccording to the service-level agreement with the greatest utility is selected. The applicationmay be charged for the transaction based on the utility of the service-level agreement that …,*,2015,3
Supporting research collaboration through bi-level file synchronization,Catherine C Marshall; Ted Wobber; Venugopalan Ramasubramanian; Douglas B Terry,Abstract In this paper; we describe the design and use of Cimetric; a file synchronizationapplication that supports scholarly collaboration. The system design incorporates results ofearlier studies that suggest replicating content on a user's personal devices may havedifferent characteristics than replicating content to share it with collaborators. To realize thisdistinction; Cimetric performs bi-level synchronization: it synchronizes local copies of aversioned repository among collaborators' computers; while it separately synchronizesprivate working files between each user's personal devices. Through a year's worth of in-house use of Cimetric in a variety of configurations; we were able to investigate key filesynchronization issues; including the role of cloud storage given the ability to sync betweenpeers; the strengths and weaknesses of a bi-level design; and which aspects of the …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM international conference on Supporting group work,2012,3
Policy-based access control for peer-to-peer replication,Ted Wobber; Thomas L Rodeheffer; Douglas B Terry,Abstract Security is difficult to reason about in weakly-consistent distributed systems whereupdates to replicated state propagate lazily. In particular; if different replicas make differentdecisions about allowing a new update; then permanently divergent state can result. In thispaper; we describe and evaluate the design and implementation of an access-controlsystem for weakly-consistent replication where peers are not uniformly trusted. Our systemallows for the specification of fine-grained access control policy over a collection ofreplicated items; as well as delegation of the authority to make new policy. Policies areexpressed and evaluated using the SecPAL logical assertion framework [6]; and they arepropagated as data by the replication system that they protect. Eventual consistency ispreserved despite the possibility of temporarily inconsistent access control policy.,Microsoft Research; Silicon Valley; Aug,2008,3
Fast encounter-based synchronization for mobile devices,Daniel Peek; Douglas B Terry; Venugopalan Ramasubramanian; Meg Walraed-Sullivan; Thomas L Rodeheffer; Ted Wobber,The large and growing number of computing devices used by individuals has caused thechallenges of distributed storage to take on increased importance. In addition to desktopsand laptops; portable devices; such as cell phones; digital cameras; iPods; and PDAs arecapable of storing and sharing data. These devices' mobility coupled with wirelessnetworking capabilities allows them to opportunistically propagate data to other devices theymight encounter; even if connectivity is unplanned and transient. To take advantage of suchad hoc connectivity; devices must have an efficient method for determining which files theyhold in common and which versions must be propagated to achieve consistency. This paperpresents new techniques for reducing the cost of this data synchronization operation by overan order of magnitude in many situations.,Digital Information Management; 2007.

Framework for track-based mobile applications,*,Tracks associated with a first user are identified by a computing device. Each track mayinclude location identifiers. The identified tracks are clustered to generate a composite trackfor the first user by the computing device. At least one track that is similar to the compositetrack is identified by the computing device. The at least one track may be associated with auser other than the first user. Information related to the identified at least one track that issimilar to the composite track is provided by the computing device through a network.,*,2011,2
The Duality between Message Routing and Epidemic Data Replication.,Peter Gilbert; Venugopalan Ramasubramanian; Patrick Stuedi; Douglas B Terry,Abstract Several domains of networking such as Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs); Mobile Adhoc Networks (MANETs); and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks have the common goal oftransporting messages to their intended destinations. These networking domains sharemany requirements and employ routing protocols that are often composed of similarmechanisms. In this paper; we explore the synergy between message routing and datareplication and propose the use of topology-independent weakly consistent partialreplication systems as a messaging substrate for the above networking domains. Thesereplication systems provide the key properties of eventual consistency; disruption tolerance;and at-most-once delivery; which translate into guaranteed delivery; failure resilience; andbandwidth efficiency—three much desired and repeatedly implemented aspects of …,HotNets,2009,2
StarTrack: A Framework for Enabling Track-Based Applications,Maya Haridasan; Iqbal Mohomed; Doug Terry; A Chandramohan,ABSTRACT Mobile devices are increasingly equipped with hardware and software servicesallowing them to determine their locations; but support for building location-awareapplications remains rudimentary. This paper proposes tracks of location coordinates as ahigh-level abstraction for a new class of mobile applications including ride sharing; location-based collaboration; and health monitoring. Each track is a sequence of entries recording aperson's time; location; and applicationspecific data. StarTrack provides applications with acomprehensive set of operations for recording; comparing; clustering and querying tracks.StarTrack can efficiently operate on thousands of tracks.,6th International conference on Mobile Systems; applications and services; University of California,2009,2

Accumulating star knowledge in replicated data protocol,*,A distributed system includes full and partial replicas of a set of data items that may beinserted; modified; or deleted by any replica. Replicas may occasionally synchronize withother arbitrarily chosen replicas to learn about updates. A replica's knowledge includes oneor more knowledge fragments; where each fragment indicates a set of items. A type ofknowledge fragment; called a star knowledge fragment; contains versions associated withall items in the system. Star knowledge fragments are compact because the set of itemsstored at a replica need not be explicitly listed. Once all replicas know of all updates in thesystem; partial and full replicas will have the same compact star knowledge fragment.,*,2012,1
Multiple fidelity level item replication and integration,*,A distributed system synchronizes replica devices with respect to items that may be inserted;modified; or deleted by any of the replica devices.

The low-fidelity replicationplatforms may synchronize low-fidelity versions of items among the replica devices; and thehigh-fidelity replication platforms may synchronize high-fidelity versions of items among thereplica devices. Each replica device may include a fidelity manager that copies high-fidelityversions of items from the high-fidelity replication platform; generates low-fidelity versions ofthe items from the high-fidelity versions of the items; and adds the low-fidelity versions of theitems to the low-fidelity replication platforms.

Rivulet: a fault-tolerant platform for smart-home applications,Masoud Saeida Ardekani; Rayman Preet Singh; Nitin Agrawal; Douglas B Terry; Riza O Suminto,Abstract Rivulet is a fault-tolerant distributed platform for running smart-home applications; itcan tolerate failures typical for a home environment (eg; link losses; network partitions;sensor failures; and device crashes). In contrast to existing cloud-centric solutions; whichrely exclusively on a home gateway device; Rivulet leverages redundant smart consumerappliances (eg; TVs; Refrigerators) to spread sensing and actuation across devices local tothe home; and avoids making the Smart-Home Hub a single point of failure. Rivulet ensuresevent delivery in the presence of link loss; network partitions and other failures in the home;to enable applications with reliable sensing in the case of sensor failures; and eventprocessing in the presence of device crashes. In this paper; we present the design andimplementation of Rivulet; and evaluate its effective handling of failures in a smart home.,Proceedings of the 18th ACM/IFIP/USENIX Middleware Conference,2017,*
Cloud Storage Services: A Model of (In) Consistency,Douglas Terry,Summary form only given. Cloud storage systems invariably replicate data for highavailability and low latency access. Application designers; as well as cloud providers; mustdeal with trade-offs between consistency; performance; and availability. Some cloudservices provide strong data consistency to their clients while others have chosen eventualconsistency. Increasingly; systems are offering a choice of consistency when reading shareddata. This talk examines the implications of such a choice and explores a broader class ofconsistency guarantees that can; and perhaps should; be provided within the cloud.,Cloud Engineering (IC2E); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,*

Quantifying the Efficiency; Scalability; and Robustness of WinFS Replication,Doug Terry,Abstract The WinFS storage platform supports update-anywhere; peer-to-peer datareplication. Due to the wide range of possible system configurations; we study theperformance of the novel data replication protocol using simulation. Of interest are howmany network messages are sent; the convergence time needed for a modified data objectto be propagated to all sites; and how messages and convergence time are affected byfailures in the network. The results for configurations of various real and synthetic networktopologies show an efficient network utilization since each site receives each modification atmost once despite the peer-to-peer architecture. In addition; convergence time is shown tobe scalable as the number of sites increases. Finally; the protocol's robustness to link andsite failures is quantified and shown to provide good performance in the face of lost …,*,2006,*

A Methodology for Building RPC-based Distributed Systems,Douglas B Terry,Abstract: When constructing distributed systems based on the remote procedure callparadigm; designers must be aware that local and remote interfaces have different; oftenconflicting; goals. Remote interfaces should be designed to utilize bandwidth effectively;minimize round-trip delays; deal with partial failures; and accommodate RPC semantics.Remote interfaces may need to be tuned based on observed usage. Local interfaces; on theother hand; should be stable and designed for ease of use by programmers. Arecommended design technique is to define both a local and remote interface for eachremote service. Remote interfaces can then evolve to incorporate caching; rebinding; andother optimizations without affecting their cleanly designed local counterparts.,*,2000,*

Naming and Caching in Large Distributed Computing Environments,Douglas Brian Terry,Abstract Name services facilitate sharing in distributed environments by allowing objects tobe named unambiguously and maintaining a set of application-defined attributes for eachnamed object. Existing distributed name services; which manage names based on theirsyntactic structure; may lack the flexibility needed by large; diverse; and evolving computingcommunities. A new approach; structure-free name man-agement; separates three activities:choosing names; selecting the storage sites for object attributes; and resolving an object'sname to its attributes. Administrative entities apportion the responsibility for managingvarious names; while the name service's information needed to locate an object's attributescan be independently reconfigured to improve performance or meet changing demands.

4.13 Specifying; Reasoning About; Optimizing; and Implementing Atomic Data Services for Distributed Systems: Alexander A. Shvartsman,Doug Terry; Sebastian Burckhardt,Sharing memory in networked systems is nicer than message passing; otherwise wewouldn't be here talking about consistency! This requires replication for availability and fault-tolerance; with replication comes the challenge of consistency. The easiest notion for usersis the one-copy view (eg; linearizability); but this is expensive. A cheaper guarantee is: aread sees some subset of the previous writes; but this is too hard to use. Between the “slowbut correct” approach; eg; linearizability; vs.“fast but wrong;” ie; weak consistency; thedesirable goal is “fast enough and correct.” In dynamic systems new challenges arise due toreplicas coming; going; and failing. Such systems must be reconfigurable; and variousapproaches explored the use of state machine replication; consensus; and groupcommunication.
