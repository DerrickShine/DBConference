Many SERS-activenanostructures have been investigated; but they suffer from poor reproducibility of the SERS-active sites; and the wide distribution of their enhancement factor values results in anunquantifiable SERS signal. Here; we show that DNA on gold nanoparticles facilitates theformation of well-defined gold nanobridged nanogap particles (Au-NNP) that generate ahighly stable and reproducible SERS signal. The uniform and hollow gap (∼ 1 nm) betweenthe gold core and gold shell can be precisely loaded with a quantifiable amount of Ramandyes.

Mimicking such nanostructures found in nature; however;requires state-of-the-art nanofabrication techniques that are slow; expensive and notscalable. Herein; we demonstrate high-resolution patterning of multiple structural colourswithin seconds; based on successive tuning and fixing of colour using a single materialalong with a maskless lithography system. We have invented a material called 'M-Ink'; thecolour of which is tunable by magnetically changing the periodicity of the nanostructure andfixable by photochemically immobilizing those structures in a polymer network.

Guided and fluidic self-assembly of microstructures using railed microfluidic channels,Su Eun Chung; Wook Park; Sunghwan Shin; Seung Ah Lee; Sunghoon Kwon,Abstract Fluidic self-assembly is a promising pathway for parallel fabrication of devicesmade up of many small components. Here; we introduce 'railed microfluidics' as an agilemethod to guide and assemble microstructures inside fluidic channels. The guidedmovement of microstructures in microfluidic channels was achieved by fabricating grooves('rails') on the top surface of the channels and also creating complementary polymericmicrostructures that fit with the grooves. Using the rails as a guiding mechanism; we builtcomplex one-and two-dimensional microsystems in which all the microstructures initiallyinvolved in the fabrication method were incorporated as components in the final product.Complex structures composed of more than 50 microstructures (each sized smaller than 50μm) were fluidically self-assembled with zero error.

Fabrication of large number density platinum nanowire arrays by size reduction lithography and nanoimprint lithography,X-M Yan; S Kwon; AM Contreras; J Bokor; GA Somorjai,Large number density Pt nanowires with typical dimensions of 12 μm× 20 nm× 5 nm(length× width× height) are fabricated on planar oxide supports. First sub-20 nm singlecrystalline silicon nanowires are fabricated by size reduction lithography; and then the Sinanowire pattern is replicated to produce a large number of Pt nanowires by nanoimprintlithography. The width and height of the Pt nanowires are uniform and are controlled withnanometer precision. The nanowire number density is 4× 104 cm-1; resulting in a Pt surfacearea larger than 2 cm2 on a 5× 5 cm2 oxide substrate.

Rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing by tracking single cell growth in a microfluidic agarose channel system,Jungil Choi; Yong-Gyun Jung; Jeewoo Kim; Sungbum Kim; Yushin Jung; Hunjong Na; Sunghoon Kwon,Sepsis is one of the major causes of death in the US; necessitating rapid treatment withproper antibiotics. Conventional systems for antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) take far toolong (16–24 h) for the timely treatment of sepsis. This is because they rely on measuringoptical density; which relates to bacterial growth; to determine the minimal inhibitoryconcentrations (MICs) of relevant antibiotics. Thus; there is a desperate need for moreimproved and rapid AST (RAST) systems. The RAST system can also reduce the growingnumber of clinical problems that are associated with antibiotic resistance caused bymethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus;and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

Size dependent damping in picosecond dynamics of single nanomagnets,A Barman; S Wang; J Maas; AR Hawkins; S Kwon; J Bokor; A Liddle; H Schmidt,The authors use time-resolved cavity-enhanced magneto-optical Kerr spectroscopy to studythe damping of magnetization precession in individual cylindrical nickel nanomagnets. Awide range of shapes (diameters of 5 μ m–125 nm and aspect ratio: 0.03–1.2) isinvestigated. They observe a pronounced difference in damping between the micro-andnanomagnets. Microscale magnets show large damping at low bias fields; whereasnanomagnets exhibit bias field-independent damping. This behavior is explained by theinteraction of in-plane and out-of-plane precession modes in microscale magnets thatresults in additional dissipative channels. The small and robust damping values on thenanoscale are promising for implementation of controlled precessional switching schemesin nanomagnetic devices.,Applied physics letters,2007,50
Biomimetic 3D tissue models for advanced high-throughput drug screening,Ki-Hwan Nam; Alec ST Smith; Saifullah Lone; Sunghoon Kwon; Deok-Ho Kim,Most current drug screening assays used to identify new drug candidates are 2D cell-basedsystems; even though such in vitro assays do not adequately re-create the in vivo complexityof 3D tissues. Inadequate representation of the human tissue environment during apreclinical test can result in inaccurate predictions of compound effects on overall tissuefunctionality. Screening for compound efficacy by focusing on a single pathway or proteintarget; coupled with difficulties in maintaining long-term 2D monolayers; can serve toexacerbate these issues when using such simplistic model systems for physiological drugscreening applications.

Individually photopatterned 2D microstructures are axis-translated from in-plane to out-of-plane and fluidically self-assembled; guided by side-railsin microfluidic channels to form a 3D morphology. Since the structures are fabricated influidic environments; there are no fixed initial points on the channel substrate allowing fluidichorizontal stacking of erected 2D structures.

Capillary based patterning of cellular communities in laterally open channels,Sung Hoon Lee; Austen James Heinz; Sunghwan Shin; Yong-Gyun Jung; Sung-Eun Choi; Wook Park; Jung-Hye Roe; Sunghoon Kwon,In order to offer an easier way to study interactions between multiple cellular populations; wehave developed a novel method to precisely place cells in a variety of nonoverlappingpatterns using surface tension in laterally open microchannels. Our design is fundamentallydifferent from previous strategies such as compartmentalization; stamping; stenciling; ormechanical approaches. It relies on capillary action or the propensity for liquid to move morereadily through narrow spaces as a result of surface tension. Until now; capillary basedpatterning has been limited to coating chemically isolated areas. Here; we demonstrate;through use of surface tension and controlled flooding; that it is possible to pattern multiplecells and proteins using laterally open channels in a variety of designs.

Harvesting such energy may be particularly advantageous inenvironment sensing and surveillance monitoring. For example; replacing the batteries for awireless network monitoring hundreds of remote sensors would likely be difficult; and self-sustained systems could reduce maintenance costs.

The potential energy of a moisturegradient can be converted inside the composite actuator and stored as elastic potentialenergy; and then used to produce mechanical work or to create electricity.,Science,2013,15

Embedded biofilm; a new biofilm model based on the embedded growth of bacteria,Yong-Gyun Jung; Jungil Choi; Soo-Kyoung Kim; Joon-Hee Lee; Sunghoon Kwon,ABSTRACT A variety of systems have been developed to study biofilm formation. However;most systems are based on the surface-attached growth of microbes under shear stress. Inthis study; we designed a microfluidic channel device; called a microfluidic agarose channel(MAC); and found that microbial cells in the MAC system formed an embedded cellaggregative structure (ECAS). ECASs were generated from the embedded growth ofbacterial cells in an agarose matrix and better mimicked the clinical environment of biofilmsformed within mucus or host tissue under shear-free conditions. ECASs were developedwith the production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS); the most important featureof biofilms; and eventually burst to release planktonic cells; which resembles the fulldevelopmental cycle of biofilms.

Uniform Drug Loading into Prefabricated Microparticles by Freeze‐Drying,Seo Woo Song; Hyung Jong Bae; Sudeok Kim; Dong Yoon Oh; Okju Kim; Yunjin Jeong; Sunghoon Kwon,Abstract Microparticle-based drug delivery is a promising technology for small volumebioassay platforms. The general utilization of the drug-loaded microparticles in the in vitrobioassay platforms requires the drug loading method; which should impregnate the generaldrug types (eg; water insoluble) with high payload into the variously designedmicroparticles. Loading the drug into the prefabricated microparticles using solventevaporation satisfies the requirement. However; similar to the “coffee-ring effect;” drugs areloaded in a seriously nonuniform manner; caused by the capillary flow during theevaporation process.

S-613 Potential usefulness of direct rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing in blood culture,Jeong Han Kim; Sang Hoon Song; Sunghoon Kwon; Pyoeng Gyn Choe; Eu Suk Kim; Hong Bin Kim; Wan Beom Park,Background: Antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) is essential for choosing an accuratetreatment of bacterial infections. Current AST requires at least 48h when a first blood culture(BC) is positive on direct smear examination (DSE). Thus; initial empirical antibiotictreatment is often inadequate; increasing rates of ineffective treatment or unnecessary broadspectrum antibiotic use. Direct rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing (dRAST) based onanalyzing change of single bacterial cell under antibiotic condition detects antibioticresistance in 4-6h after unveiling of DSE results and is expected to help more accurateselection of antibiotic. Objective: To assess accuracy of dRAST and evaluate its potentialusefulness to improve selection of adequate antibiotic in clinical practice settings.

Photonic bandgap fusion by magnetically aligned 3D photonic bandgap structures,Hyoki Kim; Eun-Geun Kim; Sung-Eun Choi; Lily Nari Kim; Sunghoon Kwon,As can be found on the wings of a butterfly or feathers of a peacock; structural color results fromthe interaction of light with sub-wavelength structures.

Due to its unique characteristics; many techniques to fabricateartificial structural color have been reported [1;2].

Signal Enhancement of Time-resolved Magneto-optic Measurements on Individual Nanomagnets,Suqin Wang; Naser Qureshi; Mark A Lowther; Aaron R Hawkins; Sunghoon Kwon; Alexander Liddle; Jeffrey Bokor; Holger Schmidt,The sensitivity of magneto-optic Kerr measurements of nanomagnetic structures issignificantly improved using cavity enhancement to increase the Kerr signal by depositingdielectric layers on the magnetic surface under study. We discuss different strategies tooptimize the use of cavity enhancement for observation of nanomagnets. We show thatmaximization of the Kerr rotation from magnetic structures results in higher sensitivity formagnetic films; but does not yield the highest sensitivity for nanomagnets. Instead; the use ofan anti-reflection coating on the substrate surrounding the magnet in conjunction with indexoptimization of the enhancement layer can increase the Kerr signal by more than two ordersof magnitude in the deep nanometer range; and enables detection of individualnanomagnets using conventional far-field Kerr microscopy.,2006 16th Biennial University/Government/Industry Microelectronics Symposium,2006,*

Using the micro-dilution method; automated AST systems have beendeveloped. The system consume relatively large amount of bacteria and test time because itmeasures optical density (OD) for bacterial growth to determine the minimal inhibitoryconcentrations (MICs) of relevant antibiotics. We have invented a new microfluidic channelsystem for AST to reduce both amount of bacteria and test time dramatically. The agarosebased microfulidic channel system fixes bacterial cell and tracks single cell growth to reduceAST assay time and to determine MICs of antibiotics.
