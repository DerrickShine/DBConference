Processing private queries over untrusted data cloud through privacy homomorphism,Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu; Chushi Ren; Byron Choi,Query processing that preserves both the data privacy of the owner and the query privacy ofthe client is a new research problem. It shows increasing importance as cloud computingdrives more businesses to outsource their data and querying services. However; mostexisting studies; including those on data outsourcing; address the data privacy and queryprivacy separately and cannot be applied to this problem. In this paper; we propose aholistic and efficient solution that comprises a secure traversal framework and an encryptionscheme based on privacy homomorphism. The framework is scalable to large datasets byleveraging an index-based approach. Based on this framework; we devise secure protocolsfor processing typical queries such as k-nearest-neighbor queries (kNN) on R-tree index.Moreover; several optimization techniques are presented to improve the efficiency of the …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,188
What are real DTDs like,Byron Choi,Abstract DTDs have proved important in a variety of areas: transformations between XMLand databases; XML storage; XML publishing; consistency analysis of XML specifications;typechecking; and optimization of XML queries. Much of this work depends on certainassumptions about DTDs; eg; the absence of recursion and non-determinism. With thiscomes the need to justify these assumptions against DTDs in the real world. This papersurveys a number of DTDs collected from the Web; and provides statistics with respect to avariety of criteria commonly discussed in XML resesarch.,Technical Reports (CIS),2002,147
-Implementing XQuery 1.0: The Galax Experience,Mary Fernández; Jérôme Siméon; Byron Choi; Amélie Marian; Gargi Sur,This chapter demonstrates the Galax system as well as its most advanced features;including support for XPath 2.0; XML Schema; and static type checking. It also presentssome of the first experiments with optimization. The chapter demonstrates query-rewritingcapabilities in the Galax compiler; and the ability to run queries on documents up to aGigabyte without the need for preindexing. Although early versions of Galax have beenshown in industrial conferences over the past; this is the first time it is demonstrated in thedatabase community. Galax is a light-weight; portable; open-source implementation ofXQuery 1.0. Started in December 2000 as a small prototype designed to test the XQuerystatic type system; Galax has now become a solid implementation; aiming at fullconformance with the family of XQuery 1.0 specifications.

Improving large graph processing on partitioned graphs in the cloud,Rishan Chen; Mao Yang; Xuetian Weng; Byron Choi; Bingsheng He; Xiaoming Li,Abstract As the study of large graphs over hundreds of gigabytes becomes increasinglypopular for various data-intensive applications in cloud computing; developing large graphprocessing systems has become a hot and fruitful research area. Many of those existingsystems support a vertex-oriented execution model and allow users to develop customlogics on vertices. However; the inherently random access pattern on the vertex-orientedcomputation generates a significant amount of network traffic. While graph partitioning isknown to be effective to reduce network traffic in graph processing; there is little attentiongiven to how graph partitioning can be effectively integrated into large graph processing inthe cloud environment. In this paper; we develop a novel graph partitioning framework toimprove the network performance of graph partitioning itself; partitioned graph storage …,Proceedings of the Third ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing,2012,76
Multiple materialized view selection for XPath query rewriting,Nan Tang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; M Tamer Ozsu; Byron Choi; Kam-Fai Wong,We study the problem of answering XPATH queries using multiple materialized views.Despite the efforts on answering queries using single materialized view; answering queriesusing multiple views remains relatively new. We address two important aspects of thisproblem: multiple-view selection and equivalent multiple-view rewriting. With regards to thefirst problem; we propose an NFA-based approach (called VFILTER) to filter views thatcannot be used to answer a given query. We then present the criterion for multipleview/query answerability. Based on the output of VFILTER; we further propose a heuristicmethod to identify a minimal view set that can answer a given query. For the problem ofmultiple-view rewriting; we first refine the materialized fragments of each selected view (likepushing selection); we then join the refined fragments utilizing an encoding scheme …,Data Engineering; 2008.

Vectorizing and querying large XML repositories,Peter Buneman; Byron Choi; Wenfei Fan; Robert Hutchison; Robert Mann; Stratis D Viglas,Vertical partitioning is a well-known technique for optimizing query performance in relationaldatabases. An extreme form of this technique; which we call vectorization; is to store eachcolumn separately. We use a generalization of vectorization as the basis for a native XMLstore. The idea is to decompose an XML document into a set of vectors that contain the datavalues and a compressed skeleton that describes the structure. In order to query thisrepresentation and produce results in the same vectorized format; we consider a practicalfragment of XQuery and introduce the notion of query graphs and a novel graph reductionalgorithm that allows us to leverage relational optimization techniques as well as to reducethe unnecessary loading of data vectors and decompression of skeletons.

On the optimality of holistic algorithms for twig queries,Byron Choi; Malika Mahoui; Derick Wood,Abstract Streaming XML documents has many emerging applications. However; in thispaper; we show that the restrictions imposed by data streaming are too restrictive forprocessing twig queries–the core operation for XML query processing. Previous proposedalgorithm TwigStack is an optimal algorithm for processing twig queries with onlydescendent edges over streams of nodes. The cause of the suboptimality of the TwigStackalgorithm is the structurally recursions appearing in XML documents. We show that withoutrelaxing the data streaming model; it is not possible to develop an optimal holistic algorithmfor twig queries. Also the computation of the twig queries is not memory bounded. Thismotivates us to study two variations of the data streaming model:(1) offline sorting is allowedand the algorithm is allowed to select the correct nodes to be streamed and (2) multiple …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2003,61
The Xquery formal semantics: A foundation for implementation and optimization,Byron Choi; Mary Fernandez; Jerome Simeon,Abstract XQuery is a strongly typed; functional language; which supports the commonprocessing; transformation; and querying tasks of a wide variety of XML applications.Following the tradition of other functional languages; XQuery includes a complete formalsemantics. In this paper; we argue that basing an XQuery implementation on the XQueryFormal Semantics not only ensures correctness; but is a good foundation for optimization.We describe an architecture that we have implemented and that is based on the XQueryFormal Semantics and describe several logical and physical optimizations that can be easilyintegrated in the above architecture.,Bell Labs Research,2002,48
On incremental maintenance of 2-hop labeling of graphs,Ramadhana Bramandia; Byron Choi; Wee Keong Ng,Abstract Recent interests on XML; Semantic Web; and Web ontology; among other topics;have sparked a renewed interest on graph-structured databases. A fundamental query ongraphs is the reachability test of nodes. Recently; 2-hop labeling has been proposed toindex large collections of XML and/or graphs for efficient reachability tests. However; therehas been few work on updates of 2-hop labeling. This is compounded by the fact that Webdata changes over time. In response to these; this paper studies the incrementalmaintenance of 2-hop labeling. We identify the main reason for the inefficiency of updates ofexisting 2-hop labels. We propose two updatable 2-hop labelings; hybrids of 2-hop labeling;and their incremental maintenance algorithms. The proposed 2-hop labeling is derived fromgraph connectivities; as opposed to set cover which is used by all previous work.

PCMLogging: reducing transaction logging overhead with PCM,Shen Gao; Jianliang Xu; Bingsheng He; Byron Choi; Haibo Hu,Abstract Phase Changing Memory (PCM); as one of the most promising next-generationmemory technologies; offers various attractive properties such as non-volatility; bit-alterability; and low idle energy consumption. In this paper; we present PCMLogging; anovel logging scheme that exploits PCM devices for both data buffering and transactionlogging in disk-based databases. Different from the traditional approach where bufferedupdates and transaction logs are completely separated; they are integrated in the newlogging scheme. Our preliminary experiments show an up to 40% improvement ofPCMLogging in disk I/O performance in comparison with a basic buffering and loggingscheme.,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,39
GBLENDER: towards blending visual query formulation and query processing in graph databases,Changjiu Jin; Sourav S Bhowmick; Xiaokui Xiao; James Cheng; Byron Choi,Abstract Given a graph database D and a query graph g; an exact subgraph matching queryasks for the set S of graphs in D that contain g as a subgraph. This type of queries findimportant applications in several domains such as bioinformatics and chemoinformatics;where users are generally not familiar with complex graph query languages. Consequently;user-friendly visual interfaces which support query graph construction can reduce theburden of data retrieval for these users. Existing techniques for subgraph matching queriesbuilt on top of such visual framework are designed to optimize the time required in retrievingthe result set S from D; assuming that the whole query graph has been constructed. Thisleads to sub-optimal system response time as the query processing is initiated only after theuser has finished drawing the query graph.

Incremental evaluation of schema-directed XML publishing,Philip Bohannon; Byron Choi; Wenfei Fan,Abstract When large XML documents published from a database are maintained externally;it is inefficient to repeatedly recompute them when the database is updated. Vastlypreferable is incremental update; as common for views stored in a data warehouse.However; to support schema-directed publishing; there may be no simple query that definesthe mapping from the database to the external document. To meet the need for efficientincremental update; this paper studies two approaches for incremental evaluation of ATGs[4]; a formalism for schema-directed XML publishing. The reduction approach seeks to pushas much work as possible to the underlying DBMS. It is based on a relational encoding ofXML trees and a nontrivial translation of ATGs to SQL 99 queries with recursion. However; aweakness of this approach is that it relies on high-end DBMS features rather than the …,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2004,35
Cache-conscious automata for XML filtering,Bingsheng He; Qiong Luo; Byron Choi,Hardware cache behavior is an important factor in the performance of memory-resident; data-intensive systems such as XML filtering engines. A key data structure in several recent XMLfilters is the automaton; which is used to represent the long-running XML queries in the mainmemory. In this paper; we study the cache performance of automaton-based XML filteringthrough analytical modeling and system measurement. Furthermore; we propose a cache-conscious automaton organization technique; called the hot buffer; to improve the locality ofautomaton state transitions. Our results show that 1) our cache performance model for XMLfiltering automata is highly accurate and 2) the hot buffer improves the cache performanceas well as the overall performance of automaton-based XML filtering,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2006,33
DigestJoin: Exploiting fast random reads for flash-based joins,Yu Li; Sai Tung On; Jianliang Xu; Byron Choi; Haibo Hu,Flash disks have been an emerging secondary storage media. In particular; there have beenportable devices; multimedia players and laptop computers that are configured with nomagnetic disks but flash disks. It is envisioned that some RDBMSs will operate on flash disksin the near future. However; the I/O characteristics of flash disks are different from those ofmagnetic disks. Thus; in this paper; we study the core of query processing in RDBMSs---joinprocessing---on flash disks. Specifically; we propose a new join method; called DigestJoin;to exploit fast random reads of flashdisks. DigestJoin consists of two phases:(1) projectingthe join attributes followed by a join on the projected attributes; and (2) fetching the fulltuples that satisfy the join to produce the final join results. While the problem of tuple/pagefetching with minimum I/O cost (in the second phase) is intractable; we propose three …,Mobile Data Management: Systems; Services and Middleware; 2009. MDM'09.

Flag commit: Supporting efficient transaction recovery in flash-based dbmss,Sai Tung On; Jianliang Xu; Byron Choi; Haibo Hu; Bingsheng He,Owing to recent advances in semiconductor technologies; flash disks have been acompetitive alternative to traditional magnetic disks as external storage media. In this paper;we study how transaction recovery can be efficiently supported in database managementsystems (dbmss) running on slc flash disks. Inspired by the classical shadow-pagingapproach; we propose a new commit scheme; called flagcommit; to exploit the uniquecharacteristics of flash disks such as fast random read access; out-place updating; andpartial page programming. To minimize the need of writing log records; we embed thetransaction status into flash pages through a chain of commit flags. Based on flagcommit; wedevelop two recovery protocols; namely commit-based flag commit (cfc) and abort-basedflag commit (afc); to meet different performance needs.

Traversing knowledge networks: an algorithmic historiography of extant literature on the Internet of Things (IoT),Fei Liu; Chee-Wee Tan; Eric TK Lim; Ben Choi,Research on the Internet of Things (IoT) has been booming for the past 6 years due totechnological advances and potential for application. Nonetheless; the rapid growth of IoTarticles and the heterogeneous nature of IoT pose challenges to conducting a systematicreview of IoT literature. This study seeks to address the abovementioned challenges byreviewing 1065 IoT articles retrieved from the International Statistical Institute Web ofScience via a blend of quantitative citation analysis and qualitative content analysis. For theformer; we generated a historiography of IoT research; a citation network; in which we triedto identify main paths of codification and diffusion; as well as path-dependent transitions.

Updating recursive XML views of relations,Byron Choi; Gao Cong; Wenfei Fan; Stratis D Viglas,This paper investigates the view update problem for XML views published from relationaldata. We consider (possibly) recursively defined XML views; compressed into DAGs andstored in relations. We provide new techniques to efficiently support XML view updatesspecified in terms of XFath expressions with recursion and complex filters. The interactionbetween XFath recursion and DAG compression of XML views makes the analysis of XMLview updates intriguing. Furthermore; many issues are still open even for relational viewupdates; and need to be explored. In response to these; we revise the update semantics toaccommodate XML side effects based on the semantics of XML views; and present efficientalgorithms to translate XML updates to relational view updates. Moreover; we propose amild condition on SPJ views; and show that under this condition the analysis of deletions …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007. IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,22
Prague: towards blending practical visual subgraph query formulation and query processing,Changjiu Jin; Sourav S Bhowmick; Byron Choi; Shuigeng Zhou,In a previous paper; we laid out the vision of a novel graph query processing paradigmwhere instead of processing a visual query graph after its construction; it interleaves visualquery formulation and processing by exploiting the latency offered by the GUI to filterirrelevant matches and prefetch partial query results [8]. Our first attempt at implementing thisvision; called GBLENDER [8]; shows significant improvement in system response time (SRT)for sub graph containment queries. However; GBLENDER suffers from two key drawbacks;namely inability to handle visual sub graph similarity queries and inefficient support forvisual query modification; limiting its usage in practical environment.

Bayesian networks for knowledge-based authentication,Ye Chen; Divakaran Liginlal,Knowledge-based authentication (KBA) has gained prominence as a user authenticationmethod for electronic transactions. This paper presents a Bayesian network model of KBAgrounded in probabilistic reasoning and information theory. The probabilistic semantics ofthe model parameters naturally lead to the definitions of two key KBA metrics-guessabilityand memorability. The statistical modeling approach allows parameter estimation usingmethods such as the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). The information-theoretic viewhelps to derive the closed-form solutions to estimating the guessability and guessing entropymetrics. The results related to KBA metrics and the models under different attackingstrategies and factoid distributions are unified under a game-theoretic framework that yieldslower and upper bounds of optimal guessability.

Towards efficient authenticated subgraph query service in outsourced graph databases,Zhe Fan; Yun Peng; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu; Sourav S Bhowmick,Graphs are powerful tools suitable for a large variety of applications including chemicaldatabases and the Semantic Web; among others. A fundamental query of graph databasesis the subgraph query: given a query graph q; it retrieves the data graphs from a databasethat contain q. Due to the cost of managing massive data coupled with the computationalhardness of subgraph query processing; outsourcing the processing to a third-party serviceprovider is an appealing alternative. However; security properties such as data integrity andthe response time are critical Quality of Service (QoS) issues in query services.Unfortunately; to our knowledge; authenticated subgraph query services have not beenaddressed before.

Private search on key-value stores with hierarchical indexes,Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu; Xizhong Xu; Kexin Pei; Byron Choi; Shuigeng Zhou,Query processing that preserves both the query privacy at the client and the data privacy atthe server is a new research problem. It has many practical applications; especially whenthe queries are about the sensitive attributes of records. However; most existing studies;including those originating from data outsourcing; address the data privacy and queryprivacy separately. Although secure multiparty computation (SMC) is a suitable computingparadigm for this problem; it has significant computation and communication overheads;thus unable to scale up to large datasets. Fortunately; recent advances in cryptography bringus two relevant tools-conditional oblivious transfer and homomorphic encryption. In thispaper; we integrate database indexing techniques with these tools in the context of privatesearch on key-value stores.

Authentication of moving top-k spatial keyword queries,Dingming Wu; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu; Christian S Jensen,A moving top-k spatial keyword (MkSK) query; which takes into account a continuouslymoving query location; enables a mobile client to be continuously aware of the top-k spatialweb objects that best match a query with respect to location and text relevance. Theincreasing mobile use of the web and the proliferation of geo-positioning render it of interestto consider a scenario where spatial keyword search is outsourced to a separate serviceprovider capable at handling the voluminous spatial web objects available from varioussources. A key challenge is that the service provider may return inaccurate or incorrect queryresults (intentionally or not); eg; due to cost considerations or invasion of hackers. Therefore;it is attractive to be able to authenticate the query results at the client side.

More specifically;we analyze the search results of a sequence of temporally-ordered queries returned by ablog search engine; and build and maintain Blog profiles for those blogs whose postsfrequently appear in the top-ranked search results. With the blog profiles; 4 splog scoringfunctions were evaluated using real data collected from a popular blog search engine.

By employingthese techniques; we show; through a comprehensive experiment; that our approach notonly scales well but also performs better than some representative tree-unawareapproaches on more than 65% of our benchmark queries with the highest observed gainfactor being 1939.

Unfortunately; query serviceproviders may be untrusted or compromised by attacks. To our knowledge; no studies havebeen carried out on the authentication of the search.

Detecting spam blogs from blog search results,Linhong Zhu; Aixin Sun; Byron Choi,Abstract Blogging has been an emerging media for people to express themselves. However;the presence of spam blogs (also known as splogs) may reduce the value of blogs and blogsearch engines. Hence; splog detection has recently attracted much attention from research.Most existing works on splog detection identify splogs using their content/link features andtarget on spam filters protecting blog search engines' index from spam. In this paper; wepropose a splog detection framework by monitoring the on-line search results. The novelty ofour splog detection is that our detection capitalizes on the results returned by searchengines. The proposed method therefore is particularly useful in detecting those splogs thathave successfully slipped through the spam filters that are also actively generating spam-posts. More specifically; our method monitors the top-ranked results of a sequence of …,Information Processing & Management,2011,14
StableBuffer: optimizing write performance for DBMS applications on flash devices,Yu Li; Jianliang Xu; Byron Choi; Haibo Hu,Abstract Flash devices have been widely used in embedded systems; laptop computers; andenterprise servers. However; the poor random writes have been an obstacle to running write-intensive DBMS applications on flash devices. In this paper; we exploit the recentlydiscovered; efficient write patterns of flash devices to optimize the performance of DBMSapplications. Specifically; motivated by a focused write pattern; we propose to write pagestemporarily to a small; pre-allocated storage space on the flash device; called StableBuffer;instead of directly writing to their actual destinations. We then recognize and flush efficientwrite patterns of the buffer to achieve a better write performance. In contrast to prior log-based techniques; our StableBuffer solution does not require modifying the driver of flashdevices and hence works well for commodity flash devices.

XML users however are writing theirapplication in their own way. Doubts on the quality of an XML application have been raised.In this paper; we listed some criteria for good XML design. The quest is to find out the designtechnique leading us to fit this criteria. The attempts on recycling the existing technique failbecause of the new challenges on XML design. To illustrate the uniqueness of XML design;we presented two case studies. These case studies leads to the sugggestion on thecategorization on XML application.

Rapid fabrication of aluminum shoe mold using vacuum sealed casting process,S Chung; Y Im; H Jeong; D Jeong; K Cho; S Lee; B Choi; H Choi,Abstract Rapid prototyping and manufacturing (RP&M) is the most appropriate technologyfor the small-lot production system; because the production cycle is getting shorter owing tovarious needs of the consumer. Recently RP products; which are made of plastics; wax; andpaper; were used to examine the design of samples. These samples; however; cannot beapplied to the real mold because soft materials; such as plastics lack the necessary strengthto be a mold. So the materials have been changed from RP products to a metal powder filledmold like an epoxy-metal powder composite mold or metal mold; which is called rapidtooling (RT) technology. In this paper; RT technology is applied to the casting process. Thecasting process has the ability to reflect complicated shapes in one process. But it has notbeen widely used to make a die and mold because of the poor surface quality caused by …,Journal of materials processing technology,2003,13
Spatial-aware interest group queries in location-based social networks,Yafei Li; Dingming Wu; Jianliang Xu; Byron Choi; Weifeng Su,Abstract With the recent advances in positioning and smartphone technologies; a number ofsocial networks such as Twitter; Foursquare and Facebook are acquiring the dimension oflocation; thus bridging the gap between the physical world and online social networkingservices. Most of the location-based social networks released check-in services that allowusers to share their visiting locations with their friends. In this paper; users' interests aremodeled by check-in actions. We propose a new type of Spatial-aware Interest Group (SIG)query that retrieves a user group of size k where each user is interested in the querykeywords and they are close to each other in the Euclidean space. We prove that the SIGquery problem is NP-complete. A family of efficient algorithms based on the IR-tree is thusproposed for the processing of SIG queries.

A uniform framework for ad-hoc indexes to answer reachability queries on large graphs,Linhong Zhu; Byron Choi; Bingsheng He; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Wee Keong Ng,Abstract Graph-structured databases and related problems such as reachability queryprocessing have been increasingly relevant to many applications such as XML databases;biological databases; social network analysis and the Semantic Web. To efficiently evaluatereachability queries on large graph-structured databases; there has been a host of recentresearch on graph indexing. To date; reachability indexes are generally applied to the entiregraph. This can often be suboptimal if the graph is large or/and its subgraphs are diverse instructure. In this paper; we propose a uniform framework to support existing reachabilityindexing for subgraphs of a given graph. This in turn supports fast reachability queryprocessing in large graph-structured databases. The contributions of our uniform frameworkare as follows:(1) We formally define a graph framework that facilitates indexing …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2009,12
A uniform system for publishing and maintaining XML data,Byron Choi; Wenfei Fan; Xibei Jia; Arek Kasprzyk,XML has become the prime standard for data exchange on the Web. To exchange datacurrently residing in databases; one needs to publish it in XML; ie; to extract data from thedatabase and transform the data into an XML format. In practice; data publishing is oftendone with a predefined “schema”. A community agrees on a certain schema; andsubsequently all members of the community exchange their data wrt the predefined schema;by ensuring their published (target) XML data to conform to the fixed schema. This is calledschema-directed XML publishing. The need for this is particularly evident in biological dataexchange and services. However; it is nontrivial to ensure that the target XML data conformsto a given schema. The difficulty is introduced by; among others; recursion in a targetschema; which is common in; eg; biological ontologies [7].

MyBenchmark: generating databases for query workloads,Eric Lo; Nick Cheng; Wilfred WK Lin; Wing-Kai Hon; Byron Choi,Abstract To evaluate the performance of database applications and database managementsystems (DBMSs); we usually execute workloads of queries on generated databases ofdifferent sizes and then benchmark various measures such as respond time and throughput.This paper introduces MyBenchmark; a parallel data generation tool that takes a set ofqueries as input and generates database instances. Users of MyBenchmark can control thecharacteristics of the generated data as well as the characteristics of the resulting workload.Applications of MyBenchmark include DBMS testing; database application testing; andapplication-driven benchmarking. In this paper; we present the architecture and theimplementation algorithms of MyBenchmark. Experimental results show that MyBenchmarkis able to generate workload-aware databases for a variety of workloads including query …,The VLDB Journal,2014,11
Social-aware top-k spatial keyword search,Dingming Wu; Yafei Li; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu,The boom of the spatial web has enabled spatial keyword queries that take a user locationand multiple search keywords as arguments and return the objects that are spatially andtextually relevant to these arguments. Recently; utilizing social data to improve searchresults; normally by giving a higher rank to the content generated or consumed by thesearcher's friends in the social network; has been studied in the information retrieval (IR)community. However; little attention has been drawn to the integration of social factors intospatial keyword query processing. In this paper; we propose a novel spatial keyword query;Social-aware top-k Spatial Keyword (SkSK) query; which enriches the semantics of theconventional spatial keyword query by introducing a new social relevance attribute. A hybridindex structure; called Social Network-aware IR-tree (SNIR-tree); is proposed for the …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2014 IEEE 15th International Conference on,2014,11
On the efficiency and programmability of large graph processing in the cloud,Rishan Chen; Xuetian Weng; Bingsheng He; Mao Yang; Byron Choi; Xiaoming Li,ABSTRACT As the study of large graphs over hundreds of gigabytes becomes increasinglypopular in cloud computing; efficiency and programmability of large graph processing taskschallenge existing tools. The inherent random access pattern on the graph generatessignificant amount of network traffic. Moreover; implementing custom logics on theunstructured data in a distributed manner is often a pain for graph analysts. To addressthese challenges; we develop Surfer; a large graph processing engine in the cloud. Surferresolves the bottleneck of network traffic with graph partitioning; which is specificallyadapted to the network environment of the cloud. To improve the programmability; Surferprovides two basic primitives as building blocks for high-level applications–MapReduce andpropagation. Surfer implements both primitives with automatic optimizations on the …,Microsoft Research TechReport,2010,11
A quantitative summary of XML structures,Zi Lin; Bingsheng He; Byron Choi,Abstract Statistical summaries in relational databases mainly focus on the distribution of datavalues and have been found useful for various applications; such as query evaluation anddata storage. As xml has been widely used; eg for online data exchange; the need for(corresponding) statistical summaries in xml has been evident. While relational techniquesmay be applicable to the data values in xml documents; novel techniques are requried forsummarizing the structures of xml documents. In this paper; we propose metrics for majorstructural properties; in particular; nestings of entities and one-to-many relationships; of XMLdocuments. Our technique is different from the existing ones in that we generate aquantitative summary of an xml structure. By using our approach; we illustrate that somepopular real-world and synthetic xml benchmark datasets are indeed highly skewed and …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2006,11

QUBLE: blending visual subgraph query formulation with query processing on large networks,Ho Hoang Hung; Sourav S Bhowmick; Ba Quan Truong; Byron Choi; Shuigeng Zhou,Abstract In a previous paper; we laid out the vision of a novel graph query processingparadigm where instead of processing a visual query graph after its construction; itinterleaves visual query formulation and processing by exploiting the latency offered by theGUI [4]. Our recent attempts at implementing this vision [4; 6]; show significant improvementin the system response time (SRT) for subgraph queries. However; these efforts aredesigned specifically for graph databases containing a large collection of small or medium-sized graphs. Consequently; its frequent fragment-based action-aware indexing schemesand query processing strategy are unsuitable for supporting subgraph queries on largenetworks containing thousands of nodes and edges. In this demonstration; we present anovel system called QUBLE (QUery Blender for Large nEtworks) to realize this novel …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,10
Selectivity estimation of twig queries on cyclic graphs,Yun Peng; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu,Recent applications including the Semantic Web; Web ontology and XML have sparked arenewed interest on graph-structured databases. Among others; twig queries have been apopular tool for retrieving subgraphs from graph-structured databases. To optimize twigqueries; selectivity estimation has been a crucial and classical step. However; the majority ofexisting works on selectivity estimation focuses on relational and tree data. In this paper; weinvestigate selectivity estimation of twig queries on possibly cyclic graph data. To facilitateselectivity estimation on cyclic graphs; we propose a matrix representation of graphs derivedfrom prime labeling-a scheme for reachability queries on directed acyclic graphs. With thisrepresentation; we exploit the consecutive ones property (C1P) of matrices. As aconsequence; a node is mapped to a point in a two-dimensional space whereas a query …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,10
Authentication of range query results in mapreduce environments,Ziwei Yang; Shen Gao; Jianliang Xu; Byron Choi,Abstract Authenticated query processing has been an important problem in outsourced andcloud databases. However; all existing works on query authentication are confined to asingle server. In this paper; we present a scalable authentication solution for range queriesbased on the MapReduce framework. To address the problem; we propose two algorithmsfor mapping an authentication task to a set of sub-tasks that can be executed on distributedservers in parallel. We also develop an optimization technique for concurrent queries toimprove system performance by shared execution. The efficiency of the proposed algorithmsand techniques is shown through a set of simulation experiments.,Proceedings of the third international workshop on Cloud data management,2011,9
Private proximity detection and monitoring with vicinity regions,Xin Lin; Haibo Hu; Hong Ping Li; Jianliang Xu; Byron Choi,Abstract Proximity detection is an important location-based service (LBS) that helps mobileusers find nearby friends. However; this service usually requires users to submit theirlocations to the server; which raises privacy concerns. In this paper; we propose symmetricproximity detection on vicinity regions as a fair and privacy-preserving solution to thisproblem. Specifically; each user can specify a nearby area as vicinity region; and two usersare considered to be in proximity only if they are located in each other's vicinity region. Toenable efficient detection; we design a shift-and-compare protocol for one-shot proximityqueries without revealing users' locations or vicinity regions. Furthermore; for continuousproximity monitoring; we propose an alert-area-based location update strategy with minimalupdate frequency; thereby saving communication cost.

GBLENDER: visual subgraph query formulation meets query processing,Changjiu Jin; Sourav S Bhowmick; Xiaokui Xiao; Byron Choi; Shuigeng Zhou,Abstract Due to the complexity of graph query languages; the need for visual queryinterfaces that can reduce the burden of query formulation is fundamental to the spreading ofgraph data management tools to wider community. We present a novel HCI (human-computer interaction)-aware graph query processing paradigm; where instead of processinga query graph after its construction; it interleaves visual query construction and processing toimprove system response time. We demonstrate a system called GBLENDER that exploitsGUI latency to prune false results and prefetch candidate data graphs by employing a novelaction-aware indexing scheme and a data structure called spindle-shaped graphs (SPIG).We demonstrate various innovative features of GBLENDER and its promising performancein evaluating subgraph containment and similarity queries.,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,8
Optimizing nonindexed join processing in flash storage-based systems,Yu Li; Sai Tung On; Jianliang Xu; Byron Choi; Haibo Hu,Flash memory-based disks (or simply flash disks) have been widely used in today'scomputer systems. With their continuously increasing capacity and dropping price; it isenvisioned that some database systems will operate on flash disks in the near future.However; the I/O characteristics of flash disks are different from those of magnetic hard disks.Motivated by this; we study the core of query processing in row-based database systems-join processing-on flash storage media. More specifically; we propose a new framework;called DigestJoin; to optimize nonindexed join processing by reducing the intermediateresult size and exploiting fast random reads of flash disks. DigestJoin consists of twophases: 1) projecting the join attributes followed by a join on the projected attributes; and 2)fetching the full tuples that satisfy the join to produce the final join results.

Optimizing updates of recursive XML views of relations,Ramadhana Bramandia; Jiefeng Cheng; Byron Choi; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract XML publishing has been an emerging technique for transforming (portions of) arelational database into an XML document; for example; to facilitate interoperability betweenheterogeneous applications. Such applications may update the XML document and thesource relational database must be updated accordingly. In this paper; we consider suchXML documents as (possibly) recursively defined XML views of relations. We propose newoptimization techniques to efficiently support XML view updates specified via an XPATHexpression with recursion and complex filters. The main novelties of our techniques are:(1)we propose a space-efficient relational encoding of recursive XML views; and (2) we pushthe bulk of update processing inside a relational database. Specifically; a compressedrepresentation of the XML views is stored as extended shared-inlining relations. A space …,The VLDB Journal,2009,7

Document decomposition for XML compression: A heuristic approach,Byron Choi,Abstract Sharing of common subtrees has been reported useful not only for XMLcompression but also for main-memory XML query processing. This method compressessubtrees only when they exhibit identical structure. Even slight irregularities among subtreesdramatically reduce the performance of compression algorithms of this kind. Furthermore;when XML documents are large; the chance of having large number of identical subtrees isinherently low. In this paper; we proposed a method of decomposing XML documents forbetter compression. We proposed a heuristic method of locating minor irregularities in XMLdocuments. The irregularities are then projected out from the original XML document. Werefered this process to as document decomposition. We demonstrated that bettercompression can be achieved by compressing the decomposed documents separately …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2006,7
Geo-social k-cover group queries for collaborative spatial computing,Yafei Li; Rui Chen; Jianliang Xu; Qiao Huang; Haibo Hu; Byron Choi,With the rapid development of location-aware mobile devices; ubiquitous Internet accessand social computing technologies; lots of users' personal information; such as location dataand social data; has been readily accessible from various mobile platforms and online socialnetworks. The convergence of these two types of data; known as geo-social data; hasenabled collaborative spatial computing that explicitly combines both location and socialfactors to answer useful geo-social queries for either business or social good. In this paper;we study a new type of Geo-Social K-Cover Group (GSKCG) queries that; given a set ofquery points and a social network; retrieves a minimum user group in which each user issocially related to at least k other users and the users' associated regions (eg; familiarregions or service regions) can jointly cover all the query points.

PIGEON: Progress indicator for subgraph queries,Xiaojing Xie; Zhe Fan; Byron Choi; Peipei Yi; Sourav S Bhowmick; Shuigeng Zhou,Subgraph queries have been a fundamental query for retrieving patterns from graph data.Due to the well known NP hardness of subgraph queries; those queries may sometimes takea long time to complete. Our recent investigation on real-world datasets revealed that theperformance of queries on graphs generally varies greatly. In other words; query clients mayoccasionally encounter “unexpectedly” long execution from a subgraph query processor.This paper aims to demonstrate a tool that alleviates the problem by monitoring subgraphquery progress. Specifically; we present a novel subgraph query progress indicator calledPIGEON that exploits query-time information to report to users accurate estimated queryprogress. In the demonstration; users may interact with PIGEON to gain insights on the queryevaluation; which include the following: Users are enabled to (i) monitor query progress; …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,6
Asymmetric structure-preserving subgraph queries for large graphs,Zhe Fan; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu; Sourav S Bhowmick,One fundamental type of query for graph databases is subgraph isomorphism queries (akasubgraph queries). Due to the computational hardness of subgraph queries coupled with thecost of managing massive graph data; outsourcing the query computation to a third-partyservice provider has been an economical and scalable approach. However; confidentiality isknown to be an important attribute of Quality of Service (QoS) in Query as a Service (QaaS).In this paper; we propose the first practical private approach for subgraph query services;asymmetric structure-preserving subgraph query processing; where the data graph ispublicly known and the query structure/topology is kept secret. Unlike other previousmethods for subgraph queries; this paper proposes a series of novel optimizations that onlyexploit graph structures; not the queries. Further; we propose a robust query encoding …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,6
Privacy-preserving reachability query services,Shuxiang Yin; Zhe Fan; Peipei Yi; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu; Shuigeng Zhou,Abstract Due to the massive volume of graph data from a wide range of recent applicationsand resources required to process numerous queries at large scale; it is becomingeconomically appealing to outsource graph data to a third-party service provider (SP); toprovide query services. However; SP cannot always be trusted. Hence; data owners andquery clients may prefer not to expose their data graphs and queries. This paper studiesprivacy-preserving query services for a fundamental query for graphs namely thereachability query where both clients' queries and the structural information of the owner'sdata are protected. We propose privacy-preserving 2-hop labeling (pp-2-hop) where thequeries are computed in an encrypted domain and the input and output sizes of any queriesare indistinguishable. We analyze the security of pp-2-hop with respect to ciphertext only …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2014,6
Optimizing incremental maintenance of minimal bisimulation of cyclic graphs,Jintian Deng; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract Graph-structured databases have numerous recent applications including theSemantic Web; biological databases and XML; among many others. In this paper; we studythe maintenance problem of a popular structural index; namely bisimulation; of a possiblycyclic data graph. In comparison; previous work mainly focuses on acyclic graphs. In thecontext of database applications; it is natural to compute minimal bisimulation with mergingalgorithms. First; we propose a maintenance algorithm for a minimal bisimulation of a cyclicgraph; in the style of merging. Second; to prune the computation on non-bisimilar SCC s; wepropose a feature-based optimization. The features are designed to be constructed andused more efficiently than bisimulation minimization. Third; we conduct an experimentalstudy that verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.

Hiding emerging patterns with local recoding generalization,Michael WK Cheng; Byron Koon Kau Choi; William Kwok Wai Cheung,Abstract Establishing strategic partnership often requires organizations to publish and sharemeaningful data to support collaborative business activities. An equally important concernfor them is to protect sensitive patterns like unique emerging sales opportunities embeddedin their data. In this paper; we contribute to the area of data sanitization by introducing anoptimization-based local recoding methodology to hide emerging patterns from a dataset butwith the underlying frequent itemsets preserved as far as possible. We propose a novelheuristic solution that captures the unique properties of hiding EPs to carry out iterative localrecoding generalization. Also; we propose a metric which measures (i) frequentitemsetdistortion that quantifies the quality of published data and (ii) the degree of reduction inemerging patterns; to guide a bottom-up recoding process.

Structure-preserving subgraph query services,Zhe Fan; Byron Choi; Qian Chen; Jianliang Xu; Haibo Hu; Sourav S Bhowmick,A fundamental problem of graph databases is subgraph isomorphism query (aka subgraphquery): given a query graph Q and a graph database; it retrieves the graphs Gs from thedatabase that contain Q. Due to the cost of managing massive data coupled with thecomputational hardness of subgraph isomorphism testing; outsourcing the computations to athird-party provider is an appealing alternative. However; confidentiality has been a criticalattribute of quality of service (QoS) in query services. To the best of our knowledge;subgraph query services with tunable preservation of privacy of structural information havenever been addressed. In this paper; we present the first work on structure-preservingsubIso (SPsubIso). A crucial step of our work is to transform subIso-the seminal subgraphisomorphism algorithm (the Ullmann's algorithm)-into a series of matrix operations.

ViSual: An hci-inspired simulator for blending visual subgraph query construction and processing,Sourav S Bhowmick; Huey Eng Chua; Benji Thian; Byron Choi,In [3]; we laid out the vision of a novel graph query processing paradigm; where visualsubgraph query formulation is interleaved (or “blended”) with query processing by exploitingthe latency offered by the gui. Our recent attempts at implementing this vision [6];[7] do notprovide any robust framework to systematically investigate the performance of this novelparadigm. This is because it is prohibitively expensive to engage a large number of users toformulate a large number of visual queries in order to measure the performance of blendingquery formulation with query processing. In this demonstration; we present a novel syntheticvisual subgraph query simulator called ViSual that can evaluate the performance of thisparadigm for a large number of visual subgraph queries without requiring a large number ofusers to formulate them. Specifically; it leverages principles from hci to quantify the gui …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,5
Spatial-aware interest group queries in location-based social networks,Yafei Li; Dingming Wu; Jianliang Xu; Byron Choi; Weifeng Su,Abstract Location-based social networks; such as Foursquare and Facebook Places; arebridging the gap between the physical world and online social networking services throughacquired user locations. Some social networks released check-in services that allow usersto share their visiting locations with their friends. In this paper; users' interests are modeledby check-in actions. We propose a new spatial-aware interest group (SIG) query thatretrieves a user group of size k where every user is highly interested in the query keywordand also spatially close to each other. An efficient algorithm AIR based on the IR-tree isproposed for the processing of SIG queries. Furthermore; an optimization is developed andachieves a much better performance than the baseline algorithm.,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,5
XML vectorization: A column-based XML storage model,Byron Choi; Peter Buneman,Abstract The usual method for storing tables in a relational database is to store each tuplecontiguously in secondary storage. A simple alternative is to store the columns contiguously;so that a table is represented as a set of vectors all of the same length. It has been shownthat such a representation performs well on queries requiring few columns. This paperreviews the shredding scheme used in XMill; an XML compressor; which represents thedocument structure by using a set of files; consisting of a file describing the structure; andfiles describing the character data to be found on designated paths (corresponding to thecolumn data). We consider such a shredding as a storage model–-XML vectorization–-bypresenting an indexing scheme and a physical algebra associated with a detailed costmodel. We study query processing on the XML vectorization; in particular the XML join …,Technical Reports (CIS),2003,5

Interruption-sensitive empty result feedback: Rethinking the visual query feedback paradigm for semistructured data,Sourav S Bhowmick; Curtis Dyreson; Byron Choi; Min-Hwee Ang,Abstract The usability of visual querying schemes for tree and graph-structured data can begreatly enhanced by providing feedback during query construction; but feedback atinopportune times can hamper query construction. In this paper; we rethink the traditionalway of providing feedback. We describe a novel vision of interruption-sensitive queryfeedback where relevant notifications are delivered quickly but at an appropriate momentwhen the mental workload of the user is low. Though we focus on one class of queryfeedback; namely empty result detection; where a user is notified when a partiallyconstructed visual query yields an empty result; our new paradigm is applicable to otherkinds of feedback. We present a framework called iSERF that bridges the classical databaseproblem of empty-result detection with intelligent notification management from the …,Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2015,4
DaVinci: Data-driven visual interface construction for subgraph search in graph databases,Jinbo Zhang; Sourav S Bhowmick; Hong H Nguyen; Byron Choi; Feida Zhu,Due to the complexity of graph query languages; the need for visual query interfaces thatcan reduce the burden of query formulation is fundamental to the spreading of graph datamanagement tools to a wider community. Despite the significant progress towards buildingsuch query interfaces to simplify visual subgraph query formulation task; construction ofcurrent generation visual interfaces is not data-driven. That is; it does not exploit theunderlying data graphs to automatically generate the contents of various panels in theinterface. Such data-driven construction has several benefits such as superior support forsubgraph query formulation and portability of the interface across different graph databases.In this demonstration; we present a novel data-driven visual subgraph query interfaceconstruction engine called DaVinci.

A private DNA motif finding algorithm,Rui Chen; Yun Peng; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu; Haibo Hu,Abstract With the increasing availability of genomic sequence data; numerous methods havebeen proposed for finding DNA motifs. The discovery of DNA motifs serves a critical step inmany biological applications. However; the privacy implication of DNA analysis is normallyneglected in the existing methods. In this work; we propose a private DNA motif findingalgorithm in which a DNA owner's privacy is protected by a rigorous privacy model; knownas∊-differential privacy. It provides provable privacy guarantees that are independent ofadversaries' background knowledge. Our algorithm makes use of the n-gram model and isoptimized for processing large-scale DNA sequences. We evaluate the performance of ouralgorithm over real-life genomic data and demonstrate the promise of integrating privacy intoDNA motif finding.,Journal of biomedical informatics,2014,4
AutoG: A visual query autocompletion framework for graph databases,Peipei Yi; Byron Choi; Sourav S Bhowmick; Jianliang Xu,Abstract Composing queries is evidently a tedious task. This is particularly true of graphqueries as they are typically complex and prone to errors; compounded by the fact thatgraph schemas can be missing or too loose to be helpful for query formulation. Despite thegreat success of query formulation aids; in particular; automatic query completion; graphquery autocompletion has received much less research attention. In this demonstration; wepresent a novel interactive visual subgraph query autocompletion framework called A uto Gwhich alleviates the potentially painstaking task of graph query formulation. Specifically;given a large collection of small or medium-sized graphs and a visual query fragment qformulated by a user; A uto G returns top-k query suggestions Q′ as output at interactivetime.

Adaptive index utilization in memory-resident structural joins,Bingsheng He; Qiong Luo; Byron Choi,We consider adaptive index utilization as a fine-grained problem in autonomic databases inwhich an existing index is dynamically determined to be used or not in query processing. Asa special case; we study this problem for structural joins; the core operator in XML queryprocessing; in the main memory. We find that index utilization is beneficial for structural joinsonly under certain join selectivity and distribution of matching elements. Therefore; wepropose adaptive algorithms to decide whether to use an index probe or a data scan foreach step of matching during the processing of a structural join operator. Our adaptivealgorithms are based on the history; the look-ahead information; or both. We havedeveloped a cost model to facilitate this adaptation and have conducted experiments withboth synthetic and real-world data sets. Our results show that adaptively utilizing indexes …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2007,3
Data-driven visual graph query interface construction and maintenance: challenges and opportunities,Sourav S Bhowmick; Byron Choi; Curtis Dyreson,Abstract Visual query interfaces make it easy for scientists and other nonexpert users toquery a data collection. Heretofore; visual query interfaces have been statically-constructed;independent of the data. In this paper we outline a vision of a different kind of interface; onethat is built (in part) from the data. In our data-driven approach; the visual interface isdynamically constructed and maintained. A data-driven approach has many benefits such asreducing the cost in constructing and maintaining an interface; superior support for queryformulation; and increased portability of the interface. We focus on graph databases; but ourapproach is applicable to several other kinds of databases such as JSON and XML.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,2
VColor: A practical vertex-cut based approach for coloring large graphs,Yun Peng; Byron Choi; Bingsheng He; Shuigeng Zhou; Ruzhi Xu; Xiaohui Yu,Graph coloring is a fundamental NP-hard problem in graph theory. It has a wide range ofreal applications; such as Operations Research; Communication Network; ComputationalBiology and Compiler Optimization. Notable efforts have been spent on designing itsapproximation algorithms. Halldrsson proposed the algorithm (denoted as SampleIS) withthe current best known approximation ratio. However; its time complexity is O (| G| 3); where|G| is the number of vertices of a graph G. It is clear that SampleIS is not practical for largegraphs. In this paper; we propose a practical vertex-cut based coloring technique (VColor)for coloring large graphs. First; we partition G into k connected components (CCs) of a smallsize s by removing a vertex-cut component (VCC). For each CC; we apply our novel coloringalgorithm; based on maximal independent set enumeration.

Incremental maintenance of the minimum bisimulation of cyclic graphs,Jintian Deng; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu; Haibo Hu; Sourav S Bhowmick,There have been numerous recent applications of graph databases (eg; the Semantic Web;ontology representation; social networks; XML; chemical databases; and biologicaldatabases). A fundamental structural index for data graphs; namely minimum bisimulation;has been reported useful for efficient path query processing and optimization includingselectivity estimation; among many others. Data graphs are subject to change and theirindexes are updated accordingly. This paper studies the incremental maintenance problemof the minimum bisimulation of a possibly cyclic data graph. While cyclic graphs areubiquitous among the data on the web; previous work on the maintenance problem hasmostly focused on acyclic graphs.

Predicting the optimal ad-hoc index for reachability queries on graph databases,Jintian Deng; Fei Liu; Yun Peng; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu,Abstract Due to the recent advances in graph databases; a large number of ad-hoc indexesfor a fundamental query; in particular; reachability query; have been proposed. Theperformances of these indexes on different graphs have known to be very different. Worststill; deriving an accurate cost model for selecting the optimal index of a graph databaseappears to be a daunting task. In this paper; we propose a hierarchical predictionframework; based on neural networks and a set of graph features and a knowledge base onpast predictions; to determine the optimal index for a graph database. For ease ofpresentation; we propose our framework with three structurally distinguishable indexes. Ourexperiments show that our framework is accurate.,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,2

Assuring spatio-temporal integrity on mobile devices with minimum location disclosure,Haibo Hu; Qian Chen; Jianliang Xu; Byron Choi,Since the boom of smartphones and location-based services; spatio-temporal data (ie; userlocations with timestamps) have become increasingly essential in many real-lifeapplications. To ensure these data are faithfully extracted from the underlying locationtracking hardware and not altered by any malicious party or the user himself/herself; integrityassurance schemes such as digital signatures or message authentication codes (MAC) mustbe adopted. However; these conventional schemes disclose to the verifier the completeplaintext location and thus jeopardize users' privacy. In this paper; we propose an integrityassurance scheme with minimum location disclosure. That is; the granule of the disclosedlocation is just small enough to prove the user is/has been to a certain place; and the verifiercannot learn anything beyond it. To this end; we propose a new MAC scheme called …,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2017,1
Human-powered data cleaning for probabilistic reachability queries on uncertain graphs,Xin Lin; Yun Peng; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu,Uncertain graph models are widely used in real-world applications such as knowledgegraphs and social networks. To capture the uncertainty; each edge in an uncertain graph isassociated with an existential probability that signifies the likelihood of the existence of theedge. One notable issue of querying uncertain graphs is that the results are sometimesuninformative because of the edge uncertainty. In this paper; we consider probabilisticreachability queries; which are one of the fundamental classes of graph queries. To makethe results more informative; we adopt a crowdsourcing-based approach to clean theuncertain edges. However; considering the time and monetary cost of crowdsourcing; it is aproblem to efficiently select a limited set of edges for cleaning that maximizes the qualityimprovement.

This is particularly true of graphqueries as they are typically complex and prone to errors; compounded by the fact thatgraph schemas can be missing or too loose to be helpful for query formulation. Despite thegreat success of query formulation aids; in particular; automatic query completion; graphquery autocompletion has received much less research attention. In this paper; we proposea novel framework for subgraph query autocompletion (called AutoG). Given an initial queryq and a user's preference as input; AutoG returns ranked query suggestions Q'Q′ as output.Users may choose a query from Q'Q′ and iteratively apply AutoG to compose their queries.The novelties of AutoG are as follows: First; we formalize query composition. Second; wepropose to increment a query with the logical units called c-prime features that are (i) …,The VLDB Journal,2017,1
Privacy-preserving reachability query services for massive networks,Jiaxin Jiang; Peipei Yi; Byron Choi; Zhiwei Zhang; Xiaohui Yu,Abstract This paper studies privacy-preserving reachability query services under theparadigm of data outsourcing. Specifically; graph data have been outsourced to a third-partyservice provider (SP); query clients submit their queries to the (SP); and the (SP) returns thequery answers to the clients. However; the (SP) may not always be trustworthy. Hence; thispaper investigates protecting the structural information of the graph data and the queryanswers from the (SP). Existing techniques are either insecure or not scalable. This paperproposes a privacy-preserving labeling; called ppTopo. To our knowledge; ppTopo is thefirst work that can produce reachability index on massive networks and is secure againstknown plaintext attacks (KPA). Specifically; we propose a scalable index constructionalgorithm by employing the idea of topological folding; recently proposed by Cheng et al …,Proceedings of the 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2016,1
Side-effect estimation: A filtering approach to the view update problem,Yun Peng; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu; Haibo Hu; Sourav S Bhowmick,Views and their updates have long been a fundamental technology required in a wide rangeof applications. However; it has been known that updates through views is a classicalintractable problem. In this paper; we propose a novel; data-oriented approach to thisproblem that provides a practical support for view updates. In particular; we propose asummarization of the source database of views; which serves as an update filter. The updatefilter aims to efficiently reject untranslatable view updates by estimating the side effects of theupdates; thereby avoiding costly translation analysis. For applications where estimationerrors are not preferred; our update filter can be tuned to be exact. In this paper; we presentour approach with SPJ views; an important class of view definitions. We first revise thenotion of estimation errors to quantify the filter's qualities. We then propose a novel join …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,1
Network Performance Aware Graph Partitioning for Large Graph Processing Systems in the Cloud.,Rishan Chen; Xuetian Weng; Bingsheng He; Byron Choi; Mao Yang,A wide variety of recent applications model their data in graphs/networks such as socialnetworks; web graphs; and protein–protein interaction networks. Efficient processing forlarge graph data poses new challenges for almost all components of state-of-the-art datamanagement systems. To list a few examples:(i) graph data are complex structures andcannot be efficiently stored as relational tables;(ii) the access patterns of large graphprocessing are complex; which results in inefficient disk accesses or networkcommunications; and (iii) last but not least; to tackle scalability issues; graph processingmust be efficiently distributed in a networked environment.

Spectral decomposition for optimal graph index prediction,Liyan Song; Yun Peng; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu; Bingsheng He,Abstract There is an ample body of recent research on indexing for structural graph queries.However; as verified by our experiments with a large number of random and scale-freegraphs; there may be a great variation in the performances of indexes of graph queries.Unfortunately; the structures of graph indexes are often complex and ad-hoc; so deriving anaccurate performance model is a daunting task. As a result; database practitioners mayencounter difficulties in choosing the optimal index for their data graphs. In this paper; weaddress this problem by proposing a spectral decomposition method for predicting therelative performances of graph indexes. Specifically; given a graph; we compute itsspectrum. We then propose a similarity function to compare the spectrums of graphs.

Ontology-based Graph Visualization for Summarized View,Xin Huang; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu; William K Cheung; Yanchun Zhang; Jiming Liu,Abstract Data summarization that presents a small subset of a dataset to users has beenwidely applied in numerous applications and systems. Many datasets are coded withhierarchical terminologies; eg; the international classification of Diseases-9; Medical SubjectHeading; and Gene Ontology; to name a few. In this paper; we study the problem ofselecting a diverse set of k elements to summarize an input dataset with hierarchicalterminologies; and visualize the summary in an ontology structure. We propose an efficientgreedy algorithm to solve the problem with (1-1/e)≈ 62%-approximation guarantee.Preliminary experimental results on real-world datasets show the effectiveness andefficiency of the proposed algorithm for data summarization.,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2017,*
PICASSO: exploratory search of connected subgraph substructures in graph databases,Kai Huang; Sourav S Bhowmick; Shuigeng Zhou; Byron Choi,Abstract Recently; exploratory search has received much attention in information retrievaland database fields. This search paradigm assists users who do not have a clear searchintent and are unfamiliar with the underlying data space. Specifically; query formulationevolves iteratively as the user becomes more familiar with the content. Despite its growingimportance; exploratory search on graph-structured data has received little attention in theliterature. We demonstrate a system called picasso to realize exploratory sub-structuresearch on a graph database containing a set of small or medium-sized data graphs. picassoembodies several novel features such as progressive (ie; iterative) formulation of queriesvisually and incremental processing; multi-stream results exploration wall to visualize;explore; and analyze search results to identify possible search directions.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,*
VISUAL: Simulation of Visual Subgraph Query Formulation to Enable Automated Performance Benchmarking,Sourav S Bhowmick; Huey Eng Chua; Byron Choi; Curtis Dyreson,Visual graph interfaces improve the usability of graph databases by making it easier forusers to formulate queries.

Effect of Ni Seed Layer for Electroplating 63Ni in Beta Voltaic Battery,YR Uhm; BG Choi; KJ Son; DH Jeong,Abstract Ni seed layers with a thickness of 200; 500; and 1000 Å were deposited by e-beamirradiation on a single trench PN absorber in a beta voltaic battery. The optimum thickness of63 Ni on the seed layer was determined to be about 2 μm regarding the minimum self-shielding effect of a beta-ray (β-ray). The electroplating was carried out using two-stepprocesses such as preparation of ionic solution including 63 Ni; and coating processes onthe seed layer. The electroplating of Ni on the seed layer was carried out at current densityof 20 mA/cm 2. Both the conductivity and uniformity of the seed layer are enhanced; as thethickness of deposit layer is increased. However; self-shielding of β-ray from measuringphoto-voltaic (IV curves) is significantly increase; as the thickness of the seed layer becomethick.

Selectivity Estimation of XPath for Cyclic Graphs,Yun Peng; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu,ABSTRACT Recent interests on the Semantic Web; Web ontology and XML; among othertopics; have sparked a renewed interest on graph-structured databases. Path queries areoften used to retrieve graph-structured data (or simply graphs) from the database. A crucialand classical query optimization has been query selectivity estimation. However; themajority of existing works on selectivity estimation focuses on relational and tree data. In thispaper; we investigate selectivity estimation on path queries on possibly cyclic graph data. Tofacilitate selectivity estimation on cyclic graphs; we propose a matrix representation ofgraphs extended from prime labeling; an index for reachability queries on directed acyclicgraphs. With this representation; we exploit consecutive ones property (C1P) of matrix. As aconsequence; a node is mapped to a point in a 2-dimensional plane and a query is …,*,*,*
