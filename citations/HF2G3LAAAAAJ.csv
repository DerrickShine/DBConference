-Querying the Internet with PIER,Ryan Huebsch; Joseph M Hellerstein; Nick Lanham; Boon Thau Loo; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,This chapter presents the initial design of peer-to-peer information exchange and retrieval(PIER); a massively distributed query engine based on overlay networks; which is intendedto bring database query processing facilities to new; widely distributed environments. Thechapter highlights the need for massively distributed queries; and argues for a relaxation ofcertain traditional database research goals in the pursuit of scalability and widespreadadoption. It presents simulation results showing PIER running relational queries acrossthousands of machines; and shows results from the same software base in actualdeployment on a large experimental cluster. The scalability of PIER derives from a small setof relaxed design principles; which led to some of the key decisions; including the adoptionof soft state and dilated-reachable snapshot semantics; the use of DHTs as a core …,*,2003,692
Complex queries in DHT-based peer-to-peer networks,Matthew Harren; Joseph M Hellerstein; Ryan Huebsch; Boon Thau Loo; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract Recently a new generation of P2P systems; offering distributed hash table (DHT)functionality; have been proposed. These systems greatly improve the scalability and exact-match accuracy of P2P systems; but offer only the exact-match query facility. This paperoutlines a research agenda for building complex query facilities on top of these DHT-basedP2P systems. We describe the issues involved and outline our research plan and currentstatus.,International Workshop on Peer-to-Peer Systems,2002,482
Implementing declarative overlays,Boon Thau Loo; Tyson Condie; Joseph M Hellerstein; Petros Maniatis; Timothy Roscoe; Ion Stoica,Abstract Overlay networks are used today in a variety of distributed systems ranging from file-sharing and storage systems to communication infrastructures. However; designing; buildingand adapting these overlays to the intended application and the target environment is adifficult and time consuming process. To ease the development and the deployment of suchoverlay networks we have implemented P2; a system that uses a declarative logic languageto express overlay networks in a highly compact and reusable form. P2 can express aNarada-style mesh network in 16 rules; and the Chord structured overlay in only 47 rules. P2directly parses and executes such specifications using a dataflow architecture to constructand maintain overlay networks. We describe the P2 approach; how our implementationworks; and show by experiment its promising trade-off point between specification …,ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review,2005,422
On the feasibility of peer-to-peer web indexing and search,Jinyang Li; Boon Thau Loo; Joseph M Hellerstein; M Frans Kaashoek; David R Karger; Robert Morris,Abstract This paper discusses the feasibility of peer-to-peer full-text keyword search of theWeb. Two classes of keyword search techniques are in use or have been proposed: floodingof queries over an overlay network (as in Gnutella); and intersection of index lists stored in adistributed hash table. We present a simple feasibility analysis based on the resourceconstraints and search workload. Our study suggests that the peer-to-peer network does nothave enough capacity to make naive use of either of search techniques attractive for Websearch. The paper presents a number of existing and novel optimizations for P2P searchbased on distributed hash tables; estimates their effects on performance; and concludes thatin combination these optimizations would bring the problem to within an order of magnitudeof feasibility. The paper suggests a number of compromises that might achieve the last …,International Workshop on Peer-to-Peer Systems,2003,408
Declarative routing: extensible routing with declarative queries,Boon Thau Loo; Joseph M Hellerstein; Ion Stoica; Raghu Ramakrishnan,Abstract The Internet's core routing infrastructure; while arguably robust and efficient; hasproven to be difficult to evolve to accommodate the needs of new applications. Priorresearch on this problem has included new hard-coded routing protocols on the one hand;and fully extensible Active Networks on the other. In this paper; we explore a new point inthis design space that aims to strike a better balance between the extensibility androbustness of a routing infrastructure. The basic idea of our solution; which we calldeclarative routing; is to express routing protocols using a database query language. Weshow that our query language is a natural fit for routing; and can express a variety of well-known routing protocols in a compact and clean fashion. We discuss the security of ourproposal in terms of its computational expressive power and language design. Via …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2005,316
Declarative networking: language; execution and optimization,Boon Thau Loo; Tyson Condie; Minos Garofalakis; David E Gay; Joseph M Hellerstein; Petros Maniatis; Raghu Ramakrishnan; Timothy Roscoe; Ion Stoica,Abstract The networking and distributed systems communities have recently explored avariety of new network architectures; both for application-level overlay networks; and asprototypes for a next-generation Internet architecture. In this context; we have investigateddeclarative networking: the use of a distributed recursive query engine as a powerful vehiclefor accelerating innovation in network architectures [23; 24; 33].

The case for a hybrid P2P search infrastructure,Boon Thau Loo; Ryan Huebsch; Ion Stoica; Joseph M Hellerstein,Abstract Popular P2P file-sharing systems like Gnutella and Kazaa use unstructured networkdesigns. These networks typically adopt flooding-based search techniques to locate files.While flooding-based techniques are effective for locating highly replicated items; they arepoorly suited for locating rare items. As an alternative; a wide variety of structured P2Pnetworks such as distributed hash tables (DHTs) have been recently proposed. Structurednetworks can efficiently locate rare items; but they incur significantly higher overheads thanunstructured P2P networks for popular files. Through extensive measurements of theGnutella network from multiple vantage points; we argue for a hybrid search solution; wherestructured search techniques are used to index and locate rare items; and floodingtechniques are used for locating highly replicated content. To illustrate; we present …,International Workshop on Peer-to-Peer Systems,2004,261
Adaptive precision setting for cached approximate values,Chris Olston; Boon Thau Loo; Jennifer Widom,Abstract Caching approximate values instead of exact values presents an opportunity forperformance gains in exchange for decreased precision. To maximize the performanceimprovement; cached approximations must be of appropriate precision: approximations thatare too precise easily become invalid; requiring frequent refreshing; while overly impreciseapproximations are likely to be useless to applications; which must then bypass the cache.We present a parameterized algorithm for adjusting the precision of cached approximationsadaptively to achieve the best performance as data values; precision requirements; orworkload vary. We consider interval approximations to numeric values but our ideas can beextended to other kinds of data and approximations. Our algorithm strictly generalizesprevious adaptive caching algorithms for exact copies: we can set parameters to require …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2001,257
The architecture of pier: an internet-scale query processor,Ryan Huebsch; Brent Chun; Joseph M Hellerstein; Boon Thau Loo; Petros Maniatis; Timothy Roscoe; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica; Aydan R Yumerefendi,This paper presents the architecture of PIER1; an Internetscale query engine we have beenbuilding over the last three years. PIER is the first general-purpose relational queryprocessor targeted at a peer-to-peer (p2p) architecture of thousands or millions ofparticipating nodes on the Internet. It supports massively distributed; database-styledataflows for snapshot and continuous queries. It is intended to serve as a building block fora diverse set of Internet-scale informationcentric applications; particularly those that tap intothe standardized data readily available on networked machines; including packet headers;system logs; and file names. In earlier papers we presented the vision for PIER; itsapplication relevance; and initial simulation results [28; 32]. We have also presented real-world results showing the benefits of using PIER in a p2p filesharing network [41; 43]. In …,*,2005,251

Enhancing p2p file-sharing with an internet-scale query processor,Boon Thau Loo; Joseph M Hellerstein; Ryan Huebsch; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract In this paper; we address the problem of designing a scalable; accurate queryprocessor for peer-to-peer filesharing and similar distributed keyword search systems. Usinga globally-distributed monitoring infrastructure; we perform an extensive study of theGnutella filesharing network; characterizing its topology; data and query workloads. Weobserve that Gnutella's query processing approach performs well for popular content; butquite poorly for rare items with few replicas. We then consider an alternate approach basedon Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs). We describe our implementation of PIERSearch; a DHT-based system; and propose a hybrid system where Gnutella is used to locate popular items;and PIERSearch for handling rare items.

Declarative networking,Boon Thau Loo; Tyson Condie; Minos Garofalakis; David E Gay; Joseph M Hellerstein; Petros Maniatis; Raghu Ramakrishnan; Timothy Roscoe; Ion Stoica,Abstract Declarative Networking is a programming methodology that enables developers toconcisely specify network protocols and services; which are directly compiled to a dataflowframework that executes the specifications. This paper provides an introduction to basicissues in declarative networking; including language design; optimization; and dataflowexecution. We present the intuition behind declarative programming of networks; includingroots in Datalog; extensions for networked environments; and the semantics of long-runningqueries over network state. We focus on a sublanguage we call Network Datalog (NDlog);including execution strategies that provide crisp eventual consistency semantics withsignificant flexibility in execution. We also describe a more general language called Overlog;which makes some compromises between expressive richness and semantic guarantees …,Communications of the ACM,2009,169
Efficient querying and maintenance of network provenance at internet-scale,Wenchao Zhou; Micah Sherr; Tao Tao; Xiaozhou Li; Boon Thau Loo; Yun Mao,Abstract Network accountability; forensic analysis; and failure diagnosis are becomingincreasingly important for network management and security. Such capabilities often utilizenetwork provenance-the ability to issue queries over network meta-data. For example;network provenance may be used to trace the path a message traverses on the network aswell as to determine how message data were derived and which parties were involved in itsderivation. This paper presents the design and implementation of ExSPAN; a generic andextensible framework that achieves efficient network provenance in a distributedenvironment. We utilize the database notion of data provenance to" explain" the existence ofany network state; providing a versatile mechanism for network provenance. To achievesuch flexibility at Internet-scale; ExSPAN uses declarative networking in which network …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,121

This tutorial briefly reviews theDatalog language and recursive query processing and optimization techniques; thendiscusses applications of Datalog in three application domains: data integration; declarativenetworking; and program analysis.

Secure network provenance,Wenchao Zhou; Qiong Fei; Arjun Narayan; Andreas Haeberlen; Boon Thau Loo; Micah Sherr,Abstract This paper introduces secure network provenance (SNP); a novel technique thatenables networked systems to explain to their operators why they are in a certain state--eg;why a suspicious routing table entry is present on a certain router; or where a given cacheentry originated. SNP provides network forensics capabilities by permitting operators to trackdown faulty or misbehaving nodes; and to assess the damage such nodes may have causedto the rest of the system. SNP is designed for adversarial settings and is robust tomanipulation; its tamper-evident properties ensure that operators can detect whencompromised nodes lie or falsely implicate correct nodes. We also present the design ofSNooPy; a general-purpose SNP system. To demonstrate that SNooPy is practical; we applyit to three example applications: the Quagga BGP daemon; a declarative implementation …,Proceedings of the Twenty-Third ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles,2011,92
Declarative automated cloud resource orchestration,Changbin Liu; Boon Thau Loo; Yun Mao,Abstract As cloud computing becomes widely deployed; one of the challenges facedinvolves the ability to orchestrate a highly complex set of subsystems (compute; storage;network resources) that span large geographic areas serving diverse clients. To ease thisprocess; we present COPE (Cloud Orchestration Policy Engine); a distributed platform thatallows cloud providers to perform declarative automated cloud resource orchestration. InCOPE; cloud providers specify system-wide constraints and goals using COPElog; adeclarative policy language geared towards specifying distributed constraint optimizations.COPE takes policy specifications and cloud system states as input and then optimizescompute; storage and network resource allocations within the cloud such that provideroperational objectives and customer SLAs can be better met.

Declarative network verification,Anduo Wang; Prithwish Basu; Boon Thau Loo; Oleg Sokolsky,Abstract In this paper; we present our initial design and implementation of a declarativenetwork verifier (DNV). DNV utilizes theorem proving; a well established verificationtechnique where logic-based axioms that automatically capture network semantics aregenerated; and a user-driven proof process is used to establish network correctnessproperties. DNV takes as input declarative networking specifications written in the NetworkDatalog (NDlog) query language; and maps that automatically into logical axioms that canbe directly used in existing theorem provers to validate protocol correctness. DNV is asignificant improvement compared to existing use case of theorem proving which typicallyrequire several man-months to construct the system specifications. Moreover; NDlog; a high-level specification; whose semantics are precisely compiled into DNV without loss; can be …,International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages,2009,65
Real-time MapReduce scheduling,Linh TX Phan; Zhuoyao Zhang; Boon Thau Loo; Insup Lee,Abstract In this paper; we explore the feasibility of enabling the scheduling of mixed hardand soft real-time MapReduce applications. We first present an experimental evaluation ofthe popular Hadoop MapReduce middleware on the Amazon EC2 cloud. Our evaluationreveals tradeoffs between overall system throughput and execution time predictability; aswell as highlights a number of factors affecting real-time scheduling; such as dataplacement; concurrent users; and master scheduling overhead. Based on our evaluationstudy; we present a formal model for capturing real-time MapReduce applications and theHadoop platform.

Distributed web crawling over DHTs,Boon Thau Loo; Owen Cooper; Sailesh Krishnamurthy,Abstract In this paper; we present the design and implementation of a distributed webcrawler. We begin by motivating the need for such a crawler; as a basic building block fordecentralized web search applications. The distributed crawler harnesses the excessbandwidth and computing resources of clients to crawl the web. Nodes participating in thecrawl use a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) to coordinate and distribute work. We studydifferent crawl distribution strategies and investigate the trade-offs in communicationoverheads; crawl throughput; balancing load on the crawlers as well as crawl targets; andthe ability to exploit network proximity. We present an implementation of the distributedcrawler using PIER; a relational query processor that runs over the Bamboo DHT; andcompare different crawl strategies on Planet-Lab querying live web sources.,Departmental Papers (CIS),2004,50
Scalable link-based relay selection for anonymous routing,Micah Sherr; Matt Blaze; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract The performance of an anonymous path can be described using many networkmetrics–eg; bandwidth; latency; jitter; loss; etc. However; existing relay selection algorithmshave focused exclusively on producing paths with high bandwidth. In contrast to traditionalnode-based path techniques in which relay selection is biased by relays' node-characteristics (ie; bandwidth); this paper presents the case for link-based path generation inwhich relay selection is weighted in favor of the highest performing links. Link-based relayselection supports more flexible routing; enabling anonymous paths with low latency; jitter;and loss; in addition to high bandwidth. Link-based approaches are also more secure thannode-based techniques; eliminating “hotspots” in the network that attract a disproportionateamount of traffic. For example; misbehaving relays cannot advertise themselves as “low …,International Symposium on Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium,2009,49
Towards a Declarative Language and System for Secure Networking.,Martín Abadi; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract In this paper; we present a declarative language and system for describing andimplementing secure networks. Our proposed language; SeNDlog; is an attempt at unifyingBinder; a logic-based language for access control in distributed systems; and NetworkDatalog (NDlog); a database query language for declarative networks. The contributions ofthis paper are as follows. First; we highlight the similarities and differences between Binderand NDlog with regards to their notion of location; trust model; and evaluation strategies.Second; we motivate and propose the SeNDlog language that combines features fromBinder and NDlog. Third; we demonstrate the use of SeNDlog for specifying securenetworks and present directions for future work.,NetDB,2007,49
Private and verifiable interdomain routing decisions,Mingchen Zhao; Wenchao Zhou; Alexander JT Gurney; Andreas Haeberlen; Micah Sherr; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract Existing secure interdomain routing protocols can verify validity properties aboutindividual routes; such as whether they correspond to a real network path. It is often useful toverify more complex properties relating to the route decision procedure-for example;whether the chosen route was the best one available; or whether it was consistent with thenetwork's peering agreements. However; this is difficult to do without knowing a network'srouting policy and full routing state; which are not normally disclosed. In this paper; we showhow a network can allow its peers to verify a number of nontrivial properties of itsinterdomain routing decisions without revealing any additional information. If all theproperties hold; the peers learn nothing beyond what the interdomain routing protocolalready reveals; if a property does not hold; at least one peer can detect this and prove …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2012,47

Automated profiling and resource management of pig programs for meeting service level objectives,Zhuoyao Zhang; Ludmila Cherkasova; Abhishek Verma; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract An increasing number of MapReduce applications associated with live businessintelligence require completion time guarantees. In this paper; we consider the popular Pigframework that provides a high-level SQL-like abstraction on top of MapReduce engine forprocessing large data sets. Programs written in such frameworks are compiled into directedacyclic graphs (DAGs) of MapReduce jobs. There is a lack of performance models andanalysis tools for automated performance management of such MapReduce jobs. We offer aperformance modeling environment for Pig programs that automatically profiles jobs fromthe past runs and aims to solve the following inter-related problems:(i) estimating thecompletion time of a Pig program as a function of allocated resources;(ii) estimating theamount of resources (a number of map and reduce slots) required for completing a Pig …,Proceedings of the 9th international conference on Autonomic computing,2012,41
Maintaining distributed logic programs incrementally,Vivek Nigam; Limin Jia; Boon Thau Loo; Andre Scedrov,Abstract Distributed logic programming languages; which allow both facts and programs tobe distributed among different nodes in a network; have been recently proposed and used todeclaratively program a wide-range of distributed systems; such as network protocols andmulti-agent systems. However; the distributed nature of the underlying systems posesserious challenges to developing efficient and correct algorithms for evaluating theseprograms. This paper proposes an efficient asynchronous algorithm to computeincrementally the changes to the states in response to insertions and deletions of base facts.Our algorithm is formally proven to be correct in the presence of message reordering in thesystem. To our knowledge; this is the first formal proof of correctness for such an algorithm.,Computer Languages; Systems & Structures,2012,39
Recursive computation of regions and connectivity in networks,Mengmeng Liu; Nicholas E Taylor; Wenchao Zhou; Zachary G Ives; Boon Thau Loo,In recent years; the data management community has begun to consider situations in whichdata access is closely tied to network routing and distributed acquisition: examples include;sensor networks that execute queries about reachable nodes or contiguous regions;declarative networks that maintain information about shortest paths and reachableendpoints; and distributed and peer-to-peer stream systems that detect associations (eg;transitive relationships) among data at the distributed sources. In each case; thefundamental operation is to maintain a view over dynamic network state. This view istypically distributed; recursive; and may contain aggregation; eg; describing transitiveconnectivity; shortest paths; least costly paths; or region membership. Surprisingly; solutionsto computing such views are often domain-specific; expensive; and incomplete. In this …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,39
An empirical analysis of scheduling techniques for real-time cloud-based data processing,Linh TX Phan; Zhuoyao Zhang; Qi Zheng; Boon Thau Loo; Insup Lee,In this paper; we explore the challenges and needs of current cloud infrastructures; to bettersupport cloud-based data-intensive applications that are not only latency-sensitive but alsorequire strong timing guarantees. These applications have strict deadlines (eg; to performtime-dependent mission critical tasks or to complete real-time control decisions using ahuman-in-the-loop); and deadline misses are undesirable. To highlight the challenges inthis space; we provide a case study of the online scheduling of MapReduce jobs executedby Hadoop. Our evaluations on Amazon EC2 show that the existing Hadoop scheduler is ill-equipped to handle jobs with deadlines. However; by adapting existing multiprocessorscheduling techniques for the cloud environment; we observe significant performanceimprovements in minimizing missed deadlines and tardiness.

Impact of path characteristics and scheduling policies on MPTCP performance,Behnaz Arzani; Alexander Gurney; Shuotian Cheng; Roch Guerin; Boon Thau Loo,With increasing deployment of Multipath TCP (MPTCP) in multihoming and data enterscenarios; there is a need to understand how its performance is affected in practice-both bytraditional factors such as RTT measurements; and by new multipath-specific considerationssuch as sub flow selection. We carried out an initial but comprehensive study using anactual MPTCP implementation in an emulated network environment; to explore the impact ofdifferent factors on MPTCP throughput. We find that path selection and packet schedulinghave a large effect on performance; and that merely trusting the congestion controlmechanism to do the right thing is not enough. Moreover; we provide evidence thatthroughput can be improved by slight modifications to the send buffers and path selectioncomponents of the implementation.

Diagnosing missing events in distributed systems with negative provenance,Yang Wu; Mingchen Zhao; Andreas Haeberlen; Wenchao Zhou; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract When debugging a distributed system; it is sometimes necessary to explain theabsence of an event-for instance; why a certain route is not available; or why a certainpacket did not arrive. Existing debuggers offer some support for explaining the presence ofevents; usually by providing the equivalent of a backtrace in conventional debuggers; butthey are not very good at answering'Why not?'questions: there is simply no starting point fora possible backtrace. In this paper; we show that the concept of negative provenance can beused to explain the absence of events in distributed systems. Negative provenance relies oncounterfactual reasoning to identify the conditions under which the missing event could haveoccurred. We define a formal model of negative provenance for distributed systems; and wepresent the design of a system called Y! that tracks both positive and negative …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2014,33
Towards dynamic pricing-based collaborative optimizations for green data centers,Yang Li; David Chiu; Changbin Liu; Linh TX Phan; Tanveer Gill; Sanchit Aggarwal; Zhuoyao Zhang; Boon Thau Loo; David Maier; Bart McManus,Increased demand for cloud computing services has ushered power management schemesinto the frontlines of data center research. Meanwhile; market penetration of intermittentrenewable energy sources (eg; wind and solar) is on the rise. While clean and abundant;their intermittency is troubling for utility companies; requiring power balancing reserves to bedeployed at anytime to precisely match consumer demand with energy availability.However; a transformative redesign of our power grid is looming; calling for the use ofdynamic energy pricing to resolve this issue by possibly shaping demand.

Exploiting cloud heterogeneity to optimize performance and cost of MapReduce processing,Zhuoyao Zhang; Ludmila Cherkasova; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract Cloud computing offers a new; attractive option to customers for quicklyprovisioning any size Hadoop cluster; consuming resources as a service; executing theirMapReduce workload; and then paying for the time these resources were used. One of theopen questions in such environments is the right choice of resources (and their amount) auser should lease from the service provider. Typically; there is a variety of different types ofVM instances in the Cloud (eg; small; medium; or large EC2 instances). The capacitydifferences of the offered VMs are reflected in VM's pricing. Therefore; for the same price auser can get a variety of Hadoop clusters based on different VM instance types.

This makes a selection of the best cost/performance platform for a given …,ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review,2015,32
Distributed time-aware provenance,Wenchao Zhou; Suyog Mapara; Yiqing Ren; Yang Li; Andreas Haeberlen; Zachary Ives; Boon Thau Loo; Micah Sherr,Abstract The ability to reason about changes in a distributed system's state enables networkadministrators to better diagnose protocol misconfigurations; detect intrusions; and pinpointperformance bottlenecks. We propose a novel provenance model called Distributed Time-aware Provenance (DTaP) that aids forensics and debugging in distributed systems byexplicitly representing time; distributed state; and state changes. Using a distributed Datalogabstraction for modeling distributed protocols; we prove that the DTaP model provides asound and complete representation that correctly captures dependencies among events in adistributed system. We additionally introduce DistTape; an implementation of the DTaPmodel that uses novel distributed storage structures; query processing; and cost-basedoptimization techniques to efficiently query time-aware provenance in a distributed setting …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,32

A³ allows applications to tailor their anonymity properties and performancecharacteristics according to specific communication requirements. To support flexible pathconstruction; A³ exposes a declarative language (A³LOG) that enables applications tocompactly specify path selection and instantiation policies executed by a declarativenetworking engine. We demonstrate that our declarative language is sufficiently expressiveto encode novel multi-metric performance constraints as well as existing relay selectionalgorithms employed by Tor and other anonymity systems; using only a few lines of concisecode.

Performance modeling of mapreduce jobs in heterogeneous cloud environments,Zhuoyao Zhang; Ludmila Cherkasova; Boon Thau Loo,Many companies start using Hadoop for advanced data analytics over large datasets. Whilea traditional Hadoop cluster deployment assumes a homogeneous cluster; many enterpriseclusters are grown incrementally over time; and might have a variety of different servers inthe cluster. The nodes' heterogeneity represents an additional challenge for efficient clusterand job management. Due to resource heterogeneity; it is often unclear which resourcesintroduce inefficiency and bottlenecks; and how such a Hadoop cluster should be configuredand optimized. In this work1; we explore the efficiency and performance accuracy of thebounds-based performance model for predicting the MapReduce job completion times inheterogeneous Hadoop clusters.

Benchmarking approach for designing a mapreduce performance model,Zhuoyao Zhang; Ludmila Cherkasova; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract In MapReduce environments; many of the programs are reused for processing aregularly incoming new data. A typical user question is how to estimate the completion timeof these programs as a function of a new dataset and the cluster resources. In this work1; weoffer a novel performance evaluation framework for answering this question. We observethat the execution of each map (reduce) tasks consists of specific; well-defined dataprocessing phases. Only map and reduce functions are custom and their executions areuser-defined for different MapReduce jobs. The executions of the remaining phases aregeneric and depend on the amount of data processed by the phase and the performance ofunderlying Hadoop cluster. First; we design a set of parameterizable microbenchmarks tomeasure generic phases and to derive a platform performance model of a given Hadoop …,Proceedings of the 4th ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering,2013,31

Network functions virtualization with soft real-time guarantees,Yang Li; Linh Thi Xuan Phan; Boon Thau Loo,Network functions are increasingly being commoditized as software appliances on off-the-shelf machines; popularly known as Network Functions Virtualization (NFV). While this trendprovides economics of scale; a key challenge is to ensure that the performance of virtualappliances match that of hardware boxes. We present the design and implementation ofNFV-RT; a system that dynamically provisions resources in an NFV environment to providetiming guarantees. Specifically; given a set of service chains that each consist of somenetwork functions; NFV-RT aims at maximizing the total number of requests that can beassigned to the cloud for each service chain; while ensuring that the assigned requests meettheir deadlines. Our approach uses a linear programming model with randomized roundingto efficiently and proactively obtain a near-optimal solution.

In FVN; formal logical statements are used tospecify the behavior and the properties of the protocol. FVN uses declarative networking asan intermediary layer between high-level logical specifications of the network model and low-level implementations. A theorem prover is used to statically verify the properties ofdeclarative network protocols. Moreover; a property preserving translation exists forgenerating declarative networking implementations from verified formal specifications.

Maintaining recursive views of regions and connectivity in networks,Mengmeng Liu; Nicholas E Taylor; Wenchao Zhou; Zachary G Ives; Boon Thau Loo,The data management community has recently begun to consider declarative networkrouting and distributed acquisition: eg; sensor networks that execute queries aboutcontiguous regions; declarative networks that maintain shortest paths; and distributed andpeer-to-peer stream systems that detect transitive relationships among data at the distributedsources. In each case; the fundamental operation is to maintain a view over dynamicnetwork state. This view is typically distributed; recursive; and may contain aggregation; eg;describing shortest paths or least costly paths. Surprisingly; solutions to computing suchviews are often domain-specific; expensive; and incomplete. We recast the problem asincremental recursive view maintenance given distributed streams of updates to tuples: newstream data becomes insert operations and tuple expirations become deletions.

Veracity: A fully decentralized service for securing network coordinate systems,Micah Sherr; Boon Thau Loo; Matt Blaze,Abstract Decentralized logical coordinate systems have been proposed as a means ofestimating network distances. These systems have widespread usage in p2p networks;ranging from neighbor selection to replica placement. Unfortunately; these systems arevulnerable to even a small number of malicious nodes lying about their coordinates ormeasurements. In this paper; we introduce Veracity; a fully decentralized service forsecuring network coordinate systems. Unlike prior proposals; Veracity requires neither thepresence of a large number of a priori trusted nodes nor the use of network triangleinequality testing. Veracity utilizes a vote-based approach; where all advertised coordinatesare independently verified by a minimal set of nodes before being used.

The good; the bad; and the differences: Better network diagnostics with differential provenance,Ang Chen; Yang Wu; Andreas Haeberlen; Wenchao Zhou; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract In this paper; we propose a new approach to diagnosing problems in complexdistributed systems. Our approach is based on the insight that many of the trickiest problemsare anomalies. For instance; in a network; problems often affect only a small fraction of thetraffic (eg; perhaps a certain subnet); or they only manifest infrequently. Thus; it is quitecommon for the operator to have “examples” of both working and non-working traffic readilyavailable–perhaps a packet that was misrouted; and a similar packet that was routedcorrectly. In this case; the cause of the problem is likely to be wherever the two packets weretreated differently by the network. We present the design of a debugger that can leveragethis information using a novel concept that we call differential provenance.

AutoTune: Optimizing Execution Concurrency and Resource Usage in MapReduce Workflows.,Zhuoyao Zhang; Ludmila Cherkasova; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract An increasing number of MapReduce applications are written using high-level SQL-like abstractions on top of MapReduce engines. Such programs are translated intoMapReduce workflows where the output of one job becomes the input of the next job in aworkflow. A user must specify the number of reduce tasks for each MapReduce job in aworkflow. The reduce task setting may have a significant impact on the executionconcurrency; processing efficiency; and the completion time of the worklflow.

Analyzing bgp instances in maude,Anduo Wang; Carolyn Talcott; Limin Jia; Boon Thau Loo; Andre Scedrov,Abstract Analyzing Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) instances is a crucial step in the designand implementation of safe BGP systems. Today; the analysis is a manual and tediousprocess. Researchers study the instances by manually constructing execution sequences;hoping to either identify an oscillation or show that the instance is safe by exhaustivelyexamining all possible sequences.

As-cred: Reputation and alert service for interdomain routing,Jian Chang; Krishna K Venkatasubramanian; Andrew G West; Sampath Kannan; Insup Lee; Boon Thau Loo; Oleg Sokolsky,As the backbone routing system of the Internet; the operational aspect of the interdomainrouting is highly complex. Building a trustworthy ecosystem for interdomain routing requiresthe proper maintenance of trust relationships among tens of thousands of peer IP domainscalled autonomous systems (ASes). ASes today implicitly trust any routing informationreceived from other ASes as part of border gateway protocol (BGP) updates. Such blind trustis problematic given the dramatic rise in the number of anomalous updates beingdisseminated; which pose grave security consequences for the interdomain routingoperation. In this paper; we present AS-CRED; an AS reputation and alert service that notonly detects anomalous BGP updates; but also provides a quantitative view ofAS'tendencies to perpetrate anomalous behavior.

Reduction-based formal analysis of BGP instances,Anduo Wang; Carolyn Talcott; Alexander JT Gurney; Boon Thau Loo; Andre Scedrov,Abstract Today's Internet interdomain routing protocol; the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP);is increasingly complicated and fragile due to policy misconfigurations by individualautonomous systems (ASes). These misconfigurations are often difficult to manuallydiagnose beyond a small number of nodes due to the state explosion problem. To aid thediagnosis of potential anomalies; researchers have developed various formal models andanalysis tools. However; these techniques do not scale well or do not cover the full set ofanomalies. Current techniques use oversimplified BGP models that capture eitheranomalies within or across ASes; but not the interactions between the two. To address theselimitations; we propose a novel approach that reduces network size prior to analysis; whilepreserving crucial BGP correctness properties.

Having your cake and eating it too: Routing security with privacy protections,Alexander JT Gurney; Andreas Haeberlen; Wenchao Zhou; Micah Sherr; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract Internet Service Providers typically do not reveal details of their interdomain routingpolicies due to security concerns; or for commercial or legal reasons. As a result; it is difficultto hold ISPs accountable for their contractual agreements. Existing solutions can checkbasic properties; eg; whether route announcements correspond to valid routes; but they donot verify how these routes were chosen. In essence; today's Internet forces us to choosebetween per-AS privacy and verifiability. In this paper; we argue that making this difficulttradeoff is unnecessary. We propose private and verifiable routing (PVR); a technique thatenables ISPs to check whether their neighbors are fulfilling their contractual promises tothem; and to obtain evidence of any violations; without disclosing information that the routingprotocol does not already reveal. As initial evidence that PVR is feasible; we sketch a …,Proceedings of the 10th ACM workshop on hot topics in networks,2011,15
Customizable routing with declarative queries,Boon Thau Loo; Joseph M Hellerstein; Ion Stoica,Abstract To meet the demands of new Internet applications; recent work argues for givingend-hosts more control over routing. To achieve this goal; we propose the use of a recursivequery language; which allows users to define their own routing protocols. Recursive queriescan be used to express a large variety of route requests such as the k shortest paths;shortest paths that avoid (or include) a given set of nodes and least-loaded paths. We showthat these queries can be efficiently implemented in the network; and in the simple casewhen all users request shortest paths; the communication overhead of our solution is similarto that incurred by a distance vector protocol. In addition; when only a subset of nodes issuethe same query; the communication cost can be further lowered using automatic queryoptimization techniques-suggesting that declarative queries and automatic optimization …,*,2004,15
AS-TRUST: A trust quantification scheme for autonomous systems in BGP,Jian Chang; Krishna K Venkatasubramanian; Andrew G West; Sampath Kannan; Boon Thau Loo; Oleg Sokolsky; Insup Lee,Abstract The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) works by frequently exchanging updates thatdisseminate reachability information about IP prefixes (ie; IP address blocks) betweenAutonomous Systems (ASes) on the Internet. The ideal operation of BGP relies on threemajor behavioral assumptions (BAs):(1) information contained in the update is legal andcorrect;(2) a route to a prefix is stable; and (3) the route adheres to the valley free routingpolicy. The current operation of BGP implicitly trusts all ASes to adhere to theseassumptions. However; several documented violation of these assumptions attest to the factthat such an assumption of trust is perilous. This paper presents AS-TRUST; a scheme thatcomprehensively characterizes the trustworthiness of ASes with respect to their adherenceof the behavioral assumptions.

Using numerical analysis and a model-driven investigation; the paperelucidates and validates the empirical results; and highlights MPTCP's non-linear couplingbetween paths as a primary cause for this behavior. The findings are both of operationalinterest and may help design better MPTCP schedulers; as they are also exposed tocomplex interactions with MPTCP's congestion control.,Network Protocols (ICNP); 2014 IEEE 22nd International Conference on,2014,13
Answering why-not queries in software-defined networks with negative provenance,Yang Wu; Andreas Haeberlen; Wenchao Zhou; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract When debugging an SDN; it is sometimes necessary to explain the absence of anevent: why a certain rule was not installed; or why a certain packet did not arrive. ExistingSDN debuggers offer some support for explaining the presence of events; usually byproviding the equivalent of a" backtrace" in conventional debuggers; but they are not verygood at answering" Why not?" questions: there is simply no starting point for a possiblebacktrace. In this paper; we show that the concept of negative provenance can be used toexplain the absence of events in SDNs. Negative provenance relies on counterfactualreasoning to identify the conditions under which the missing event could have occurred. Weoutline a simple technique that can track negative provenance in SDNs; and we present acase study to illustrate how our technique can be used to answer concrete" Why not?" …,Proceedings of the twelfth ACM workshop on hot topics in networks,2013,13
Performance modeling and optimization of deadline-driven pig programs,Zhuoyao Zhang; Ludmila Cherkasova; Abhishek Verma; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract Many applications associated with live business intelligence are written as complexdata analysis programs defined by directed acyclic graphs of MapReduce jobs; for example;using Pig; Hive; or Scope frameworks. An increasing number of these applications haveadditional requirements for completion time guarantees. In this article; we consider thepopular Pig framework that provides a high-level SQL-like abstraction on top of MapReduceengine for processing large data sets. There is a lack of performance models and analysistools for automated performance management of such MapReduce jobs. We offer aperformance modeling environment for Pig programs that automatically profiles jobs fromthe past runs and aims to solve the following inter-related problems:(i) estimating thecompletion time of a Pig program as a function of allocated resources;(ii) estimating the …,ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems (TAAS),2013,13
Taking the blame game out of data centers operations with netpoirot,Behnaz Arzani; Selim Ciraci; Boon Thau Loo; Assaf Schuster; Geoff Outhred,Abstract Today; root cause analysis of failures in data centers is mostly done throughmanual inspection. More often than not; cus-tomers blame the network as the culprit.However; other components of the system might have caused these failures. Totroubleshoot; huge volumes of data are collected over the entire data center. Correlatingsuch large volumes of diverse data collected from different vantage points is a daunting taskeven for the most skilled technicians. In this paper; we revisit the question: how much canyou infer about a failure in the data center using TCP statistics collected at one of theendpoints? Using an agent that cap-tures TCP statistics we devised a classificationalgorithm that identifies the root cause of failure using this information at a single endpoint.Using insights derived from this classi-fication algorithm we identify dominant TCP metrics …,Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGCOMM Conference,2016,12
Optimizing completion time and resource provisioning of pig programs,Zhuoyao Zhang; Ludmila Cherkasova; Abhishek Verma; Boon Thau Loo,As cloud computing continues to mature; IT managers have started concentrating on thesupport of additional performance requirements: quality of service and tailored resourceallocation for achieving service performance goals. In this paper; we consider the popularPig framework that provides a high-level SQL-like abstraction on top of MapReduce enginefor processing large data sets. Programs written in such frameworks are compiled intodirected acyclic graphs (DAGs) of MapReduce jobs. Often; data processing applicationshave to produce results by a certain time deadline.

FSR: formal analysis and implementation toolkit for safe inter-domain routing,Yiqing Ren; Wenchao Zhou; Anduo Wang; Limin Jia; Alexander JT Gurney; Boon Thau Loo; Jennifer Rexford,Abstract We present the demonstration of a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing andimplementing routing policies; ranging from high-level guidelines to specific routerconfigurations. Our Formally Safe Routing (FSR) toolkit performs all of these functions fromthe same algebraic representation of routing policy. We show that routing algebra has a verynatural translation to both integer constraints (to perform safety analysis using SMT solvers)and declarative programs (to generate distributed implementations). Our demonstration withrealistic topologies and policies shows how FSR can detect problems in an AS's iBGPconfiguration; prove sufficient conditions for BGP safety; and empirically evaluateconvergence time.,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2011,12
TAP: Time-aware Provenance for Distributed Systems.,Wenchao Zhou; Ling Ding; Andreas Haeberlen; Zachary G Ives; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract In this paper; we explore the use of provenance for analyzing execution dynamicsin distributed systems. We argue that provenance could have significant practical benefits forsystem administrators; eg; for reasoning about changes in a system's state; diagnosingprotocol misconfigurations; detecting intrusions; and pinpointing performance bottlenecks.However; to realize this vision; we must revisit several aspects of provenance management.As a first step; we present time-aware provenance (TAP); an enhanced provenance modelthat explicitly represents time; distributed state; and state changes. We outline our researchagenda towards developing novel query processing; languages; and optimizationtechniques that can be used to efficiently and securely query time-aware provenance; evenin the presence of transient state or untrusted nodes.,TaPP,2011,12

It is based on theassumptions that:(1) cloud computing will comprise an increasing fraction of the applicationworkload offered to an Internet; and (2) that access to cloud computing resources willdemand new architectural features from a network. Features that we have identified includedependability; security; flexibility and extensibility; the entirety of which constitute resilience.Nebula provides resilient networking services using ultrareliable routers; an extensiblecontrol plane and use of multiple paths upon which arbitrary policies may be enforced.

This paper makes thecase for a new; focused Grand Challenge: Public Health for the Internet. The goal of PHI (orφ) is to enable collectives of hosts on the Internet to jointly monitor and promote networkhealth by sharing information on network conditions in a peer-to-peer fashion. We argue thatthis will be a positive effort for the research community for a variety of reasons; both in termsof its technical reach and its societal impact.,*,2007,11

Data Provenance at Internet Scale: Architecture; Experiences; and the Road Ahead.,Ang Chen; Yang Wu; Andreas Haeberlen; Boon Thau Loo; Wenchao Zhou,A BSTRACT Provenance is a way to answer “why” questions about computations. It hasfound a number of uses in the database community; such as debugging query answers ortracing unexpected results to database tuples. In fact; the ability to ask “why” can be usefulfor a much broader range of applications. In this paper; we summarize our experiences overthe past few years in adapting provenance for diagnostic and forensic uses in networks anddistributed systems. Our work draws inspirations from database provenance; yet thedeployment scale; use cases; and distributed nature of networks require a significant re-design of traditional data provenance models. We review a number of use cases; rangingfrom investigating intrusions to diagnosing (and even automatically fixing) softwaredefinednetworks; and present a unified system architecture that we have designed and …,CIDR,2017,9
Enabling incremental query re-optimization,Mengmeng Liu; Zachary G Ives; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract As declarative query processing techniques expand to the Web; data streams;network routers; and cloud platforms; there is an increasing need to re-plan execution in thepresence of unanticipated performance changes. New runtime information may affect whichquery plan we prefer to run. Adaptive techniques require innovation both in terms of thealgorithms used to estimate costs; and in terms of the search algorithm that finds the bestplan. We investigate how to build a cost-based optimizer that recomputes the optimal planincrementally given new cost information; much as a stream engine constantly updates itsoutputs given new data. Our implementation especially shows benefits for streamprocessing workloads. It lays the foundations upon which a variety of novel adaptiveoptimization algorithms can be built. We start by leveraging the recently proposed …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,9
Scenario-based programming for SDN policies,Yifei Yuan; Dong Lin; Rajeev Alur; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract Recent emergence of software-defined networks offers an opportunity to designdomain-specific programming abstractions aimed at network operators. In this paper; wepropose scenario-based programming; a framework that allows network operators toprogram network policies by describing representative example behaviors. Given thesescenarios; our synthesis algorithm automatically infers the controller state that needs to bemaintained along with the rules to process network events and update state. We havedeveloped the NetEgg scenario-based programming tool; which can execute the generatedpolicy implementation on top of a centralized controller; but also automatically infers flow-table rules that can be pushed to switches to improve throughput.

Automated network repair with meta provenance,Yang Wu; Ang Chen; Andreas Haeberlen; Wenchao Zhou; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract When debugging an SDN application; diagnosing the problem is merely the firststep--the operator must still implement a solution that works; and that does not cause newproblems elsewhere. However; most existing SDN debuggers focus exclusively onidentifying the problem and offer the network operator little or no help with finding aneffective fix. Finding a fix is challenging because the number of potential repairs can beenormous. In this paper; we propose a first step towards automated repair for SDNapplications. Our approach consists of two elements. The first is a data structure we callmeta provenance; which can be used to efficiently find good candidate repairs. Metaprovenance is inspired by the provenance concept from the database community. However;whereas standard provenance can only reason about changes to data; meta-provenance …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks,2015,9
A scalable multi-datacenter layer-2 network architecture,Chen Chen; Changbin Liu; Pingkai Liu; Boon Thau Loo; Ling Ding,Abstract Cloud today is evolving towards multi-datacenter deployment; with each datacenterserving customers in different geographical areas. The independence between datacenters;however; prohibits effective inter-datacenter resource sharing and flexible management ofthe infrastructure. In this paper; we propose WL2; a Software-Defined Networking (SDN)solution to an Internet-scale Layer-2 network across multiple datacenters. In WL2; a logicallycentralized controller handles control-plane communication and configuration in eachdatacenter. We achieve scalability in three ways:(1) eliminating Layer-2 broadcast byrerouting control-plane traffic to the controller;(2) introducing a layered addressing schemefor aggregate Layer-2 routing; and (3) creating an overlay abstraction on top of physicaltopology for fast flow setup. WL2 is fault-tolerant against controller and gateway failures …,Proceedings of the 1st ACM SIGCOMM Symposium on Software Defined Networking Research,2015,9
Parameterizable benchmarking framework for designing a mapreduce performance model,Zhuoyao Zhang; Ludmila Cherkasova; Boon Thau Loo,SUMMARY In MapReduce environments; many applications have to achieve differentperformance goals for producing time relevant results. One of typical user questions is howto estimate the completion time of a MapReduce program as a function of varying inputdataset sizes and given cluster resources. In this work; we offer a novel performanceevaluation framework for answering this question. We analyze the MapReduce processingpipeline and utilize the fact that the execution of map (reduce) tasks consists of specific; well-defined data processing phases. Only map and reduce functions are custom; and theirexecutions are user-defined for different MapReduce jobs. The executions of the remainingphases are generic (ie; defined by the MapReduce framework code) and depend on theamount of data processed by the phase and the performance of the underlying Hadoop …,Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience,2014,9
Experiences in teaching an educational user-level operating systems implementation project,Adam J Aviv; Vin Mannino; Thanat Owlarn; Seth Shannin; Kevin Xu; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract The importance of a comprehensive implementation component for undergraduateOperating Systems (OS) courses cannot be understated. Students not only develop deepinsight and understanding of OS fundamentals; but they also learn key software engineeringskills that only a large development project; such as implementing an OS; can teach. Thereare clear benefits to traditional OS projects where students program or alter real (Linux)kernel source or extend educational OS implementations; however; in our experience;bootstrapping such a project is a huge undertaking that may not be accessible in manyclassrooms.

Partial specification of routing configurations,Alexander JT Gurney; Limin Jia; Anduo Wang; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract The formal analysis of routing protocol configurations for safety properties is wellestablished. Methods exist to identify potential protocol oscillations by analysis of thenetwork topology and route preference information. However; if not all of this information isavailable; then the existing theory does not apply. We present an analysis of partialspecification of protocol instances and apply it to eBGP and iBGP examples; so that potentialoscillations can be detected from the incomplete data. This technique is applicable to theincremental design of network configurations; where some parts of the design have beenspecified but others are not yet known. We also anticipate that automated tools could beused to 'fill in the blanks' of a partial configuration in some optimal way. To that end; we showhow our analysis can be used to derive constraints on an IGP weight matrix …,*,2011,8

IDCP has been operational for many years;and currently is deployed live on tens of thousands of machines that are globally distributedat various data centers. We perform an analysis of job execution traces obtained over a oneyear period collected from tens of thousands of IDCP machines from 20 different pools.

A program logic for verifying secure routing protocols,Chen Chen; Limin Jia; Hao Xu; Cheng Luo; Wenchao Zhou; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract The Internet; as it stands today; is highly vulnerable to attacks. However; little hasbeen done to understand and verify the formal security guarantees of proposed secure inter-domain routing protocols; such as Secure BGP (S-BGP). In this paper; we develop a soundprogram logic for SANDLog—a declarative specification language for secure routingprotocols—for verifying properties of these protocols. We prove invariant properties ofSANDLog programs that run in an adversarial environment. As a step towards automatedverification; we implement a verification condition generator (VCGen) to automatically extractproof obligations. VCGen is integrated into a compiler for SANDLog that can generateexecutable protocol implementations; and thus; both verification and empirical evaluation ofsecure routing protocols can be carried out in this unified framework.

Getting more for less in optimized mapreduce workflows,Zhuoyao Zhang; Ludmila Cherkasova; Boon Thau Loo,Many companies are piloting the use of Hadoop for advanced data analytics over largedatasets. Typically; such MapReduce programs represent workflows of MapReduce jobs.Currently; a user must specify the number of reduce tasks for each MapReduce job. Thechoice of the right number of reduce tasks is non-trivial and depends on the cluster size;input dataset of the job; and the amount of resources available for processing this job. In theworkflow of MapReduce jobs; the output of one job becomes the input of the next job; andtherefore the number of reduce tasks in the previous job may impact the performance andprocessing efficiency of the next job.

Dispersing asymmetric DDOS attacks with splitstack,Ang Chen; Akshay Sriraman; Tavish Vaidya; Yuankai Zhang; Andreas Haeberlen; Boon Thau Loo; Linh Thi Xuan Phan; Micah Sherr; Clay Shields; Wenchao Zhou,Abstract This paper presents SplitStack; an architecture targeted at mitigating asymmetricDDoS attacks. These attacks are particularly challenging; since attackers can use a limitedamount of resources to trigger exhaustion of a particular type of system resource on theserver side. SplitStack resolves this by splitting the monolithic stack into many separablecomponents called minimum splittable units (MSUs). If part of the application stack isexperiencing a DDoS attack; SplitStack massively replicates just the affected MSUs;potentially across many machines. This allows scaling of the impacted resource separatelyfrom the rest of the application stack; so that resources can be precisely added whereneeded to combat the attack. We validate SplitStack via a preliminary case study; and showthat it outperforms naive replication in defending against asymmetric attacks.,Proceedings of the 15th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks,2016,6
Differential provenance: Better network diagnostics with reference events,Ang Chen; Yang Wu; Andreas Haeberlen; Wenchao Zhou; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract In this paper; we propose a new approach to diagnosing problems in complexnetworks. Our approach is based on the insight that many of the trickiest problems areanomalies--they affect only a small fraction of the traffic (eg; perhaps a certain subnet); orthey only manifest infrequently. Thus; it is quite common for the network operator to have"examples" of both working and non-working traffic readily available--perhaps a packet thatwas misrouted; and a similar packet that was routed correctly. In this case; the cause of theproblem is likely to be wherever the two packets were treated differently by the network. Wesketch the design of a network debugger that can leverage this information using a novelconcept that we call differential provenance. Like classical provenance; differentialprovenance tracks the causal connections between network and configuration states and …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks,2015,6

Quantitative Network Monitoring with NetQRE,Yifei Yuan; Dong Lin; Ankit Mishra; Sajal Marwaha; Rajeev Alur; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract In network management today; dynamic updates are required for traffic engineeringand for timely response to security threats. Decisions for such updates are based onmonitoring network traffic to compute numerical quantities based on a variety of network andapplication-level performance metrics. Today's state-of-the-art tools lack programmingabstractions that capture application or session-layer semantics; and thus require networkoperators to specify and reason about complex state machines and interactions acrosslayers. To address this limitation; we present the design and implementation of NetQRE; ahigh-level declarative toolkit that aims to simplify the specification and implementation ofsuch quantitative network policies.

Private and verifiable interdomain routing decisions,Mingchen Zhao; Wenchao Zhou; Alexander JT Gurney; Andreas Haeberlen; Micah Sherr; Boon Thau Loo,Existing secure interdomain routing protocols can verify validity properties about individualroutes; such as whether they correspond to a real network path. It is often useful to verifymore complex properties relating to the route decision procedure-for example; whether thechosen route was the best one available; or whether it was consistent with the network'speering agreements. However; this is difficult to do without knowing a network's routingpolicy and full routing state; which are not normally disclosed. In this paper; we show how anetwork can allow its peers to verify a number of nontrivial properties of its interdomainrouting decisions without revealing any additional information. If all the properties hold; thepeers learn nothing beyond what the interdomain routing protocol already reveals; if aproperty does not hold; at least one peer can detect this and prove the violation.

On the feasibility of automation for bandwidth allocation problems in data centers,Yifei Yuan; Anduo Wang; Rajeev Alur; Boon Thau Loo,Mapping virtual networks to physical networks under bandwidth constraints is a keycomputational problem for the management of data centers. Recently proposed heuristicstrategies for this problem work efficiently; but are not guaranteed to always find anallocation even when one exists. Given that the bandwidth allocation problem is NP-complete; and the state-of-the-art SAT solvers have recently been successfully applied to NP-hard problems in planning and formal verification; the goal of this paper is to study whetherthese SAT solvers can be used to solve the bandwidth allocation problem exactly withacceptable overhead. We investigate alternative ways of encoding the allocation problem;and develop techniques for abstraction and refinement of network graphs for scalability.

Reduction-based security analysis of internet routing protocols,Chen Chen; Limin Jia; Boon Thau Loo; Wenchao Zhou,In recent years; there have been strong interests in the networking community in designingnew Internet architectures that provide strong security guarantees. However; none of theseproposals back their security claims by formal analysis. In this paper; we use a reduction-based approach to prove the route authenticity property in secure routing protocols. Theseproperties require routes announced by honest nodes in the network not to be tamperedwith by the adversary. We focus on protocols that rely on layered signatures to providesecurity: each route announcement is associated with a list of signatures attesting theauthenticity of its subpaths. Our approach combines manual proofs with automated analysis.We define several reduction steps to reduce proving route authenticity properties to simpleconditions that can be automatically checked by the Proverif tool.

Recent advances in declarative networking,Boon Thau Loo; Harjot Gill; Changbin Liu; Yun Mao; William R Marczak; Micah Sherr; Anduo Wang; Wenchao Zhou,Abstract Declarative networking is a programming methodology that enables developers toconcisely specify network protocols and services; and directly compile these specificationsinto a dataflow framework for execution. This paper describes recent advances indeclarative networking; tracing its evolution from a rapid prototyping framework towards aplatform that serves as an important bridge connecting formal theories for reasoning aboutprotocol correctness and actual implementations. In particular; the paper focuses on the useof declarative networking for addressing four main challenges in the distributed systemsdevelopment cycle: the generation of safe routing implementations; debugging; security andprivacy; and optimizing distributed systems.,International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages,2012,5
A policy-based constraint-solving platform towards extensible wireless channel selection and routing,Changbin Liu; Xiaozhou Li; Shiv Muthukumar; Harjot Gill; Taher Saeed; Boon Thau Loo; Prithwish Basu,Abstract This paper presents PUMA; a novel declarative constraint-solving platform thatachieves efficient policy-based channel selection and routing for multi-radio wireless meshnetworks. PUMA is based on declarative networking; a database-inspired extensibleinfrastructure using query languages to specify behavior. In PUMA; users specify high-leveldeclarative policies that dictate their channel selection constraints and routing protocolbehavior. We demonstrate that channel selection can be expressed in a compact fashionand implemented efficiently. We have developed a PUMA prototype based on the RapidNetdeclarative networking engine with enhancements to handle multi-channel communicationand integration with an open-source constraint solver. We perform preliminary evaluation ofPUMA using the emerging ns-3 network simulator; and describe our ongoing research in …,Proceedings of the Workshop on Programmable Routers for Extensible Services of Tomorrow,2010,5
An operational semantics for network datalog,Vivek Nigam; Limin Jia; Anduo Wang; Boon Thau Loo; Andre Scedrov,Abstract Network Datalog (NDlog) is a recursive query language that extends Datalog byallowing programs to be distributed in a network. In our initial efforts to formally specifyNDlog's operational semantics; we have found several problems with the current evaluationalgorithm being used; including unsound results; unintended multiple derivations of thesame table entry; and divergence. In this paper; we make a first step towards correctingthese problems by formally specifying a new operational semantics for NDlog and provingits correctness for the fragment of non-recursive programs. We also argue that if terminationis guaranteed; then the results also extend to recursive programs. Finally; we identify anumber of potential implementation improvements to NDlog.,*,2010,5

Maintaining distributed recursive views incrementally,Vivek Nigam; Limin Jia; Boon Thau Loo; Andre Scedrov,Abstract Distributed logic programming languages; that allow both facts and programs to bedistributed among different nodes in a network; have been recently proposed and used todeclaratively program a wide-range of distributed systems; such as network protocols andmulti-agent systems. However; the distributed nature of the underlying systems posesserious challenges to developing efficient and correct algorithms for evaluating theseprograms. This paper proposes an efficient asynchronous algorithm to computeincrementally the changes to the states in response to insertions and deletions of base facts.Our algorithm is formally proven to be correct in the presence of message reordering in thesystem. To our knowledge; this is the first formal proof of correctness for such an algorithm.,*,2011,4
AS-CRED: Reputation service for trustworthy inter-domain routing,Jian Chang; Krishna K Venkatasubramanian; Andrew G West; Sampath Kannan; Insup Lee; Boon T Loo; Oleg Sokolsky,Abstract: The current design of BGP implicitly assumes the existence of trust between ASeswith respect to exchanging valid BGP updates. This assumption of complete trust isproblematic given the frequent announcement of invalid-inaccurate or unnecessary-updates. This paper presents AS-CRED; a reputation service for ASes which quantifies thelevel of trust one can have with respect to its announcing valid updates. To compute thereputation; AS-CRED analyzes the past updates announced by each observable AS in theInternet; over a time-window; based on well-defined properties. It then classifies the resultingobservations into multiple types of feedback. The feedback values are input into amathematical function for computing AS reputation. The reputation is then used to track theinstances of invalid updates announced in the Internet and trigger alerts. The …,*,2010,4
A theorem proving approach towards declarative networking,Anduo Wang; Boon Thau Loo; Changbin Liu; Oleg Sokolsky; Prithwish Basu,Abstract We present the DRIVER system for designing; analyzing and implementing networkprotocols. DRIVER leverages declarative networking; a recent innovation that enablesnetwork protocols to be concisely specified and implemented using declarative languages.DRIVER takes as input declarative networking specifications written in the Network Datalog(NDlog) query language; and maps that automatically into logical specifications that can bedirectly used in existing theorem provers to validate protocol correctness. As an alternativeapproach; network designer can supply a component-based model of their routing design;automatically generate PVS specifications for verification and subsequent compilation intoveriffied declarative network implementations. We demonstrate the use of DRIVER forsynthesizing and verifying a variety of well-known network routing protocols.,*,2009,4

The data-centric approach both improves flexibility overexisting solutions; and is extensible to meet the demands of future mobile applications andservices. We demonstrate the flexibility of distributed queries used in declarative networksby specifying and implementing mobile services; eg; overlay-based solutions for hostmobility; customizable routing; service discovery and composition; and location-basedservices.

A quantitative evaluation of traffic-aware routing strategies,Eric J Anderson; Thomas E Anderson; Steven D Gribble; Anna R Karlin; Stefan Savage,Sunnnary In this research; we address a simple question: how much benefit can beachieved by traffic-aware routing of lntemet traffic? Efficient routing on packet-switchednetworks has attracted considerable~ h attention from the early days of the Interoet to thepresent day; yet current routing practice still relies on weighted shortest paths to route traffic;using algorithms that do not take the distribution of traffic demand into account. Compared totrafficaware routing; static muting potentially reduces Internet performance and/or increasesoperational and infrastructure costs; as networks must overprovision to avoid congestion.Efficiently mapping traffic demands onto a fixed and limited network topology-a practicecalled" traffic engineering"-poses several challenges: acquiring a traffic demand matrix;providing a mechanism (such as MPLS or adjustable edge weights) for mapping traffic to …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2002,4
Automated Bug Removal for Software-Defined Networks.,Yang Wu; Ang Chen; Andreas Haeberlen; Wenchao Zhou; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract When debugging an SDN application; diagnosing the problem is merely the firststep: the operator must still find a fix that solves the problem; without causing new problemselsewhere. However; most existing debuggers focus exclusively on diagnosis and offer thenetwork operator little or no help with finding an effective fix. Finding a suitable fix is difficultbecause the number of candidates can be enormous. In this paper; we propose a steptowards automated repair for SDN applications. Our approach consists of two elements. Thefirst is a data structure that we call meta provenance; which can be used to efficiently findgood candidate repairs. Meta provenance is inspired by the provenance concept from thedatabase community; however; whereas standard provenance can only reason aboutchanges to data; meta provenance can also reason about changes to programs.

Proof-based Verification of Software Defined Networks.,Chen Chen; Limin Jia; Wenchao Zhou; Boon Thau Loo,Software defined network (SDN) eases the task of programming and managing computernetworks. The conceptually centralized nature of the control plane provides a holistic view ofthe network; thereby making it feasible to verify SDN's functionalities. Verification of SDN isgaining attention in the last few years [1; 5]. There are two main challenges of SDN:(1) SDNsare often programmed in general-purpose programming languages (eg Java; Python);which makes it tedious and error-prone to apply formal methods over controllerapplications;(2) the sheer scale of modern networks makes state explosion problem aninsurmountable challenge for model checking. Model checking techniques combined withlimiting the expressiveness of the programming language have demonstrated as an effectiveapproach to verifying basic properties.

Brief announcement: A calculus of policy-based routing systems,Anduo Wang; Carolyn Talcott; Alexander Gurney; Boon Thau Loo; Andre Scedrov,Abstract The BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is the single inter-domain routing protocol thatenables network operators within each autonomous system (AS) to influence routingdecisions by independently setting local policies on route filtering and selection. Thisindependence leads to fragile networking and makes analysis of policy configurations verycomplex. To aid the systematic and efficient study of the policy configuration space; thispaper presents a reduction calculus on policy-based routing systems. In the calculus; weprovide two types of reduction rules that transform policy configurations by mergingduplicate and complementary router configurations to simplify analysis. We show that thereductions are sound; dual of each other and are locally complete. The reductions are alsocomputationally attractive; requiring only local configuration information and modification …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM symposium on Principles of distributed computing,2012,3

Tracking Adversarial Behavior in Distributed Systems with Secure Network Provenance,Wenchao Zhou; Andreas Haeberlen; Boon Thau Loo; Micah Sherr,Abstract This paper presents secure network provenance (SNP); a novel technique fortracking down compromised nodes in a distributed system and assessing the damage thatthey may have caused to other nodes. SNP enables operators to ask the system why it is ina certain state–for example; why a suspicious routing table entry is present on a certainrouter; or where a given cache entry originated. SNP is robust to manipulation; its tamper-evident properties ensure that operators can detect when compromised nodes lie or falselyimplicate correct nodes. Thus; compromised nodes can at worst refuse to participate; makingtheir presence evident to operators. We describe an algorithm for answering SNP queries;as well as a proof-of-concept implementation.,*,2010,3

Measurement and Analysis of Ultrapeer-based P2P Search Networks,Boon Thau Loo; Joseph Hellerstein; Ryan Huebsch; Scott Shenker; Ion Stoica,Abstract Unstructured Networks have been used extensively in P2P search systems todayprimarily for file sharing. These networks exploit heterogeneity in the network and offloadmost of the query processing load to more powerful nodes. As an alternative to unstructurednetworks; there have been recent proposals for using inverted indexes on structurednetworks for searching. These structured networks; otherwise known as distributed hashtables (DHTs); guarantee recall and are well suited for locating rare items. However; theymay incur significant bandwidth for keyword-based searches. This paper performs ameasurement study of Gnutella; a popular unstructured network used for file sharing. Wefocus primarily on studying Gnutella's search performance and recall; especially in light ofrecent ultrapeer enhancements.

Content-based multicast: Comparison of overlay network implementation,Ryan Huebsch; Boon Thau Loo,ABSTRACT This paper is an attempt to quantify the performance differences for content-based multicast implemented in two different layers of an overlay network. We focus onoverlay networks designed for peer-to-peer distributed hash table (DHT) applications wherecontent-based multicast is most applicable. In particular we study Content AddressableNetworks (CAN) and Chord as the routing algorithms. It is our conjecture that similar resultswould be obtained through other protocols such as Pastry and Tapestry. 1. INTRODUCTIONDistributed hash tables (DHTs) can be used to distribute and retrieve data among manynodes in a network. A basic DHT provides only two simple primitives; get (key) and put (key;value). Given a particular key a DHT is able to retrieve the associated value from the propernode. For some applications this is sufficient; ie when the application knows the exact key …,Project Report for Univ. of California at Berkeley Class CS268; available from http://www. cs. berkeley. edu/~ boonloo/classes/cs268/cs268. pdf,2003,3
Distributed provenance compression,Chen Chen; Harshal Tushar Lehri; Lay Kuan Loh; Anupam Alur; Limin Jia; Boon Thau Loo; Wenchao Zhou,Abstract Network provenance; which records the execution history of network events asmeta-data; is becoming increasingly important for network accountability and failurediagnosis. For example; network provenance may be used to trace the path that a messagetraversed in a network; or to reveal how a particular routing entry was derived and theparties involved in its derivation. A challenge when storing the provenance of a live networkis that the large number of the arriving messages may incur substantial storage overhead. Inthis paper; we explore techniques to dynamically compress distributed provenance stored atscale. Logically; the compression is achieved by grouping equivalent provenance trees andmaintaining only one concrete copy for each equivalence class. To efficiently identifyequivalent provenance; we (1) introduce distributed event-based linear programs (DELP) …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data,2017,2

MTor does not depend on an external serviceto broker the group communication; and avoids central points of failure and trust. MTor'ssubstantial bandwidth savings and graceful scalability enable new classes of anonymousapplications that are currently too bandwidth-intensive to be viable through traditionalunicast Tor communication-eg; group file transfer; collaborative editing; streaming video;and real-time audio conferencing.,Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,2016,2

Such errorscan lead to disruption of services; which may have grave consequences. Verification ofnetworks is key to eliminating errors and building robust networks. In this paper; we proposean approach to verify networks using declarative networking; where networks are specifiedin NDlog; a declarative language. We focus on analyzing safety properties. We develop atechnique to statically analyze NDlog programs: first; we build a dependency graph of thepredicates of NDlog programs; then; we build a summary data structure called a derivationpool to represent all possible derivations and their associated constraints for predicates inthe program; finally; properties specified in first-order logic are checked on the data structurewith the help of the SMT solver Z3.

A case study of tunnel instability in weakness zone containing swelling clay,Dawei Mao; Bjørn Nilsen; Shurong Feng; Haibin Zhao; Ming Lu,ABSTRACT Tunnelling in weakness zones containing swelling clay represent one of themost difficult conditions in hard rock tunnelling; which could result in large excavationproblems and in extreme cases even tunnel collapses. To enrich the engineeringexperience for such ground; the case of rock fall at the twin-tube Hanekleiv road tunnel isstudied in the paper. The rock fall occurred ten years after tunnel completion in thesouthbound tube; approximately 1.1 km from the northern entrance; in a fault zonecontaining swelling clay. Laboratory testing results indicate gouge material in the collapsezone was not very active on swelling and the content of swelling clay was low.

This paper proposes a synthesis approach for managing software-definednetworks. We formulate the construction of network control logic as a reactive synthesisproblem which is solvable with existing synthesis tools. The key idea is to synthesize astrategy that manages control logic in response to network changes while satisfying somenetwork-wide specification. Finally; we investigate network abstractions for scalability. Forlarge networks; instead of synthesizing control logic directly; we use its abstraction-a smallernetwork that simulates its behavior-for synthesis; and then implement the synthesizedcontrol on the original network while preserving the correctness.

Formalizing Metarouting in PVS,Anduo Wang; Boon Thau Loo,ABSTRACT In this paper; we extend PVS specification logic with abstract metarouting theoryto aid the development of complex routing protocol models based on metarouting; which isan algebraic framework for specifying routing protocols in a restricted fashion such that theprotocol is guaranteed to converge. Our formalization of metarouting theory utilizes thetheory-interpretation extensions of PVS. Our use of a general purpose theorem proverprovides a structured framework for a network designer to incrementally develop and refinetheir algebraic routing protocol model by starting from various base routing algebras; andcomposing them into complex algebra models with composition operators. In addition; onecan leverage PVS's type checking capability and built-in proof engine to ensure routingmodel consistency.,Automated Formal Methods (AFM),2009,2
Provenance-aware declarative secure networks,Wenchao Zhou; Eric Cronin; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract In recent years; network accountability and forensic analysis have becomeincreasingly important; as a means of performing network diagnostics; identifying maliciousnodes; enforcing trust management policies; and imposing diverse billing over the Internet.This has lead to a series of work to provide better network support for accountability; andefficient mechanisms to trace packets and information flows through the Internet. In thispaper; we make the following contributions. First; we show that network accountability andforensic analysis can be posed generally as data provenance computations and queriesover distributed streams. In particular; one can utilize provenance-aware declarativenetworks with appropriate security extensions to provide a flexible declarative framework forspecifying; analyzing and auditing networks.

Querying network graphs with recursive queries,Boon Thau Loo,Abstract This paper describes a distributed infrastructure for querying network graphs withrecursive queries. We argue that recursive queries have great practical value as adeclarative interface to multi-hop networks. To query these networks in a distributed fashion;we describe the processing of recursive queries using PIER; a P2P relational queryprocessor that utilizes distributed hash tables (DHTs). We focus on studying a set ofcommonly used recursive queries based on the transitive closure query. We demonstratethat different query processing techniques will lead to tradeoffs in latency; work sharing andcommunication overheads. Our experimental results also show that selecting the bestexecution strategy based on the query workload and graph topology can lead to significantreduction in communication overhead and latency.,Departmental Papers (CIS),2004,2
One primitive to diagnose them all: Architectural support for Internet diagnostics,Ang Chen; Andreas Haeberlen; Wenchao Zhou; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract Today; network operators are increasingly playing the role of part-time detectives:they must routinely diagnose intricate problems and malfunctions; eg; routing orperformance issues; and they must often perform forensic investigations of past misbehavior;eg; intrusions or cybercrimes. However; the current Internet architecture offers little directsupport for them. A variety of solutions have been proposed; but each solution tends toaddress only one specific problem. Moreover; each solution proposes a different fix that isincompatible with the others; which complicates deployment. In this paper; we make theobservation that most of the existing solutions share a common" functional core"; whichsuggests that it may be possible to add a single primitive to the Internet architecture that cansupport a wide variety of diagnostic and forensic tasks. We then present one specific …,Proceedings of the Twelfth European Conference on Computer Systems,2017,1
FixRoute: A Unified Logic and Numerical Tool for Provably Safe Internet Traffic Engineering,Behnaz Arzani; Alexander Gurney; Bo Li; Xianglong Han; Roch Guerin; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract: The performance of networks that use the Internet Protocol is sensitive to preciseconfiguration of many low-level parameters on each network device. These settings governthe action of dynamic routing protocols; which direct the flow of traffic; in order to ensure thatthese dynamic protocols all converge to produce some'optimal'flow; each parameter must beset correctly. Multiple conflicting optimization objectives; nondeterminism; and the need toreason about different failure scenarios make the task particularly complicated. We present afast and flexible approach for the analysis of a number of such management tasks presentedin the context of BGP routing. The idea is to combine {\em logical} satisfiability criteria withtraditional {\em numerical} optimization; to reach a desired traffic flow outcome subject togiven constraints on the routing process.

Automating platform selection for mapreduce processing in the cloud,Zhuoyao Zhang; Ludmila Cherkasova; Boon Thau Loo,Cloud computing enables a user to quickly provision any desirable size Hadoop cluster andthen pay for the time these resources were used. With the same budget; a user can rent alarger amount of resources and process its scale-out application in a shorter time; or rent asmaller size cluster but pay a for longer processing time. Moreover; there is a variety ofdifferent types of VM instances in the Cloud (eg; small; medium; or large EC2 instances).The capacity differences of the offered VMs are reflected in VM's pricing. Therefore; again forthe same price a user can get a variety of" similar capacity" Hadoop clusters based ondifferent VM instance types. We observe that performance of MapReduce applications mayvary significantly on different platforms.

A formal framework for secure routing protocols,Chen Chen; Limin Jia; Hao Xu; Cheng Luo; Wenchao Zhou; Boon Thau Loo,The Internet infrastructure; as it stands today; is highly vulnerable to attacks. The Internetruns the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP); where routers are grouped into AutonomousSystems (ASes) administered by Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Since routeadvertisements are not authenticated; ASes can; for example; advertise nonexistent routesor claim to own arbitrary destination addresses. In response to these vulnerabilities; therehas been a considerable amount of work to design new architectures and protocols for amore secure Internet; including direct secure extensions (Secure-BGP; ps-BGP and so-BGP)and “clean-slate” Internet architectural redesigns such as SCION and ICING.

Reduction-based analysis of BGP systems with BGPVerif,Anduo Wang; Alexander JT Gurney; Xianglong Han; Jinyan Cao; Carolyn Talcot; Boon Thau Loo; Andre Scedrov,Abstract Today's inter-domain routing protocol; the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP); isincreasingly complicated and fragile due to policy misconfiguration by individualautonomous systems (ASes). Existing configuration analysis techniques are either manualand tedious; or do not scale beyond a small number of nodes due to the state explosionproblem. To aid the diagnosis of misconfigurations in real-world large BGP systems; thispaper presents BGPVerif; a reduction based analysis toolkit. The key idea is to reduce BGPsystem size prior to analysis while preserving crucial correctness properties. BGPVerifconsists of two components; NetReducer that simplifies BGP configurations; andNetAnalyzer that automatically detects routing oscillation. BGPVerif accepts a wide range ofBGP configuration inputs ranging from real-world traces (Rocketfuel network topologies) …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2012,1

Cost-based Dynamic Job Rescheduling: A Case Study of the Intel Distributed Computing Platform,Linh TX Phan; Zhuoyao Zhang; Saumya Jain; Godfrey Tan; Boon Thau Loo; Insup Lee,Abstract We perform a trace-driven analysis of the Intel Distributed Computing Platform(IDCP); an Internet-scale data center based distributed computing platform developed byIntel Corporation for massively parallel chip simulations within the company. IDCP has beenoperational for many years; and currently is deployed “live” on tens of thousands ofmachines that are globally distributed at various data centers. Our analysis is performed onjob execution traces obtained over a one year period collected from tens of thousands ofIDCP machines from 20 different pools. Our analysis demonstrates that job completion timecan be severely impacted due to job suspension when higher priority jobs preempt lowerpriority jobs. We then develop cost-based dynamic job rescheduling strategies thatadaptively restart suspended jobs; which better utilize system resources and improve …,*,2010,1

Verifiable Policy-based Routing with DRIVER,Anduo Wang; Changbin Liu; Boon Thau Loo; Oleg Sokolsky; Prithwash Basu,Abstract The Internet today runs on a complex routing protocol called the Border GatewayProtocol (BGP). BGP is a policy-based protocol; in which autonomous Internet ServiceProviders (ISPs) impose their local policies on the propagation of routing information. Overthe past few years; there has been a growing consensus on the complexity and fragility ofBGP routing. To address these challenges; we present the DRIVER system for designing;analyzing and implementing policy-based routing protocols. Our system utilizes adeclarative network verifier (DNV) which leverages declarative networking's connection tologic programming by automatically compiling high-level declarativen networking programinto formal specifications; which can be directly used in a theorem prover for verification.

Querying and Routing in Next-Generation Networks,Boon Thau Loo,Abstract I propose the use of recursive queries [24] as an interface for querying distributednetwork graph structures. Recursive queries allow a query result to be defined in terms ofitself. This is particularly useful for querying network graphs that exhibit recursive structures.To query these distributed graphs over the Internet; I propose using distributed queryprocessing techniques to process recursive queries. I further demonstrate the relationshipbetween in-network execution of recursive queries and traditional routing protocols. Basedon this relationship; I propose investigating the use of recursive queries for end-hosts tocustomize routing protocols. I plan to implement my proposals in the context of the PIER [9]system; and study different techniques to achieve good performance in the system.,*,2004,1

Architectural implications on the performance and cost of graph analytics systems,Qizhen Zhang; Hongzhi Chen; Da Yan; James Cheng; Boon Thau Loo; Purushotham Bangalore,Abstract Graph analytics systems have gained significant popularity due to the prevalence ofgraph data. Many of these systems are designed to run in a shared-nothing architecturewhereby a cluster of machines can process a large graph in parallel. In more recentproposals; others have argued that a single-machine system can achieve betterperformance and/or is more cost-effective. There is however no clear consensus whichapproach is better. In this paper; we classify existing graph analytics systems into fourcategories based on the architectural differences; ie; processing infrastructure (centralizedvs distributed); and memory consumption (in-memory vs out-of-core). We select eight open-source systems to cover all categories; and perform a comparative measurement study tocompare their performance and cost characteristics across a spectrum of input data …,Proceedings of the 2017 Symposium on Cloud Computing,2017,*
A Demonstration of the DeDoS Platform for Defusing Asymmetric DDoS Attacks in Data Centers,Henri Maxime Demoulin; Tavish Vaidya; Isaac Pedisich; Nik Sultana; Bowen Wang; Jingyu Qian; Yuankai Zhang; Ang Chen; Andreas Haeberlen; Boon Thau Loo; Linh Thi Xuan Phan; Micah Sherr; Clay Shields; Wenchao Zhou,Abstract We propose a demonstration of DeDoS; a platform for mitigating asymmetric DDoSattacks. These attacks are particularly challenging since attackers using limited resourcescan exhaust the resources of even well-provisioned servers. DeDoS resolves this by splittingmonolithic software stacks into separable components called minimum splittable units(MSUs). If part of the application stack is experiencing a DDoS attack; DeDoS can massivelyreplicate only the affected MSUs; potentially across many machines. This allows scaling ofthe impacted resource separately from the rest of the application stack so that resources canbe precisely added where needed to combat the attack. Our demonstration will show thatDeDoS incurs reasonable overheads in normal operations and that it significantlyoutperforms naïve replication when defending against a range of asymmetric attacks.,Proceedings of the SIGCOMM Posters and Demos,2017,*
Closing the Network Diagnostics Gap with Vigil,Behnaz Arzani; Selim Ciraci; Luiz Chamon; Yibo Zhu; Hongqiang Liu; Jitu Padhye; Geoff Outhred; Boon Thau Loo,Vigil started with an ambitious goal: For every TCP retransmission in our data centers; wewanted to pinpoint the network link that caused the packet drop that triggered theretransmission with negligible diagnostic overhead or changes to the networkinginfrastructure. This goal may sound like an overkill—after all; TCP is supposed to be able todeal with a few packet losses. Packet losses might occur due to simple congestion instead ofnetwork equipment failures. Even network failures might be transient. Above all; there is adanger of drowning in a sea of data without generating any actionable intelligence.,Proceedings of the SIGCOMM Posters and Demos,2017,*

Provably Correct Distributed Provenance Compression,Chen Chen; Harshal Tushar Lehri; Lay Kuan Loh; Anupam Alur; Limin Jia; Boon Loo; Wenchao Zhou,ABSTRACT Network provenance; which records the execution history of network events asmeta-data; is becoming increasingly important for network accountability and failurediagnosis. For example; network provenance may be used to trace the path that a messagetraversed in a network; or to reveal how a particular routing entry was derived and theparties involved in its derivation. A challenge when storing the provenance of a live networkis that the large number of the arriving messages may incur substantial storage overhead. Inthis paper; we explore techniques to dynamically compress distributed provenance stored atscale. Logically; the compression is achieved by grouping equivalent provenance trees andmaintaining only one concrete copy for each equivalence class.

A reduction-based approach towards scaling up formal analysis of internet configurations,Anduo Wang; Alexander JT Gurney; Xianglong Han; Jinyan Cao; Boon Thau Loo; Carolyn Talcott; Andre Scedrov,The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the single inter-domain routing protocol that enablesnetwork operators within each autonomous system (AS) to influence routing decisions byindependently setting local policies on route filtering and selection. This independenceleads to fragile networking and makes analysis of policy configurations very complex. To aidthe systematic and efficient study of the policy configuration space; this paper presentsnetwork reduction; a scalability technique for policy-based routing systems. In networkreduction; we provide two types of reduction rules that transform policy configurations bymerging duplicate and complementary router configurations to simplify analysis.

As aconsequence; recent architectures; such as SCION [8] and ICING [5]; provide radically newarchitectures that claim to provide stronger security guarantees.

Implementing network protocols as distributed logic programs,Boon Thau Loo,Abstract Declarative networking [2; 4; 3; 1] is an application of database query-language andprocessing techniques to the domain of networking. Declarative networking is based on theobservation that network protocols deal at their core with computing and maintainingdistributed state (eg; routes; sessions; performance statistics) according to basic informationlocally available at each node (eg; neighbor tables; link measurements; local clocks) whileenforcing constraints such as local routing policies. Recursive query languages studied inthe deductive database literature [6] are a natural fit for expressing the relationship betweenbase data; derived data; and the associated constraints.

The Case for a Hybrid P2P Search Infrastructure,Ion Stoica; Joseph M Hellerstein; Boon Thau Loo; Ryan Huebsch,Abstract Popular P2P file-sharing systems like Gnutella and Kazaa use unstructured networkdesigns. These networks typically adopt flooding-based search techniques to locate files.While flooding-based techniques are effective for locating highly replicated items; they arepoorly suited for locating rare items. As an alternative; a wide variety of structured P2Pnetworks such as Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) have been recently proposed. Structurednetworks can efficiently locate rare items; but they incur significantly higher overheads thanunstructured P2P networks for popular files. Through extensive measurements of theGnutella network from multiple vantage points; we argue for a hybrid search solution; wherestructured search techniques are used to index and locate rare items; and floodingtechniques are used for locating highly replicated content.

The interface presented by such searchengines is hence very limited.

A Program Logic for Verifying Secure Routing Protocols (Technical Report),Chen Chen; Limin Jia; Hao Xu; Cheng Luo; Wenchao Zhou; Boon Thau Loo,Abstract. The Internet; as it stands today; is highly vulnerable to attacks. However; little hasbeen done to understand and verify the formal security guarantees of proposed secure inter-domain routing protocols; such as Secure BGP (S-BGP). In this paper; we develop a soundprogram logic for SANDLog—a declarative specification language for secure routingprotocols—for verifying properties of these protocols. We prove invariant properties ofSANDLog programs that run in an adversarial environment. As a step towards automatedverification; we implement a verification condition generator (VCGen) to automatically extractproof obligations. VCGen is integrated into a compiler for SANDLog that can generateexecutable protocol implementations; and thus; both verification and empirical evaluation ofsecure routing protocols can be carried out in this unified framework. To validate our …,*,*,*

SP4: Scalable Programmable Packet Processing Platform,Harjot Gill Dong Lin Lohit Sarna; Robert Mead; Kenton CT Lee; Boon Thau Loo,As network applications become increasingly complex and heterogeneous; there is anincreasing need for extensibility at the data plane; in order to carry out sophisticatedfunctionalities such as traffic flow management; filtering out unwanted traffic; and content-based networking. Emerging softwaredefined networking platforms such as OpenFlow [7]provides extensibility by enabling packet processing at the software level. However;enabling such functionality in software requires significantly high bandwidth and computecapacity from servers. One promising direction proposed recently is the use of multicoremachines to enable high-performance programmable software routers [3; 13]; that can scaleas the number of cores/machines increases. However; existing solutions either lackprogramming tools to rapidly customize different data plane functionalities; require explicit …,*,*,*

Private and Verifiable Interdomain Routing Decisions Proofs of Correctness,Mingchen Zhao; Wenchao Zhou; Alexander JT Gurney; Andreas Haeberlen; Micah Sherr; Boon Thau Loo,This technical report contains proofs of correctness for the VPref protocol described in “Privateand Verifi- able Interdomain Routing Decisions” [2]. Below; we use cursive notation to indicatefaulty ASes — that is; a producer P that is faulty is written as P; a consumer C that is faulty is writtenas C; and an elector E that is faulty is written as E … The detection proofs make use of the followingdefinitions and lemmas … Definition 1. We say that h is well-formed iff … Note that a correctelector will always construct a well-formed h in step four of the Commitment Phase … Definition2. We say that a message is observable iff it directly or indirectly affects at least one correctnode … Our definition of observable is similar to the notion defined by Haeberlen et al. in PeerReview[1]; and is necessary since we cannot expect faulty nodes to reveal telltale messages exchangedonly between faulty nodes. Our goal is to detect malicious behavior that affects (either …,*,*,*
Query Optimization as a Datalog Program,Mengmeng Liu; Zachary G Ives; Boon Thau Loo,In recent years; there has been a resurgence of interest in using Datalog and declarativeprogramming techniques to capture a wide variety of problems: particularly those withnatural recursion in their computation; and those for which it might be desirable to allow forcustom modification by a sophisticated end user. One such problem is that of specifying thetransformation rules and search process of a query optimizer [1]. In certain emergingdomains it may be desirable to be able to customize query transformation rules; and Datalogis much more universally understood than the languages used in transformationaloptimizers like those generated by Volcano [2]. As part of the ASPEN project we envisionfuture query processing architectures targeted at widely distributed (cloud or cluster)deployments; where statistics and state monitoring information are acquired from across …,*,*,*
Towards a Secure and Verifiable Future Internet (Full Presentation),Limin Jia; Chen Chen; Sangeetha A Jyothi; Wenchao Zhou; Suyog Mapara; Boon Thau Loo,In recent years; there have been strong interests in the networking community in designingnew Internet architectures. One of the driving forces behind these “clean-slate” designs isthe need to address pressing security concerns of the Internet. As a consequence; recentarchitectures; such as SCION [8] and ICING [5]; provide radically new architectures thatclaim to provide stronger security guarantees. One of the limitations of current proposals isthat security claims of these new designs lack formal security proofs–these protocols areevaluated primarily via experimental evaluations and argued via informal reasoning. In thispaper; we outline our research agenda on programming language support for implementingsecure Internet protocols; and verifying the security properties of these implementations.Central to our work is the use of Secure Network Datalog (SeNDLog)[9]; a declarative …,*,*,*

FSR: A Formal Analysis and Development Toolkit for Safe Inter-domain Routing,Anduo Wang; Limin Jia; Wenchao Zhou; Shivkumar C Muthukumar; Vivek Nigam; Boon Thau Loo; Jennifer Rexford; Andre Scedrov; Carolyn L Talcott,Abstract The design and evaluation of inter-domain routing protocols is complicatedbecause even the most basic goal—guaranteed convergence—depends on the localrouting policies. Our Formally Safe Routing (FSR) toolkit assists in each stage of the designprocess:(i) demonstrating that specific configurations (“gadgets”) diverge;(ii) verifying thatproposed constraints on routing policy ensure convergence; and (iii) generating a provably-correct protocol implementation to use in experiments. FSR uses routing algebra to analyzeconvergence and declarative networking to generate implementations from algebraicspecifications. Our implementation of FSR uses the RapidNet declarative networkingsystem; Yices SMT solver; and Maude logic-based model checker. We run FSR to show thatwell-known BGP gadgets diverge and recently-proposed policy guidelines ensure …,*,*,*
Trace-driven Analysis of an Internet-scale Cloud Computing Platform,Harrison Duong; Boon Thau Loo; Godfrey Tan,In recent years; cloud computing have become a popular computing paradigm; wherecomputation is moved away from personal computers or an individual application server to a“cloud” of computers in the network. Users of the cloud only need to be concerned with thecomputing service being asked for; as the underlying details of how it is achieved arehidden. This method of distributed computing is done through pooling all computerresources together and being managed by software rather than a human. The popularapplication of cloud computing have primarily been for the deployment of web applcationsby end users; eg; Amazon's elastic compute cloud [1]; and the Google/IBM's academiccluster computing initiative [2]. In this paper; we study an important use of cloud computing:that of performing compute-intensive tasks within an Internet-scale enterprise network …,*,*,*
