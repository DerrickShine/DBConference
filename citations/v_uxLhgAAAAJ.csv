A case for end system multicast (keynote address),Yang-hua Chu; Sanjay G Rao; Hui Zhang,Abstract The conventional wisdom has been that IP is the natural protocol layer forimplementing multicast related functionality. However; ten years after its initial proposal; IPMulticast is still plagued with concerns pertaining to scalability; network management;deployment and support for higher layer functionality such as error; flow and congestioncontrol. In this paper; we explore an alternative architecture for small and sparse groups;where end systems implement all multicast related functionality including membershipmanagement and packet replication. We call such a scheme End System Multicast. Thisshifting of multicast support from routers to end systems has the potential to address mostproblems associated with IP Multicast.

Enabling conferencing applications on the internet using an overlay muilticast architecture,Yang Chu; Sanjay Rao; Srinivasan Seshan; Hui Zhang,Abstract In response to the serious scalability and deployment concerns with IP Multicast; weand other researchers have advocated an alternate architecture for supporting groupcommunication applications over the Internet where all multicast functionality is pushed tothe edge. We refer to such an architecture as End System Multicast. While End SystemMulticast has several potential advantages; a key concern is the performance penaltyassociated with such a design. While preliminary simulation results conducted in staticenvironments are promising; they have yet to consider the challenging performancerequirements of real world applications in a dynamic and heterogeneous Internetenvironment. In this paper; we explore how Internet environments and applicationrequirements can influence End System Multicast design. We explore these issues in the …,ACM SIGCOMM computer communication review,2001,760
Opportunities and challenges of peer-to-peer internet video broadcast,Jiangchuan Liu; Sanjay G Rao; Bo Li; Hui Zhang,There have been tremendous efforts and many technical innovations in supporting real-timevideo streaming in the past two decades; but cost-effective large-scale video broadcast hasremained an elusive goal. Internet protocol (IP) multicast represented an earlier attempt totackle this problem but failed largely due to concerns regarding scalability; deployment; andsupport for higher level functionality. Recently; peer-to-peer based broadcast has emergedas a promising technique; which has been shown to be cost effective and easy to deploy.This new paradigm brings a number of unique advantages such as scalability; resilience;and effectiveness in coping with dynamics and heterogeneity. While peer-to-peerapplications such as file download and voice-over-IP have gained tremendous popularity;video broadcast is still in its early stages; and its full potential remains to be seen.

Cloudward bound: planning for beneficial migration of enterprise applications to the cloud,Mohammad Hajjat; Xin Sun; Yu-Wei Eric Sung; David Maltz; Sanjay Rao; Kunwadee Sripanidkulchai; Mohit Tawarmalani,Abstract In this paper; we tackle challenges in migrating enterprise services into hybrid cloud-based deployments; where enterprise operations are partly hosted on-premise and partly inthe cloud. Such hybrid architectures enable enterprises to benefit from cloud-basedarchitectures; while honoring application performance requirements; and privacy restrictionson what services may be migrated to the cloud. We make several contributions. First; wehighlight the complexity inherent in enterprise applications today in terms of their multi-tierednature; large number of application components; and interdependencies. Second; we havedeveloped a model to explore the benefits of a hybrid migration approach. Our model takesinto account enterprise-specific constraints; cost savings; and increased transaction delaysand wide-area communication costs that may result from the migration.

In over a year; the system has beenproviding a cost-effective alternative for Internet broadcast; used by over 4000 users spreadacross multiple continents in home; academic and commercial environments. Technicalconferences and special interest groups are the early adopters. Our experience confirmsthat Overlay Multicast can be easily deployed and can provide reasonably good applicationperformance.

Dissecting video server selection strategies in the youtube cdn,Ruben Torres; Alessandro Finamore; Jin Ryong Kim; Marco Mellia; Maurizio M Munafo; Sanjay Rao,In this paper; we conduct a detailed study of the YouTube CDN with a view to understandingthe mechanisms and policies used to determine which data centers users download videofrom. Our analysis is conducted using week-long datasets simultaneously collected from theedge of five networks-two university campuses and three ISP networks-located in threedifferent countries. We employ state-of-the-art delay-based geolocation techniques to findthe geographical location of YouTube servers. A unique aspect of our work is that weperform our analysis on groups of related YouTube flows. This enables us to infer keyaspects of the system design that would be difficult to glean by considering individual flowsin isolation.

Mercury: a scalable publish-subscribe system for internet games,Ashwin R Bharambe; Sanjay Rao; Srinivasan Seshan,Abstract Today's network games suffer from scalability and performance limitations causedby centralized client-server architectures and/or broadcast communication. In this paper; weargue that the communication between components of a game can be modeled as a publish-subscribe system. We present the design of M ERCURY; a completely distributed publish-subscribe system; which supports a content-based publish-subscribe model ofcommunication and performs distributed matching using a novel content-based routingprotocol. We also present preliminary simulation results identifying key design decisionsaffecting the scalability and network efficiency of the system.,Proceedings of the 1st workshop on Network and system support for games,2002,166
Measurement-based optimization techniques for bandwidth-demanding peer-to-peer systems,TS Eugene Ng; Y-H Chu; Sanjay G Rao; Kunwadee Sripanidkulchai; Hui Zhang,Measurement-based optimization is one important strategy to improve the performance ofbandwidth-demanding peer-to-peer systems. However; to date; we have little quantitativeknowledge of how well basic lightweight measurement-based techniques such as RTTprobing; 10KB TCP probing; and bottleneck bandwidth probing may work in practice in thepeer-to-peer environment. By conducting trace-based analyses; we find that the basictechniques can help achieve 40 to 50% optimal performance. To deepen our understanding;we analyze some of the intrinsic properties of these techniques. Our analyses reveal theinherent difficulty of the peer selection problem due to the extreme heterogeneity in the peer-to-peer environment; and that the basic techniques are limited because their primarystrength lies in eliminating the low-performance peers rather than reliably identifying the …,INFOCOM 2003.

Considering Priority in Overlay Multicast Protocols Under Heterogeneous Environments.,Michael A Bishop; Sanjay G Rao; Kunwadee Sripanidkulchai,Abstract—Hosts participating in overlay multicast applications have a wide range ofheterogeneity in bandwidth and participation characteristics. In this paper; we highlight andshow the need to systematically consider prioritization as a key criterion in the design ofprotocols for overlay multicast. We identify trade-offs in the design of prioritization heuristicsin two important contexts. The first part of the paper considers prioritization strategies in thecontext of heterogeneity in node outgoing bandwidth and node stay time durations; and alack of correlation between the two dimensions. The second part of the paper considersbandwidth allocation and prioritization policies with multi-tree data delivery in environmentswith heterogeneity in outgoing bandwidth and a certain degree of altruistic behavior.

Configuration management at massive scale: system design and experience,William Enck; Thomas Moyer; Patrick McDaniel; Subhabrata Sen; Panagiotis Sebos; Sylke Spoerel; Albert Greenberg; Yu-Wei Eric Sung; Sanjay Rao; William Aiello,The development and maintenance of network device configurations is one of the centralchallenges faced by large network providers. Current network management systems fail tomeet this challenge primarily because of their inability to adapt to rapidly evolving customerand provider-network needs; and because of mismatches between the conceptual models ofthe tools and the services they must support. In this paper; we present the Prestoconfiguration management system that attempts to address these failings in acomprehensive and flexible way. Developed for and used during the last 5 years within alarge ISP network; Presto constructs device-native configurations based on the compositionof configlets representing different services or service options. Configlets are compiled byextracting and manipulating data from external systems as directed by the Presto …,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,2009,110
Towards systematic design of enterprise networks,Yu-Wei Eric Sung; Xin Sun; Sanjay G Rao; Geoffrey G Xie; David A Maltz,Abstract Enterprise networks are important; with size and complexity even surpassing carriernetworks. Yet; the design of enterprise networks remains ad hoc and poorly understood. Inthis paper; we show how a systematic design approach can handle two key areas ofenterprise design: virtual local area networks (VLANs) and reachability control. We focus onthese tasks given their complexity; prevalence; and time-consuming nature. Ourcontributions are threefold. First; we show how these design tasks may be formulated interms of network-wide performance; security; and resilience requirements. Our formulationscapture the correctness and feasibility constraints on the design; and they model each taskas one of optimizing desired criteria subject to the constraints. The optimization criteria mayfurther be customized to meet operator-preferred design strategies. Second; we develop …,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TON),2011,104

Enabling contribution awareness in an overlay broadcasting system,Yu-Wei Sung; Michael Bishop; Sanjay Rao,Abstract We consider the design of bandwidth-demanding broadcasting applications usingoverlays in environments characterized by hosts with limited and asymmetric bandwidth;and significant heterogeneity in outgoing bandwidth. Such environments are critical toconsider to extend the applicability of overlay multicast to mainstream Internet environmentswhere insufficient bandwidth exists to support all hosts; but have not received adequateattention from the research community. We leverage the multi-tree framework and designheuristics to enable it to consider host contribution and operate in bandwidth-scarceenvironments. Our extensions seek to simultaneously achieve good utilization of systemresources; performance to hosts commensurate to their contributions; and consistentperformance.

The impact of heterogeneous bandwidth constraints on DHT-based multicast protocols,Ashwin R Bharambe; Sanjay G Rao; Venkata N Padmanabhan; Srinivasan Seshan; Hui Zhang,Abstract In this paper; we consider support for bandwidth-demanding applications such asvideo broadcasting using DHTs. Our investigations focus on the impact of heterogeneity inthe outgoing bandwidth capabilities of nodes on Scribe; a representative and relativelymature DHT-based multicast protocol. We expose important issues that arise due to themismatch between the ID space that underlies the DHT and the outgoing bandwidthconstraints on nodes.,International Workshop on Peer-to-Peer Systems,2005,78
Modeling and understanding end-to-end class of service policies in operational networks,Yu-Wei Eric Sung; Carsten Lund; Mark Lyn; Sanjay G Rao; Subhabrata Sen,Abstract Business and economic considerations are driving the extensive use of servicedifferentiation in Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) operated for business enterprises today.The resulting Class of Service (CoS) designs embed complex policy decisions based on thedescribed priorities of various applications; extent of bandwidth availability; and costconsiderations. These inherently complex high-level policies are realized through low-levelrouter configurations. The configuration process is tedious and error-prone given the highlyintertwined nature of CoS configuration; the multiple router configurations over which thepolicies are instantiated; and the complex access control lists (ACLs) involved. Ourcontributions include (i) a formal approach to modeling CoS policies from routerconfiguration files in a precise manner;(ii) a practical and computationally efficient tool …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2009,49
DDoS attacks by subverting membership management in P2P systems,Xin Sun; Ruben Torres; Sanjay Rao,We show that malicious participants in a peer-to-peer system can subvert its membershipmanagement mechanisms to create large-scale DDoS attacks on nodes not even part of theoverlay system. The attacks exploit many fundamental design choices made by peer-to-peersystem designers such as (i) use of push-based mechanisms;(ii) use of distinct logicalidentifier (eg IDs in a DHT) corresponding to the same physical identifier (eg; IP address);typically to handle hosts behind NATs; and (iii) inadequate or poorly designed mechanismsto validate membership information. We demonstrate the significance of the attacks in thecontext of mature and extensively deployed peer-to-peer systems with representative andcontrasting membership management algorithms-DHT-based Kad and gossip-based ESM.,Secure Network Protocols; 2007.

Inferring undesirable behavior from P2P traffic analysis,Ruben D Torres; Mohammad Y Hajjat; Sanjay G Rao; Marco Mellia; Maurizio M Munafò,Abstract While peer-to-peer (P2P) systems have emerged in popularity in recent years; theirlarge-scale and complexity make them difficult to reason about. In this paper; we argue thatsystematic analysis of traffic characteristics of P2P systems can reveal a wealth ofinformation about their behavior; and highlight potential undesirable activities that suchsystems may exhibit. As a first step to this end; we present an offline and semi-automatedapproach to detect undesirable behavior. Our analysis is applied on real traffic tracescollected from a Point-of-Presence (PoP) of a national-wide ISP in which over 70% of thetotal traffic is due to eMule [19]; a popular P2P file-sharing system. Flow-level measurementsare aggregated into" samples" referring to the activity of each host during a time interval. Wethen employ a clustering technique to automatically and coarsely identify similar behavior …,ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review,2009,40
A systematic approach for evolving VLAN designs,Xin Sun; Yu-Wei Sung; Sunil D Krothapalli; Sanjay G Rao,Enterprise networks are large and complex; and their designs must be frequently altered toadapt to changing organizational needs. The process of redesigning and reconfiguringenterprise networks is ad-hoc and error-prone; and configuration errors could cause seriousissues such as network outages. In this paper; we take a step towards systematic evolutionof network designs in the context of virtual local area networks (VLANs). We focus on VLANsgiven their importance and prevalence; the frequent need to change VLAN designs; and thetime-consuming and error-prone process of making changes. We present algorithms forcommon design tasks encountered in evolving VLANs such as deciding which VLAN a newhost must be assigned to. Our algorithms trade off multiple criteria such as broadcast trafficcosts; and costs associated with maintaining spanning trees for each VLAN in the network …,INFOCOM; 2010 Proceedings IEEE,2010,38
Characterizing VLAN usage in an operational network,Prashant Garimella; Yu-Wei Eric Sung; Nan Zhang; Sanjay Rao,Abstract In this paper; we present one of the first studies characterizing VLAN usage in alarge operational network. Our study employs a" white-box" approach; based on analysis ofswitch and router configuration files; and interactions with network operators. Our findingsare:(i) VLANs are extensively used to enable users at physically disparate locations to betreated as a group;(ii) the performance inefficiencies resulting from such usage is significant;and (iii) the inefficiencies are exacerbated by sub-optimal placement policies. Finally; weidentify potential sources of errors that may arise with VLAN configurations; and demonstratetheir prevalence.,Proceedings of the 2007 SIGCOMM workshop on Internet network management,2007,38
Fast techniques for the optimal smoothing of stored video,Sanjay G Rao; SV Raghavan,Abstract. Work-ahead smoothing is a technique whereby a server; transmitting storedcompressed video to a client; utilizes client buffer space to reduce the rate variability of thetransmitted stream. The technique requires the server to compute a schedule of transferunder the constraints that the client buffer neither overflows nor underflows. Recent workestablished an optimal off-line algorithm (which minimizes peak; variance and rate variabilityof the transmitted stream) under the assumptions of fixed client buffer size; known worst casenetwork jitter; and strict playback of the client video. In this paper; we examine the practicalconsiderations of heterogeneous and dynamically variable client buffer sizes; variable worstcase network jitter estimates; and client interactivity. These conditions require on-linecomputation of the optimal transfer schedule. We focus on techniques for reducing on-line …,Multimedia Systems,1999,37
A survey of virtual LAN usage in campus networks,Minlan Yu; Jennifer Rexford; Xin Sun; Sanjay Rao; Nick Feamster,VLANs are widely used in today's enterprise networks to improve Ethernet scalability andsupport network policies. However; manuals and textbooks offer very little information abouthow VLANs are actually used in practice. Through discussions with network administratorsand analysis of configuration data; we describe how three university campuses and oneacademic department use VLANs to achieve a variety of goals. We argue that VLANs are ill-suited to some of these goals (eg; VLANs are often used to realize access control policies;but constrain the types of policies that can be expressed). Furthermore; the use of VLANsleads to significant complexity in the configuration of network devices.,IEEE Communications Magazine,2011,33
PARCEL: Proxy assisted browsing in cellular networks for energy and latency reduction,Ashiwan Sivakumar; Shankaranarayanan Puzhavakath Narayanan; Vijay Gopalakrishnan; Seungjoon Lee; Sanjay Rao; Subhabrata Sen,Abstract Today's web page download process is ill suited to cellular networks resulting inhigh page load times and radio energy usage. While there have been notable prior attemptsat tackling the challenge with assistance from proxies (cloud); achieving a responsive andenergy efficient browsing experience remains an elusive goal. In this paper; we make afresh attempt at addressing the challenge by proposing PARCEL. PARCEL splitsfunctionality between the mobile device and the proxy based on their strengths; and in amanner distinct from both traditional browsers and existing cloud-heavy approaches.

Performance sensitive replication in geo-distributed cloud datastores,PN Shankaranarayanan; Ashiwan Sivakumar; Sanjay Rao; Mohit Tawarmalani,Modern web applications face stringent requirements along many dimensions includinglatency; scalability; and availability. In response; several geo-distributed cloud data storeshave emerged in recent years. Customizing data stores to meet application SLAs ischallenging given the scale of applications; and their diverse and dynamic workloads. In thispaper; we tackle these challenges in the context of quorum-based systems (eg AmazonDynamo; Cassandra); an important class of cloud storage systems. We present models thatoptimize percentiles of response time under normal operation and under a data-center (DC)failure. Our models consider factors like the geographic spread of users; DC locations;consistency requirements and inter-DC communication costs.

Cloud is not a silver bullet: A case study of cloud-based mobile browsing,Ashiwan Sivakumar; Vijay Gopalakrishnan; Seungjoon Lee; Sanjay Rao; Subhabrata Sen; Oliver Spatscheck,Abstract In recent years; there has been growing interest in both industry and academia inaugmenting mobile web browsing with support from the cloud [4; 1; 3; 16; 18]). These effortsare motivated by the goals of lowering costs of data transfer; and reducing web latenciesand device energy consumption. While these efforts have adopted different approaches tocloud-based browsing; there isn't a systematic understanding of the rich design space due tothe proprietary nature of many of the solutions. In this paper; we take a step towardsobtaining a better understanding by evaluating an extreme point in the design space thatinvolves cloud support for most browsing functionality including execution of JavaScript (JS);and for compaction of data (eg; image transcoding and compression).

Extracting network-wide correlated changes from longitudinal configuration data,Yu-Wei Eric Sung; Sanjay Rao; Subhabrata Sen; Stephen Leggett,Abstract IP network operators face the challenge of making and managing routerconfiguration changes to serve rapidly evolving user and organizational needs. Changesare expressed in low-level languages; and often impact multiple parts of a configuration fileand multiple routers. These dependencies make configuration changes difficult for operatorsto reason about; detect problems in; and troubleshoot. In this paper; we present amethodology to extract network-wide correlations of changes. From longitudinal snapshotsof low-level router configuration data; our methodology identifies syntactic configurationblocks that changed; applies data mining techniques to extract correlated changes; andhighlights changes of interest via operator feedback. Employing our methodology; weanalyze an 11-month archive of router configuration data from 5 different large-scale …,International Conference on Passive and Active Network Measurement,2009,23
On the feasibility of exploiting P2P systems to launch DDoS attacks,Xin Sun; Ruben Torres; Sanjay G Rao,Abstract We show that malicious nodes in a peer-to-peer (P2P) system may impact theexternal Internet environment; by causing large-scale distributed denial of service (DDoS)attacks on nodes not even part of the overlay system. This is in contrast to attacks that disruptthe normal functioning; and performance of the overlay system itself. We demonstrate thesignificance of the attacks in the context of mature and extensively deployed P2P systemswith representative and contrasting membership management algorithms—Kad; a DHT-based file-sharing system; and ESM; a gossip-based video broadcasting system. We thenpresent an evaluation study of three possible mitigation schemes and discuss their strengthand weakness. These schemes include (i) preferring pull-based membership propagationover push-based;(ii) corroborating membership information through multiple sources; and …,Peer-to-peer networking and applications,2010,19
The internet-wide impact of p2p traffic localization on isp profitability,Jeff Seibert; Ruben Torres; Marco Mellia; Maurizio M Munafo; Cristina Nita-Rotaru; Sanjay Rao,Abstract We conduct a detailed simulation study to examine how localizing P2P traffic withinnetwork boundaries impacts the profitability of an ISP. A distinguishing aspect of our work isthe focus on Internet-wide implications; ie; how adoption of localization within an ISP affectsboth itself and other ISPs. Our simulations are based on detailed models that estimate inter-autonomous system (AS) P2P traffic and inter-AS routing; localization models that predict theextent to which P2P traffic is reduced; and pricing models that predict the impact of changesin traffic on the profit of an ISP. We evaluate our models by using a large-scale crawl ofBitTorrent containing over 138 million users sharing 2.75 million files. Our results show thatthe benefits of localization must not be taken for granted. Some of our key findings include:1) residential ISPs can actually lose money when localization is employed; and some of …,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TON),2012,17
A toolkit for automating and visualizing vlan configuration,Sunil D Krothapalli; Xin Sun; Yu-Wei E Sung; Suan Aik Yeo; Sanjay G Rao,Abstract Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) are extensively used in enterprise networks.However; their configuration remains an ad-hoc; complex and error-prone process today.We believe that to eliminate these difficulties; there is need for automation tools; and alsoneed for visualization tools. In this paper; we report on our experience building a VLANmanagement toolkit; which automates and visualizes common VLAN configuration tasks. Webegin by describing common misconfigurations; and their impact on network performanceand security. We next present a set of algorithms that automate the VLAN configurationtasks.

In this paper; we present Dealer--a system thathelps geo-distributed; interactive and multi-tier applications meet their stringentrequirements on response time despite such variability. Our approach is motivated by thefact that; at any time; only a small number of application components of large multi-tierapplications experience poor performance. Dealer abstracts application structure as acomponent graph; with nodes being application components and edges capturing inter-component communication patterns. Dealer continually monitors the performance ofindividual component replicas and communication latencies between replica pairs.

Preventing DDoS attacks on internet servers exploiting P2P systems,Xin Sun; Ruben Torres; Sanjay Rao,Abstract Recently; there has been a spurt of work [1–7] showing that a variety of extensivelydeployed P2P systems may be exploited to launch DDoS attacks on web and other Internetservers; external to the P2P system. In this paper; we dissect these attacks and categorizethem based on the underlying cause for attack amplification. We show that the attacks stemfrom a violation of three key principles:(i) membership information must be validated beforeuse;(ii) innocent participants must only propagate validated information; and (iii) the systemmust protect against multiple references to the victim. We systematically explore theeffectiveness of an active probing approach to validating membership information inthwarting such DDoS attacks. The approach does not rely on centralized authorities formembership verification; and is applicable to both structured (DHT-based) and …,Computer Networks,2010,14

Modeling complexity of enterprise routing design,Xin Sun; Sanjay G Rao; Geoffrey G Xie,Abstract Enterprise networks often have complex routing designs given the need to meet awide set of resiliency; security and routing policies. In this paper; we take the position thatminimizing design complexity must be an explicit objective of routing design. We take a firststep to this end by presenting a systematic approach for modeling and reasoning aboutcomplexity in enterprise routing design. We make three contributions. First; we present aframework for precisely defining objectives of routing design; and for reasoning about how acombination of routing design primitives (eg routing instances; static routes; and route filtersetc.) will meet the objectives. Second; we show that it is feasible to quantitatively measurethe complexity of a routing design by modeling individual routing design primitives; andleveraging configuration complexity metrics [5].

Preventing DDoS attacks with P2P systems through robust membership management,Xin Sun; Ruben Torres; Sanjay Rao,ABSTRACT We show that malicious nodes in a peer-to-peer system may impact the externalInternet environment; by causing largescale distributed denial of service attacks on nodesnot even part of the overlay system. This is in contrast to attacks that disrupt the normalfunctioning; and performance of the overlay system itself. We formulate several principlescritical to the design of membership management protocols robust to such attacks. We showthat (i) pull-based mechanisms are preferable to push-based mechanisms;(ii) it is critical tovalidate membership information received by a node; and even simple probe-basedtechniques can be quite effective;(iii) validating information by requiring corroboration frommultiple sources can provide good security properties with insignificant performancepenalties; and (iv) it is important to bound the number of distinct logical identifier (eg IDs …,The 3rd Workshop on Secure Network Protocols (NPSec 2007),2007,12
Reducing latency through page-aware management of web objects by content delivery networks,Shankaranarayanan Puzhavakath Narayanan; Yun Seong Nam; Ashiwan Sivakumar; Balakrishnan Chandrasekaran; Bruce Maggs; Sanjay Rao,Abstract As popular web sites turn to content delivery networks (CDNs) for full-site delivery;there is an opportunity to improve the end-user experience by optimizing the delivery ofentire web pages; rather than just individual objects. In particular; this paper explores page-structure-aware strategies for placing objects in CDN cache hierarchies. The key idea is thatthe objects in a web page that have the largest impact on page latency should be served outof the closest or fastest caches in the hierarchy. We present schemes for identifying theseobjects and develop mechanisms to ensure that they are served with higher priority by theCDN; while balancing traditional CDN concerns such as optimizing the delivery of popularobjects and minimizing bandwidth costs. To establish a baseline for evaluatingimprovements in page latencies; we collect and analyze publicly visible HTTP headers …,ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review,2016,10

First; we conduct a measurement study spanning a 19 monthsperiod of a wide variety of applications on Amazon EC2 to understand issues involved inconfiguration selection.

A cost-benefit framework for judicious enterprise network redesign,Xin Sun; Sanjay G Rao,Recent works; have shown the benefits of a systematic approach to designing enterprisenetworks. However; these works are limited to the design of greenfield (newly deployed)networks; or to incremental evolution of existing networks without altering prior designdecisions. In this paper; we focus on redesigning existing networks; allowing for changes toexisting decisions. Such redesign (migration) may be desirable from the perspective ofimproved network performance or lower complexity.

RelSamp: Preserving application structure in sampled flow measurements,Myungjin Lee; Mohammad Hajjat; Ramana Rao Kompella; Sanjay Rao,The Internet has significantly evolved in the number and variety of applications. Networkoperators need mechanisms to constantly monitor and study these applications. Givenmodern applications routinely consist of several flows; potentially to many differentdestinations; existing measurement approaches such as Sampled NetFlow sample only afew flows per application session. To address this issue; in this paper; we introduceRelSamp architecture that implements the notion of related sampling where flows that arepart of the same application session are given higher probability. In our evaluation usingreal traces; we show that RelSamp achieves 5-10x more flows per application sessioncompared to Sampled NetFlow for the same effective number of sampled packets.

Towards securing data delivery in peer-to-peer streaming,Jeff Seibert; Xin Sun; Cristina Nita-Rotaru; Sanjay Rao,The goal of enabling ubiquitous video broadcasting on the Internet has been a longcherished vision in the networking community. Prior efforts aimed at achieving this goalbased on the IP Multicast architecture have been unsuccessful. In recent years; peer-to-peer(P2P) streaming has emerged as a promising alternative technology; which has matured tothe point that there are several commercial offerings available to users. While thesedevelopments are encouraging; P2P streaming systems are susceptible to attacks bymalicious participants; and their viability depends on how effectively they can perform undersuch attacks. In this paper; we explore this issue in the context of mesh-based designs;which have emerged as the dominant architecture for P2P streaming.

Enabling confidentiality of data delivery in an overlay broadcasting system,Ruben Torres; Xin Sun; AAron Walters; Cristina Nita-Rotaru; Sanjay Rao,In this paper; we present an extensive study of key dissemination schemes in an overlaymulticast context; and the first to involve actual implementation; real traces; and performancein Internet environments. Given that rekey traffic has stronger resilience requirements and isburstier than data traffic; we consider whether data and keys must be distributed using thesame overlay or using two separate dissemination structures. Our key findings are:(i) acoupled architecture is effective in achieving resilient key dissemination. Using TCP in eachhop of the dissemination structure (an opportunity unique to overlays) is effective inachieving resiliency in end-to-end key delivery. The performance can be further enhanced ifconvergence properties of overlays are considered; and (ii) a coupled architecture optimizedfor data delivery has high overheads; while a coupled architecture optimized for key …,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,2007,8
Alpaca: Compact network policies with attribute-carrying addresses,Nanxi Kang; Ori Rottenstreich; Sanjay Rao; Jennifer Rexford,Abstract In enterprise networks; policies (eg; QoS or security) are often defined based on thecategorization of hosts along dimensions such as the organizational role of the host (facultyvs. student); and department (engineering vs. sales). While current best practices (VLANs)help when hosts are categorized along a single dimension; policy may often need to beexpressed along multiple orthogonal dimensions. In this paper; we make three contributions.First; we argue for Attribute-Carrying IPs (ACIPs); where the IP address allocation process inenterprises considers attributes of a host along all policy dimensions. ACIPs enable flexiblepolicy specification in a manner that may not otherwise be feasible owing to the limited sizeof switch rule-tables. Second; we present Alpaca; algorithms for realizing ACIPs underpractical constraints of limited-length IP addresses.

On-demand waypoints for live P2P video broadcasting,Aditya Ganjam; Sanjay G Rao; Kunwadee Sripanidkulchai; Jibin Zhan; Hui Zhang,Abstract A peer-to-peer architecture has emerged as a promising approach to enabling theubiquitous deployment of live video broadcasting on the Internet. However the performancein these architectures is unpredictable and fundamentally constrained by the characteristicsof the members participating in the broadcast. By characteristics; we refer to user dynamics;out-going bandwidth connectivity; whether the member is behind NAT/firewall; and thenetwork conditions among participating members. While several researchers have looked athybrid P2P/CDN approaches to address these issues; such approaches requireprovisioning of centralized server resources prior to a broadcast; which complicates the goalof ubiquitous video broadcasting. In this paper; we explore an alternative architecture whereusers are willing to donate their bandwidth resources to a broadcast event; even though …,Peer-to-peer networking and applications,2010,7
Establishing the viability of end system multicast using a systems approach to protocol design,Sanjay G Rao,Abstract: This thesis is motivated by the vision of enabling ubiquitous deployment ofapplications such as audio/video conferencing and broadcasting over the Internet. For over15 years; researchers have attempted to enable such applications using the IP Multicastarchitecture. However; concerns regarding per-group state in routers; deployment issues;and difficulties with supporting higher level functionality; such as reliability and congestioncontrol; have prevented IP Multicast from taking root. The author contends that" it is feasibleto efficiently enable group communication applications on the Internet without router and IPlevel support." He demonstrates this in the context of an alternate architecture that he calls"End System Multicast." Here; end systems implement all multicast functionality; includingmembership management and packet replication. By eliminating state in routers; and …,*,2004,6
Robust validation of network designs under uncertain demands and failures,Yiyang Chang; Sanjay Rao; Mohit Tawarmalani,Abstract A key challenge confronting wide-area network architects is validating that theirnetwork designs provide assurable performance in the face of variable traffic demands andfailures. Validation is hard because of the exponential; and possibly non-enumerable; set ofscenarios that must be considered. Current theoretical tools provide overly conservativebounds on network performance since to remain tractable; they do not adequately model theflexible routing strategies that networks employ in practice to adapt to failures and changingtraffic demands. In this paper; we develop an optimizationtheoretic framework to derive theworst-case network performance across scenarios of interest by modeling flexible routingadaptation strategies. We present an approach to tackling the resulting intractable problems;which can achieve tighter bounds on network performance than current techniques. While …,strategies,2017,4
Characterization of community based-P2P systems and implications for traffic localization,Ruben Torres; Marco Mellia; Maurizio M Munafo; Sanjay G Rao,Abstract In this paper; we present one of the first and most extensive characterizations ofclosed community-based P2P systems. Such systems are organic groups of peer-to-peer(P2P) clients; which can be joined only by users belonging to a certain network (eg;connected to a given Internet Service Provider (ISP)). A number of factors motivate thegrowth of these communities; such as quality of content; anonymity of transfers; and thepotential for better performance that enhances user experience. Our study is conducted intwo contrasting environments—a campus network and a national ISP—located in differentcontinents. In both cases; large-scale closed communities have been found to be thepredominant P2P systems in use. We shed light both on the factors motivating the growth ofsuch communities; and present results characterizing the extensiveness of their usage …,Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications,2013,4
Virtual man: A VLAN management system for enterprise networks,Sunil Dath Krothapalli; Suan Aik Yeo; Yu-Wei Eric Sung; Sanjay G Rao,ABSTRACT In this demonstration; we present Virtual MAN; a system which addressesplethora of unique challenges network operators face in managing Virtual Local AreaNetworks (VLANs) in enterprise networks. Despite their wide prevalence in enterprisenetworks; the management process of VLANs is ad-hoc; error-prone; and has received littlesystematic treatment in the research community. We have identified the most commonlyperformed tasks by the network operators when managing VLANs and developed a systemto automate these tasks. From an operator standpoint; the system not only provides anetwork wide view of how VLANs are organized in an enterprise network but also assiststhem in performing actions like extending current VLANs and configuring new VLANs.Network managers can also use this toolkit to detect and diagnose suboptimal root bridge …,Demo Session; ACM SIGCOMM,2009,4
A software toolkit for visualizing enterprise routing design,Xin Sun; Jinliang Wei; Sanjay G Rao; Geoffrey G Xie,Routing design is widely considered as one of the most challenging parts of enterprisenetwork design. The challenges come from the typical large scale of such networks; thediverse objectives to meet through design; and a wide variety of protocols and mechanismsto choose from. As a result network operators often find it difficult to understand and trouble-shoot the routing design of their networks. Furthermore; today's common practice of focusingon one router or one protocol at a time makes it a onerous task to reason about the network-wide routing behavior. We believe that to mitigate the problem; there is a need for softwaretools to produce effective visualization of enterprise routing designs. In this paper we reporton our experience building such a toolkit. We begin by abstracting various routingmechanisms into a small number of design primitives. The abstraction allows for a more …,Configuration Analytics and Automation (SAFECONFIG); 2011 4th Symposium on,2011,3
A design for securing data delivery in mesh-based peer-to-peer streaming,Jeff Seibert; Xin Sun; Cristina Nita-Rotaru; Sanjay Rao,Abstract While mesh-based approaches have emerged as the dominant architecture for P2Pstreaming; the performance of these approaches under malicious participants has receivedlittle attention. In this paper; we provide a taxonomy of the implicit commitments made bynodes when peering with others. We show that when these commitments are not enforcedexplicitly; they can be exploited by malicious nodes to conduct attacks that degrade the datadelivery service. We consider mesh-based specific P2P attacks where malicious nodesdeliberately become neighbors of a large number of nodes and do not upload data to them;or malicious nodes deliberately delay packets till they are not useful anymore for theapplication. We focus on these attacks given the limited attention paid to them; and thesignificant impact they can have on overall data delivery. We present mechanisms that …,Computer Networks,2011,3
Dealer: Dynamic Request Splitting for Performance-Sensitive Applications in Multi-Cloud Environments,Mohammad Hajjat; Shankaranarayanan Narayanan; David Maltz; Sanjay Rao; Kunwadee Sripanidkulchai,ABSTRACT Enterprises are increasingly deploying their applications in the cloud given thecost-saving advantages; and the potential to geo-distribute applications to ensure resilienceand better service experience. However; a key unknown is whether it it is feasible to meetthe stringent response time requirements of enterprise applications using the cloud. Wemake several contributions. First; we show through empirical measurement studies that (i)there is significant short-term variability in application workload and response times ofindividual components; however (ii) the response times of the same component in differentdata-centers are often uncorrelated. This leads us to argue that there are potential latencysavings if work related to a poorly performing component is dynamically reassigned to areplica in a remote data-center.

A flow measurement architecture to preserve application structure,Myungjin Lee; Mohammad Hajjat; Ramana Rao Kompella; Sanjay G Rao,Abstract The Internet has significantly evolved in the number and variety of applications.Network operators need mechanisms to constantly monitor and study these applications.Modern routers employ passive measurement solution called Sampled NetFlow to collectbasic statistics on a per-flow basis (for a small subset of flows); that could provide valuableinformation for application monitoring. Given modern applications routinely consist ofseveral flows; potentially to many different destinations; only a few flows are sampled perapplication session using Sampled NetFlow. To address this issue; in this paper; weintroduce related sampling that allows network operators to give a higher probability to flowsthat are part of the same application session.

D-tunes: self tuning datastores for geo-distributed interactive applications,Shankaranarayanan PN; Ashiwan Sivakumar; Sanjay Rao; Mohit Tawarmalani,Abstract Modern internet applications have resulted in users sharing data with each other inan interactive fashion. These applications have very stringent service level agreements(SLAs) which place tight constraints on the performance of the underlying geo-distributeddatastores. Deploying these systems in the cloud to meet such constraints is a challengingtask; as application architects have to strike an optimal balance among different contrastingobjectives such as maintaining consistency between multiple replicas; minimizing accesslatency and ensuring high availability. Achieving these objectives requires carefullyconfiguring a number of low-level parameters of the datastores; such as the number ofreplicas; which DCs contain which data; and the underlying consistency protocolparameters.

A case for end system multicast,Yang-Hua Chu Sanjay; Sanjay G Rao; Srinivasan Seshan; Hui Zhang,Abstract The conventional wisdom has been that IP is the natural protocol layer forimplementing multicast related functionality. However; more than a decade after its initialproposal; IP Multicast is still plagued with concerns pertaining to scalability; networkmanagement; deployment and support for higher layer functionality such as error; flow andcongestion control. In this paper; we explore an alternative architecture that we term EndSystem Multicast; where end systems implement all multicast related functionality includingmembership management and packet replication. This shifting of multicast support fromrouters to end systems has the potential to address most problems associated with IPMulticast. However; the key concern is the performance penalty associated with such amodel. In particular; End System Multicast introduces duplicate packets on physical links …,in Proceedings of ACM Sigmetrics,2002,2
Achieving Causal Consistency under Partial Replication for Geo-distributed Cloud Storage,Tariq Mahmood; Shankaranarayanan Puzhavakath Narayanan; Sanjay Rao; TN Vijaykumar; Mithuna Thottethodi,Abstract Causal consistency has emerged as an attractive middle-ground to architectingcloud storage systems; as it allows for high availability and low latency; while supportingstronger-than-eventual-consistency semantics. However; causally-consistent cloud storagesystems have seen limited deployment in practice. A key factor is these systems employ fullreplication of all the data in all the data centers (DCs); incurring high cost. A simpleextension of current causal systems to support partial replication by clustering DCs into ringsincurs availability and latency problems. We propose Karma; the first system to enablecausal consistency for partitioned data stores while achieving the cost advantages of partialreplication without the availability and latency problems of the simple extension. Ourevaluation with 64 servers emulating 8 geo-distributed DCs shows that Karma (i) incurs …,*,2016,1

Proxies that execute Web page JavaScript (JS)and push objects needed by the client can reduce latency. However; a key concern is thescalability of the proxy which must execute JS for many concurrent users. In this paper; wepropose to scale the proxies; focusing on a design where the proxy's execution is solely topush the needed objects and the client completely executes the page as normal. Suchredundant execution is a simple; yet effective approach to cutting network latencies; whichdominate page load delays in cellular settings.

Composing middlebox and traffic engineering policies in SDNs,Yiyang Chang; Gustavo Petri; Sanjay Rao; Tiark Rompf,Middleboxes present new requirements that need to be integrated with traffic engineeringapplications that are already complex and consider myriad factors (eg; routing; QoS; load-balancing). While it is possible to revisit traffic engineering algorithms to explicitly integratemiddleboxes; such an approach is not compositional. Existing efforts at compositional SDNapplication development do not apply since they support application composition after staticpacket-forwarding policies are generated by application modules. Consequently; routescomputed by a traffic engineering module cannot be influenced by the constraints imposedby a module that specifies middlebox traversal requirements. In this paper; we explore analternate approach where application composition is done prior to the generation of packet-forwarding policies.

Self tuning data-stores for geo-distributed cloud applications,PN Shankaranarayanan; Ashiwan Sivakumar; Sanjay Rao; Mohit Tawarmalani,Introduction: 1 Modern internet applications have resulted in users sharing data with eachother in an interactive fashion. These applications have very stringent service levelagreements (SLAs) which place tight constraints on the performance of the underlyinggeodistributed data-stores. Deploying these systems in the cloud to meet such constraints isa challenging task; as application architects have to strike an optimal balance amongdifferent contrasting objectives such as maintaining consistency between multiple replicas;minimizing access latency and ensuring high availability. Achieving these objectivesrequires carefully configuring a number of low-level parameters of the data-stores; such asthe number of replicas; which DCs contain which data; and the underlying consistencyprotocol parameters. In this work; we adopt a systematic approach where we develop …,*,*,*
Characterization Study of VLANs in a Campus Network,Prashant Garimella; Yu-Wei Sung; Nan Zhang; Sanjay Rao,Abstract In this paper we present a study characterizing VLAN usage in a large-sizedcampus network. Despite their extensive prevalence in enterprise and campus networks; theusage of VLANs has received little systematic treatment in the research community. Ourstudy is conducted using a whitebox approach; involving data such as router configurationfiles obtained from network operators; and through iterative interactions with them. Our studyshows that the use of virtualization is prevalent to enable users belonging to physicallydisparate locations to be treated as a group. We demonstrate and characterize theperformance inefficiencies resulting from virtualization. We show the inefficiencies areexacerbated by sub-optimal placement policies. We also discuss potential sources of errorsthat may arise with configuration of VLANs; and demonstrate their prevalence in real …,*,*,*

The Impact of Heterogeneous Bandwidth Constraints on Protocols for Overlay Multicast,Sanjay G Rao; Ashwin R Bharambe; Venkat Padmanabhan; Srini Seshan; Hui Zhang,Abstract—In this paper; we consider the impact of het-erogeneity in the outgoing bandwidthcapabilities of nodes on existing protocol designs for overlay multicast. This issue hasreceived limited attention in the community although experience with the real deployment ofan overlay multicast prototype [6] has revealed this to be a first-order concern. We considerrepresentative designs from two key classes of protocols-performance-centric and DHT-based.,*,*,*
Closer to the Cloud-A Case for Emulating Cloud Dynamics by Controlling the Environment,Ashiwan Sivakumar; PN Shankaranarayanan; Sanjay Rao,Abstract—Cloud computing offers a wide range of bene-fits including potential cost-savingsby leasing resources from cloud service providers and improved user experience byGeodistributing applications [17]. Cloud service providers typically share the platform andcloud resources across multiple users for better utilization. They lease resources on-demandto users in three broad flavors; namely; Infrastructure as service (IaaS)[1]; Platform asService (PaaS)[9] and Software as Service (SaaS)[8]. These shared resources make thecloud environment highly dynamic and often induce substantial performance variation in thecloud services [21];[22];[14]. A critical step in developing cloud based applications is theability to test these solutions on a controlled but cloud-like environment. Also; it is importantfor commercial product vendors to profile the application performance in the presence of …,*,*,*
