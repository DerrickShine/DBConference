A data-oriented survey of context models,Cristiana Bolchini; Carlo A Curino; Elisa Quintarelli; Fabio A Schreiber; Letizia Tanca,Abstract Context-aware systems are pervading everyday life; therefore context modeling isbecoming a relevant issue and an expanding research field. This survey has the goal toprovide a comprehensive evaluation framework; allowing application designers to comparecontext models with respect to a given target application; in particular we stress the analysisof those features which are relevant for the problem of data tailoring. The contribution of thispaper is twofold: a general analysis framework for context models and an up-to-datecomparison of the most interesting; data-oriented approaches available in the literature.,ACM Sigmod Record,2007,376
Incompleteness; counterexamples; and refinements in abstract model-checking,Roberto Giacobazzi; Elisa Quintarelli,Abstract In this paper we study the relation between the lack of completeness in abstractinterpretation of model-checking and the structure of the counterexamples produced by amodel-checker. We consider two dual forms of completeness of an abstract interpretation:Forward and backward completeness. They correspond respectively to the standard γ/αcompleteness of an abstract interpretation and can be related with each other by adjunction.We give a constructive characterization of Clarke et al.'s spurious counterexamples in termsof both forward and backward completeness of the underlying abstract interpretation. Thisresult allows us to understand the structure of the counterexamples that can be removed bysystematically refining abstract domains to achieve completeness with respect to a givenoperation. We apply our result to improve static program analysis by refining the model …,International Static Analysis Symposium,2001,117
And what can context do for data?,Cristiana Bolchini; CA Curino; Giorgio Orsi; Elisa Quintarelli; Rosalba Rossato; Fabio A Schreiber; Letizia Tanca,a Enterprise Resource Planning. november 2009| vol. 52| no. 11| communications of theacm 137 contributed articles posed methodological approach. In the context design phase;all the possible scenarios (contexts) of the considered application are identified; then; thedesigner must determine context-aware views; as the portions of the entire dataset whichare relevant for each particular actor in each particular context. We propose the definition ofa context-guided methodology to support the designer in identifying; for a given applicationscenario; the contexts and the correspondingly interesting subsets of data. Our methodologyis composed of three basic elements: a context model; capturing all the aspects–the so-called dimensions–that allows the implicit representation of the possible applicationcontexts; a strategy for identifying; for each dimension; independently of the others; a …,Communications of the ACM,2009,67
Context information for knowledge reshaping,Cristiana Bolchini; Carlo Aldo Curino; Elisa Quintarelli; Fabio A Schreiber; Letizia Tanca,More and more often; we face the necessity of extracting appropriately reshaped knowledgefrom an integrated representation of the information space. Be such a global representationa central database; a global view of several ones or an ontological representation of aninformation domain; we face the need to define personalised views for the knowledgestakeholders: single users; companies or applications. We propose exploiting theinformation usage context within a methodology for context-aware data design; where thenotion of context is formally defined together with its role within the process of view buildingby information tailoring. This paper presents our context model; called the context dimensiontree; which plays a fundamental role in tailoring the information space according to userinformation needs.,International Journal of Web Engineering and Technology,2009,56
CARVE: Context-aware automatic view definition over relational databases,Cristiana Bolchini; Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca,Abstract Classical database design strategies; based on the a priori definition of applicationviews to be finally integrated in the design of the global databases; are not appropriate forthe design needs of modern; highly dynamic information systems. This paper presentsCARVE (Context-Aware Relational View dEfinition); a methodology for context-aware viewdefinition; well-suited for the design of modern; dynamic applications that; in differentenvironments and situations; need to access different portions of data. The methodologicalapproach includes a context-design phase; followed by a phase when each of the possibleapplication contexts is automatically associated with its relevant part of information (context-aware view). Accordingly; CARVE is based on a context model; on guidelines to definepartial views related to components of the context; and on a set of operators used to …,Information Systems,2013,53
Data mining for XML query-answering support,Mirjana Mazuran; Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca,Extracting information from semistructured documents is a very hard task; and is going tobecome more and more critical as the amount of digital information available on the Internetgrows. Indeed; documents are often so large that the data set returned as answer to a querymay be too big to convey interpretable knowledge. In this paper; we describe an approachbased on Tree-Based Association Rules (TARs): mined rules; which provide approximate;intensional information on both the structure and the contents of Extensible MarkupLanguage (XML) documents; and can be stored in XML format as well. This minedknowledge is later used to provide: 1) a concise idea-the gist-of both the structure and thecontent of the XML document and 2) quick; approximate answers to queries. In this paper;we focus on the second feature. A prototype system and experimental results …,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,48
A methodology for preference-based personalization of contextual data,Antonio Miele; Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca,Abstract The widespread use of mobile appliances; with limitations in terms of storage;power; and connectivity capability; requires to minimize the amount of data to be loaded onuser's devices; in order to quickly select only the information that is really relevant for theusers in their current contexts: in such a scenario; specific methodologies and techniquesfocused on data reduction must be applied. We propose an extension to the data tailoringapproach of Context-ADDICT; whose aim is to dynamically hook and integrateheterogeneous data to be stored on small; possibly mobile devices. The main goal of ourextension is to personalize the context-dependent data obtained by means of the Context-ADDICT methodology; by allowing the user to express preferences that specify which datas/he is more interested in (and which not) in each specific context. This step allows us to …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,48
Answering XML queries by means of data summaries,Elena Baralis; Paolo Garza; Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca,Abstract XML is a rather verbose representation of semistructured data; which may requirehuge amounts of storage space. We propose a summarized representation of XML data;based on the concept of instance pattern; which can both provide succinct information andbe directly queried. The physical representation of instance patterns exploits itemsets orassociation rules to summarize the content of XML datasets. Instance patterns may be usedfor (possibly partially) answering queries; either when fast and approximate answers arerequired; or when the actual dataset is not available; for example; it is currently unreachable.Experiments on large XML documents show that instance patterns allow a significantreduction in storage space; while preserving almost entirely the completeness of the queryresult. Furthermore; they provide fast query answers and show good scalability on the …,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2007,44
Temporal aspects of semistructured data,Barbara Oliboni; Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca,In many applications information about the history of data and their dynamic aspects are justas important as static information. The increasing amount of information accessible throughthe Web has presented new challenges to academic and industrial research on databases.In this context; data are either structured; when coming from relational or object-orienteddatabases; or partially or completely unstructured; when they consist of simple collections oftext or image files. In the context of semistructured data; models and query languages mustbe extended in order to consider dynamic aspects. We present a model based on labeledgraphs for representing changes in semistructured data and a SQL-like query language forquerying it.,Temporal Representation and Reasoning; 2001. TIME 2001.

Relational data tailoring through view composition,Cristiana Bolchini; Elisa Quintarelli; Rosalba Rossato,Abstract This paper presents a methodology to derive views over a relational database byapplying a sequence of appropriately defined operations to the global schema. Suchtailoring and composition process aims at offering personalized views over the databaseschema; so as to improve its ability to support the new needs of customers; supportevolutionary software development; and fix existing legacy database design problems. Theprocess is driven by the designer's knowledge of the possible operational contexts; in termsof the various dimensions that contribute to determine which portions of the global schemaare relevant with respect to the different actors and situations. We formally introduce someoperators; defined on sets of relations; which tailor the schema and combine theintermediate views to derive different final views; suitable for the different envisioned …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2007,33
An algorithm for generating XML Schemas from ER Schemas.,Paolo Pigozzo; Elisa Quintarelli,Nowadays applications are often characterized by the presence of mobile devices which provideaccess to complex services and allow the user to retrieve and exchange multi- mediainformation. A lot of research issues are related to this new communication envi- ronment; suchas; for example; mobility and multi-channel environment. In particular; context-dependance ofinformation and mobility of the users motivate research effort devoted to the design of informationsources suited to be stored into mobile devices. In [2] a methodology for very small databasesaimed at being stored by portable devices is introduced; it has as starting point the presenceof a model of the applica- tion; ie a complete conceptual schema; such as the ER schema; ofthe entire database supporting it. Since in a mobility oriented environment different informationsources may be present and they may adopt various models and schemata of data; the …,SEBD,2005,30
Operational and abstract semantics of the query language G-Log,Agostino Cortesi; Agostino Dovier; Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca,Abstract The amount and variety of data available electronically have dramatically increasedin the last decade; however; data and documents are stored in different ways and do notusually show their internal structure. In order to take full advantage of the topologicalstructure of digital documents; and particularly web sites; their hierarchical organizationshould be exploited by introducing a notion of query similar to the one used in databasesystems. A good approach; in that respect; is the one provided by graphical querylanguages; originally designed to model object bases and later proposed for semistructureddata; like G-Log. The aim of this paper is to provide suitable graph-based semantics to thislanguage; supporting both data structure variability and topological similarities betweenqueries and document structures.

Mining tree-based association rules from XML documents.,Mirjana Mazuran; Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca,Abstract The increasing amount of very large XML datasets available to casual users is amost challenging problem for our community; and calls for an appropriate support toefficiently gather knowledge from these data. Data mining; already widely applied to extractfrequent correlations of values from both structured and semi-structured datasets; is theappropriate tool for knowledge elicitation. In this work we describe an approach to extractTree-based association rules from XML documents. Such rules provide approximate;intensional information on both the structure and the content of XML documents; and can bestored in XML format to be queried later on. The mined knowledge is used to provide:(i)quick; approximate answers to queries and (ii) information about structural regularities.

Intensional query answering to xquery expressions,Simone Gasparini; Elisa Quintarelli,Abstract XML is a representation of data which may require huge amounts of storage spaceand query processing time. Summarized representations of XML data provide succinctinformation which can be directly queried; either when fast yet approximate answers aresufficient; or when the actual dataset is not available. In this work we show which kinds ofXQuery expressions admit a partial answer by using association rules extracted from XMLdatasets. Such partial information provide intensional answers to queries formulated asXQuery expressions.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2005,21
Modeling semistructured data by using graph-based constraints,Ernesto Damiani; Barbara Oliboni; Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca,Abstract The widespread adoption of semistructured and more in particular XML data hasopened a new venue for the application of formal methods to the speci. cation of models forde. ning classes of semistructured or XML documents [1; 3]. Most current models forsemistructured data are too speci. c to allow immediate comparison with each other; and donot easily support incremental model design. For this reason; we introduce the GeneralSemistructured Meta-Model (GSMM); a simple meta-model for semistructured informationwhich can be applied for the translation to a common formalism of the various abstractmodels proposed in literature; this approach fosters easy a priori comparison and discussionof concrete models' features; such as allowed sets of values; handling of object identi. ers;relationships representation; moreover; it supports e. ective inter-model translation and …,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2003,20

The ESTEEM platform: enabling P2P semantic collaboration through emerging collective knowledge,Stefano Montanelli; Devis Bianchini; Carola Aiello; Roberto Baldoni; Cristiana Bolchini; Silvia Bonomi; Silvana Castano; Tiziana Catarci; Valeria De Antonellis; Alfio Ferrara; Michele Melchiori; Elisa Quintarelli; Monica Scannapieco; Fabio A Schreiber; Letizia Tanca,Abstract In this paper; we present Esteem (Emergent Semantics and cooperaTion in multi-knowledgE EnvironMents); a community-based P2P platform for supporting semanticcollaboration among a set of independent peers; without prior reciprocal knowledge and nopredefined relationships. Goal of Esteem is to go beyond the existing state-of-the-artsolutions for P2P knowledge sharing and to provide an integrated platform for both data andservice discovery. A distinguishing feature of Esteem is the use of semantic communities toexplicitly give shape to the collective knowledge and expertise of peer groups with similarinterests. Key techniques of Esteem will be presented in the paper and concern: shuffling-based communication; ontology and service matchmaking; context management; andquality-aware data integration.

Ontology-based information tailoring,Carlo Curino; Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca,Current applications are often forced to filter the richness of datasources in order to reducethe information noise the user is subject to. We consider this aspect as a critical issue ofapplications; to be factorized at the data management level. The Context-ADDICT system;leveraging on ontology-based context and domain models; is able to personalize the data tobe made available to the user by" context-aware tailoring". In this paper we present a formalapproach to the definition of the relationship between context (represented by anappropriate context model) and application domain (modeled by a domain ontology). Oncesuch relationship has been defined; we are able to work out the boundary of the portion ofthe domain relevant to a user in a certain context. We also sketch the implementation of avisual tool supporting the application designer in this modeling task,Data Engineering Workshops; 2006. Proceedings. 22nd International Conference on,2006,18
A data-mining approach to preference-based data ranking founded on contextual information,Antonio Miele; Elisa Quintarelli; Emanuele Rabosio; Letizia Tanca,Abstract The term information overload was already used back in the 1970s by Alvin Tofflerin his book Future Shock; and refers to the difficulty to understand and make decisions whentoo much information is available. In the era of Big Data; this problem becomes much moredramatic; since users may be literally overwhelmed by the cataract of data accessible in themost varied forms. With context-aware data tailoring; given a target application; in eachspecific context the system allows the user to access only the view which is relevant for thatapplication in that context. Moreover; the relative importance of information to the same userin a different context or; reciprocally; to a different user in the same context; may varyenormously; for this reason; contextual preferences can be used to further refine the viewsassociated with contexts; by imposing a ranking on the data of each context-aware view …,Information Systems,2013,17
Applying model-checking to solve queries on semistructured data,Agostino Dovier; Elisa Quintarelli,Abstract The large volume and nature of data available to the casual users and programsmotivate the increasing interest of the database community in studying flexible and efficienttechniques for extracting and querying semistructured data. On the other hand; efficientmethods have been discovered for solving the so-called model-checking problem for somemodal logics. The aim of this paper is to show how some of these methods can be used forquerying semistructured data. For doing that we show that semistructured data can benaturally seen as Kripke Transition Systems. To keep the presentation independent of aspecific language; we introduce a graphical query language that includes some of thefeatures of the query languages based on graphs and patterns. We show how to associateCTL formulas to queries of this language. This allows us to see the problems of solving a …,Computer Languages; Systems & Structures,2009,16
Modeling users' navigation history,Ernesto Damiani; Barbara Oliboni; Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca,Abstract A lot of recent research has focused on methods of modeling Web users and onefficient ways to initialize and manage user models. In this paper; we present a new usermodeling technique relying on a temporal; graph-based data model for semistructuredinformation. Our technique can be used to filter WWW information and to make the Webexperience personalized for the individual user. Moreover; such graph based data modelalso offers appropriate query languages; which allow user-defined queries either over thewhole web site or over the personalized user site views.,In Proc. of Intl’Workshop on Intelligent Techniques for Web Personalisation (in conj. with IJCAI-01,2001,16
A data mining approach to incremental adaptive functional diagnosis,Cristiana Bolchini; Elisa Quintarelli; Fabio Salice; Paolo Garza,This paper presents a novel approach to functional fault diagnosis adopting data mining toexploit knowledge extracted from the system model. Such knowledge puts into relation testoutcomes with components failures; to define an incremental strategy for identifying thecandidate faulty component. The diagnosis procedure is built upon a set of sorted; possiblyapproximate; rules that specify given a (set of) failing test; which is the faulty candidate. Theprocedure iterative selects the most promising rules and requests the execution of thecorresponding tests; until a component is identified as faulty; or no diagnosis can beperformed. The proposed approach aims at limiting the number of tests to be executed inorder to reduce the time and cost of diagnosis. Results on a set of examples show that theproposed approach allows for a significant reduction of the number of executed tests (the …,Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT); 2013 IEEE International Symposium on,2013,15
Problems and opportunities in context-based personalization,Letizia Tanca; Cristiana Bolchini; Elisa Quintarelli; Fabio A Schreiber; Giorgio Orsi,ABSTRACT In a world of global networking; the increasing amount of heterogeneousinformation; available through a variety of channels; has made it difficult for users to find theinformation they need in the current situation; at the right level of detail. This is true not onlywhen accessing information from mobile devices; characterized by limited–althoughgrowing–resources and by high connection costs; but also when using powerful systems;since the amount of “out-of-context” answers to a given user request may be overwhelming.The knowledge of the context in which the data are going to be used can support theprocess of focussing on currently useful; personalized information. The activity needed forcontextaware information personalization provides material for stimulating research; brieflyillustrated in this paper.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,15
CADD: a tool for context modeling and data tailoring,Cristiana Bolchini; CA Curino; Giorgio Orsi; Elisa Quintarelli; Fabio A Schreiber; Letizia Tanca,Nowadays user mobility requires that both content and services be appropriatelypersonalized; in order for the (mobile) user to be always-and anywhere-equipped with theadequate share of data. Thus; the knowledge about the user; the adopted device and theenvironment; altogether called context; has to be taken into account in order to minimize theamount of information imported on mobile devices. The Context-ADDICT (Context-AwareData Design; Integration; Customization and Tailoring) project aims at the definition of acomplete framework which; starting from a methodology for the early design phases;supports mobile users through the dynamic hooking and integration of new; availableinformation sources; so that an appropriate context-based portion of data; called data chunk;is delivered to their mobile devices.

Context awareness in pervasive information management,Francesco Colace; Vincenzo Moscato; Elisa Quintarelli; Emanuele Rabosio; Letizia Tanca,Abstract Context has been defined as the knowledge that can be used to characterize thesituation of any entity that is relevant for the (pervasive) system under consideration: given atarget application scenario; a context-aware system supports users and devices by providingselective access to the set of data and operations (eg; interesting services and information;environmental data; close-by people; points of interest etc.) which is relevant in each specificcontext. More than that; the relative importance of a piece of information to the same user indifferent contexts or; reciprocally; to different users in the same context may varyenormously; thus the system can personalize information even further by ranking theprovided data on the basis of (contextual) user preferences.

Top-n recommendations on unpopular items with contextual knowledge,Paolo Cremonesi; Paolo Garza; Elisa Quintarelli; Roberto Turrin,ABSTRACT Traditional recommender systems provide recommendations of items to users;recently; some of them also consider the context related to predictions. In this paper wepropose a technique that relies on classical recommendation algorithms and post-filtersrecommendations on the basis of contextual information available for them. Associationrules are exploited to identify the most significant correlations among context and itemcharacteristics. The mined rules are used to filter the predictions performed by traditionalrecommender systems to provide contextualized recommendations. Our experimentalresults show that the proposed approach allows improving the output of classical algorithmsproposed in the literature; especially in the case of unpopular items.,2011 Workshop on Context-aware Recommender Systems.

Filtering mobile data by means of context: a methodology,Cristiana Bolchini; Elisa Quintarelli,The goal of this paper is the introduction of a methodol-ogy for designing context-aware dataselection for portable devices; where computation; memory; power and connectivityresources are limited; and thus; the possibility to tailor the available; usually too rich; dataaccording to context is a mandatory task. First of all; we will introduce the concept of contextand its model; a data structure that expresses knowledge on the user; the environment andthe pos-sible scenarios. We will then focus on the proposed methodology for selecting; bymeans of such information; the relevant data to be made available on a user device. Anoverall picture of the complete scenario for this context-aware data design and tailoringsystem will be also provided.,Second International Workshop on Context Representation and Reasoning,2006,14
Anomaly detection in XML databases by means of association rules,Giulia Bruno; Paolo Garza; Elisa Quintarelli; Rosalba Rossato,Anomaly detection has the double purpose of discovering interesting exceptions andidentifying incorrect data in huge amounts of data. Since anomalies are rare events whichviolate the frequent relationships among data; we propose a method to detect frequentrelationships and then extract anomalies. The RADAR (Research of Anomalous Datathrough Association Rules) method is based on data mining techniques to extract frequent"rules" from datasets; in the form of quasi-functional dependencies. Such dependencies areextracted by using association rules. Given a quasi-functional dependency; we can discoverthe associated anomalies by querying either the original database or the association rulespreviously mined. The analysis on this kind of anomaly can either derive the presence oferroneous data or highlight novel information which represents significant outliers of …,Database and Expert Systems Applications; 2007.

Database challenges for exploratory computing,Marcello Buoncristiano; Giansalvatore Mecca; Elisa Quintarelli; Manuel Roveri; Donatello Santoro; Letizia Tanca,Helping users to make sense of very big datasets is nowadays considered an importantresearch topic. However; the tools that are available for data analysis purposes typicallyaddress professional data scientists; who; besides a deep knowledge of the domain ofinterest; master one or more of the following disciplines: mathematics; statistics; computerscience; computer engineering; and programming. On the contrary; in our vision it is vital tosupport also different kinds of users who; for various reasons; may want to analyze the dataand obtain new insight from them. Examples of these data enthusiasts [4; 9] are journalists;investors; or politicians: non-technical users who can draw great advantage from exploringthe data; achieving new and essential knowledge; instead of reading query results with tonsof records.

1. Introduction,Elisa Quintarelli,Abstract An increasing amount of data is becoming available electronically to humans andprograms. Such data are managed via a large number of data models and accesstechniques; and may come from relational or object-oriented databases (structured data); orconsist of simple collections of text or image files (unstructured data). Many of them can beseen as semistructured: with the term semistructured data we intuitively refer to data whoseschema is not fixed in advance; and whose structure may be irregular or incomplete.,*,2004,11
Context schema evolution in context-aware data management,Elisa Quintarelli; Emanuele Rabosio; Letizia Tanca,Abstract Pervasive access–often by means of mobile devices–to the massive amount ofavailable (Web) data suggests to deliver; anywhere at any time; exactly the data that areneeded in the current specific situation. The literature has introduced the possibility todescribe the context in which the user is involved; and to tailor the available data on itsbasis. In this paper; after having formally defined the context schema–a representation forthe contexts which are to be expected in a given application scenario–a strategy to managecontext schema evolution is developed; by introducing a sound and complete set ofoperators.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2011,10
Using context for the extraction of relational views,Cristiana Bolchini; Elisa Quintarelli; Rosalba Rossato; Letizia Tanca,Abstract The paper presents an approach for automatically extracting views from a relationaldatabase schema; based on the knowledge of the application domain. In order to achievesuch result; the possible contexts emerging from the application domain are identified and;starting from the representation of the characterizing dimensions; a sequence of operationsis applied to the schema to derive the portion of interest or; as we say; to tailor the schemawith respect to each possible context. We introduce the tailoring operators as well as themethod to compose partial views to obtain the final ones; a running example is used to leadthe reader through the steps of the proposed methodology.,International and Interdisciplinary Conference on Modeling and Using Context,2007,10
Semi-automatic support for evolving functional dependencies.,Mirjana Mazuran; Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca; Stefania Ugolini,ABSTRACT During the life of a database; systematic and frequent violations of a givenconstraint may suggest that the represented reality is changing and thus the constraintshould evolve with it. In this paper we propose a method and a tool to (i) find the functionaldependencies that are violated by the current data; and (ii) support their evolution when it isnecessary to update them. The method relies on the use of confidence; as a measure that isassociated with each dependency and allows us to understand” how far” the dependency isfrom correctly describing the current data; and of goodness; as a measure of balancebetween the data satisfying the antecedent of the dependency and those satisfying itsconsequent. Our method compares favorably with literature that approaches the sameproblem in a different way; and performs effectively and efficiently as shown by our tests …,EDBT,2016,9
A framework to model self-adaptive computing systems,Cristiana Bolchini; Matteo Carminati; Antonio Miele; Elisa Quintarelli,This paper proposes a model for the specification and characterization of self-aware/adaptive systems. The model offers a rigorous support for the identification andmanagement of the aspects that characterize context/self-awareness in terms of the relevantelements that determine the changes of context and the consequent related actions thesystem should take. These elements include the application; the architecture and theenvironment as perceived; also modeling the actions the system can perform to adapt tochanges in the context. The proposal specifically targets the field of computing systems;however it is not limited to it. The proposed model is applied to a few self-adaptive scenariosto illustrate its potential.,Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS); 2013 NASA/ESA Conference on,2013,9
Anomaly detection through quasi-functional dependency analysis.,Giulia Bruno; Paolo Garza; Elisa Quintarelli; Rosalba Rossato,ABSTRACT: Anomaly detection problems have been investigated in several research areassuch as database; machine learning; knowledge discovery; and logic programming; with themain goal of identifying objects of a given population whose behavior is anomalous withrespect to a set of commonly accepted rules that are part of the knowledge base. In thispaper we focus our attention on the analysis of anomaly detection in databases. We proposea method; based on data mining algorithms; which allows one to infer the “normal behavior”of objects; by extracting frequent “rules” from a given dataset. These rules are described inthe form of quasifunctional dependencies and mined from the dataset by using associationrules. Our approach allows us to consequently analyze anomalies with respect to thepreviously inferred dependencies: given a quasi-functional dependency; it is possible to …,Journal of Digital Information Management,2007,9
Towards user centric schema mapping platform,Guilian Wang; Rami Rifaieh; Joseph Goguen; Vitaliy Zavesov; Arcot Rajasekar; Mark Miller,Abstract Schema mapping is a fundamental problem in many important databaseapplications. The process of mapping discovery is complex and error prone; it cannot befully automated; so user input is necessary. This paper presents SCIA; a system that assistsusers in creating executable mappings between a source schema and a target schema byautomating simple matches and finding critical points where user input is both necessaryand maximally useful. SCIA finds critical points by using path contexts together with acombination of multiple matching algorithms. SCIA also helps users; when a critical pointoccurs; by asking them specific questions with sufficient context and making suggestions foradding semantic information to data transformation; such as join and grouping conditions.SCIA handles complex mappings involving n-to-m matches with semantic functions and …,International Workshop on Semantic Data and Service Integration; SDSI 2007,2007,9
Model-checking based data retrieval,Agostino Dovier; Elisa Quintarelli,Abstract In this paper we develop a new method for solving queries on semistructured data.The main idea is to see a database as a Kripke Transition System (a model) and a query asa formula of the temporal logic CTL. In this way; the retrieval of data fulfilling a query isreduced to the problem of finding out the states of the model which satisfy the formula (themodel-checking problem) that can be done in linear time.,International Workshop on Database Programming Languages,2001,9
A principled approach to context schema evolution in a data management perspective,Elisa Quintarelli; Emanuele Rabosio; Letizia Tanca,Abstract Context-aware data tailoring studies the means for the system to furnish the users;at any moment; only with the set of data which is relevant for their current context. Thesedata may be from traditional databases; sensor readings; environmental information; close-by people; points of interest; etc. To implement context-awareness; we use a formalrepresentation of a conceptual context model; used to design the context schema; whichintensionally represents all the contexts in which the user may be involved in the consideredapplication scenario. Following this line of thought; in this paper we develop a formalapproach and the corresponding strategy to manage the evolution of the context schema ofa given context-aware application; when the context perspectives initially envisaged by thesystem designer are not applicable any more and unexpected contexts are to be …,Information Systems,2015,8

Exploratory computing: a draft Manifesto,Nicoletta Di Blas; Mirjana Mazuran; Paolo Paolini; Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca,The advent of the Big Data challenge has stimulated research on methods and techniquesto deal with the problem of managing data abundance. Many approaches have beendeveloped; but for the most part; they attack one specific side of the problem: eg efficientquerying; analysis techniques that summarize data or reduce its dimensionality; datavisualization; etc. The approach proposed in this paper aims instead at taking acomprehensive view: first of all; it takes into account that human exploration is an iterativeand multi-step process and therefore allows building upon a previous query on to the next;in a sort of “dialogue” between the user and the system. Second; it aims at supporting avariety of user experiences; like investigation; inspiration seeking; monitoring; comparison;decision-making; research; etc. Third; and probably most important; it adds to the notion …,Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA); 2014 International Conference on,2014,7
ADaPT: automatic data personalization based on contextual preferences,Antonio Miele; Elisa Quintarelli; Emanuele Rabosio; Letizia Tanca,This demo presents a framework for personalizing data access on the basis of the users'context and of the preferences they show while in that context. The system is composed of (i)a server application; which “tailors” a view over the available data on the basis of the user'scontextual preferences; previously inferred from log data; and (ii) a client application runningon the user's mobile device; which allows to query the data view and collects the activity logfor later mining. At each change of context detected by the system the corresponding tailoredview is loaded on the client device: accordingly; the most relevant data is available to theuser even when the connection is unstable or lacking. The demo features a movie database;where users can browse data in different contexts and appreciate the personalization of thedata views according to the inferred contextual preferences.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,7
Recommending new items to ephemeral groups using contextual user influence,Elisa Quintarelli; Emanuele Rabosio; Letizia Tanca,Abstract Group recommender systems help groups of users in finding appropriate items tobe enjoyed together. Lots of activities; like watching TV or going to the restaurant; areintrinsically group-based; thus making the group recommendation problem very relevant. Inthis paper we study ephemeral groups; ie; groups where the members might be together forthe first time. Recent approaches have tackled this issue introducing complex models to belearned offline; making them unable to deal with new items; on the contrary; we propose agroup recommender able to manage new items too. In more detail; our techniquedetermines the preference of a group for an item by combining the individual preferences ofthe group members on the basis of their contextual influence; where the contextual influencerepresents the ability of an individual; in a given situation; to direct the group's decision …,Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems,2016,6
Mining context-aware preferences on relational and sensor data,Davide Beretta; Elisa Quintarelli; Emanuele Rabosio,The increasing amount of available digital data motivates the development of techniques forthe management of the information overload which risks to actually reduce people'sknowledge instead of increasing it. Research is concentrating on topics related to theproblem of filtering/suggesting a subset of available information that is likely to be of interestto the user; besides this subset may vary and is often determined by the context the user iscurrently in. We cannot actually expect only a collaborative approach; where users manuallyspecify the long list of preferences that might be applied to all available data; that is why inthis paper we propose a preliminary methodology; described by using a realistic runningexample; that tries to combine the following research topics: context-awareness; datamining; and preferences. In particular; data mining is used to infer contextual preferences …,Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA); 2011 22nd International Workshop on,2011,6

Designing and developing context-aware mobile mashups: the CAMUS approach,Fabio Corvetta; Maristella Matera; Riccardo Medana; Elisa Quintarelli; Vincenzo Rizzo; Letizia Tanca,Abstract CAMUS (Context-Aware Mobile mashUpS) is a framework for the design of mobileapplications that dynamically collect and integrate heterogeneous resources (data sourcesand services) to offer integrated content and functions to mobile users in a context-awarefashion. CAMUS exploits a set of high-level abstractions for context and mashup modelingthat hide the complexity resulting from service selection; invocation and integration.Generative techniques then enable the transformation of models into running code formobile applications that flexibly respond to actual user needs as they vary in differentsituations of use.,International Conference on Web Engineering,2015,5

We propose to exploit the information usage context within amethodology for context-aware data design; where the notion of context must be formallydefined; together with its role within the process of information tailoring in the P2P setting.This report presents our context model; called Context Dimension Tree; which plays afundamental role in tailoring the information space according to the user's informationneeds; as well as an analysis of relevant features of context models; later used forclassification and comparison.,*,2006,5
Graph transformation to infer schemata from XML documents,Luciano Baresi; Elisa Quintarelli,Abstract Semi-structured data are characterized by the lack of a predefined schema. Thisheterogeneity simplifies the management of such data; but analysis and queries becomemore difficult and demand for schemata that describe these data. Super-imposed structurescannot be as general as predefined ones; but ease the retrieval of the informationembedded in such data. The paper adopts XML as the language to render semi-structureddata and proposes an approach-based on graph transformation techniques-to infer theschemata of XML documents.,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2005,5
Smart buildings: A monitoring and data analysis methodological framework,Cristiana Bolchini; Angela Geronazzo; Elisa Quintarelli,Abstract This paper proposes a methodology for monitoring and data analysis in buildings;leading the user in the design and implementation of smart environments able to collectinformation on spaces and the comfort perceived by their inhabitants. A systematicdescriptive framework is defined to identify the most convenient strategies for monitoring anddata interpretation; driven by the constraints and goals set by how data will be exploited. Awide body of field works has been analyzed and put in relation to the methodology;highlighting the difficulty to extract general guidelines with respect to the same goal and toreveal use case specificity; preventing the possibility to learn from previous solutions.

An expert cad flow for incremental functional diagnosis of complex electronic boards,Cristiana Bolchini; Luca Cassano; Paolo Garza; Elisa Quintarelli; Fabio Salice,Functional diagnosis for complex systems can be a very time-consuming and expensivetask; trying to identify the source of an observed misbehavior. We propose an automaticincremental diagnostic methodology and CAD flow; based on data mining (DM). It is a model-based approach that incrementally determines the tests to be executed to isolate the faultycomponent; aiming at minimizing the total number of executed tests; without compromising100% diagnostic accuracy. The DM engine allows for shorter test sequences with respect toother reasoning-based solutions (eg; Bayesian belief networks); not requiring complex preand post-conditions management. Experimental results on a large set of synthetic examplesand on three industrial boards substantiate the quality of the proposed approach.,IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems,2015,4

Modeling temporal dimensions of semistructured data,Carlo Combi; Barbara Oliboni; Elisa Quintarelli,Abstract In this paper we propose a graph-based generic model able to uniformly representsemistructured data and their temporal aspects. In particular; we start from a generic andexpressive model proposed in the database literature and consider in a formal andsystematic way both valid time and transaction time; together with the set of temporalconstraints needed to correctly manage the semantics of the represented time dimension.We then propose operations; which allow the incremental management of the proposedmodel satisfying the introduced temporal constraints. Moreover; we also deal with thepossibility of managing together the two classical time dimensions of valid and transactiontimes; and formalize the set of constraints needed to correctly handle these temporal aspectstogether.

Mining flexible association rules from XML,Elisabetta Caneva; Barbara Oliboni; Elisa Quintarelli,Abstract The role of the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is becoming very important inthe research fields focusing on the representation; the exchange; and the integration ofinformation coming from different data sources and containing information related to variouscontexts such as; for example; medical and biological data. Extracting knowledge from XMLdatasets is an important issue that may be difficult because of the semistructured intrinsicnature of XML; indeed documents can have an implicit and irregular structure; not defined inadvance. In this paper; we propose a novel approach for discovering frequent; butapproximate; information in XML documents; based on Flexible Tree Rules taking intoaccount both structure and content of the analyzed data.

Mining violations to relax relational database constraints,Mirjana Mazuran; Elisa Quintarelli; Rosalba Rossato; Letizia Tanca,Abstract Frequent constraint violations on the data stored in a database may suggest that therepresented reality is changing; and thus the database does not reflect it anymore. It is thusdesirable to devise methods and tools to support (semi-) automatic schema changes; inorder for the schema to mirror the new situation. In this work we propose a methodology andthe RELACS tool; based on data mining; to maintain the domain and tuple integrityconstraints specified at design time; in order to adjust them to the evolutions of the modeledreality that may occur during the database life. The approach we propose allows to isolatefrequent and meaningful constraint violations and; consequently; to extract novel rules thatcan be used to update or relax the no longer up-to-date integrity constraints.,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2009,3
Context-Driven data filtering: a methodology,Cristiana Bolchini; Elisa Quintarelli,Abstract The goal of this paper is the introduction of a methodology for designing context-driven data selection; that is the possibility to tailor the available; usually too rich; data to beheld on portable mobile devices; according to context. First of all; we will introduce theconcept of context and its model; a data structure that expresses knowledge on the user; theenvironment and the possible scenarios. We will then focus on the proposed methodologyfor selecting; by means of such information; the relevant data to be made available on a userdevice. An application of the proposed methodology is the possibility to select data ofinterest for portable devices; where computation; memory; power and connectivity resourcesare limited; and thus; tailororing the available; usually too rich; data according to context is amandatory task.,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2006,3

Context-aware personalization can reduce theinformation noise; by proposing to the users only the information which is relevant to theircurrent contexts.

Exploratory Computing: What is there for the Database Researcher?,Marcello Buoncristiano; Giansalvatore Mecca; Elisa Quintarelli; Manuel Roveri; Donatello Santoro; Letizia Tanca,Abstract. The need for effective tools helping users to make sense of very big datasets hasreceived a lot of attention lately. In this paper we propose a paradigm for databaseexploration which is in turn inspired by the exploratory computing vision [2]. We maydescribe exploratory computing as the step-by-step “conversation” of a user and a systemthat “help each other” to refine the data exploration process; ultimately gathering newknowledge that concretely fulfills the user needs. In this broad and innovative context; thispaper proposes a model to concretely perform this kind of exploration over a database. Themodel is general enough to encompass most data models and query languages that havebeen proposed for data management in the last few years. At the same time; it is preciseenough to provide a first formalization of the problem and reason about the research …,SEBD,2015,2

Mining rare association rules by discovering quasi-functional dependencies: an incremental approach,Giulia Bruno; Paolo Garza; Elisa Quintarelli,ABSTRACT In the context of anomaly detection; the data mining technique of extractingassociation rules can be used to identify rare rules which represent infrequent situations. Amethod to detect rare rules is to first infer the normal behavior of objects in the form of quasi-functional dependencies (ie functional dependencies that frequently hold); and thenanalyzing rare violations with respect to them. The quasi-functional dependencies areusually inferred from the current instance of a database. However; in several applications;the database is not static; but new data are added or deleted continuously. Thus; theanomalies have to be updated because they change over time. In this chapter; we proposean incremental algorithm to efficiently maintain up-to-date rules (ie; functional and quasi-functional dependencies).

We briefly describe a general methodology for the statisticalanalysis of large-scale databases with the aim to extract relevant; often implicit orunexpected; information about the distribution of the attribute values in two (large) tuple setsresulting from different queries on a large database. This analysis has the main aim ofhelping users to gain knowledge about the datasets they are exploring (see Blas et al.;2014).

Context− aware views for mobile users,Cristiana Bolchini; Carlo Curino; Giorgio Orsi; Elisa Quintarelli; Rosalba Rossato; Fabio A Schreiber; Letizia Tanca,Abstract: Independent; heterogeneous; distributed; sometimes transient and mobile datasources produce an enormous amount of information that should be semantically integratedand ﬁltered; or; as we say; tailored; based on the users' interests and context. We propose toexploit knowledge about the user; the adopted device; and the environment-altogethercalled context-to the end of information tailoring. This paper presents the Context DimensionTree; a context model which is the basis for solving the information tailoring problem; alongwith its role in the framework of the Context-ADDICT architecture.,Proc. of the 10th DELOS Thematic Workshop on Personalized Access ‚Profile Management ‚and Context Awareness in Digital Libraries (PersDL− UM Workshops),2007,1
Specifying temporal data models for semistructured data by a constraint-based approach,Carlo Combi; Barbara Oliboni; Elisa Quintarelli,Abstract In the past few years some models for semistructured temporal data; which proposedifferent strategies to deal with temporal dimensions; have been defined. In this paper weanalyze these models by applying the recently proposed meta-model GSMM (GeneralSemistructured Meta-Model) for semistructured information. GSMM allows us to representsemistructured temporal data models with a unifying formalism; constraints that are specifiedin these models are also represented and classified on the basis of their expressiveness.,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2004,1

Refining and Compressing Abstract Model Checking1,Agostino Dovier; Roberto Giacobazzi; Elisa Quintarelli,Abstract For verifying systems involving a wide number or even an infinite number of states;standard model checking needs approximating techniques to be tractable. Abstractinterpretation offers an appropriate framework to approximate models of reactive systems inorder to obtain simpler models; where properties of interest can be effectively checked. Inthis work we study the impact of domain refinements in abstract interpretation based modelchecking. We consider the universal fragment of the branching time temporal logic CTL∗and we characterize the structure of temporal formulae that are verified in new abstractmodels obtained by refining an abstract domain by means of reduced product anddisjunctive completion; or by simplifying the domain by their inverse operations ofcomplementation and least disjunctive bases.,Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science,2001,1
A Short Account of Techniques for Assisting Users in Mastering Big Data,Davide Martinenghi; Elisa Quintarelli; Fabio A Schreiber; Letizia Tanca,Abstract One of the most challenging problems faced by the database community is to assistinexperienced or casual users; who need the support of a sophisticated system that guidesthem in making sense of the data. This problem becomes especially relevant in the case ofBig Data; where the amount of data may quickly overwhelm users and discourage them fromleveraging the richness of the data patrimony. In the last years; often in collaboration withother members of the Italian database community; we have developed several differenttechniques whose aim is both to reduce the size of the problem and to focus on theinformation that is most relevant to the user. To this end; most of these techniques fruitfullyextract and exploit data semantics; for example by succinctly characterizing data viaintensional properties such as integrity constraints or by tailoring the answer to the user …,*,2018,*
INDIANA the Database Explorer,Antonio Giuzio; Giansalvatore Mecca; Elisa Quintarelli; Manuel Roveri; Donatello Santoro; Letizia Tanca,Abstract We propose INDIANA; a system conceived to support a novel paradigm of databaseexploration. INDIANA guides users that are interested in gaining insights about a databaseby involving them in a “conversation”. During the conversation; the system proposes somefeatures of the data that are “interesting” from the statistical viewpoint. The user selects someof these as starting points; and INDIANA reacts by suggesting new features related to theones selected by the user. A key requirement in this context is the ability to exploretransactional databases; without the need to conduct complex pre-processing. To this end;we develop a number of novel algorithms to support interactive exploration of the database.We report an in-depth experimental evaluation to show that the proposed systemguarantees a very good trade-off between accuracy and scalability; and a user study that …,*,2017,*
On the Role of Context in the Design of Mobile Mashups,Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca; Vittorio Zaccaria,Abstract. This paper presents a design methodology and an accompanying platform for thedesign and fast development of Context-Aware Mobile mashUpS (CAMUS). The approach ischaracterized by the role given to context as a first-class modeling dimension used tosupport (i) the identification of the most adequate resources that can satisfy the users'situational needs and (ii) the consequent tailoring at runtime of the provided data andfunctions. Context-based abstractions are exploited to generate models specifying how datareturned by the selected services have to be merged and visualized by means of integratedviews. Thanks to the adoption of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) techniques; thesemodels drive the flexible execution of the final mobile app on target mobile devices.

A Framework for Mining and Querying Summarized XML Data through Tree-Based Association Rules,Mirjana Mazuran; Elisa Quintarelli; Angelo Rauseo; Letizia Tanca,ABSTRACT The massive amount of datasets expressed in different formats; such asrelational; XML; and RDF; available in several real applications; may cause some difficultiesto non-expert users trying to access these datasets without having sufficient knowledge ontheir content and structure. Moreover; the processes of query composition; especially in theabsence of a schema; and interpretation of the obtained answers may be non-trivial. Datamining techniques; already widely applied to extract frequent correlations of values fromboth structured and semistructured datasets; provide several interesting solutions forknowledge elicitation. However; the mining process is often guided by the designer; whodetermines the portion of a dataset where useful patterns can be extracted based on his/herdeep knowledge of the application scenario.

Semantic-enriched data mining techniques for intensional service representation,Devis Bianchini; Paolo Garza; Elisa Quintarelli,Abstract The adoption of Web service technologies to enable collaboration in distributedenvironments has been made possible by the availability of huge amount of servicerepositories; that; if not properly controlled; leads to information overload rather thanfacilitating collaboration. Data mining provides well known exploratory techniques to extractrelevant and frequent information from data repositories. This paper presents a preliminaryeffort to apply data mining algorithms to service repositories; to properly extract usefulinformation about services.

Mining Tree-based Schema Patterns from XML documents,M Mazuran; E Quintarelli,Abstract The high number of XML datasets available to casual users increases the necessityof investigating algorithms to extract knowledge from these data. Data mining is widelyapplied in the database research area in order to extract frequent correlations of values fromboth structured and semi-structured datasets. In this work we describe an approach to minetree-based association rules from XML documens providing information on their structure.The mined rules can be stored in XML format and used later on in order to gain knowledgeabout the structure of most frequent subtrees of XML datasets. In particular; the associationrules can be used to provide:(i) quick; approximate answers to some queries and (ii)information about structural regularities that can be used as Dataguides for documentquerying.,Conference of the Italian Chapter of AIS,2008,*
Using mined patterns for XML Query Answering,Elena Baralis; Paolo Garza; Elisa Quintarelli; Letizia Tanca,Abstract XML is a rather verbose representation of semistructured data; which may requirehuge amounts of storage space. Several summarized representations of XML data havebeen proposed; which can both provide succinct information and be directly queried. In thischapter we focus on compact representations based on the extraction of association rulesfrom XML datasets. In particular; we show how patterns can be exploited to (possiblypartially) answer queries; either when fast (and approximate) answers are required; or whenthe actual dataset is not available; eg; it is currently unreachable. We focus on (a) schemapatterns; representing exact or approximate dataset constraints;(b) instance patterns; whichrepresent actual data summaries; and their use for answering queries.,*,2008,*
Final report on the methodology: Context-based data tailoring through view composition,C Bolchini; E Quintarelli; R Rossato; L Tanca,This document presents the methodology for designing context-driven views; to support theautomatic selection and interpretation of the shared resources to be imported to the devicesof different peers in a sematic community. Besides selecting and semantically integrating themost appropriate resources provided by the various peers; thus reducing the “knowledgenoise” produced by the large amount of available information; it will be the special goal ofsuch techniques to obey the constraint imposed by the device context. Indeed the widespread of portable devices; with limited resources such as computational power; battery lifeand memory; poses a quest for applications able to manage the most interesting data;keeping on board only the (small) portion that–in that moment–the user wants.

The scenario is that of anexisting semantic community; sharing data and services among peers; with the support of acontext-aware methodology for identifying the interesting portion of data; the aim is that ofenabling the peers to make queries that are as precise as possible in order to limitcommunication costs; to reduce the amount of data to be stored; and discarding possiblynon-interesting information. Furthermore; considering the transient character of P2Pcommunities; peers are also interested in locally caching information that may be useful atlater times; when no data exchange will be possible; in such a situation; the capability is …,*,2006,*

4. Temporal Aspects of Semistructured Data,Elisa Quintarelli,Abstract In Chapter 3 we proposed a method based on model-checking techniques toefficiently solve (graphical) queries on semistructured data. However; it is known that model-checking has emerged in the past years as a promising and powerful approach to automaticverification of systems [27; 73; 28]; and is especially used to verify temporal properties;which are usually expressed by means of temporal logics formulae; on reactive systems.Thus; as natural consequence of the temporal logic nature; in this chapter we want to adaptthe technique introduced for accessing static information stored in graphical databases; toretrieve temporal aspects of semistructured data as well; such as; for example; the evolutionof properties related to semistructured data.,*,2004,*

Conclusion,Elisa Quintarelli,Abstract In this work we have proposed a method to provide suitable graph-based semanticsto languages for semistructured data; supporting both data structure variability andtopological similarities between queries and document structures.

3. Model-Checking Based Data Retrieval,Elisa Quintarelli,Abstract As we said in the previous chapters; semistructured data are often represented byusing data models based on directed labeled graphs [13; 84; 18]; users can retrieveinformation of interest with graph-based queries [50; 33; 81] or with extended SQLlanguages [12; 4; 16]. In both cases; the data retrieval activity requires the development ofgraph algorithms. In fact; queries (graphical or not) are expected to extract information storedin labeled graphs. In order to do that; it is required to perform a kind of matching of the “querygraph” with the “database instance graph”. More in detail; we need to find subgraphs of theinstance of the database that are somehow similar to the query graph. In Chapter 2 we haveshown that even if the problem of establishing whether two graphs are bisimilar or not ispolynomial time [60; 79]; the task of finding subgraphs isomorphic or bisimilar is NP …,*,2004,*

However; it is well known that verifying atemporal logic formula against a model; in particular finding all the system states that verifythe formula; is in general a computationally hard problem. Moreover; model checking isusually applied to programs that consist of several concurrent processes; and thus; thenumber of states representing the whole programs behaviour may grow exponentially in thenumber of concurrent processes.
