Clustering support for static concept location in source code,Giuseppe Scanniello; Andrian Marcus,One of the most common comprehension activities undertaken by developers is conceptlocation in source code. In the context of software change; concept location means findinglocations in source code where changes are to be made in response to a modificationrequest. Static techniques for concept location usually rely on searching the source codeusing textual information or on navigating the dependencies among software elements. Inthis paper we propose a novel static concept location technique; which leverages both thetextual information present in the code and the structural dependencies between sourcecode elements. The technique employs a textual search in that source code; which isclustered using the Border Flow algorithm; based on combining both structural and textualdata. We evaluated the technique against a text search based baseline approach using …,Program Comprehension (ICPC); 2011 IEEE 19th International Conference on,2011,64
Developing legacy system migration methods and tools for technology transfer,Andrea De Lucia; Rita Francese; Giuseppe Scanniello; Genoveffa Tortora,Abstract This paper presents the research results of an ongoing technology transfer projectcarried out in cooperation between the University of Salerno and a small software company.The project is aimed at developing and transferring migration technology to the industrialpartner. The partner should be enabled to migrate monolithic multi-user COBOL legacysystems to a multi-tier Web-based architecture. The assessment of the legacy systems of thepartner company revealed that these systems had a very low level of decomposability withspaghetti-like code and embedded control flow and database accesses within the userinterface descriptions. For this reason; it was decided to adopt an incremental migrationstrategy based on the reengineering of the user interface using Web technology; on thetransformation of interactive legacy programs into batch programs; and the wrapping of …,Software: Practice and Experience,2008,59
Investigating the use of lexical information for software system clustering,Anna Corazza; Sergio Di Martino; Valerio Maggio; Giuseppe Scanniello,Developers have a lot of freedom in writing comments as well as in choosing identifiers andmethod names. These are intentional in nature and provide a different relevance ofinformation to understand what a software system implements; and in particular the role ofeach source file. In this paper we investigate the effectiveness of exploiting lexicalinformation for software system clustering. In particular we explore the contribution of thecombined use of six different dictionaries; corresponding to the six parts of the source codewhere programmers introduce lexical information; namely: class; attribute; method andparameter names; comments; and source code statements. Their relevance has beenweighted by means of a probabilistic model; whose parameters have been estimated by theExpectation-Maximization algorithm. To group source files accordingly we used a …,Software Maintenance and Reengineering (CSMR); 2011 15th European Conference on,2011,58
Evaluating legacy system migration technologies through empirical studies,Massimo Colosimo; Andrea De Lucia; Giuseppe Scanniello; Genoveffa Tortora,Abstract We present two controlled experiments conducted with master students andpractitioners and a case study conducted with practitioners to evaluate the use of MELIS(Migration Environment for Legacy Information Systems) for the migration of legacy COBOLprograms to the web. MELIS has been developed as an Eclipse plug-in within a technologytransfer project conducted with a small software company [16]. The partner company hasdeveloped and marketed in the last 30 years several COBOL systems that need to bemigrated to the web; due to the increasing requests of the customers. The goal of thetechnology transfer project was to define a systematic migration strategy and the supportingtools to migrate these COBOL systems to the web and make the partner company an ownerof the developed technology.

Assessing the effectiveness of sequence diagrams in the comprehension of functional requirements: Results from a family of five experiments,Silvia Abrahao; Carmine Gravino; Emilio Insfran; Giuseppe Scanniello; Genoveffa Tortora,Modeling is a fundamental activity within the requirements engineering process andconcerns the construction of abstract descriptions of requirements that are amenable tointerpretation and validation. The choice of a modeling technique is critical whenever it isnecessary to discuss the interpretation and validation of requirements. This is particularlytrue in the case of functional requirements and stakeholders with divergent goals anddifferent backgrounds and experience. This paper presents the results of a family ofexperiments conducted with students and professionals to investigate whether thecomprehension of functional requirements is influenced by the use of dynamic models thatare represented by means of the UML sequence diagrams. The family contains fiveexperiments performed in different locations and with 112 participants of different abilities …,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,2013,42
A probabilistic based approach towards software system clustering,Anna Corazza; Sergio Di Martino; Giuseppe Scanniello,In this paper we present a clustering based approach to partition software systems intomeaningful subsystems. In particular; the approach uses lexical information extracted fromfour zones in Java classes; which may provide a different contribution towards softwaresystems partitioning. To automatically weigh these zones; we introduced a probabilisticmodel; and applied the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. To group classesaccording to the considered lexical information; we customized the well-known K-Medoidsalgorithm. To assess the approach and the implemented supporting system; we haveconducted a case study on six open source software systems.,Software Maintenance and Reengineering (CSMR); 2010 14th European Conference on,2010,41
Using the kleinberg algorithm and vector space model for software system clustering,Giuseppe Scanniello; Anna D'Amico; Carmela D'Amico; Teodora D'Amico,Clustering based approaches are generally difficult to use in practice since they need asignificant human interaction for recovering software architectures; are conceived for aspecific programming language; and very often do not use design knowledge (eg; theimplemented architectural model). In this paper we present a clustering based approach torecover the implemented architecture of software systems with a hierarchical structure andimplemented with any object oriented programming language. The approach is based onthe combination of structural and lexical dimensions. The structural dimension is used todecompose a software system into layers (ie; horizontal decomposition); while the lexicaldimension is then employed to partition each layer (ie; vertical decomposition) into softwaremodules. Layers are identified using a well known and widely employed link analysis …,Program Comprehension (ICPC); 2010 IEEE 18th International Conference on,2010,39
On the effectiveness of screen mockups in requirements engineering: results from an internal replication,Filippo Ricca; Giuseppe Scanniello; Marco Torchiano; Gianna Reggio; Egidio Astesiano,Abstract In this paper; we present and discuss the results of an internal replication of acontrolled experiment for assessing the effectiveness of including screen mockups whenadopting Use Cases. The results of the original experiment indicate a clear improvement interms of understandability of functional requirements when screen mockups are present withno significant impact on effort. The data analysis of the replication; conducted also in thiscase with undergraduate students; confirms the results of the original experiment with slightdifferences; thus confirming that screen mockups facilitate the understanding ofrequirements without influencing the effort. We also sketch here some issues related to thedocumentation and communication between experimenters.,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM-IEEE international symposium on empirical software engineering and measurement,2010,35
Class level fault prediction using software clustering,Giuseppe Scanniello; Carmine Gravino; Andrian Marcus; Tim Menzies,Abstract Defect prediction approaches use software metrics and fault data to learn whichsoftware properties associate with faults in classes. Existing techniques predict fault-proneclasses in the same release (intra) or in a subsequent releases (inter) of a subject softwaresystem. We propose an intra-release fault prediction technique; which learns from clusters ofrelated classes; rather than from the entire system. Classes are clustered using structuralinformation and fault prediction models are built using the properties of the classes in eachcluster. We present an empirical investigation on data from 29 releases of eight open sourcesoftware systems from the PROMISE repository; with predictors built using multivariate linearregression. The results indicate that the prediction models built on clusters outperform thosebuilt on all the classes of the system.,Proceedings of the 28th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering,2013,34
Reengineering web applications based on cloned pattern analysis,Andrea De Lucia; Rita Francese; Giuseppe Scanniello; Genoveffa Tortora,Web applications are subject to continuous and rapid evolution. Often it happens thatprogrammers indiscriminately duplicate Web pages without considering systematicdevelopment and maintenance methods. This practice creates code clones that make Webapplications hard to maintain and reuse. This paper presents an approach for reengineeringWeb applications based on clone analysis that aims at identifying and generalizing staticand dynamic pages and navigational patterns of a Web application. Clone analysis is alsohelpful for identifying literals that can be generated from a database. A case study isdescribed which shows how the proposed approach can be used for restructuring thenavigational structure of a Web application by removing redundant code.,Program Comprehension; 2004.

These technical infrastructuresallow us to extend the system with new services as well as to integrate and reuseheterogeneous software e-learning components. Moreover; they let us better support the"anytime and anywhere" learning paradigm. As a matter of fact; the proposal provides animplementation of the run-time environment suggested in the sharable content objectreference model (SCORM) to trace learning processes; which is also suitable for mobilelearning.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT],International Journal of Distance Education Technologies,2007,31

On the impact of UML analysis models on source-code comprehensibility and modifiability,Giuseppe Scanniello; Carmine Gravino; Marcela Genero; Jose'A Cruz-Lemus; Genoveffa Tortora,Abstract We carried out a family of experiments to investigate whether the use of UMLmodels produced in the requirements analysis process helps in the comprehensibility andmodifiability of source code. The family consists of a controlled experiment and 3 externalreplications carried out with students and professionals from Italy and Spain. 86 participantswith different abilities and levels of experience with UML took part. The results of theexperiments were integrated through the use of meta-analysis. The results of both theindividual experiments and meta-analysis indicate that UML models produced in therequirements analysis process influence neither the comprehensibility of source code nor itsmodifiability.,ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM),2014,27
A strategy and an Eclipse based environment for the migration of legacy systems to multi-tier web-based architectures,Andrea De Lucia; Rita Francese; Giuseppe Scanniello; Genoveffa Tortora; Nicola Vitiello,We present an incremental approach to the migration of non decomposable COBOLapplications to a Web-enabled multi-tier architecture. The relevant software components ofthe target architecture; namely the communication middleware and the generator ofgraphical user interfaces; are developed once for all in order to reduce the migration effort.An Eclipse plug-in has also been developed to support the software engineer in themigration of the graphical user interface and in the restructuring and wrapping of the originallegacy code. A pilot project on a COBOL legacy system evolved during the last thirty yearshas been used to experiment the migration strategy and the plug-in,Software Maintenance; 2006.

Understanding cloned patterns in web applications,Andrea De Lucia; Rita Francese; Giuseppe Scanniello; Genoveffa Tortora,We propose a tool to identify and analyze cloned patterns in Web applications using cloneanalysis and clustering of static and dynamic Web pages. The tool first detects clonedpages; which are then grouped into clusters as well as the groups of links between clusters.In this way the navigational schema is simplified and the duplicated functionalitiescorresponding to cloned navigational patterns can be more easily analyzed. The tool alsoallows filtering out uninteresting parts of the restructured navigational schema; thus to furtherimprove the understanding.,Program Comprehension; 2005. IWPC 2005.

Architecture recovery using latent semantic indexing and k-means: an empirical evaluation,Michele Risi; Giuseppe Scanniello; Genoveffa Tortora,A number of clustering based approaches and tools have been proposed in the past topartition a software system into subsystems. The greater part of these approaches issemiautomatic; thus requiring human decision to identify the best partition of softwareentities into clusters among the possible partitions. In addition; some approaches areconceived for software systems implemented using a particular programming language (eg;C and C++). In this paper we present an approach to automate the partitioning of a givensoftware system into subsystems. In particular; the approach first analyzes the softwareentities (eg; programs or classes) and then using Latent Semantic Indexing the dissimilaritybetween these entities is computed. Finally; software entities are grouped using iterativelythe k-means clustering algorithm. The approach has been implemented in a prototype of …,Software Engineering and Formal Methods (SEFM); 2010 8th IEEE International Conference on,2010,21

Assessing the usability of a visual tool for the definition of e-learning processes,Gennaro Costagliola; Andrea De Lucia; Filomena Ferrucci; Carmine Gravino; Giuseppe Scanniello,Abstract In this paper; we present a usability study aiming at assessing a visual language-based tool for developing adaptive e-learning processes. The tool implements the adaptiveself-consistent learning object SET (ASCLO-S) visual language; a special case of flowdiagrams; to be used by instructional designers to define classes of learners throughstereotypes and to specify the more suited adaptive learning process for each class oflearners. The usability study is based on the combined use of two techniques: aquestionnaire-based survey and an empirical analysis. The survey has been used toachieve feedbacks from the subjects' point of view. In particular; it has been useful to capturethe perceived usability of the subjects.

Clustering algorithms and latent semantic indexing to identify similar pages in web applications,Andrea De Lucia; Michele Risi; Genoveffa Tortora; Giuseppe Scanniello,In this paper; we analyze some clustering algorithms that have been widely employed in thepast to support the comprehension of Web applications. To this end; we have defined anapproach to identify static pages that are duplicated or cloned at the content level. Thisapproach is based on a process that first computes the dissimilarity between Web pagesusing latent semantic indexing; a well known information retrieval technique; and thengroups similar pages using clustering algorithms. We consider five instances of this process;each based on three variants of the agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm; adivisive clustering algorithm; k-means partitional clustering algorithm; and a widelyemployed partitional competitive clustering algorithm; namely Winner Takes All. In order toassess the proposed approach; we have used the static pages of three Web applications …,Web Site Evolution; 2007. WSE 2007. 9th IEEE International Workshop on,2007,20
A multi-objective technique to prioritize test cases based on latent semantic indexing,Md Mahfuzul Islam; Alessandro Marchetto; Angelo Susi; Giuseppe Scanniello,To early discover faults in source code; test case ordering has to be properly chosen. To thisaim test prioritization techniques can be used. Several of these techniques leave out theexecution cost of test cases and exploit a single objective function (eg; code or requirementscoverage). In this paper; we present a multi-objective test prioritization technique thatdetermines sequences of test cases that maximize the number of discovered faults that areboth technical and business critical. The technique uses the information related to the codeand requirements coverage; as well as the execution cost of each test case. The approachalso uses recovered trace ability links among source code and system requirements via theLatent Semantic Indexing technique. We evaluated our proposal against both a randomprioritization technique and two single-objective prioritization techniques on two Java …,Software Maintenance and Reengineering (CSMR); 2012 16th European Conference on,2012,19
Assessing communication media richness in requirements negotiation,Ugo Erra; Giuseppe Scanniello,A critical claim in software requirements negotiation regards the assertion that groupperformances improve when a medium with different richness level is used. Accordingly; theauthors have conducted a study to compare traditional face-to-face communication; therichest medium and two less rich communication media; namely a distributed three-dimensional virtual environment and a text-based structured chat. This comparison hasbeen performed with respect to the time needed to accomplish a negotiation. Furthermore;as the only assessment of the time could not be meaningful; the authors have also analysedthe media effect on the issues arisen in the negotiation process and the quality of thenegotiated software requirements.,IET software,2010,19
Identifying similar pages in web applications using a competitive clustering algorithm,Andrea De Lucia; Giuseppe Scanniello; Genoveffa Tortora,Abstract We present an approach based on Winner Takes All (WTA); a competitiveclustering algorithm; to support the comprehension of static and dynamic Web applicationsduring Web application reengineering. This approach adopts a process that first computesthe distance between Web pages and then identifies and groups similar pages using theconsidered clustering algorithm. We present an instance of application of the clusteringprocess to identify similar pages at the structural level. The page structure is encoded into astring of HTML tags and then the distance between Web pages at the structural level iscomputed using the Levenshtein string edit distance algorithm. A prototype to automate theclustering process has been implemented that can be extended to other instances of theprocess; such as the identification of groups of similar pages at content level.

MetricAttitude: a visualization tool for the reverse engineering of object oriented software,Michele Risi; Giuseppe Scanniello,Abstract In this paper; we present a visualization approach for the reverse engineering ofobject-oriented (OO) software systems and its implementation in MetricAttitude; an EclipseRich Client Platform application. The goal of our proposal is to ease both the comprehensionof a subject system and the identification of fault-prone classes. The approach graphicallyrepresents a suite of object-oriented design metrics (eg; Weighted Methods per Class) and"traditional" code-size metrics (eg; Lines Of Code). To assess the validity of MetricAttitudeand its underlying approach; we have conducted a case study on the framework Eclipse 3.5.The study has provided indications about the tool scalability; interactivity; and completeness.The results also suggest that our proposal can be successfully used in the identification offault-prone classes.,Proceedings of the International Working Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces,2012,17

The greater part ofthese studies are quantitative and fail to analyze the values; beliefs; and assumptions thatinform and shape source code comprehensibility and maintainability. We designed andconducted a qualitative study to understand the role of source code comments andidentifiers in source code comprehensibility and maintainability. In particular; we sought tounderstand how novice and young professional developers perceive comments andidentifier names after they have inspected the system behavior visible in its user interfaces.Novice developers were 18 third-year Bachelor students in Computer Science.

On the effort of augmenting use cases with screen mockups: results from a preliminary empirical study,Filippo Ricca; Giuseppe Scanniello; Marco Torchiano; Gianna Reggio; Egidio Astesiano,Abstract In order to increase stakeholders' comprehension on software requirements; UseCases can be enhanced with screen mock-ups (ie; GUI prototypes sketched with a specialconceived graphical tool). However; the effort to write Use Cases augmented with screenmockups may increase; thus not justifying their adoption in the requirements engineeringprocess. In this paper we present a preliminary empirical study to assess the effort needed todevelop screen mockups. We first computed the time to define and design screen mockupsand then we collected the subjects' perceptions about the effort to build them. Additionally;we collected also the subjects' perceptions about the tool used to produce screen mockups.The results indicate that the subjects:(i) perceive screen mockups construction as a non-onerous activity;(ii) believe that this activity requires a low effort as compared to the …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM-IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement,2010,16
Identifying cloned navigational patterns in web applications,Andrea De Lucia; Rita Francese; Giuseppe Scanniello; Genoveffa Tortora,Abstract Web Applications are subject to continuous and rapid evolution. Often programmersindiscriminately duplicate Web pages without considering systematic development andmaintenance methods. This practice creates code clones that make Web Applications hardto maintain and reuse. We present an approach to identify duplicated functionalities in WebApplications through cloned navigational pattern analysis. Cloned patterns can begeneralized in a reengineering process; thus to simplify the structure and futuremaintenance of the Web Applications. The proposed method first identifies pairs of clonedpages by analyzing similarity at structure; content; and scripting code. Two pages areconsidered clones if their similarity is greater than a given threshold. Cloned pages are thengrouped into clusters and the links connecting pages of two clusters are grouped too.

Source code survival with the Kaplan Meier,Giuseppe Scanniello,The presence of dead code may affect the comprehensibility; the readability; and the size ofsource code so increasing the effort and the cost for maintenance. The elimination of deadcode needs a huge cost and effort for recognizing and eliminating code that is not effectivelyused. The goal of this work consists in defining an approach based on the Kaplan Meierestimator to analyze dead code. The validity of the approach has been preliminarilyassessed on a case study constituted of fifty-eight versions of five open source softwaresystems implemented in Java. The results suggested that two out of the five systems whereimplemented avoiding as much as possible the introduction of dead code.,Software Maintenance (ICSM); 2011 27th IEEE International Conference on,2011,15

Link analysis algorithms for static concept location: an empirical assessment,Giuseppe Scanniello; Andrian Marcus; Daniele Pascale,Abstract During software evolution; one of the most important comprehension activities isconcept location in source code; as it identifies the places in the code where changes are tobe made in response to a modification request. Change requests (such as; bug fixing or newfeature requests) are usually formulated in natural language; while the source code alsoincludes large amounts of text. In consequence; many of the existing concept locationtechniques are based on text search or text retrieval. Such approaches reformulate conceptlocation as a document retrieval problem. We refine and improve such solutions byleveraging dependencies between source code elements. Dependency information is usedby a link analysis algorithm to rank the document space and to improve concept locationbased on text retrieval. We implemented our solution to concept location using the …,Empirical Software Engineering,2015,14

Using fold-in and fold-out in the architecture recovery of software systems,Michele Risi; Giuseppe Scanniello; Genoveffa Tortora,Abstract In this paper we present an approach to automate the architecture recovery processof software systems. The approach is built on information retrieval and clustering techniques;and; in particular; uses Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) to get similarities among softwareentities (eg; programs or classes) and the k-means clustering algorithm to form groups ofsoftware entities that implement similar functionality. In order to improve computational timein the context of the software evolution and then reduce energy waste; the architecturerecovery process can be also applied by using fold-in and fold-out mechanisms that;respectively; add and remove software entities to the LSI representation of the understudysoftware system.

A system for visual role-based policy modelling,Massimiliano Giordano; Giuseppe Polese; Giuseppe Scanniello; Genoveffa Tortora,Abstract The definition of security policies in information systems and programmingapplications is often accomplished through traditional low level languages that are difficult touse. This is a remarkable drawback if we consider that security policies are often specifiedand maintained by top level enterprise managers who would probably prefer to usesimplified; metaphor oriented policy management tools. To support all the different kinds ofusers we propose a suite of visual languages to specify access and security policiesaccording to the role based access control (RBAC) model. Moreover; a system implementingthe proposed visual languages is proposed. The system provides a set of tools to enable auser to visually edit security policies and to successively translate them into (eXtensibleAccess Control Markup Language) code; which can be managed by a Policy Based …,Journal of Visual Languages & Computing,2010,14
Using semantic clustering to enhance the navigation structure of web sites,Giuseppe Scanniello; Damiano Distante; Michele Risi,This paper presents an automatic approach based on semantic clustering to enhance thenavigation structure of Web sites. The approach extends the navigation structure of a Website by introducing a set of links that enable the navigation from each page of the site to otherpages showing similar or related content. The approach uses Latent Semantic Indexing tocompute a dissimilarity measure between the pages of the site and a Graph-Theoreticclustering algorithm to group pages having similar or related content. The additional linksconnecting each page of the site to the others within the same cluster are dynamicallyinjected into each page by using AJAX code. A prototype of a supporting tool and the resultsfrom a case study conducted to assess the feasibility of the approach are also presented.,Web Site Evolution; 2008.

Only a few empirical investigations have been conducted to assesswhether the kind of documentation for design patterns implemented in source code affectsits comprehensibility. To investigate this aspect; we conducted a family of four controlledexperiments with 88 participants having different experience (ie; professionals andBachelor; Master; and PhD students). In each experiment; the participants were divided intothree groups and asked to comprehend a nontrivial chunk of an open-source softwaresystem. Depending on the group; each participant was; or was not; provided with graphicalor textual representations of the design patterns implemented within the source code.

A replication in the context of source code comprehension,Carmine Gravino; Michele Risi; Giuseppe Scanniello; Genoveffa Tortora,Abstract We present the results of a differentiated replication conducted with professionaldevelopers to assess whether the presence and the kind of documentation for the solutionsor instances of design patterns affect source code comprehension. The participants weredivided into three groups and asked to comprehend a chunk of the JHot-Draw source code.Depending on the group; each participant was or not provided with the graphical and textualrepresentations of the design pattern instances implemented within that source code. In thecase of graphically documented instances; we used UML class diagrams; while textuallydocumented instances are reported as comment in the source code. The results revealedthat participants provided with the documentation of the instances achieved a significantlybetter comprehension than the participants with source code alone. The effect of the kind …,International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems,2012,13
A tree kernel based approach for clone detection,Anna Corazza; Sergio Di Martino; Valerio Maggio; Giuseppe Scanniello,Reusing software by copying and pasting is a common practice in software development.This phenomenon is widely known as code cloning. Problems with clones are mainly due tothe need of managing each duplication; thus increasing the effort to maintain softwaresystems. Clone detection approaches generally take into account either the syntacticstructure (eg; Abstract Syntax Tree) or lexical elements (eg; the signature of a function). Inthis paper we propose an approach to detect code clones; based on syntactic informationenriched by lexical elements. To this end; we have defined a Tree Kernel function tocompare Abstract Syntax Trees. A preliminary investigation has been also conducted toassess the validity of the proposed approach.,Software Maintenance (ICSM); 2010 IEEE International Conference on,2010,13
Does the documentation of design pattern instances impact on source code comprehension? Results from two controlled experiments,Carmine Gravino; Michele Risi; Giuseppe Scanniello; Genoveffa Tortora,We present the results of a controlled experiment and a differentiated replication that havebeen carried out to assess the effect of the documentation of design patterns on thecomprehension of source code. The two experiments involved Master Students in ComputerScience at the University of Basilicas a and at University of Salerno; respectively. Theparticipants to the original experiment performed a comprehension task with and withoutgraphically-documented design patterns. Textually documented design patterns wereprovided or not to the participants to perform a comprehension task within the replication.The data analysis revealed that participants employing graphically documented designpatterns achieved significantly better performances than the participants provided withsource code alone. Conversely; the effect of textually documented design patterns was …,Reverse Engineering (WCRE); 2011 18th Working Conference on,2011,12
Precise vs. ultra-light activity diagrams-an experimental assessment in the context of business process modelling,Francesco Di Cerbo; Gabriella Dodero; Gianna Reggio; Filippo Ricca; Giuseppe Scanniello,Abstract UML activity diagrams are a commonly used notation for modelling businessprocesses in the field of both workflow automation and requirements engineering. In thispaper; we present a novel precise style for this notation. Further; the effectiveness of thisstyle has been investigated in the context of the modelling of business processes through acontrolled experiment conducted with master students in Computer Science at the FreeUniversity of Bolzano-Bozen. The results indicate that the subjects achieved a significantlybetter comprehension level when business processes are modelled using the precise stylewith respect to a “lighter” variant; with no significant impact on the effort to accomplish thetasks.,International Conference on Product Focused Software Process Improvement,2011,12
An approach for architectural layer recovery,Giuseppe Scanniello; Anna D'Amico; Carmela D'Amico; Teodora D'Amico,Abstract In this paper we present an approach to identify software layers for theunderstanding and evolution of object oriented software systems. The approach firstidentifies relations between the classes and then uses the Kleinberg algorithm to groupthem into layers. Additionally to assess the approach and the underlying techniques; thepaper also presents a prototype of a supporting tool to identify layers within Java softwaresystems. To assess the feasibility of both the approach and the system prototype; the resultsfrom a case study conducted on an open source Java software system are presented anddiscussed.,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2010,11
Inferring links between concerns and methods with multi-abstraction vector space model,Yun Zhang; David Lo; Xin Xia; Tien-Duy B Le; Giuseppe Scanniello; Jianling Sun,Concern localization refers to the process of locating code units that match a particulartextual description. It takes as input textual documents such as bug reports and featurerequests and outputs a list of candidate code units that are relevant to the bug reports orfeature requests. Many information retrieval (IR) based concern localization techniques havebeen proposed in the literature. These techniques typically represent code units and textualdescriptions as a bag of tokens at one level of abstraction; eg; each token is a word; or eachtoken is a topic. In this work; we propose a multi-abstraction concern localization techniquenamed MULAB. MULAB represents a code unit and a textual description at multipleabstraction levels. Similarity of a textual description and a code unit is now made byconsidering all these abstraction levels. We combine a vector space model and multiple …,Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME); 2016 IEEE International Conference on,2016,10
Weighing lexical information for software clustering in the context of architecture recovery,Anna Corazza; Sergio Di Martino; Valerio Maggio; Giuseppe Scanniello,Abstract In this paper; we present a software clustering approach that leverages theinformation conveyed by the zone in which each lexeme appears in the classes of objectoriented systems. We define six zones in the source code: Class Name; Attribute Name;Method Name; Parameter Name; Comment; and Source Code Statement. These zones mayconvey information with different levels of relevance; and so their contribution should bedifferently weighed according to the software system under study. To this aim; we define aprobabilistic model of the lexemes distribution whose parameters are automaticallyestimated by the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. The weights of the zones are thenexploited to compute similarities among source code classes; which are then grouped by a k-Medoid clustering algorithm. To assess the validity of our solution in the software …,Empirical Software Engineering,2016,10
Using Project-Based-Learning in a mobile application development course—An experience report,Rita Francese; Carmine Gravino; Michele Risi; Giuseppe Scanniello; Genoveffa Tortora,Abstract In this paper; we report the experience gained in a Mobile Application Developmentcourse. We involved students in Computer Science at the University of Salerno; who inteams had to conduct a project. The goal of this project was to design and developapplications (or simply app) for Android-based devices. The adopted teaching approachwas based on Project-Based-Learning and enhanced collaboration and competition.Collaboration took place among members of the same team (intra-team); while competitionamong different teams of students (extra-team).

On the effect of using SysML requirement diagrams to comprehend requirements: results from two controlled experiments,Giuseppe Scanniello; Miroslaw Staron; Håkan Burden; Rogardt Heldal,Abstract We carried out a controlled experiment and an external replication to investigatewhether the use of requirement diagrams of the System Modeling Language (SysML) helpsin the comprehensibility of requirements. The original experiment was conducted at theUniversity of Basilicata in Italy with Bachelor students; while its replication was executed atthe University of Gothenburg in Sweden with Bachelor and Master students. A total of 87participants took part in the experiment and its replication. The achieved results indicatedthat the comprehension of requirements is statistically significant when requirementsspecification documents include requirement diagrams without any impact on the time toaccomplish comprehension tasks. On the basis of our results; we also present and discusspossible implications from the practitioner and researcher perspectives.,Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering,2014,10
Towards the visualization of software systems as 3D forests: the codetrees environment,Ugo Erra; Giuseppe Scanniello,Abstract We present an approach based on a forest metaphor to ease the comprehension ofobject oriented software systems. Software systems are represented as forests of trees thatusers can navigate and interact with. We also describe here the mapping of the informationof the source code in meaningful ways to take advantages of familiar concepts such asagglomerates of trees (or sub-forest); trunk; branches; leaves; and color of the leaves. Theapproach has been implemented in a prototype of a 3D environment; namely CodeTrees. Toassess the validity of the approach and environment; we have also conducted a preliminaryempirical evaluation on three open source software systems implemented in theprogramming languages Java and C++.,Proceedings of the 27th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2012,10
An empirical investigation on the relation between analysis models and source code comprehension,Carmine Gravino; Genoveffa Tortora; Giuseppe Scanniello,Abstract This paper presents a controlled experiment to investigate whether thecomprehension of source code increases in case novice software engineers use abstractsoftware models produced in the early phase of the software development; ie; requirementsanalysis. The study has revealed that there is not significant difference in the comprehensionof source code achieved by using or not abstract software models.,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2010,10
Concurrent fine-grained versioning of UML models,Andrea De Lucia; Fausto Fasano; Giuseppe Scanniello; Genoveffa Tortora,Concurrent versioning of source code is a common and well-established practice to manageconcurrency and consistency within source code repository. With the growing complexity ofnowadays software systems; the need for high level representations of the system todevelop becomes inevitable. These software models evolve together with the softwaresystem; thus requiring versioning management. Moreover; software models are often theresult of cooperative work by different software engineers; that need to update them evenconcurrently. Unfortunately; the available concurrent versioning tools; do not provide anadequate support for this type of software artifacts. We propose a solution to manageversioning and concurrency for software models (in particular; UML models); that consists ofa fine-grained concurrent modeling approach. The approach has been implemented and …,Software Maintenance and Reengineering; 2009. CSMR'09. 13th European Conference on,2009,10
Using a competitive clustering algorithm to comprehend web applications,Andrea De Lucia; Giuseppe Scanniello; Genoveffa Tortora,We propose an approach based on winner takes all; a competitive clustering algorithm; tosupport the comprehension of static and dynamic Web applications. The process firstcomputes the distances between the Web pages and then identifies similar pages throughthe winner takes all clustering algorithm. Two different instances of the process arepresented to identify similar pages at structural and content level; respectively. The firstinstance encodes the page structure into a string and then uses the Levenshtein algorithm toachieve the distances between pairs of pages. On the other hand; to group similar pages atcontent level we use the latent semantic indexing to produce the page representations asvectors in the concept space. The Euclidean distance is then computed between the vectorsto achieve the distances between the pages to be given as input to the adopted clustering …,Web Site Evolution; 2006. WSE'06.

Visual languages for defining adaptive and collaborative e-learning activities,Giovanni Casella; Gennaro Costagliola; Filomena Ferrucci; Giuseppe Polese; Giuseppe Scanniello,ABSTRACT In order to support instructional designers in the creation of distance courses;involving learning contents; collaborative activities; and assessment tests; a suite of visuallanguages are proposed. In particular; we define an extension of UML Activity Diagrams;named eXtended Learning Activity Diagram; to make them suitable for defining e-learningcourses based on e-learning activities. We also propose the Adaptive Self consistentLearning Object SET language for defining learning contents; the SYnchronousCollaborative Learning Environment used to define synchronous and asynchronouslearning environments; and the Test Maker Language for defining assessment and self-assessment tests. The proposed visual languages have been implemented in the SEAMANtool (System for E-learning Activity MANagement) which provides means to fully design …,Proc. IADIS Int’l Conf.: e-Soc,2004,10
On the use of requirements measures to predict software project and product measures in the context of android mobile apps: a preliminary study,Rita Francese; Carmine Gravino; Michele Risi; Giuseppe Scanniello; Genoveffa Tortora,In this paper; we study the value of software project and product measures in the context ofAndroid mobile apps. In particular; we focus on the effort to develop mobile apps and thenumber of graphical components in these apps. Estimation models are based on informationfrom requirements specification documents (eg; Number of actors; number of use cases; andnumber of classes). We have used a dataset containing information on 23 Android apps andemployed a stepwise linear regression to build estimation models. The predictions havebeen compared with those obtained considering models built on software measures (eg;Number of classes; number of files; and number of line of code). The results suggest that themeasures from the artifacts produced in requirements engineering process are not worsepredictors than those measures from source code. That is; requirements measures can …,Software Engineering and Advanced Applications (SEAA); 2015 41st Euromicro Conference on,2015,9

A precise style for business process modelling: Results from two controlled experiments,Gianna Reggio; Filippo Ricca; Giuseppe Scanniello; Francesco Di Cerbo; Gabriella Dodero,Abstract We present a precise style for the modelling of business processes based on theUML activity diagrams and two controlled experiments to compare this style with a lightervariant. The comparison has been performed with respect to the comprehensibility ofbusiness processes and the effort to comprehend them. The first experiment has beenconducted at the Free University of Bolzano-Bozen; while the second experiment (ie; adifferentiated replication) at the University of Genova. The participants to the first experimentwere Master students and so more experienced than the participants to the replication; whowere Bachelor students. The results indicate that:(a) all the participants achieved asignificantly better comprehension level with the precise style;(b) the used style did not haveany significant impact on the effort; and (c) more experienced participants benefited more …,International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems,2011,9
Clustering and lexical information support for the recovery of design pattern in source code,Simone Romano; Giuseppe Scanniello; Michele Risi; Carmine Gravino,We propose an approach that leverages lexical information and fuzzy clustering to reducethe number of the design pattern instances that existing approaches based on structuralinformation (ie; navigating the dependencies among software elements) erroneouslyrecover in source code. To assess the effectiveness of the techniques; we present the resultsof a case study conducted on four open source software systems implemented in java. Thedata analysis indicates that the use of lexical information and fuzzy clustering improves thecorrectness of the results achieved by existing design pattern recovery approaches basedon structural information; while preserving the number of design pattern instances correctlyidentified.,Software Maintenance (ICSM); 2011 27th IEEE International Conference on,2011,9
Dealing with faults in source code: Abbreviated vs. full-word identifier names,Giuseppe Scanniello; Michele Risi,We carried out a controlled experiment to investigate whether the use of abbreviatedidentifier names affects the ability of novice software developers to identify and fix faults insource code. The experiment was conducted with 49 students in Computer Science. Theresults of the statistical analyses indicate that there was not a significant difference to identifyand to fix faults; when source code contains either abbreviated and full-word identifiernames. In other words; it seems that abbreviated identifiers provide the same information asfull-word identifiers on the solution domain and the implementation.,Software Maintenance (ICSM); 2013 29th IEEE International Conference on,2013,8

Comparing two communication media in use case modeling: results from a controlled experiment,Ugo Erra; Ana Portnova; Giuseppe Scanniello,Abstract A critical claim in software requirements regards the assertion that the teamperformances improve when media with higher richness levels are used. To investigate thisclaim; we have conducted a controlled experiment to compare traditional face-to-facecommunication; the richest medium; and a leaner medium; namely an advanced chatimplementing a distributed version of Think-Pair-Square (ie; a well known method forcollaborative problem solving). The comparison has been performed considering the timeneeded to model functional requirements through a use case modeling technique. Since theonly assessment of time could be meaningless; we have also analyzed the media effect onthe quality of the produced use cases. The results indicate a significant difference in terms oftime to model software requirements in favor of face-to-face communication with no …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM-IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement,2010,8
On the effectiveness of dynamic modeling in UML: Results from an external replication,Silvia Abrahao; Emilio Insfran; Carmine Gravino; Giuseppe Scanniello,Abstract This paper describes the results of an external replication of an experiment forassessing whether the use of dynamic modeling influences the comprehension of softwarerequirements. The results of the original experiment conducted in Italy did not confirm thatthere was a significant difference in the comprehension of software requirements whendynamic modeling is used. The goal of the replication was therefore to verify these findingswith a group of more experienced students at the Universidad Politécnica de Valencia (UPV)in Spain. The results shows that the use of dynamic modeling does significantly improve thecomprehension of software requirements; thus providing evidence that dynamic modelingfacilitates the interpretation and comprehension of requirements.,Proceedings of the 2009 3rd International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement,2009,8
COMOVER: Concurrent model versioning,Ivo Barone; Andrea De Lucia; Fausto Fasano; Esterino Rullo; Giuseppe Scanniello; Genoveffa Tortora,Concurrent versioning of source code is a common and well-established practice to manageconcurrency and consistency within source code repository. Similarly to source code;software models are often the result of cooperative work by different software engineers; thatneed to update them even concurrently. Unfortunately; modeling tools rarely provide supportfor concurrency and consistency. On the other hand; the available concurrent versioningtools do not provide an adequate support for software models.

On the effectiveness of the UML object diagrams: A replicated experiment,Giuseppe Scanniello; Filippo Ricca; Marco Torchiano,Background: In the modeling of object oriented software systems; the UML object diagramsare recognized very useful to complement class diagrams. However; up to now; there existsonly one experiment [Torchiano 2004] that investigates this concern. Aim: To confirm orcontradict the findings of the original experiment; we have conducted a replication and theachieved results have been presented in this paper. Both the replication and the originalexperiment have been conducted to investigate whether the use of object diagrams tocomplement class diagrams affects the comprehension of software systems. Method: Thereplication has been conducted with a group of 24 graduated subjects in Computer Scienceof the University of Basilicata. The experiment adopts a counterbalanced design; thusensuring that each subject work on two comprehension tasks; experimenting each time …,IET Conference Proceedings,2011,7
Evaluating distributed inspection through controlled experiments,Andrea De Lucia; Fausto Fasano; Giuseppe Scanniello; Genny Tortora,Inspection methods can be classified according to their discipline and flexibility. Thediscipline concerns the formal aspect of an inspection method; whereas the flexibility isstrongly related to the simplicity of organising and conducting a meeting. The majority of theavailable distributed inspection methods have a high level of discipline and flexibility as theyare based on a well-defined process and the discussion among team members is easilyorganised and conducted. In this study the authors present two controlled experiments toevaluate the effectiveness and the efficacy of a distributed inspection process to discoverdefects within source code. In particular; the first experiment compares the distributedinspection method proposed to a disciplined but not flexible method (ie the Fagan'sinspection process). In the second experiment the authors investigate differences …,IET software,2009,7
A multi-objective technique to prioritize test cases,Alessandro Marchetto; Md Mahfuzul Islam; Waseem Asghar; Angelo Susi; Giuseppe Scanniello,While performing regression testing; an appropriate choice for test case ordering allows thetester to early discover faults in source code. To this end; test case prioritization techniquescan be used. Several existing test case prioritization techniques leave out the execution costof test cases and exploit a single objective function (eg; code or requirements coverage). Inthis paper; we present a multi-objective test case prioritization technique that determines theordering of test cases that maximize the number of discovered faults that are both technicaland business critical. In other words; our new technique aims at both early discovering faultsand reducing the execution cost of test cases. To this end; we automatically recover linksamong software artifacts (ie; requirements specifications; test cases; and source code) andapply a metric-based approach to automatically identify critical and fault-prone portions of …,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,2016,6
An external replication on the effects of test-driven development using a multi-site blind analysis approach,Davide Fucci; Giuseppe Scanniello; Simone Romano; Martin Shepperd; Boyce Sigweni; Fernando Uyaguari; Burak Turhan; Natalia Juristo; Markku Oivo,Abstract Context: Test-driven development (TDD) is an agile practice claimed to improve thequality of a software product; as well as the productivity of its developers. A previous study(ie; baseline experiment) at the University of Oulu (Finland) compared TDD to a test-lastdevelopment (TLD) approach through a randomized controlled trial. The results failed tosupport the claims. Goal: We want to validate the original study results by replicating it at theUniversity of Basilicata (Italy); using a different design. Method: We replicated the baselineexperiment; using a crossover design; with 21 graduate students. We kept the settings andcontext as close as possible to the baseline experiment. In order to limit researchers bias;we involved two other sites (UPM; Spain; and Brunel; UK) to conduct blind analysis of thedata.

Proposing and assessing a software visualization approach based on polymetric views,Rita Francese; Michele Risi; Giuseppe Scanniello; Genoveffa Tortora,Abstract In this paper; we present an approach for the visualization of object-orientedsoftware. This approach has been implemented in MetricAttitude; a visualization tool basedon static analysis that provides a mental picture of a software implemented in Java by meansof polymetric views. The approach graphically represents a suite of object-oriented designmetrics (eg; Weighted Methods per Class) and “traditional” code-size metrics (eg; Lines OfCode). To assess the validity of our proposal; we have conducted two users' studies withstudents in Computer Science and professional software developers. The used empiricalmethod is qualitative. To assess MetricAttitude and its underlying approach; we conductedquestionnaire-based surveys. Results suggest that MetricAttitude is a viable means to dealwith existing objects-oriented software and to comprehend their source code; in particular.,Journal of Visual Languages & Computing,2016,6
On the comprehension of workflows modeled with a precise style: results from a family of controlled experiments,Gianna Reggio; Filippo Ricca; Giuseppe Scanniello; Francesco Di Cerbo; Gabriella Dodero,Abstract In this paper; we present the results from a family of experiments conducted toassess whether the level of formality/precision in workflow modeling; based on UML activitydiagrams; influences two aspects of construct comprehensibility: correctness ofunderstanding and task completion time. In particular; we have considered two styles forworkflow modeling with different levels of formality: a precise style (with specific rules andimposed constraints) and an ultra-light style (no rules; no imposed constraints). Experimentswere conducted with 111 participants (Bachelor and Master students). In each experiment;participants accomplished comprehension tasks on two workflows; modeled either with theprecise style or with a lighter variant. The main results from our data analysis can besummarized as follows:(i) all participants achieved a significantly better comprehension of …,Software & Systems Modeling,2015,6

Validating a model-driven software architecture evaluation and improvement method: A family of experiments,Javier Gonzalez-Huerta; Emilio Insfran; Silvia Abrahão; Giuseppe Scanniello,Abstract Context Software architectures should be evaluated during the early stages ofsoftware development in order to verify whether the non-functional requirements (NFRs) ofthe product can be fulfilled. This activity is even more crucial in software product line (SPL)development; since it is also necessary to identify whether the NFRs of a particular productcan be achieved by exercising the variation mechanisms provided by the product linearchitecture or whether additional transformations are required. These issues havemotivated us to propose QuaDAI; a method for the derivation; evaluation and improvementof software architectures in model-driven SPL development. Objective We present in thispaper the results of a family of four experiments carried out to empirically validate theevaluation and improvement strategy of QuaDAI.

An investigation of object-oriented and code-size metrics as dead code predictors,Giuseppe Scanniello,In case of biological organisms; death is unambiguous. It is not the same in softwareengineering; where death assumes a different meaning. For example; this term can be usedto indicate source code that can be removed being it unnecessary for a given softwaresystem. In this paper; the early achievements of an empirical investigation on softwaremetrics as predictors for dead code methods in object-oriented (OO) source code have beenpresented. OO design metrics and traditional code-size metrics have been considered. Dataon one open source software system implemented in Java have been collected. The resultssuggest that five of these metrics can be used as indicators for dead code methods in OOsoftware systems.,Software Engineering and Advanced Applications (SEAA); 2014 40th EUROMICRO Conference on,2014,6
Enhancing navigability in websites built using web content management systems,Damiano Distante; Michele Risi; Giuseppe Scanniello,Websites built using Web Content Management Systems (WCMSs) usually provide theirusers with three types of access structures to surf their contents: indexes of categories;breadcrumb trails; and sitemaps. In addition; to find contents of his/her interest; a user canperform more or less advanced full-text searches. In this paper we propose an automaticapproach to extend the navigation structure of websites developed using WCMSs withSemantic Navigation Maps (SNMs); a complementary navigation structure that enableslinking and navigating contents based on their lexical similarity. The approach uses aninformation retrieval technique (namely; Latent Semantic Indexing) to identify lexicalsimilarities between textual contents; and a fuzzy clustering algorithm to form groups ofsimilar web pages. For each page of the website; a set of navigation links towards pages …,International Journal of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering,2014,6
MOTCP: A tool for the prioritization of test cases based on a sorting genetic algorithm and Latent Semantic Indexing,Md Mahfuzul Islam; Alessandro Marchetto; Angelo Susi; Fondazione Bruno Kessler; Giuseppe Scanniello,Test prioritization techniques can be used to determine test case ordering and early discoverfaults in source code. Several of these techniques exploit a single objective function; eg;code or requirements coverage. In this tool demo paper; we present MOTCP; a software toolthat implements a multi-objective test prioritization technique based on the informationrelated to the code and requirements coverage; as well as the execution cost of each testcase. To establish users' and system requirements coverage; the MOTCP uses LatentSemantic Indexing to recover traceability links among application source code andrequirements specifications. The test case ordering is then obtained by applying a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm.,Software Maintenance (ICSM); 2012 28th IEEE International Conference on,2012,6
An investigation of clustering algorithms in the identification of similar web pages,Andrea De Lucia; Michele Risi; Giuseppe Scanniello; Genoveffa Tortora,Abstract In this paper we investigate the effect of using clustering algorithms in the reverseengineering field to identify pages that are similar either at the structural level or at thecontent level. To this end; we have used two instances of a general process that only differfor the measure used to compare web pages. In particular; two web pages at the structurallevel and at the content level are compared by using the Levenshtein edit distances andLatent Semantic Indexing; respectively. The static pages of two web applications and onestatic web site have been used to compare the results achieved by using the consideredclustering algorithms both at the structural and content level. On these applications wegenerally achieved comparable results. However; the investigation has also suggestedsome heuristics to quickly identify the best partition of web pages into clusters among the …,Journal of Web Engineering,2009,6
An approach and an eclipse based environment for data migration,Giuseppe Scanniello; Andrea De Lucia; Michele Mennella; Giuseppe Tagliamonte,This paper presents an incremental approach to migrate COBOL non decomposable data-intensive applications based on files to a modern relational database management system.This approach has been defined and developed within a technology transfer project carriedout in cooperation between the University of Salerno and a small industrial partner. Thedeveloped approach first reengineers the original database and then adapts the code of thelegacy application to enable the communication with reengineered database. A wrapperenables the communication between the legacy code and the new database. To support thesoftware engineer in the different phases of the defined approach an Eclipse plug-in hasalso been developed. Finally; both the plug-in and the approach have been assessed on alegacy system of our industrial partner.,Software Maintenance; 2008. ICSM 2008. IEEE International Conference on,2008,6

The latter should be platform independent and expressed in terms of roles. Usually;they are defined through languages that conceptualize the hardware characteristicsproviding powerful abstraction on the technical components of a system. Unluckily; theselanguages are very difficult to use for nonexpert users. To support all the different types ofusers visual languages have been proposed. Following this paradigm; we propose a visuallanguage hierarchy and a tool for specifying and implementing access and security policiesaccording to the RBAC model.,Multimedia Software Engineering; 2004.

A visual language for designing presenting e-learning activities,G Costagliola; Filomena Ferrucci; G Polese; G Scanniello,We propose a visual language based approach to support an instruction designer in thecreation of e-learning activities; distance courses and assessment tests. In particular; wehave extended UML activity diagrams to make them suitable for the definition andgeneration of e-learning activities. The language is turned out to be also a powerful tool forpresenting e-learning activities to end-users by providing them an easy user interface whichallows us also to keep track of students' progresses. We also present a system prototypebased on the proposed approach. The system includes integrated modules for severalauthoring activities; such as distance courses; assessment and self-assessment.,Information Technology: Research and Education; 2003. Proceedings.

Viewing object-oriented software with metricattitude: An empirical evaluation,Rita Francese; Michele Risi; Giuseppe Scanniello; Genoveffa Tortora,MetricAttitude is a visualization tool based on static analysis that provides a mental pictureby viewing an object-oriented software system by means of polymetric views. In this paper;we present a preliminary empirical investigation based on a questionnaire-based survey toassess Metric Attitude with respect to source code comprehension tasks. Participantsinvolved in this study were Computer Science students and software professionals. Theresults suggest that Metric Attitude is a viable means to comprehend source code and thatboth kinds of participants in the empirical investigation considered it to be appropriate insource code comprehension.,Information Visualisation (IV); 2014 18th International Conference on,2014,5
Maintainability-based requirements prioritization by using artifacts traceability and code metrics,M Waseem Asghar; Alessandro Marchetto; Angelo Susi; Giuseppe Scanniello,Requirements prioritization is a fundamental activity during software system maintenance.Prioritize requirements; in fact; means to determine the ordering in which requirements haveto be considered in a given planning or maintenance activity. Most of the existingrequirements prioritization techniques and tools focus on user and non/functionalrequirements; while only few attempt exists to consider how requirements are actuallyimplemented; if they are implemented. In this demonstration paper; we present a tool thatprioritizes (change) requirements by using artifacts traceability information; to locate therequirements implementation; and a set of code-based metrics; to measure severalproperties (eg; coupling; size; scattering) of the requirements implementation. The tool;hence; determines the requirement ordering with respect to how these requirements are …,Software Maintenance and Reengineering (CSMR); 2013 17th European Conference on,2013,5
Visualizing the Evolution of Software Systems Using the Forest Metaphor,Ugo Erra; Giuseppe Scanniello; Nicola Capece,We present an approach based on a forest metaphor to ease the comprehension of evolvingobject oriented software systems. The approach takes advantages of familiar concepts suchas forests of trees; sub-forest of trees; trunks; branches; leaves; and color of the leaves. Inparticular; each release of a software is represented as a forest that users (or softwaremaintainers) can navigate and interact with. Users can pass from a release to another one;so understanding how the entire software and its classes evolve throughout the pastreleases. The approach has been implemented in a prototype of a 3D interactiveenvironment. A preliminary empirical evaluation has been also conducted to assess thatenvironment and the underlying approach.,Information Visualisation (IV); 2012 16th International Conference on,2012,5
Improving artefact quality management in advanced artefact management system with distributed inspection,Andrea De Lucia; Fausto Fasano; Giuseppe Scanniello; Genoveffa Tortora,Advanced artefact management system (ADAMS) is an artefact-based process supportsystem for the management of human resources; projects and software artefacts. Thissystem puts great emphasis on the artefact life cycle by associating software engineers withthe different operations that can be performed on a given artefact. Managing the quality ofsoftware artefacts is considered as one of the main issues. To this end; ADAMS integratesweb-based artefact inspection tool (WAIT); a web-based system implementing a distributedinspection process. A case study has been accomplished to evaluate both the integration ofWAIT in ADAMS and the provided quality management support. The main result of thisempirical investigation is that the integrated system provides an effective support for themanagement of the quality of software artefacts.,IET software,2011,5
Assessing legacy system migration technologies through controlled experiments,Massimo Colosimo; Andrea De Lucia; Rita Francese; Giuseppe Scanniello,We present the results of two controlled experiments aimed at assessing MELIS (migrationenvironment for legacy information systems); a tool developed within a technology transferproject to support the migration of COBOL legacy information systems to a J2EE web-enabled multi-tier target architecture. The first controlled experiment was conducted withinan academic research laboratory with master students in Computer Science at the Universityof Salerno; while a replicated experiment was conducted in the laboratory of our partnercompany with both professional programmers and academic researchers. The resultsrevealed that the use of MELIS decrease the time to migrate legacy systems to the web withrespect to the use of traditional development tools. Also; less expert software engineersbenefit more of the use of MELIS.,Software Maintenance; 2007. ICSM 2007. IEEE International Conference on,2007,5
Assessing the effectiveness of a distributed method for code inspection: A controlled experiment,Andrea De Lucia; Fausto Fasano; Genoveffa Tortora; Giuseppe Scanniello,We propose a distributed inspection method that tries to minimise the synchronouscollaboration among team members to identify defects in software artefacts. The approachconsists of identifying conflicts on the potential defects and then resolving them using anasynchronous discussion before performing a traditional synchronous meeting. Thisapproach has been implemented in a Web based tool and assessed through a controlledexperiment with master students in Computer Science at the University of Salerno. The toolpresented provides automatic merge and conflict highlighting functionalities to support theinspectors during the pre-meeting refinement phase and provides the moderator withinformation about the inspection progress as a decision support. The tool also supports asynchronous inspection meeting to discuss about unsolved conflicts. However; by …,Global Software Engineering; 2007. ICGSE 2007. Second IEEE International Conference on,2007,5

An approach for the creation of collaborative environments,Gennaro Costagliola; F Ferrucci; Giuseppe Polese; G Scanniello,In this paper; we propose an approach for the creation of collaborative e-learningenvironments. The approach provides suitable visual languages allowing the instructiondesigner to specify e-learning courses in a simple way. The defined courses are based onsynchronous and asynchronous activities. Moreover; we describe a system prototype basedon the presented approach; which provides automated support for the generation of e-learning courses starting from their visual specification. Another distinctive characteristic ofour approach is the possibility to specify and generate full collaborative environments.

A graph-based approach to detect unreachable methods in java software,Simone Romano; Giuseppe Scanniello; Carlo Sartiani; Michele Risi,Abstract In this paper; we have defined a static approach named DUM (DetectingUnreachable Methods) that works on Java byte-code and detects unreachable methods bytraversing a graph-based representation of the software to be analyzed. To assess thevalidity of our approach; we have implemented it in a prototype software system. Both ourapproach and prototype have been validated on four open-source software. Results haveshown the correctness; the completeness; and the accuracy of the methods that our solutiondetected as unreachable. We have also compared our solution with: JTombstone andGoogle CodePro AnalytiX. This comparison suggested that DUM outperforms baselines.,Proceedings of the 31st Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2016,4
Estimating the effort to develop screen mockups,Giuseppe Scanniello; Filippo Ricca; Marco Torchiano; Carmine Gravino; Gianna Reggio,There is empirical evidence supporting the usefulness of screen mockups in improving thecomprehension of use cases. Though a cost-benefit analysis would require an estimate ofthe effort required to produce them. In this paper; we present an empirical study withstudents and professionals to estimate the effort to develop mockups starting from usecases. We adopted Step Wise Linear Regression to build estimation models based on usecase size measures (eg; the number of steps and the number of characters). The leave-one-out cross validation has been adopted to assess the accuracy of our models against abaseline benchmark. The results of our empirical study show that the estimates obtainedwith our models are significantly better than those achieved by using the chosen baselinebenchmark.,Software Engineering and Advanced Applications (SEAA); 2013 39th EUROMICRO Conference on,2013,4

An early investigation on the contribution of class and sequence diagrams in source code comprehension,Giuseppe Scanniello; Carmine Gravino; Genoveffa Tortora,We report the preliminary results of a controlled experiment conducted to analyze whetherthe combined use of UML class and sequence diagrams better supports source codecomprehension with respect to the use of class and sequence diagrams alone. We alsoinvestigated which notation between class and sequence diagrams provides a bettersupport in the execution of comprehension tasks on source code. The results suggest that itis better to use class and sequence diagrams together with respect to using either class orsequence diagrams alone. The difference in the source code comprehension is statisticallysignificant with respect to the use of class diagrams alone; while is not statistically significantwith respect to the sequence diagrams alone.,Software Maintenance and Reengineering (CSMR); 2013 17th European Conference on,2013,4
Synchronous communication media in the software requirements negotiation process,Ugo Erra; Giuseppe Scanniello,Abstract This paper presents an empirical study in the requirements negotiation process. Inparticular; the study compares traditional face-to-face meeting and distributedcommunication by using two rich synchronous communication media (ie; an enhanced chat;and a three-dimensional virtual environment). We have observed that there is a difference inthe time taken to negotiate software requirements in favor of face-to-face meeting. As theonly assessment of the time could not be meaningful; we have also analyzed the quality ofthe structured description of the negotiated software requirements. We observed that thequality of the structured descriptions is not influenced by the used communication media.,International Conference on Cooperative Design; Visualization and Engineering,2009,4
An investigation of clustering algorithms in the comprehension of legacy web applications,Andrea De Lucia; Michele Risi; Giuseppe Scanniello; Genoveffa Tortora,*,Journal of Web Engineering,2009,4
Comparing clustering algorithms for the identification of similar pages in web applications,Andrea De Lucia; Michele Risi; Giuseppe Scanniello; Genoveffa Tortora,Abstract In this paper; we analyze some widely employed clustering algorithms to identifyduplicated or cloned pages in web applications. Indeed; we consider an agglomerativehierarchical clustering algorithm; a divisive clustering algorithm; k-means partitionalclustering algorithm; and a partitional competitive clustering algorithm; namely Winner TakesAll (WTA). All the clustering algorithms take as input a matrix of the distances between thestructures of the web pages. The distance of two pages is computed applying theLevenshtein edit distance to the strings that encode the sequences of HTML tags of the webpages.,International Conference on Web Engineering,2007,4
Integrating a Distributed Inspection Tool Within an Artefact Management System.,Andrea De Lucia; Fausto Fasano; Genoveffa Tortora; Giuseppe Scanniello,Abstract: We propose a web based inspection tool addressing the problem of softwareinspection within a distributed development environment. This tool implements an inspectionmethod that tries to minimise the synchronous collaboration among team members using anasynchronous discussion to resolve the conflicts before the traditional synchronous meeting.The tool also provides automatic merging and conflict highlighting functionalities to supportthe reviewers during the pre-meeting refinement phase. Information about the inspectionprogress; which can be a valuable support to make inspection process related decisions isalso provided.

Role based reengineering of Web applications,Andrea De Lucia; Massimiliano Giordano; Giuseppe Polese; Giuseppe Scanniello; Genoveffa Tortora,We present an approach based on roles and access policies to improve securitymanagement of Web applications. The approach first identifies the roles users have in theapplication; and then the software resources they can access based on the assigned role.Roles and resources are then used to design access policies by means of a visual languagebased tool providing a metaphor-oriented layer above the well-known role based accesscontrol (RBAC) model. A network infrastructure based on a policy enforcement point (PEP)and a policy decision point (PDP) is used to enforce these policies. The proposed approachhas been used in a preliminary case study.,Web Site Evolution; 2005.(WSE 2005). Seventh IEEE International Symposium on,2005,4
Adaptive learning processes in pure and blended teaching approaches,Gennaro Costagliola; Andrea De Lucia; Filomena Ferrucci; Giuseppe Scanniello,ABSTRACT Demand for e-learning is being driven by a need for flexibility according to thestudent satisfaction.

Students' and professionals' perceptions of test-driven development: a focus group study,Giuseppe Scanniello; Simone Romano; Davide Fucci; Burak Turhan; Natalia Juristo,Abstract We have conducted a qualitative investigation on test-driven development (TDD)with focus groups to develop insights on the opinions of developers using TDD regardingthe unintuitive process involved; its claimed effects; as well as the context factors that canfacilitate (or hinder) its application. In particular; we conducted two focus group sessions:one with professionals and another with Master students in Computer Science. We usedthematic analysis template (TAT) method for identifying patterns; themes; and interpretationsin gathered data. We obtained a number of results that can be summarized as follows:(i)applying TDD without knowing advanced unit testing techniques can be difficult;(ii)refactoring (one of the phases of TDD) is not done as often as the process requires;(iii) thereis a need for live feedback to let developers understand if TDD is being applied correctly; …,Proceedings of the 31st Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2016,3
Software systems as archipelagos of atolls,Ugo Erra; Giuseppe Scanniello; Maria Caulo,We present a new metaphor that takes advantages of concepts such as archipelagos; atolls;and palms. Each package of a software system is represented as an atoll that maintainerscan navigate and interact with. Atolls that form an archipelago represent the entire system.Maintainers can pass from an atoll to another one; so understanding how the entire softwareand its packages are related with one another. Palms on an atoll graphically depict salientinformation of the classes contained in the package associated to that atoll. The metaphorhas been implemented as a 3D interactive environment tool to allow a fine-and large-grained understanding of a subject software system implemented in Java. Finally; we haveused our 3D environment on a number of open-source object-oriented software systems andthe obtained results are preliminarily presented in this paper.,Information Visualisation (iV); 2015 19th International Conference on,2015,3
Enhancing Software Visualization with Information Retrieval,Rita Francese; Michele Risi; Giuseppe Scanniello,I have enhanced Metric Attitude. It is a visualization tool based on static analysis thatprovides a mental picture by viewing an object-oriented software system by means ofpolymetric views. In particular; we have integrated an Information Retrieval engine andnamed this new version of visualization tool as Metric Attitude++. It allows the user toformulate a textual query and to show on the visual representation of the subject softwarethe elements that are more similar to that query. This could be useful in all those cases inwhich a user needs to identify (or to localize) features implemented in the source code.Several filters are also available to hide possibly irrelevant details and to ease the browsingand then the comprehension of a software system. Finally; we have applied MetricAttitude++ on a number of object-oriented software systems. In this paper; we report …,Information Visualisation (iV); 2015 19th International Conference on,2015,3

Linking E-Mails and Source Code with LASCO,Licio Mazzeo; Anna Tolve; Raffaele Branda; Giuseppe Scanniello,Many of the approaches for recovering links between e-mails and software artifacts arebased on text search or text retrieval. They reformulate the link recovery as a documentretrieval problem. We refine and improve such solutions by leveraging the parts of which ane-mail is composed of: header; current message; and previous messages. The relevance ofthese parts is weighted by a probabilistic approach based on text retrieval. We implementedour novel solution exploiting the BM25F model. The approach has been implemented in anEclipse plug-in named LASCO (Linking e-mAils and Source Code). We present that plug-inin this tool demonstration paper.,Software Maintenance and Reengineering (CSMR); 2013 17th European Conference on,2013,3

Combining machine learning and information retrieval techniques for software clustering,Anna Corazza; Sergio Di Martino; Valerio Maggio; Giuseppe Scanniello,Abstract In the field of Software Maintenance the definition of effective approaches topartition a software system into meaningful subsystems is a longstanding and relevantresearch topic. These techniques are very important as they can significantly support aMaintainer in his/her tasks by grouping related entities of a large system into smaller andeasier to comprehend subsystems. In this paper we investigate the effectiveness ofcombining information retrieval and machine learning techniques in order to exploit thelexical information provided by programmers for software clustering. In particular; differentlyfrom any related work; we employ indexing techniques to explore the contribution of thecombined use of six different dictionaries; corresponding to the six parts of the source codewhere programmers introduce lexical information; namely: class; attribute; method and …,International Workshop on Eternal Systems,2011,3

On the coherence between comments and implementations in source code,Anna Corazza; Valerio Maggio; Giuseppe Scanniello,Source code comments provide useful information on the implementation of a software andon the intent behind design decisions and goals. Writing informative and useful comments isfar from being a trivial task. Moreover; source code comments tend to remain mostlyunchanged during maintenance activities. As a consequence; the information provided inthe comment of a method and in its corresponding implementation may be not coherent witheach other (ie; The comment does not properly describe the implementation). In this paper;we present the results of a manual assessment on the coherence between comments andimplementations of 3636 methods; gathered from 3 Java open source software systems (forone of these systems; we considered 2 different subsequent versions).

Assessing think-pair-square in distributed modeling of use case diagrams,Ugo Erra; Giuseppe Scanniello,In this paper; we propose a new method for the modeling of use case diagrams in thecontext of global software development. It is based on think-pair-square; a widely usedcooperative method for active problem solving. The validity of the developed technology (ie;the method and its supporting environment) has been assessed through two controlledexperiments. In particular; the experiments have been conducted to compare the developedtechnology with a brainstorming session based on face-to-face interaction. The comparisonhas been performed with respect to the time needed to model use case diagrams and thequality of the produced models. The data analysis indicates a significant difference in favorof the brainstorming session for the time; with no significant impact on the requirementsspecification.,Empirical Requirements Engineering (EmpiRE); 2011 First International Workshop on,2011,2

Distributed workflow management based on UML and web services,Andrea De Lucia; Rita Francese; Guiseppe Scanniello,Abstract The definition and the management of business processes are considered arelevant issue to support organizations in their activities. Indeed; in the last few years manyorganizations have been changing their business processes to keep competitive in theglobal market. Workflow management is an emerging technology enabling processperformance improvement in a cooperative working environment. In particular; a workflowmanagement system (WfMS) enables processes automation through the integration; thecoordination; and communication of both human and automatic task of business processes.WfMSs provide a process definition language (PDL) for modeling business processes. APDL sentence is named process model and is enacted by a component of the WfMS; namelythe process engine. The main task of this component is executing the enactment rules …,*,2008,2
A controlled experiment conducted with bachelor students on dynamic modeling,Carmine Gravino; G Scanniello; G Tortora,Requirements Engineering (RE) is a relevant and challenging branch of systemsengineering [22];[16]. The activity most often regarded in the RE process is perhaps therequirements elicitation. Information gathered during requirements elicitation often has to beinterpreted; analyzed; modeled; and validated before the requirements can be consideredcorrectly collected and ready to be considered and implemented in a software system.However; one of the most critical activity in the RE process is the agreeing requirements asthe elicited requirements are assessed to establish whether they provide an accurateaccount of stakeholder requirements [18];[22]. In the RE process maintaining agreement withall stakeholders can be a problem; especially when stakeholders have divergent goals andbackgrounds [22];[16].

Do UML object diagrams affect design comprehensibility? Results from a family of four controlled experiments,Marco Torchiano; Giuseppe Scanniello; Filippo Ricca; Gianna Reggio; Maurizio Leotta,Abstract Objective: The main objective of our study is to assess whether the use of UML(Unified Modeling Language) object diagrams improves comprehensibility of softwaredesign when this kind of diagrams is added to UML class diagrams. Method: We haveconducted a family of four controlled experiments. We involved groups of bachelor andmaster students. Results: Results suggest that the use of object diagrams does not alwaysintroduce significant benefits in terms of design comprehensibility. We found that benefitsstrongly depend on the experience of participants and their familiarity with UML. Moreexperienced participants achieved better design comprehensibility when provided with bothclass and object diagrams; while less experienced seemed to be damaged when usingclass and object diagrams together.

A Controlled Experiment to Assess the Effectiveness of a Distributed Method for Code Inspection,Andrea De Lucia; Fausto Fasano; Genoveffa Tortora; Giuseppe Scanniello,In this report we propose a distributed inspection method; which tries to minimize thesynchronous collaboration among team members to identify defects in software artifacts. Themain idea of our approach consists of identifying conflicts on the potential defects and thenresolving them using an asynchronous inspection meeting before performing a traditionalsynchronous meeting. A synchronous inspection meeting is often not performed since it isgenerally used to remove conflicts on the defects that the inspection members have notsolved. This is because at the end of the asynchronous meeting unsolved conflicts are rareor absent at all. This approach has been implemented in a web based tool and assessedusing a controlled experiment; which context was constituted of master students in ComputerScience at the University of Salerno.

Combining Code and Requirements Coverage with Execution Cost for Test Suite Reduction,Alessandro Marchetto; Giuseppe Scanniello; Angelo Susi,Test suites tend to become large and complex after software evolution iterations; thusincreasing effort and cost to execute regression testing. In this context; test suite reductionapproaches could be applied to identify subsets of original test suites that preserve thecapability of satisfying testing requirements and revealing faults. In this paper; we proposeMulti-Objective test suites REduction (named MORE+): a three-dimension approach for testsuite reduction. The first dimension is the structural one and concerns the information onhow test cases in a suite exercise the under-test application. The second dimension isfunctional and concerns how test cases exercise business application requirements. Thethird dimension is the cost and concerns the time to execute test cases.

We named this tool as SMUG (Selective MUtant Generator).Given two subsequent versions of a program; SMUG creates mutants by considering onlythose methods modified in; or added to; the second version. This is why it is a selectivegenerator of mutants. On the basis of created mutants; SMUG generates a specified numberof faulty versions of the program. We implemented SMUG as an Eclipse plug-in andemployed this plug-in to assess regression test selection approaches. Therefore; SMUG hasto be intended as a means to advance research in regression testing. We applied SMUG tocreate a total number of 200 faulty versions of 7 small-to-medium Java programs.

Fusing multi-abstraction vector space models for concern localization,Yun Zhang; David Lo; Xin Xia; Giuseppe Scanniello; Tien-Duy B Le; Jianling Sun,Abstract Concern localization refers to the process of locating code units that match aparticular textual description. It takes as input textual documents such as bug reports andfeature requests and outputs a list of candidate code units that are relevant to the bugreports or feature requests. Many information retrieval (IR) based concern localizationtechniques have been proposed in the literature. These techniques typically represent codeunits and textual descriptions as a bag of tokens at one level of abstraction; eg; each token isa word; or each token is a topic. In this work; we propose a multi-abstraction concernlocalization technique named M ULAB. M ULAB represents a code unit and a textualdescription at multiple abstraction levels.

SEAMAN,Gennaro Costagliola; Filomena Ferrucci; Giuseppe Polese; Giuseppe Scanniello,Abstract One of the crucial activities in the development of e-learning courses concerns thedesign phase. In this phase; instructional designers define the e-learning processes byspecifying the activities students should carry out (knowledge objects; assessment; practice;etc.) and their temporal sequence. This phase is usually performed using an iterativeprocess; with step-by-step refinements. Thus; it can greatly benefit of the availability of toolsthat assist instruction designers to carry out their work. In particular; a rapid prototypingapproach could be effectively supported if the tool is also able to automatically generate thecourses starting from the supplied specification. Moreover; such a tool should also providesupport for reuse. To fulfil these requirements; in this chapter we present a tool based on asuite of visual languages; which has been specifically conceived to support instructional …,*,2011,*
Reverse Engineering of Web Based Applications: a Survey on Methods and Techniques,Ml Bernardi; GA Di Lucca; M Di Penta; F Fasano; G Scanniello,Web based applications are for their nature continuously evolving. The availability of up-to-date documentation is needed to make effective and easier their maintenance andevolution. Unfortunately; such documentation is often not produced or not up-dated mainlybecause of development processes and maintenance inter-ventions constrained by a veryshort time-to-market. Thus; several methods; techniques; and tools to reverse engineer webbased applications have been developed in the last decade to recover the neededinformation in order to support the required maintenance and evolution tasks. This surveyprovides a report about the main methods; techniques; and tools for RE of web basedapplications known in the literature; classi-fying them according to some characterizingfeatures; such as their aim (eg; model recovering; identification of cloned pages); the type …,*,2010,*
An Eclipse Plug-in to Enhance the Navigation Structure of Web Sites,Damiano Distante; Michele Risi; Giuseppe Scanniello,Abstract. This paper presents a process and a tool developed as an Eclipse plug-in forautomatically enhancing the navigation structure of Web sites. The process extends eachpage of a site with a Semantic Navigation Map; ie; a set of links connecting the page to otherpages of the site showing similar or related content. The process uses Latent SemanticIndexing to compute a dissimilarity measure between the pages of the site; a graph theoreticclustering algorithm to identify groups of pages with similar or semantically related content;and AJAX code to extend each page with the corresponding Semantic Navigation Map.Semantic navigation maps for a given Web site are recovered once and kept up to date asnew pages are added to the site or content of existing pages is updated.

DEVELOPING A SYSTEM FOR THE RETRIEVAL OF MELODIES FROM WEB REPOSITORIES,RICCARDO DISTASI; LUCA PAOLINO; GIUSEPPE SCANNIELLO,Abstract This paper presents a system called WebMelodyFinder for content-based retrievalof melodies from repositories on the world wide web. The search is based on a leastsquares fit. The system considers only the (exact) melodic shape rather than the actualnotes; and it is therefore invariant to transposition. Using this system; the melody;automatically extracted by a MIDI file or manually entered by a knowledgeable operator; canbe used as the main search key to locate the best matching melodies. Other applicationsmight include musicological archives; where other difficult-to-search information is stored(eg; scores or audio recordings).,*,2004,*

In the remaining 98% software counts for bothoperationalizing the private sector in doing its business and the public sector in supportingthe society; as well as delivering enduser applications that permeate personal life ofindividuals and families. Software can contribute to decrease power consumption (iebecome greener) in at least two ways. First; by being more energy efficient; hence usingfewer resources and causing fewer CO2 emissions. Second; by making its processes moresustainable; ie decreasing the emissions of governments; companies and individuals. Tothis end; enterprise software must be rethought to address sustainability issues and supportinnovative business models and processes. The special theme of the second edition of …,*,*,*
Clustering Support for Inadequate Test Suite Reduction,Carmen Coviello; Alessandro Marchetto; Simone Romano; Giuliano Antoniol; Giuseppe Scanniello; Anna Corazza,Abstract—Regression testing is an important activity that can be expensive (eg; for large testsuites). Test suite reduction approaches speed up regression testing by removing redundanttest cases. These approaches can be classified as adequate or inadequate. Adequateapproaches reduce test suites so that they completely preserve the test requirements (eg;code coverage) of the original test suites. Inadequate approaches produce reduced testsuites that only partially preserve the test requirements. An inadequate approach isappealing when it leads to a greater reduction in test suite size at the expense of a smallloss in faultdetection capability. We investigate a clustering-based approach for inadequatetest suite reduction and compare it with wellknown adequate approaches. Our investigationis founded on a public dataset and allows an exploration of trade-offs in test suite …,*,*,*

A Text Retrieval Approach to Recover Links among E-Mails and Source Code Classes,Giuseppe Scanniello; Licio Mazzeo,Abstract—During software development and evolution; the communication amongstakeholders is one of the most important activities. Stakeholders communicate to discussvarious topics; ranging from low-level concerns (eg; refactoring) to high-level resolutions(eg; design rationale). To support such a communication; e-mails are widely used in bothcommercial and open source software projects. Although several approaches have beenproposed to recover links among software artifacts; very few are concerned with e-mails.Recovering links between e-mails and software artifacts discussed in these e-mails is a nontrivial task. The main issue is related to the nature of the communication that is scarcelystructured and mostly informal. Many of the proposed approaches are based on text searchor text retrieval and reformulate the link recovery as a document retrieval problem. We …,*,*,*

Visualizing the Evolution of Software Systems as Growing Forests,Ugo Erra; Giuseppe Scanniello; Nicola Capece,Abstract We present an approach based on a forest metaphor to ease the comprehension ofevolving object oriented software systems. The exploited metaphor takes advantages offamiliar concepts such as agglomerates of trees (or subforest); trunk; branches; leaves; andcolor of the leaves. In particular; each release of a software is represented as a forest oftrees that users can navigate and interact with. Users can pass from a release of a softwareto the subsequent one; so comprehending how the entire software and its classes evolved.The approach has been implemented in a prototype of a 3D interactive environment. Apreliminary empirical evaluation has been also conducted to assess the validity of thatenvironment and the underlying approach.,*,*,*

Dynamic Modeling in the Comprehension of Software Requirements: Results from a Family of Experiments,Silvia Abrahão; Carmine Gravino; Emilio Insfran; Giuseppe Scanniello; Genoveffa Tortora,Abstract This document presents the results of a family of experiments conducted withstudents and practitioners to investigate whether the comprehension of softwarerequirements is influenced by the use of dynamic modeling. The family contains fiveexperiments performed in different locations and with 112 subjects having different abilitiesand level of experience with UML. The results show that the use of dynamic modelingimproves the comprehension of software requirements in case of high ability and moreexperienced subjects. This may indicate the presence of a possible experience thresholdthat the subjects should have to benefit from the use of dynamic modeling. In addition; weperformed a meta-analysis in order to aggregate the results obtained in the individualexperiments. The results of the meta-analysis confirmed that the use of dynamic modeling …,*,*,*

Usefulness of Screen Mockups in Use Case Descriptions-A Formal Experiment,Filippo Ricca; Giuseppe Scanniello; Marco Torchiano; Gianna Reggio; Egidio Astesiano,Abstract Use Cases represent a popular modeling technique amongst practitioners tocapture and define requirements in the software development process. Different techniques;templates; and styles have been proposed in the literature to describe Use Cases. Some ofthese introduce scree mockups to increase the comprehension of functional requirementsand then promote the communication among stakeholders; analysts; and developers. Thispaper reports on a controlled experiment to assess the effectiveness of including screenmockups in the Use Case descriptions to comprehend software requirements. The context ofthe experiment is constituted of students of the Bachelor program in Computer Science.Results indicate a clear improvement in terms of understandability of software requirementswhen screen mockups are present with no significant impact on effort.,*,*,*

Introducing Legacy System Migration Technologies in an Academic Context: a Controlled Experiment,Massimo Colosimo; Andrea De Lucia; Genoveffa Tortora; Giuseppe Scanniello,Abstract To verify whether or not migration technologies can be adopted; systematic andquantitative evaluations should be performed. In this paper we present the results of acontrolled experiment aimed at assessing the usefulness of an Eclipse plug-in; namedMELIS (Migration Environment for Legacy Information Systems). This plug-in has beendeveloped to support the migration of legacy information systems to a web-enabled multi-tiertarget architecture according with an incremental migration strategy. The context of theexperiment was constituted of master students in Computer Science at the University ofSalerno. The subjects without COBOL programming experience; while half of them hadJ2EE programming experience. The results of the experiment confirmed that the use ofMELIS increases the productivity with respect to the use of traditional development tools.,*,*,*
