A query language for XML,Alin Deutsch; Mary Fernandez; Daniela Florescu; Alon Levy; Dan Suciu,Abstract An important application of XML is the interchange of electronic data (EDI) betweenmultiple data sources on the Web. As XML data proliferates on the Web; applications willneed to integrate and aggregate data from multiple source and clean and transform data tofacilitate exchange. Data extraction; conversion; transformation; and integration are all well-understood database problems; and their solutions rely on a query language. We present aquery language for XML; called XML-QL; which we argue is suitable for performing theabove tasks. XML-QL is a declarative;relational complete'query language and is simpleenough that it can be optimized. XML-QL can extract data from existing XML documents andconstruct new XML documents.,Computer networks,1999,900
Storing semistructured data with STORED,Alin Deutsch; Mary Fernandez; Dan Suciu,Abstract Systems for managing and querying semistructured-data sources often store data inproprietary object repositories or in a tagged-text format. We describe a technique that canuse relational database management systems to store and manage semistructured data.Our technique relies on a mapping between the semistructured data model and therelational data model; expressed in a query language called STORED. When asemistructured data instance is given; a STORED mapping can be generated automaticallyusing data-mining techniques. We are interested in applying STORED to XML data; which isan instance of semistructured data. We show how a document-type-descriptor (DTD); whenpresent; can be exploited to further improve performance.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1999,833
Xml-ql: A query language for xml,Alin Deutsch; Mary Fernandez; Daniela Florescu; Alon Levy; Dan Suciu,Abstract XML is a new standard that supports data exchange on the World-Wide Web. It islikely to become as important and as widely used as HTML. The availability of large amountsof data on the Web raises several issues that the XML standard does not address. Inparticular; what techniques and tools should exist for extracting data from large XMLdocuments; for translating XML data between different ontologies (DTD's); for integratingXML data from multiple XML sources; and for transporting large amounts of XML data toclients or for sending queries to XML sources.,*,1998,498
The chase revisited,Alin Deutsch; Alan Nash; Jeff Remmel,Abstract We revisit the standard chase procedure; studying its properties and applicability toclassical database problems. We settle (in the negative) the open problem of decidability oftermination of the standard chase; and we provide sufficient termination conditions whichare strictly less over-conservative than the best previously known. We investigate theadequacy of the standard chase for checking query containment under constraints;constraint implication and computing certain answers in data exchange; gaining a deeperunderstanding by separating the algorithm from its result. We identify the properties of thechase result that are essential to the above applications; and we introduce the more generalnotion of F-universal model set; which supports query and constraint languages that areclosed under a class F of mappings. By choosing F appropriately; we extend prior results …,Proceedings of the twenty-seventh ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2008,245
Automatic verification of data-centric business processes,Alin Deutsch; Richard Hull; Fabio Patrizi; Victor Vianu,Abstract We formalize and study business process systems that are centered around"business artifacts"; or simply" artifacts". Artifacts are used to represent (real or conceptual)key business entities; including both their data schema and lifecycles. The lifecycle of anartifact type specifies the possible sequencings of services that can be applied to an artifactof this type as it progresses through the business process. The artifact-centric approach wasintroduced by IBM; and has been used to achieve substantial savings when performingbusiness transformations. In this paper; artifacts carry attribute records and internal staterelations (holding sets of tuples) that services can consult and update. In addition; servicescan access an underlying database and can introduce new values from an infinite domain;thus modeling external inputs or partially specified processes described by pre-and-post …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Database Theory,2009,243
Reformulation of XML queries and constraints,Alin Deutsch; Val Tannen,Abstract We state and solve the query reformulation problem for XML publishing in a generalsetting that allows mixed (XML and relational) storage for the proprietary data and exploitsredundancies (materialized views; indexes and caches) to enhance performance. Thecorrespondence between published and proprietary schemas is specified by views in bothdirections; and the same algorithm performs rewriting-with-views; composition-with-views; orthe combined effect of both; unifying the Global-As-View and Local-As-View approaches todata integration. We prove a completeness theorem which guarantees that under certainconditions; our algorithm will find a minimal reformulation if one exists. Moreover; we identifyconditions when this algorithm achieves optimal complexity bounds. We solve thereformulation problem for constraints by exploiting a reduction to the problem of query …,International Conference on Database Theory,2003,208
Containment and integrity constraints for XPath fragments,Alin Deutsch; Val Tannen,Abstract XPath is a W3C standard that plays a crucial role in several influential query;transformation; and schema standards for XML. Motivated by the larger challenge of XMLquery optimization; we investigate the problem of containment of XPath expressions underintegrity constraints that are in turn formulated with the help of XPath expressions. Our coreformalism consists of a fragment of XPath that we call simple and a corresponding class ofintegrity constraints that we call simple XPath integrity constraints (SXIC). SXIC's canexpress many database-style constraints; including key and foreign key constraints specifiedin the XML Schema standard proposal; as well as many constraints implied by DTDs. Weidentify a subclass of bounded SXIC's under which containment of simple XPathexpressions is decidable; but we show that even modest use of unbounded SXIC's makes …,Departmental Papers (CIS),2001,149
-MARS: A System for Publishing XML from Mixed and Redundant Storage,Alin Deutsch; Val Tannen,This chapter presents a system called mixed and redundant storage (MARS) for publishingXML data from mixed proprietary storage; while supporting redundancy in storage for tuningpurposes. The correspondence between public and proprietary schemas is given by acombination of Local-As-View (LAV) and Global-As-View (GAV)-style views expressed inXQuery. XML and relational integrity constraints are also taken into consideration. Startingwith client XQueries formulated against the public schema the system achieves thecombined effect of rewriting-with-views; composition with-views; and query minimizationunder integrity constraints to obtain optimal reformulations against the proprietary schema.The chapter focuses on the engineering and the experimental evaluation of the MARSsystem. MARS exploits integrity constraints on both the XML and relational data. This may …,*,2003,147
Verification of relational data-centric dynamic systems with external services,Babak Bagheri Hariri; Diego Calvanese; Giuseppe De Giacomo; Alin Deutsch; Marco Montali,Abstract Data-centric dynamic systems are systems where both the process controlling thedynamics and the manipulation of data are equally central. We study verification of (first-order) mu-calculus variants over relational data-centric dynamic systems; where data aremaintained in a relational database; and the process is described in terms of atomic actionsthat evolve the database. Action execution may involve calls to external services; thusinserting fresh data into the system. As a result such systems are infinite-state. We show thatverification is undecidable in general; and we isolate notable cases where decidability isachieved. Specifically we start by considering service calls that return valuesdeterministically (depending only on passed parameters). We show that in a mu-calculusvariant that preserves knowledge of objects appeared along a run we get decidability …,Proceedings of the 32nd ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI symposium on Principles of database systems,2013,130

Specification and verification of data-driven web applications,Alin Deutsch; Liying Sui; Victor Vianu,Abstract We study data-driven Web applications provided by Web sites interacting with usersor applications. The Web site can access an underlying database; as well as stateinformation updated as the interaction progresses; and receives user input. The structureand contents of Web pages; as well as the actions to be taken; are determined dynamicallyby querying the underlying database as well as the state and inputs. The properties to beverified concern the sequences of events (inputs; states; and actions) resulting from theinteraction; and are expressed in linear or branching-time temporal logics.

Querying XML data,Alin Deutsch; Mary F.  Fernandez; Daniela Florescu; Alon Y.  Levy; David Maier; Dan Suciu,XML threatens to expand beyond its document markup origins to become the basis for datainterchange on the Internet. One highly anticipated application of XML is the interchange ofelectronic data (EDI). Unlike existing Web documents; electronic data is primarily intendedfor computer; not human; consumption. For example; businesses could publish data abouttheir products and services; and potential customers could compare and process thisinformation automatically; business partners could exchange internal operational databetween their information systems on secure channels; search robots could integrateautomatically information from related sources that publish their data in XML format; likestock quotes from financial sites; sports scores from news sites.

Physical data independence; constraints and optimization with universal plans,Alin Deutsch; Lucian Popa; Val Tannen,Abstract We present an optimization method and al gorithm designed for three objectives:physi cal data independence; semantic optimization; and generalized tableau minimization.The method relies on generalized forms of chase and" backchase" with constraints(dependen cies). By using dictionaries (finite functions) in physical schemas we can capturewith con straints useful access structures such as indexes; materialized views; sourcecapabilities; access support relations; gmaps; etc. The search space for query plans isdefined and enumerated in a novel manner: the chase phase rewrites the original query intoa" universal" plan that integrates all the access structures and alternative pathways that areallowed by appli cable constraints. Then; the backchase phase produces optimal plans byeliminating various combinations of redundancies; again according to constraints. This …,Database Research Group (CIS),1999,104
Query reformulation with constraints,Alin Deutsch; Lucian Popa; Val Tannen,Abstract Let Σ 1; Σ 2 be two schemas; which may overlap; C be a set of constraints on thejoint schema Σ 1∪ Σ 2; and q 1 be a Σ 1-query. An (equivalent) reformulation of q 1 in thepresence of C is a Σ 2-query; q 2; such that q 2 gives the same answers as q 1 on any Σ 1∪Σ 2-database instance that satisfies C. In general; there may exist multiple suchreformulations and choosing among them may require; for example; a cost model.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2006,103
Verification of communicating data-driven web services,Alin Deutsch; Liying Sui; Victor Vianu; Dayou Zhou,Abstract We study the verification of compositions of Web Service peers which interactasynchronously by exchanging messages. Each peer has access to a local database andreacts to user input and incoming messages by performing various actions and sendingmessages. The reaction is described by queries over the database; internal state; user inputand received messages. We consider two formalisms for specification of correctnessproperties of compositions; namely Linear Temporal First-Order Logic and ConversationProtocols. For both formalisms; we map the boundaries of verification decidability; showingthat they include expressive classes of compositions and properties. We also addressmodular verification; in which the correctness of a composition is predicated on theproperties of its environment.,Proceedings of the twenty-fifth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2006,93
Artifact systems with data dependencies and arithmetic,Elio Damaggio; Alin Deutsch; Victor Vianu,Abstract We study the static verification problem for data-centric business processes;specified in a variant of IBM's “business artifact” model. Artifacts are records of variables thatcorrespond to business-relevant objects and are updated by a set of services equipped withpre-and postconditions; that implement business process tasks. The verification problemconsists in statically checking whether all runs of an artifact system satisfy desirableproperties expressed in a first-order extension of linear-time temporal logic. Previous workidentified the class of guarded artifact systems and properties; for which verification isdecidable. However; the results suffer an important limitation: they fail in the presence ofeven very simple data dependencies or arithmetic; both crucial to real-life businessprocesses. In this article; we extend the artifact model and verification results to alleviate …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2012,88
Optimization properties for classes of conjunctive regular path queries,Alin Deutsch; Val Tannen,Abstract We are interested in the theoretical foundations of the optimization of conjunctiveregular path queries (CRPQs). The basic problem here is deciding query containment bothin the absence and presence of constraints. Containment without constraints for CRPQs isEXPSPACE-complete; as opposed to only NP-complete for relational conjunctive queries.Our past experience with implementing similar algorithms suggests that staying in PSPACEmight still be useful. Therefore we investigate the complexity of containment for a hierarchyof fragments of the CRPQ language. The classifying principle of the fragments is theexpressivity of the regular path expressions allowed in the query atoms. For most of thesefragments; we give matching lower and upper bounds for containment in the absence ofconstraints. We also introduce for every fragment a naturally corresponding class of …,International Workshop on Database Programming Languages,2001,86
The NEXT framework for logical XQuery optimization,Alin Deutsch; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Yu Xu,Abstract Classical logical optimization techniques rely on a logical semantics of the querylanguage. The adaptation of these techniques to XQuery is precluded by its definition as afunctional language with operational semantics. We introduce Nested XML Tableaux whichenable a logical foundation for XQuery semantics and provide the logical plan optimizationframework of our XQuery processor. As a proof of concept; we develop and evaluate aminimization algorithm for removing redundant navigation within and across nestedsubqueries. The rich XQuery features create key challenges that fundamentally extend theprior work on the problems of minimizing conjunctive and tree pattern queries.,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,83

Managing and querying transaction-time databases under schema evolution,Hyun J Moon; Carlo A Curino; Alin Deutsch; Chien-Yi Hou; Carlo Zaniolo,Abstract The old problem of managing the history of database information is now made moreurgent and complex by fast spreading web information systems; such as Wikipedia. OurPRIMA system addresses this difficult problem by introducing two key pieces of newtechnology. The first is a method for publishing the history of a relational database in XML;whereby the evolution of the schema and its underlying database are given a unifiedrepresentation. This temporally grouped representation makes it easy to formulatesophisticated historical queries on any given schema version using standard XQuery. Thesecond key piece of technology is that schema evolution is transparent to the user: shewrites queries against the current schema while retrieving the data from one or moreschema versions. The system then performs the labor-intensive and error-prone task of …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,76
Rewriting nested XML queries using nested views,Nicola Onose; Alin Deutsch; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Emiran Curtmola,Abstract We present and analyze an algorithm for equivalent rewriting of XQuery queriesusing XQuery views; which is complete for a large class of XQueries featuring nested FLWRblocks; XML construction and join equalities by value and identity. These features posesignificant challenges which lead to fundamental extension of prior work on the problems ofrewriting conjunctive and tree pattern queries. Our solution exploits the Nested XMLTableaux (NEXT) notation which enables a logical foundation for specifying XQuerysemantics. We present a tool which inputs XQuery queries and views and outputs anXQuery rewriting; thus being usable on top of any of the existing XQuery processingengines. Our experimental evaluation shows that the tool scales well for large numbers ofviews and complex queries.,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,75
Flexible and efficient XML search with complex full-text predicates,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Emiran Curtmola; Alin Deutsch,Abstract Recently; there has been extensive research that generated a wealth of new XMLfull-text query languages; ranging from simple Boolean search to combining sophisticatedproximity and order predicates on keywords. While computing least common ancestors ofquery terms was proposed for efficient evaluation of conjunctive keyword queries byexploiting the document structure; no such solution was developed to evaluate complex full-text queries. We present efficient evaluation algorithms based on a formalization of XMLqueries in terms of keyword patterns and an algebra which manipulates pattern matches.Our algebra captures most existing languages and their varying semantics and ouralgorithms combine relational query evaluation techniques with the exploitation of documentstructure to process queries with complex full-text predicates.

XML queries and constraints; containment and reformulation,Alin Deutsch; Val Tannen,Abstract Starting from the XQuery language we define XBind; an XML analog of relationalconjunctive queries as well as a related class of XML integrity constraints (dependencies).We identify a fragment of XBind for which containment is decidable; in fact Π 2 p-complete;and a further fragment for which containment is NP-complete. We extend the containmentalgorithm to take XML dependencies into account. We give an algorithm for thereformulation of XBind queries under combinations of GAV and LAV XQuery views; as wellas additional dependencies. We prove a completeness theorem which guarantees thatunder certain conditions; our algorithm will find a minimal reformulation if one exists.Moreover; we identify conditions when this algorithm achieves optimal complexity bounds.Our results on containment and reformulation depend on certain restrictions on the query …,Theoretical Computer Science,2005,73
Systematic approach to query optimization,*,The present invention demonstrates the development and application of thechase/backchase (“C&B”) technique to systematically optimize generating alternative queryplans; aimed at multiple disparate targets. It further provides a first optimization prototypethat uses path-conjunctive query graphs internally. The methods; systems; apparatus andtechniques of the present invention capture and extend many aspects of semanticoptimizations; physical data independence; use of materialized views and cached queries;as well as generalized tableau-like minimization. Moreover; using a uniform representationwith constraints; the techniques make these disparate optimization principles highlycooperative.

Rewriting queries using views with access patterns under integrity constraints,Alin Deutsch; Bertram Ludäscher; Alan Nash,Abstract We study the problem of rewriting queries using views in the presence of accesspatterns; integrity constraints; disjunction and negation. We provide asymptotically optimalalgorithms for (1) finding minimally containing and (2) maximally contained rewritingsrespecting the access patterns (which we call executable) and for (3) deciding whether anexact executable rewriting exists. We show that rewriting queries using views in this casereduces (a) to rewriting queries with access patterns and constraints without views and also(b) to rewriting queries using views under constraints without access patterns. We show howto solve (a) directly and how to reduce (b) to rewriting queries under constraints only(semantic optimization). These reductions provide two separate routes to a unified solutionfor problems 1; 2 and 3 based on an extension of the relational chase theory to queries …,Theoretical Computer Science,2007,66
A verifier for interactive; data-driven web applications,Alin Deutsch; Monica Marcus; Liying Sui; Victor Vianu; Dayou Zhou,Abstract We present WAVE; a verifier for interactive; database-driven Web applicationsspecified using high-level modeling tools such as WebML. WAVE is complete for a broadclass of applications and temporal properties. For other applications; WAVE can be used asan incomplete verifier; as commonly done in software verification. Our experiments on fourrepresentative data-driven applications and a battery of common properties yieldedsurprisingly good verification times; on the order of seconds. This suggests that interactiveapplications controlled by database queries may be unusually well suited to automaticverification. They also show that the coupling of model checking with database optimizationtechniques used in the implementation of WAVE can be extremely effective. This issignificant both to the database area and to automatic verification in general.,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,66

A chase too far?,Lucian Popa; Alin Deutsch; Arnaud Sahuguet; Val Tannen,Abstract In a previous paper we proposed a novel method for generating alternative queryplans that uses chasing (and back-chasing) with logical constraints. The method bringstogether use of indexes; use of materialized views; semantic optimization and joinelimination (minimization). Each of these techniques is known separately to be beneficial toquery optimization. The novelty of our approach is in allowing these techniques to interactsystematically; eg. non-trivial use of indexes and materialized views may be enabled only bysemantic constraints. We have implemented our method for a variety of schemas andqueries. We examine how far we can push the method in term of complexity of both schemasand queries. We propose a technique for reducing the size of the search space by“stratifying” the sets of constraints used in the (back) chase. The experimental results …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2000,61

A deterministic model for semistructured data,Peter Buneman; Alin Deutsch; Wang-Chiew Tan,This is a preliminary report on a new model for semistructured data. The idea of semi-structured data evolved; in part; from various syntactic representations of data such asAceDB 11]; OEM 10] and has more recently been used e ectively to design query languagesfor XML 4]. Insofar as there is an agreed model; it is simply an edgelabeled graph. Howeverthis description begs a number of important questions: What can constitute an edge label?Are there values associated with the vertices? Is there a separate labeling system forvertices to provide them with independent identity? We describe here a new model for semi-structured data. It is more restrictive than the models described in 10; 6; 5] in that it isdeterministic. The edges emanating from any node in the graph have distinct labels. It is lessrestrictive in that the edges can carry data and may have structure. In fact they may …,Workshop on Query Processing for Semistructured Data and Non-Standard Data Formats,1999,60
Automating the database schema evolution process,Carlo Curino; Hyun Jin Moon; Alin Deutsch; Carlo Zaniolo,Abstract Supporting database schema evolution represents a long-standing challenge ofpractical and theoretical importance for modern information systems.

XPath Rewriting Using Multiple Views: Achieving Completeness and Efficiency.,Bogdan Cautis; Alin Deutsch; Nicola Onose,ABSTRACT The standard approach for optimization of XPath queries by rewriting usingviews techniques consists in navigating inside a view's output; thus allowing the usage ofonly one view in the rewritten query. Algorithms for richer classes of XPath rewritings; usingintersection or joins on node identifiers; have been proposed; but they either lackcompleteness guarantees; or require additional information about the data. We identify thetightest restrictions under which an XPath can be rewritten in polynomial time using anintersection of views and propose an algorithm that works for any documents or type ofidentifiers. As an additional contribution; we analyze the complexity of the related problem ofdeciding if an XPath with intersection can be equivalently rewritten as one withoutintersection or union.,WebDB,2008,51

Recent work has producedalgorithms and systems that automate the process of data migration and query adaptation;however; the problems of evolving integrity constraints and supporting legacy updates underschema and integrity constraints evolution are significantly more difficult and have thus farremained unsolved. In this paper; we address this issue by introducing a formal evolutionmodel for the database schema structure and its integrity constraints; and use it to deriveupdate mapping techniques akin to the rewriting techniques used for queries.

A system for specification and verification of interactive; data-driven web applications,Alin Deutsch; Liying Sui; Victor Vianu; Dayou Zhou,Abstract When comparing alternative query execution plans (QEPs); a cost-based queryoptimizer in a relational database management system needs to estimate the selectivity ofconjunctive predicates. To avoid inaccurate independence assumptions; modern optimizerstry to exploit multivariate statistics (MVS) that provide knowledge about joint frequencies in atable of a relation. Because the complete joint distribution is almost always too large to store;optimizers are given only partial knowledge about this distribution. As a result; there existmultiple; non-equivalent ways to estimate the selectivity of a conjunctive predicate. Toconsistently combine the partial knowledge during the estimation process; existingoptimizers employ cumbersome ad hoc heuristics. These methods unjustifiably ignorevaluable information; and the optimizer tends to favor QEPs for which the least …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,40

Automatic verification of data-centric business processes,Elio Damaggio; Alin Deutsch; Richard Hull; Victor Vianu,Abstract Recent years have witnessed the evolution of business process specificationframeworks from the traditional process-centric approach towards data-awareness. Process-centric formalisms focus on control flow while under-specifying the underlying data and itsmanipulations by the process tasks; often abstracting them away completely. In contrast;data-aware formalisms treat data as first-class citizens. A notable exponent of this class isthe business artifact model pioneered in [46; 34]; deployed by IBM in professional servicesofferings with associated tooling; and further studied in a line of follow-up works [4; 5; 26; 27;6; 38; 33; 35; 42]. Business artifacts (or simply “artifacts”) model key business-relevantentities; which are updated by a set of services that implement business process tasks. Acollection of artifacts and services is called an artifact system. This modeling approach …,International Conference on Business Process Management,2011,36
The role of visual tools in a web application design and verification framework: a visual notation for LTL formulae,Marco Brambilla; Alin Deutsch; Liying Sui; Victor Vianu,Abstract As the Web becomes a platform for implementing complex B2C and B2Bapplications; there is a need to extend Web conceptual modeling to process-centricapplications. In this context; new problems about process safety and verification arise.Recent work has investigated high-level specification and verification of Web applications.This relies on a formal data-driven model of the application; which can access an underlyingdatabase as well as state information updated as the interaction progresses; and a set ofuser inputs. Properties verified concern the sequences of events; inputs; states; and actionsresulting from the interaction. For the purpose of automatic verification; properties areexpressed in linear-time or branching-time temporal logics. However; temporal logicsproperties are difficult to specify and understand by users; which can be a significant …,International Conference on Web Engineering,2005,33

Invisible glue: scalable self-tuning multi-stores,Francesca Bugiotti; Damian Bursztyn; Alin Deutsch; Ioana Ileana; Ioana Manolescu,Next-generation data centric applications often involve di-verse datasets; some very largewhile others may be of mod-erate size; some highly structured (eg; relations) while othersmay have more complex structure (eg; graphs) or little structure (eg; text or log data). Facingthem is a variety of storage systems; each of which can host some of the datasets (possiblyafter some data migration); but none of which is likely to be best for all; at all times.Deploying and efficiently running data-centric applications in such a complex setting is verychallenging. We propose Estocada; an architecture for efficiently han-dling highlyheterogeneous datasets based on a dynamic set of potentially very different data stores.Estocada pro-vides to the application/programming layer access to each data set in itsnative format; while hosting them internally in a set of potentially overlapping fragments …,Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR),2015,25
Complete yet practical search for minimal query reformulations under constraints,Ioana Ileana; Bogdan Cautis; Alin Deutsch; Yannis Katsis,Abstract We revisit the Chase&Backchase (C&B) algorithm for query reformulation underconstraints; which provides a uniform solution to such particular-case problems as view-based rewriting under constraints; semantic query optimization; and physical access pathselection in query optimization. For an important class of queries and constraints; C&B hasbeen shown to be complete; ie guaranteed to find all (join-) minimal reformulations underconstraints. C&B is based on constructing a canonical rewriting candidate called a universalplan; then inspecting its exponentially many sub-queries in search for minimalreformulations; essentially removing redundant joins in all possible ways. This inspectioninvolves chasing the subquery. Because of the resulting exponentially many chases; theconventional wisdom has held that completeness is a concept of mainly theoretical …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,24
Efficient rewriting of XPath queries using query set specifications,Bogdan Cautis; Alin Deutsch; Nicola Onose; Vasilis Vassalos,Abstract We study the problem of querying XML data sources that accept only a limited set ofqueries; such as sources accessible by Web services which can implement very large(potentially infinite) families of XPath queries. To compactly specify such families of querieswe adopt the Query Set Specifications [14]; a formalism close to context-free grammars. Wesay that query Q is expressible by the specification P if it is equivalent to some expansion ofP. Q is supported by P if it has an equivalent rewriting using some finite set of P'sexpansions. We study the complexity of expressibility and support and identify large classesof XPath queries for which there are efficient (PTIME) algorithms. Our study considers boththe case in which the XML nodes in the results of the queries lose their original identity andthe one in which the source exposes persistent node ids.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,22
Exporting and interactively querying web service-accessed sources: The CLIDE system,Michalis Petropoulos; Alin Deutsch; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Yannis Katsis,Abstract The CLIDE System assists the owners of sources that participate in Web service-based data publishing systems to publish a restricted set of parameterized queries over theschema of their sources and package them as WSDL services. The sources may berelational databases; which naturally have a schema; or ad hoc information/applicationsystems whereas the owner publishes a virtual schema. CLIDE allows information clients topose queries over the published schema and utilizes prior work on answering queries usingviews to answer queries that can be processed by combining and processing the results ofone or more Web service calls. These queries are called feasible. Contrary to prior work;where infeasible queries are rejected without an explanatory feedback; leading the user intoa frustrating trial-and-error cycle; CLIDE features a query formulation interface; which …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2007,22
Query set specification language (QSSL),Michalis Petropoulos; Alin Deutsch; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Abstract Applications require access to multiple information sources and the data of otherapplications. WSDLbased web services are becoming a popular way of making informationsources available on the web and; hence; to applications that need to consume them--oftenvia data integration systems that combine the data of multiple sources. We argue that thefunction signature paradigm that is used today by web services cannot capture the querycapabilities provided by structurally rich and functionally powerful information sources; suchas relational databases. We propose the Query Set Specification Language (QSSL) thatallows the concise description of sets of parameterized XPath queries. A QSS is embeddedin a WSDL specification to form a specialized type of web services; called Data Services.Data Services connect the calls that the source accepts with the underlying schema …,IN PROC.

Privacy in GLAV information integration,Alan Nash; Alin Deutsch,Abstract We define and study formal privacy guarantees for information integration systems;where sources are related to a public schema by mappings given by source-to-targetdependencies which express inclusion of unions of conjunctive queries with equality. Thisgeneralizes previous privacy work in the global-as-view publishing scenario and coverslocal-as-view as well as combinations of the two. We concentrate on logical security; wheremalicious users have the same level of access as legitimate users: they can issue queriesagainst the global schema which are answered under “certain answers” semantics and thenuse unlimited computational power and external knowledge on the results of the queries toguess the result of a secret query (“the secret”) on one or more of the sources; which are notdirectly accessible. We do not address issues of physical security; which include how to …,International Conference on Database Theory,2007,20

Towards a shared ledger business collaboration language based on data-aware processes,Richard Hull; Vishal S Batra; Yi-Min Chen; Alin Deutsch; Fenno F Terry Heath III; Victor Vianu,Abstract Shared ledger technologies; as exemplified by Blockchain; provide a newframework for supporting business collaborations that is based on having a high-reliability;shared; trusted; privacy-preserving; nonrepudiable data repository that includesprogrammable logic in the form of “smart contracts”. The framework has the potential todramatically transform business collaboration across numerous industry sectors; includingfinance; supply chain; food production; pharmaceuticals; and healthcare. Widespreadadoption of this technology will be accelerated by the development of business-levellanguages for specifying smart contracts. This paper proposes that data-aware businessprocesses; and in particular the Business Artifact paradigm; can provide a robust basis for ashared ledger Business Collaboration Language (BCL).

Policy-aware sender anonymity in location based services,Alin Deutsch; Richard Hull; Avinash Vyas; Kevin Keliang Zhao,Sender anonymity in location-based services (LBS) attempts to hide the identity of a mobiledevice user who sends requests to the LBS provider for services in her proximity (eg “findthe nearest gas station” etc.). The goal is to keep the requester's interests private even fromattackers who (via hacking or subpoenas) gain access to the request and to the locations ofthe mobile user and other nearby users at the time of the request. In an LBS context; the best-studied privacy guarantee is known as sender k-anonymity. We show that state-of-the artsolutions for sender k-anonymity defend only against naive attackers who have noknowledge of the anonymization policy that is in use. We strengthen the privacy guaranteeto defend against more realistic “policy-aware” attackers. We describe a polynomialalgorithm to obtain an optimum anonymization policy.

Fol modeling of integrity constraints (dependencies),Alin Deutsch,Definition The term facet means ''little face'' and is often used to describe one side of amany-sided object; especially a cut gemstone. In the context of information science; where theitem being described is an information ob- ject; facets could refer to the object's author; date;topic; etc. Facets are used to describe both the organi- zation of information (facetedclassification); and to interface techniques that provide flexible access to that information (facetedsearch). The motivation for fac- eted classification and search is that any single organi- zationalstructure is too limiting to accommodate access to complex domains. Multiple independent facetsprovide alternative ways of getting to the same information; thus supporting a wider range ofend-user tasks and knowledge. The fields of faceted classification; information architecture; anddata modeling provide theory and methods for identifying and organizing facets. The …,*,2009,19
Automatic verification of database-centric systems,Alin Deutsch; Richard Hull; Victor Vianu,Software systems centered around a database are pervasive in numerous applications.They are encountered in areas as diverse as electronic commerce; e-government; scientificapplications; enterprise information systems; and business process management. Suchsystems are often very complex and prone to costly bugs; whence the need for verification ofcritical properties. Classical software verification techniques that can be applied to suchsystems include model checking and theorem proving. However; both have seriouslimitations. Indeed; model checking usually requires performing finite-state abstraction onthe data; resulting in loss of semantics for both the system and properties being verified.Theorem proving is incomplete; requiring expert user feedback. Recently; an alternativeapproach to verification of database-centric systems has taken shape; at the confluence …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2014,17
Abstractions for genomics,Vineet Bafna; Alin Deutsch; Andrew Heiberg; Christos Kozanitis; Lucila Ohno-Machado; George Varghese,Humans are a product of nature and nurture; meaning our phenotype (the composite of alloutward; measurable; characteristics; including our health parameters) is a function of twothings: our genotype (the DNA program in all cells) and the environment (all inputs to ahuman; like food and medicine). This arrangement is analogous to how the output of a program(such as a search engine) is a function of both the program and the input (keywords typed bya user). Using the same input with a different program (such as Google search vs. Bing) canresult in different output. In this analogy; the role of the medical professional is to provide informationthat is "diagnostic" (such as; "Is there a bug in the program based on observed output?");"prognostic" (such as; "Can output/outcome be predicted; given specific inputs; like diet?"); or"therapeutic" (such as; "Can a specific input; like a … Unlike computers; the human …,Communications of the ACM,2013,17
Design; implementation and management of rules in an active database system,Jürgen Zimmermann; Holger Branding; Alejandro P Buchmann; Alin Deutsch; Andreas Geppert,Abstract Active database systems must provide efficient support for event detection and ruleexecution. Large applications that benefit from facilities offered by active database systemsrequire tools for their whole life cycle—otherwise there will be no acceptance of this newdatabase technology. Therefore; we propose to extend the well-known and broadlyaccepted OMT design methodology to model classes and rules which have to be mappedonto a rule language. Then we present the rule languages of NAOS; SAMOS; and REACHand compare them from a user's point of view. To improve the rule management REACHoffers the facility to organize rules in so-called rule directories which provide a structuredname space like UNIX directories for the storage of files. Then we describe a comprehensiveset of commands for rules and rule directories; especially an access control mechanism …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,1996,15
State-Boundedness in Data-Aware Dynamic Systems.,Babak Bagheri Hariri; Diego Calvanese; Marco Montali; Alin Deutsch,Abstract Verification of dynamic systems that manipulate data; stored in a database orontology; has lately received increasing attention. A plethora of recent works has shown thatverification of systems working over unboundedly many data is decidable even for very richtemporal properties; provided that the system is state-bounded. This condition requires theexistence of an overall bound on the amount of data stored in each single state along thesystem evolution. In general; checking stateboundedness is undecidable. An open questionis whether it is possible to isolate significant classes of dynamic systems for which state-boundedness is decidable. In this paper we provide a strong negative answer; by resortingto a novel connection with variants of Petri nets. In particular; we show undecidability forsystems whose data component contains unary relations only; and whose action …,KR,2014,14
Interactive query formulation over web service-accessed sources,Michalis Petropoulos; Alin Deutsch; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Abstract Integration systems typically support only a restricted set of queries over theschema they export. The reason is that the participating information sources contributelimited content and limited access methods. In prior work; these limited access methodshave often been specified using a set of parameterized views; with the understanding thatthe integration system accepts only queries which have an equivalent rewriting using theviews. These queries are called feasible. Infeasible queries are rejected without anexplanatory feedback. To help a developer; who is building an integration application; avoida frustrating trial-and-error cycle; we introduce the CLIDE query formulation interface; whichextends the QBE-like query builder of Microsoft's SQL Server with a coloring scheme thatguides the user toward formulating feasible queries.

WAVE: Automatic Verification of Data-Driven Web Services.,Alin Deutsch; Victor Vianu,Abstract Data-driven Web services; viewed broadly as interactive systems available on theWeb for users and programs; provide the backbone for increasingly complex Webapplications. While this yields everincreasing functionality; the added complexity renderssuch applications more vulnerable to bugs and failures; potentially compromising theirrobustness and correctness. Therefore; there is a need to develop verification techniques forsuch Web services. The WAVE project at UC San Diego aims to develop new approachesfor automatic verification of data-driven Web services. The work relies on a novel; highlyeffective marriage of model checking and database techniques. We summarize briefly themain contributions of the project; which range from theoretical foundations to the successfulimplementation of a prototype verifier.,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2008,13
Beyond XML query languages,Peter Buneman; Alin Deutsch; Wenfei Fan; Hartmut Liefke; Arnaud Sahuguet; Wang-Chiew Tan,Abstract A query language is essential; if XML is to serve effectively as an exchange mediumfor large data sets. The design of query languages for XML is in its infancy; and the choice ofa standard may be governed more by user acceptance than by any understanding ofunderlying principles. One would hope that expressive power; performance; andcompatibility with other languages will be considered in choosing among alternatives; but itis likely that several contenders will co-exist for some time. It is worth observing that; duringthe 20-year development of relational query languages; several competing languages weredeveloped; and even today there are several relational query language standards. In spiteof this; a great deal of technology was developed that was independent of the surface syntaxof a query language. This included technology" below" the language such as efficient …,Database Research Group (CIS),1998,13
XTreeNet: democratic community search,Emiran Curtmola; Alin Deutsch; Dionysios Logothetis; KK Ramakrishnan; Divesh Srivastava; Kenneth Yocum,Abstract We describe XTreeNet; a distributed query dissemination engine which facilitatesdemocratization of publishing and efficient data search among members of onlinecommunities with powerful full-text queries. This demonstration shows XTreeNet in fullaction. XTreeNet serves as a proof of concept for democratic community search byproposing a distributed novel infrastructure in which data resides only with the publishersowning it. Expressive user queries are disseminated to publishers. Given the virtual natureof the global data collection (eg; the union of all local data published in the community) ourinfrastructure efficiently locates the publishers that contain matching documents with aspecified query; processes the complex full-text query at the publisher and returns allrelevant documents to querier.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,12
Integrating xml data sources using rdf/s schemas: The ics-forth semantic web integration middleware (swim),Ioanna Koffina; Giorgos Serfiotis; Vassilis Christophides; Val Tannen; Alin Deutsch,Abstract Semantic Web (SW) technology aims to facilitate the integration of legacy datasources spread worldwide. Despite the plethora of SW languages eg; RDF/S; OWL recentlyproposed for supporting large scale information interoperation; the vast majority of legacysources still rely on relational databases RDB published on the Web or corporate intranetsas virtual XML. In this paper; we advocate a Datalog framework for mediating high levelqueries to relational and or XML sources using community ontologies expressed in a SWlanguage such as RDF/S.

Determining source contribution in integration systems,Alin Deutsch; Yannis Katsis; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Abstract Owners of sources registered in an information integration system; which providesanswers to a (potentially evolving) set of client queries; need to know their contribution to thequery results. We study the problem of deciding; given a client query Q and a sourceregistration R; whether R is (i)" self-sufficient"(can contribute to the result of Q even if it is theonly source in the system) or (ii)" now complementary"(can contribute; but only incooperation with other specific existing sources); or (iii)" later complementary"(can contributeif in the future appropriate new sources join the system). We consider open-world integrationsystems in which registrations are expressed using source-to-target constraints; and queriesare answered under" certain answer" semantics.,Proceedings of the twenty-fourth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2005,10

Thepresent work represents a significant advance on the problem of artifact verification; byconsidering a much richer and more realistic model than in previous work; incorporatingcore elements of IBM's successful Guard-Stage-Milestone model. In particular; the modelfeatures task hierarchy; concurrency; and richer artifact data. It also allows database key andforeign key dependencies; as well as arithmetic constraints.

Do-It-Yourself database-driven web applications,Keith Kowalzcykowski; Alin Deutsch; Kian Win Ong; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Kevin Keliang Zhao; Michalis Petropoulos,UCSD's app2you project [15](commercialized as app2you. com) and its successorFORWARD project [11] 1 belong to the emerging space of Do-It-Yourself (DIY); custom;hosted; database-driven web application platforms that empower non-programmer businessprocess owners to rapidly and cheaply create and evolve applications customized to theirorganizations' data and process needs. The hoped-for outcome of DIY platforms isparalleled to the emergence of spreadsheets in the 80s and of graphical presentation toolsin the 90s [1].

Querying XML with mixed and redundant storage,Alin Deutsch; Val Tannen,Abstract This paper examines some of the issues that arise in the process of XML publishingof mixed-storage proprietary data. We argue that such data will reside typically in RDBMS'sand/or LDAP; etc; augmented with a set of native XML documents. An additional challengeis to take advantage of redundancy in the storage schema; such as mixed materializedviews that are stored for the purpose of enhancing performance.,*,2002,8
Provenance-directed chase&backchase,Alin Deutsch; Richard Hull,Abstract The Chase&Backchase algorithm for rewriting queries using views is based onconstructing a canonical rewriting candidate called a universal plan (during the chasephase); then chasing its exponentially many subqueries in search for minimal rewritings(during the backchase phase). We show that the backchase phase can be sped upsignificantly if we instrument the standard chase to maintain provenance information. Theparticular provenance flavor required is known as minimal why-provenance in the literature;and it can be computed by exploiting the analogy between a chase step execution andquery evaluation.,*,2013,7
Interactive source registration in community-oriented information integration,Yannis Katsis; Alin Deutsch; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Abstract Modern Internet communities need to integrate and query structured information.Employing current information integration infrastructure; data integration is still a very costlyeffort; since source registration is performed by a central authority which becomes abottleneck. We propose the community-based integration paradigm which pushes thesource registration task to the independent community members. This creates newchallenges caused by each community member's lack of a global overview on how her datainteracts with the application queries of the community and the data from other sources. Howcan the source owner maximize the visibility of her data to existing applications; whileminimizing the clean-up and reformatting cost associated with publishing? Does her datacontradict (or could it contradict in the future) the data of other sources? We introduce …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,7
Load-balanced query dissemination in privacy-aware online communities,Emiran Curtmola; Alin Deutsch; KK Ramakrishnan; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract We propose a novel privacy-preserving distributed infrastructure in which dataresides only with the publishers owning it. The infrastructure disseminates user queries topublishers; who answer them at their own discretion. The infrastructure enforces a publisherk-anonymity guarantee; which prevents leakage of information about which publishers arecapable of answering a certain query. Given the virtual nature of the global data collection;we study the challenging problem of efficiently locating publishers in the community thatcontain data items matching a specified query. We propose a distributed index structure;UQDT; that is organized as a union of Query Dissemination Trees (QDTs); and realized onan overlay (ie; logical) network infrastructure. Each QDT has data publishers as its leafnodes; and overlay network nodes as its internal nodes; each internal node routes …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,6

Flexible hybrid stores: Constraint-based rewriting to the rescue,Francesca Bugiotti; Damian Bursztyn; Alin Deutsch; Ioana Manolescu; Stamatis Zampetakis,Data management goes through interesting times1; as the number of currently availabledata management systems (DMSs in short) is probably higher than ever before. This leadsto unique opportunities for data-intensive applications; as some systems provide excellentperformance on certain data processing operations. Yet; it also raises great challenges; as asystem efficient on some tasks may perform poorly or not support other tasks; making itimpossible to use a single DMS for a given application. It is thus desirable to use differentDMSs side by side in order to take advantage of their best performance; as advocated underterms such as hybrid or poly-stores.

Inconsistency resolution in online databases,Yannis Katsis; Alin Deutsch; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Vasilis Vassalos,Shared online databases allow community members to collaboratively maintain knowledge.Collaborative editing though inevitably leads to inconsistencies as different members entererroneous data or conflicting opinions. Ideally community members should be able to seeand resolve these inconsistencies in a collaborative fashion. However most current onlinedatabases do not support inconsistency resolution. Instead they try to by-pass the problemby either ignoring inconsistencies and treating data as if they were not conflicting or byrequiring inconsistencies to be resolved outside the system. To address this limitation; wepropose Ricolla; an online database system that; by treating inconsistencies as first-classcitizens; supports a natural workflow for the management of conflicting data.

Chase & Backchase: A Method for Query Optimization with Materialized Views and Integrity Constraints,Alin Deutsch; Lucian Popa; Val Tannen,Abstract We have previously proposed chase and backchase as a novel method for usingmaterialized views and integrity constraints in query optimization. In this paper; we show thatthe method is usable in realistic optimizers by extending it to bag and mixed (ie bag-set)semantics as well as to grouping views and by showing how to integrate it with standard cost-based optimization. We understand materialized views broadly; including user-definedviews; cached queries and physical access structures (such as join indexes; access supportrelations; and gmaps). Moreover; our internal query representation supports object featureshence the method applies to OQL and (extended) SQL: 1999 queries. Chase andbackchase supports a very general class of integrity constraints; thus being able to findexecution plans using views that do not fall in the scope of other methods.

Optimization for physical independence in information integration components,Alin Deutsch; Lucian Popa; Val Tannen,Abstract We present an optimization method and algorithm motivated by the need forphysical independence in mediator-like components. Such components can store physicalaccess structures that facilitate joins or path navigation across the sources they cover. Usinghigh-level representations with the data structure of dictionaries (nite functions) we are ableto represent the physical access structures as views over the integrated logical schema ofthe sources. Dictionaries re ect directly the e ciency of the representation and facilitate costestimation. We de ne and enumerate in a novel manner a search space for query plans thatincorporate the physical access structures as views on the logical schema. We capture theviews through constraints (dependencies) and we use our previous work on the\equational"chase to rewrite with these constraints. This makes our method easy to integrate in the …,PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON VERY LARGE DATA BASES,1999,3
Querying data sources that export infinite sets of views,Bogdan Cautis; Alin Deutsch; Nicola Onose,Abstract We study the problem of querying data sources that accept only a limited set ofqueries; such as sources accessible by Web services which can implement very large(potentially infinite) families of queries. We revisit a classical setting in which the applicationqueries are conjunctive queries and the source accepts families of conjunctive queriesspecified as the expansions of a (potentially recursive) Datalog program with parameters.We say that query Q is expressible by the program P if it is equivalent to some expansion ofP. Q is supported by P if it has an equivalent rewriting using some finite set of P'sexpansions. We present the first study of expressibility and support for sources that satisfyintegrity constraints; which is generally the case in practice.,Theory of Computing Systems,2011,2

Xml path language (xpath) version 1.0. w3c recommendation; the world wide web consortium,Alin Deutsch; Liying Sui; Victor Vianu,Abstract We study data-driven Web applications provided by Web sites interacting with usersor applications. The Web site can access an underlying database; as well as stateinformation updated as the interaction progresses; and receives user input. The structureand contents of Web pages; as well as the actions to be taken; are determined dynamicallyby querying the underlying database as well as the state and inputs. The properties to beverified concern the sequences of events (inputs; states; and actions) resulting from theinteraction; and are expressed in linear or branching-time temporal logics. The resultsestablish under what conditions automatic verification of such properties is possible andprovide the complexity of verification. This brings into play a mix of techniques from logic andmodel checking. 1,Journal of Computer and System Sciences (JCSS) 2007; 73 (3): 442–474,1999,2

Datalography: Scaling datalog graph analytics on graph processing systems,Walaa Eldin Moustafa; Vicky Papavasileiou; Ken Yocum; Alin Deutsch,This paper presents the first Datalog evaluation engine for executing graph analytics overBSP-style graph processing engines. Building on recent advances in Datalog that supportefficient evaluation of aggregates functions; it is now easy for data scientists to author manyimportant graph algorithms succinctly. Without the burden of low-level parallelization andoptimization; data scientists can avoid programming to the quirks of the latest high-performance distributed computing framework. Where prior approaches build bespokeevaluation engines or modify generalized dataflow processing engines to achieveperformance; this work shows how to efficiently evaluate Datalog directly on BSP-style graphprocessing engines such as Giraph. Datalography incorporates both traditional Datalogoptimizations; such as semi-naive evaluation; and new evaluation algorithms and …,Big Data (Big Data); 2016 IEEE International Conference on,2016,1
Toward Scalable Hybrid Stores,Francesca Bugiotti; Damian Bursztyn; Alin Deutsch; Ioana Ileana; Ioana Manolescu,Data centric applications often use heterogeneous datasets: some very large while others ofmoderate size; some highly structured (eg; relations) while others complex structured (eg;graphs) or little structured (eg; log data). Facing them is a variety of storage systems butnone of which is the best for all; at all times. We present Estocada; an architecture we arecurrently developing to efficiently handle highly heterogeneous datasets based on adynamic set of potentially very different data stores. Estocada provides to the ap-plicationlayer access to each dataset in its native format; while hosting them internally in a set ofpotentially overlapping fragments; possibly distributed across heterogeneous stores. At thecore of Estocada lie powerful view-based rewriting and view selection algorithms to marrycorrectness with high performance.,SEBD Italian Symposium on Advanced Database Systems,2015,1
Querying contract databases based on temporal behavior,Elio Damaggio; Alin Deutsch; Dayou Zhou,Abstract Considering a broad definition for service contracts (beyond web services andsoftware; eg airline tickets and insurance policies); we tackle the challenges of building ahigh performance broker in which contracts are both specified and queried through theirtemporal behavior. The temporal dimension; in conjunction with traditional relationalattributes; enables our system to better address difficulties arising from the great deal ofinformation regarding the temporal interaction of the various events cited in contracts (eg"No refunds are allowed after a reschedule of the flight; which can be requested only beforeany flight leg has been used"). On the other hand; querying large repositories of temporalspecifications poses an interesting indexing challenge.

Interactive Query Formulation for Systems that Rewrite Queries Using Views,Michalis Petropoulos; Alin Deutsch; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Abstract Integration systems typically support only a limited set of queries over the schemathey export. The reason is that the participating information sources contribute limitedcontent and limited access methods. In prior work; this query set has often been describedusing a set of views. We describe the CLIDE interactive system; which extends the QBE-likequery builder of Microsoft's SQL Server with a coloring scheme that guides the user towardformulating feasible queries. We formalize the behavior of the system using an interactiongraph. We present a modular architecture consisting of a front-end and a back-end thatenables the front-end's behavior by providing answers to particular questions about theinteraction graph. We developed a back-end for the case where the content and the accessmethods are described using parameterized views. In this case the set of feasible queries …,*,*,1

Verification of Human Driven Data-Centric Dynamic Systems,Babak Bagheri Hariri; Diego Calvanese; Marco Montali; Giuseppe De Giacomo; Alin Deutsch,Business Process Management (BPM) refers to a systematic; holistic approach foroverseeing how work is performed in an organization; and aligning it with the businessobjectives of the organization and the needs of its customers. The core artifact in BPM is thenotion of business process; an explicit conceptual model that accounts for the way businessactivities can be executed over time (control-flow perspective); who is in charge of executingthem (resource perspective); and how the activity execution impact on data (dataperspective). A huge amount of research has been devoted to the development oflanguages; methodologies; and techniques so as to support business stakeholdersthroughout the entire business process lifecycle (van der Aalst 2012): from design toexecution; a-posteriori analysis; mining and re-engineering.

Rewriting XPath Queries using View Intersections: Tractability versus Completeness,Bogdan Cautis; Alin Deutsch; Ioana Ileana; Nicola Onose,Abstract: The standard approach for optimization of XPath queries by rewriting using viewstechniques consists in navigating inside a view's output; thus allowing the usage of only oneview in the rewritten query. Algorithms for richer classes of XPath rewritings; usingintersection or joins on node identifiers; have been proposed; but they either lackcompleteness guarantees; or require additional information about the data. We identify thetightest restrictions under which an XPath can be rewritten in polynomial time using anintersection of views and propose an algorithm that works for any documents or type ofidentifiers. As a side-effect; we analyze the complexity of the related problem of deciding ifan XPath with intersection can be equivalently rewritten as one without intersection or union.We extend our formal study of the view-based rewriting problem for XPath by describing …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1308.5585,2013,*

Trajectory and Policy Aware Sender Anonymity in Location Based Services,Alin Deutsch; Richard Hull; Avinash Vyas; Kevin Keliang Zhao,Abstract: We consider Location-based Service (LBS) settings; where a LBS provider logs therequests sent by mobile device users over a period of time and later wants to publish/sharethese logs. Log sharing can be extremely valuable for advertising; data mining research andnetwork management; but it poses a serious threat to the privacy of LBS users. Senderanonymity solutions prevent a malicious attacker from inferring the interests of LBS users byassociating them with their service requests after gaining access to the anonymized logs.With the fast-increasing adoption of smartphones and the concern that historic usertrajectories are becoming more accessible; it becomes necessary for any sender anonymitysolution to protect against attackers that are trajectory-aware (ie have access to historic usertrajectories) as well as policy-aware (ie they know the log anonymization policy).

RIDE: a tool for interactive source registration in community-oriented information integration,Yannis Katsis; Alin Deutsch; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Keliang Zhao,Abstract Modern Internet communities need to integrate and query structured information.Employing current information integration infrastructure; data integration is still a very costlyeffort; since source registration is performed by a central authority which becomes abottleneck. We propose the community-based integration paradigm which pushes thesource registration task to the independent community members. This creates newchallenges caused by each member's lack of a global overview on how her data interactswith the application queries of the community and the data from other sources. How can thesource owner maximize the visibility of her data to existing applications; while minimizing theclean-up and reformatting cost associated with publishing? Does her data contradict (orcould it contradict in the future) the data of other sources?,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,*
Censorship-resistant Publishing,Emiran Curtmola; Alin Deutsch; KK Ramakrishnan; Divesh Srivastava,We propose a novel privacy-preserving distributed infrastructure in which data resides onlywith the publishers owning it. The infrastructure disseminates user queries to publishers;who answer them at their own discretion. The infrastructure enforces a publisher k-anonymity guarantee; which prevents leakage of information about which publishers arecapable of answering a certain query. Given the virtual nature of the global data collection;we study the challenging problem of efficiently locating publishers in the community thatcontain data items matching a specified query. We propose a distributed index structure;UQDT; that is organized as a union of Query Dissemination Trees (QDTs); and realized onan overlay (ie; logical) network infrastructure. Each QDT has data publishers as its leafnodes; and overlay network nodes as its internal nodes; each internal node routes …,*,2008,*

Thus online databasescould clearly benefit from technology for uncertain/incomplete databases.

Rewriting Nested XML Queries Using Nested Views,Emiran Curtmola; Alin Deutsch; Nicola Onose; Yannis Papakonstantinou,*,*,*,*
Database Theory–ICDT 2012,Alin Deutsch,ABSTRACT Dependence logic; introduced by Väänänen; is the extension of first-order logicby atomic statements about (functional) dependencies of variables. An important feature ofthis logic is a model-theoretic semantics that; contrary to Tarski semantics; is not based onsingle assignments (mapping variables to elements of a structure) but on sets ofassignments. Sets of assignments are called teams and the semantics is called teamsemantics. By focussing on independence rather than depencence; we have proposed anew logic; called independence logic; based on atomic formulae x⊥ zy which intuitively saythat the variables x are independent from the variables y whenever the variables z are keptconstant. We show that x⊥ zy gives rise to a natural logic capable of formalizing basicintuitions about independence and dependence. We contrast this with dependence logic …,*,*,*
