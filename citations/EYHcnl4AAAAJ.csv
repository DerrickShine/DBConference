The impact of oil price shocks on the economic growth of selected MENA countries,M Hakan Berument; Nildag Basak Ceylan; Nukhet Dogan,This paper examines how oil price shocks affect the output growth of selected MENAcountries that are considered either net exporters or net importers of this commodity; but aretoo small to affect oil prices. That an individual country's economic performance does notaffect world oil prices is imposed on the Vector Autoregressive setting as an identifyingrestriction. The estimates suggest that oil price increases have a statistically significant andpositive effect on the outputs of Algeria; Iran; Iraq; Kuwait; Libya; Oman; Qatar; Syria; and theUnited Arab Emirates. However; oil price shocks do not appear to have a statisticallysignificant effect on the outputs of Bahrain; Djibouti; Egypt; Israel; Jordan; Morocco; andTunisia. When we further decompose positive oil shocks such as oil demand and oil supplyfor the latter set of countries; oil supply shocks are associated with lower output growth …,The Energy Journal,2010,181
Soccer; stock returns and fanaticism: Evidence from Turkey,M Hakan Berument; Nildag Basak Ceylan; Gulin Ogut-Eker,This paper reports the estimates of an empirical exercise that ties the success of Turkey's threemajor soccer 1 teams (Beşiktaş; Fenerbahçe and Galatasaray); each having a more or less equalnumber of fans across the country; to stock market returns by using the daily data from Turkeyfrom July 3; 1987 to November 10; 2006. The hypothesis that we tested in this paper is whetherthe returns on the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE) can be associated with the wins of teams andthe strength of the emotional ties that supporters who happen to be brokers/traders have to theirteams. To be specific; we are concerned with three questions: (i) Are the wins of the three soccerteams associated with higher returns? (ii) Are the returns different; depending on which teamwon? (iii) Are these returns tied to the fanaticism of the fans of these three teams … In behavioralfinance; emotional and visceral factors are often considered important determinants of …,The social science journal,2009,41
Stock market return and volatility relationship: Monday effect,M Hakan Berument; Nükhet Dogan,Abstract This paper assesses whether the return-volatility relationship is the same onMonday compared to other days.

Effects of soccer on stock markets: The return–volatility relationship,M Hakan Berument; Nildag Basak Ceylan,Abstract This paper assesses the effects of domestic soccer teams' performances againstforeign rivals on stock market returns as well as on the return–volatility relationship. Datafrom Chile; Spain; Turkey and the United Kingdom support propositions that soccer teamsresults in international cups affect stock market returns and the return–volatility relationship.Evidence from Spain and the UK; soccer powerhouses; suggests that losses are associatedwith lower returns and higher risk aversion but evidence from Chile and Turkey; wheresoccer is the most important sport but teams are not as successful; reveals that wins areassociated with higher returns and lower risk aversion.,The Social Science Journal,2012,26
The Effect of the Disinflation program on the Structure of the Turkish Banking Sector,C Emre Alper; M Hakan Berument; N Kamuran Malatyali,On February 21; 2001; Turkish authorities announced the forced abandon ment of thepegged exchange rate regime; which was in effect since the launch of the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF)-backed three-year stabili zation program at the end of 1999. Thisannouncement came following the acute liquidity crises of November 2000 and February2001; which threat ened the viability of the Turkish banking system as a whole. The financialturmoil following the abandonment of the pegged exchange rate regime ne cessitated arevised disinflation program; which is likely to put an end to poor banking practices anddeficiencies in supervision by prompting rapid consolidation and taking actions to boostprofitability of the banking sector.

Macroeconomic policy and unemployment by economic activity: Evidence from Turkey,M Hakan Berument; Nukhet Dogan; Aysit Tansel,This paper investigates how various macroeconomic policy shocks in Turkey affectunemployment and provides evidence on the differential responses of unemployment inselected sectors of economic activity. Our paper extends previous work in two respects. First;we consider not only the response of total unemployment; but also the response ofunemployment by selected sectors of economic activity. Second; we consider not only theeffect of monetary policy shocks; but also the effects of several other macroeconomic shocks.The results indicate that unemployment in different sectors of economic activity respondsdifferently to various macroeconomic policy shocks.,Emerging Markets Finance and Trade,2009,24

External income shocks and Turkish exports: A sectoral analysis,M Hakan Berument; N Nergiz Dincer; Zafer Mustafaoglu,Abstract This study assesses how the growth rates of Turkish trading partners affectedTurkish exports in various sectors for the period 1996: 01 to 2009: 12. To determine this; wemodeled the destination countries and the export demand for each sector separately. Eachmodel is estimated as a system of equations; where each equation represents a countryusing a seemingly unrelated regression method. The empirical evidence suggests thatMotor Vehicles; Basic Metals; and Radio–Television are the sectors with the highest incomeelasticities for most of the analyzed countries; whereas the Food Products and Beveragessector has the lowest income elasticity. We also performed simulations for the effect of a 1%increase in the growth rate of each country on Turkish exports.,Economic Modelling,2014,15
Effects of growth volatility on economic performance–Empirical evidence from Turkey,M Hakan Berument; N Nergiz Dincer; Zafer Mustafaoglu,Abstract This paper examines the relationship between growth and growth volatility for asmall open economy with high growth volatility: Turkey. Quarterly data for the period from1987Q1 to 2007Q3 suggests that growth volatility reduces growth and that this result isrobust under different specifications. This paper contributes to the literature by focusing onhow growth volatility affects a set of variables that are crucial for growth. Empirical evidencefrom Turkey suggests that higher growth volatility reduces total factor productivity;investment; and the foreign currency value of local currency (depreciation). Moreover; itincreases employment; though the evidence for this is not statistically significant.,European Journal of Operational Research,2012,15

Thebulk of previous studies investigating the link between inflation and inflation uncertaintyemploy Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH)-type models; which considerinflation uncertainty as a predetermined function of innovations to inflation specification. Thestochastic volatility in mean (SVM) models that we use allow for gathering innovations toinflation uncertainty and assess the effect of inflation volatility shocks on inflation over time.When we assess the interaction between inflation and its volatility; the empirical findingsindicate that response of inflation to inflation volatility is positive and statistically significant.However; the response of inflation volatility to inflation is negative but not statistically …,Empirical Economics,2011,15
Seasonality in inflation volatility: Evidence from Turkey,M Hakan Berument; Afsin Sahin,This paper assesses the presence of seasonal volatility in price indexes where a similar typeof pattern has been reported in asset prices in financial markets. The empirical evidencefrom Turkey for the monthly period from 1987: 01 to 2007: 05 suggests the presence ofseasonality in the conditional variance of inflation. Thus; inferences for the models that donot account for the seasonality in the conditional variance will be misleading. JELclassification codes: E31; E37; E30.,Journal of Applied Economics,2010,13

Business Cycles in Turkey and European Union Countries: A Perspective to the Membership/Türkiye'de ve Avrupa Birligi'nde Is Döngüsü: Üyelige Yönelik Bir Bakis...,Hakan Berument; Zübeyir Kilinç; Eray M Yücel,Abstract This article assesses how the business cycles in Turkey coincide with the businesscycles of member and candidate countries of the European Union. The evidence provided inthe paper suggests that there is a negative linkage between Turkish and European businesscycle dynamics when the Turkish crises are included in the data sets. This implies that thetiming of the common economic policies of the European Union in order to decrease thevolatility of output may actually increase the output volatility; rather than to decrease; forTurkey. On the other hand; when only the non-crises data of Turkey is employed; a pro-cyclical linkage is revealed between Turkish and the European economies. This suggeststhat policies enhancing the macroeconomic stability and preventing crises are crucial forhealthier synchronization of the Turkish economy with its EU counterparts.[PUBLICATION …,Sosyoekonomi,2005,11
Turkey's full membership to the European Union: an analysis in view of business cycles,MH Berument; NK Malatyali; B Neyapti,Turkey's desire for membership; initially in the European Economic Cooperation (EEC); andlater in the European Union (EU) started with the Ankara Agreement in 1963. As themovement continues today; the dates and financial terms for Turkey's full membership to theEuropean Union have not yet been clearly determined. Although Turkey's globallycompetitive potential has flourished with the liberal ization policies since the 1980s; and itsdynamism and competitive force have often been expressed since the enactment of theCustoms Union Agreement in 1995; Turkey continues to face challenges as Europeanunification progresses. Turkey's attitude toward full membership can generally becharacterized as sine qua non. Although at times there have been signs of a change in thisattitude; no major change has so far occurred.

While the bulk of previous studies has employedGARCH models in investigating the link between inflation and inflation uncertainty; in thisstudy Stochastic Volatility in Mean models are used to capture the shocks to inflationuncertainty within a dynamic framework. These models allow researchers to assess thedynamic effects of innovations in inflation as well as inflation volatility on inflation andinflation volatility over time; by incorporating the unobserved volatility as an explanatoryvariable in the mean (inflation) equation.

The choice of monetary policy tool (s) and relative price variability: evidence from Turkey,MH Berument; A Sahin; B Saracoglu,The aim of this study is to assess any regularity relative price dispersion for the effect ofmonetary policy tool selection. Central banks use tools such as interbank rate and exchangerate when pursuing their (monetary) policies. The selected tools affect economic variablesdifferently. By using Turkish monthly data for the 1988: 2-2008: 2 period; this study suggeststhat pure policies (such as interbank rate only or exchange rate only) increase relative pricevariability more than mixed policies; where the monetary authorities use the above toolssimultaneously.© 2009 Asian Network for Scientific Information.,Journal of Applied Sciences,2009,8

Football and the Risk-Return Relationship for a Stock Market: Borsa Istanbul,M Hakan Berument; Nildag Basak Ceylan; Bahar Onar,We hypothesize that results of football (soccer) teams affect the risk perception of people.People choose riskier investments after a win and less risky investments after a loss; thisleads to higher (lower) returns in the stock market. These hypotheses are tested for theinternational matches of Turkey's three most popular teams (Beşiktaş; Fenerbahçe; andGalatasaray). The empirical findings suggests that the teams' wins led to higher assetreturns and lower risk aversion on the following business day of the Borsa Istanbul andlower returns and higher risk aversion after a loss or a tie.,Emerging Markets Finance and Trade,2013,7
Output–employment relationship across employment status: evidence from Turkey,Afşin Şahin; Aysit Tansel; M Hakan Berument,This paper investigates output–employment relationships across different employmentstatuses and formal versus informal employment divisions for Turkey. Even if we fail to find along-run relationship between aggregate output and total employment; there are long-runrelationships between the aggregate output with all of the formal employment statuses. Afurther investigation for short-run relationships reveals no statistically significantrelationships between aggregate output and total employment and between aggregateoutput and casual employment but there is a significant short-run relationship betweenaggregate output and total regular employment. Thus; a sustainable economic growth policyshould aim to create formal and regular employment.,Macroeconomics and Finance in Emerging Market Economies,2014,6
Output–Employment Relationship across Sectors: A Long‐Versus Short‐Run Perspective,Afşin Şahin; Aysit Tansel; M Hakan Berument,ABSTRACT This paper investigates the nature of the output–employment relationship byusing the Turkish quarterly data for the period 1988–2008. Even if we fail to find a long-runrelationship between aggregate output and total employment; there are long-runrelationships for the aggregate output with non-agricultural employment and sectoralemployment levels for seven of nine sectors that we consider. However; a furtherinvestigation for the output and employment relationship within a short-run perspective doesnot reveal statistically significant relationships for either total employment or non-agricultureemployment; or eight of the nine sectors that we consider. Although there are various long-run relationships between output and employment; the short-run links between demand andemployment are weak.

An interest-rate-spread-based measure of Turkish monetary policy,M Hakan Berument; Nildag Basak Ceylan; Burak Dogan,A coherent method to measure the effectiveness of a monetary policy improves the monetaryauthority's management capacity and renders the possibility of applying sound policies priorto and during a crisis. The trend in employing complicated and ambiguity-bearingunconventional monetary tools in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis has increased the value ofsuch a method. The aim of this article is to introduce a coherent and consistent monetarypolicy evaluation method for Turkey. Accordingly; we suggest that innovations in the spreadbetween overnight interest rates and Treasury auction interest rates are informative forexchange rate; output; and prices. Empirical evidence for this identification reveals thatpositive innovation in spread (implying a tight monetary policy measure) decreases outputtemporarily; permanently decreases prices; and appreciates local currency. This result is …,Applied Economics,2014,4

This study adopts Uhlig's (2005) sign restrictions on theimpulse responses of main macroeconomic variables to identify monetary shock. This studyfinds that expansionary monetary policy stimulates output through consumption andinvestment in the short-run. However; expansionary monetary policy is ineffective in the long-run.,Applied Economics,2012,4

Monetary policy and interest rates under inflation targeting in Australia and New Zealand,Hakan Berument; Richard T Froyen,One advantage cited for formal inflation targeting is that by anchoring inflationaryexpectations this policy framework would aid in the pricing of long-term securities. Long-terminterest rates would become less sensitive to temporary shocks to the economy includingpolicy-induced changes in short-term interest rates. This paper examines the experience inthis regard of New Zealand and Australia; two countries that have been inflation targeters formany years. Our results are consistent with inflationary expectations having become morefirmly anchored after the move to inflation targeting in each country. There is no evidencethat the credibility of the inflation-targeting regime in either country weakened during therecent world financial crisis.,New Zealand Economic Papers,2015,3
The effects of capital inflows on Turkish macroeconomic performance,M Hakan Berument; Zulal S Denaux; Furkan Emirmahmutoglu,Abstract Capital inflows are important factor affecting macroeconomic performance; such asthe real exchange rate; interest rates; output; and price level. However; the components ofcapital inflows are also important. Capital inflows in the forms of portfolio investmentliabilities; foreign direct investment; and other investment liabilities may affect thesemacroeconomic variables differently. The main focus of this study is to analyze the behaviorof key macroeconomic variables in response to the different components of capital inflowshocks for Turkey using monthly data from 2000: 1 to 2012: 12 by utilizing a vectorautoregression model.,Empirica,2015,2

Persistency of Turkish export shocks: a quantile autoregression (QAR) approach,M Hakan Berument; N Nergiz Dincer; Pinar Yasar,Abstract This study analyzes the persistency of total and disaggregated Turkish exports fordifferent shock magnitudes using the quantile autoregression (QAR) method in line withKoenker and Xiao (J Am Stat Assoc 99: 775–787; 2004). The results suggest that thepersistence of shocks are not similar across different quantiles of Total Exports anddisaggregated export sectors; indicating an asymmetry in the case of negative and positiveshocks across different export sectors. The persistency behavior of Total Exports as well asFood and Beverages; Chemicals; Basic Metals; Raw Materials; Motor Vehicles and Radio &TV exports are asymmetric to negative versus positive shocks; which cannot be captured bytraditional unit root tests. Thus; sound interpretation of QAR results is necessary for policymakers to identify shock characteristics and thereby pursue appropriate policies for …,Empirica,2016,1
Asymmetric effects of monetary policy shocks on economic performance: empirical evidence from Turkey,Volkan Ülke; M Hakan Berument,ABSTRACT This study investigates the asymmetric effects of monetary policy shocks on themacroeconomic variables of exchange rate; output and inflation for an emerging economy‒Turkey‒by using monthly data between 1990 and 2014. We employ the innovativenonlinear vector autoregressive model of Kilian and Vigfusson (2011); which allows us toobserve the effect of different stances (tight or loose) and different sizes (small or large) ofmonetary policy actions. Our empirical evidence reveals that tight monetary policy; which; inthis case; is captured with a positive shock to interest rate; decreases exchange rate; outputand prices; as economic theory suggests. Loose monetary policy; which is captured with anegative shock to interest rate; has the opposite effect on these variables. However; theeffects of loose monetary policy are weaker than the effects of tight monetary policy …,Applied Economics Letters,2016,1
Rethinking interest rate volatility as a macroprudential policy tool,Burak Dogan; Afsin Sahin; M Hakan Berument,Along with most other central banks; Turkey's central bank has implemented unconventionalpolicies since the 2007/2008 financial crisis. Financial stability has been one of the targets ofthese macroprudential policies. However; since Turkey is working toward this goal withoutincreasing its inflation rate; tracking only short-term interest rates to measure this policy'seffectiveness would be inefficient. In this paper; we provide empirical evidence from Turkeythat interbank interest rate volatility can be an additional tool for monetary policy makers tohelp achieve the goal of financial stability. Impulse responses generated from the VectorAutoregressive models indicate that interest rate volatility increases interest rates;depreciates domestic currency and decreases credit growth and output. Its statisticallyinsignificant effect on prices is open to interpretation.,Middle East Development Journal,2016,1
Effectiveness of the reserve option mechanism as a macroeconomic prudential tool: evidence from Turkey,Afsin Sahin; Burak Dogan; M Hakan Berument,This article assesses the effectiveness of a novel macroprudential tool–the reserve optionmechanism (ROM)–which Turkey's central bank developed during the post-2008 period andhas employed to control the risk associated with excessive capital flows. We assess howcapital flows have affected economic variable changes since the introduction and usage ofthe ROM. Empirical evidence gathered from Turkey suggests that the tool decreases theeffect of capital flow on capital flow (positive shock to capital flow dies out faster or becomesless persistent) and diminishes the effects of capital flow shocks on exchange and interestrates.,Applied Economics,2015,1

To incorporate this factor; we mimic the portfolio offoreign investors in Borsa Istanbul (BIST) with respect to portfolio preferences (foreignownership) using the Fama and French's three-factor model. Our findings suggest thatmarket factor; size; and book-to-market (B/M) variables are still statistically significant andJensen's alpha is still not significant; and we obtain a statistically significant negativerelationship between the excess return of foreign investors' ownership and the returnvariation of a given portfolio.,Economic research-Ekonomska istraživanja,2015,1

This paperdirectly assesses risk tolerance after a sports event by using daily data from the three majorsoccer teams in Turkey (Beşiktaş; Fenerbahçe and Galatasaray). Results provide evidencethat risk tolerance increases after a win; but similar patterns were not found after a loss.,Psychological reports,2013,1

This study explores how one of the leading Emerging Markets(the Istanbul Stock Exchange; ISE hereafter) and various components of the ISE index areaffected by various indices from the US stock markets. The empirical evidence reveals thatunexpected shocks in the US stock markets have both contemporaneous and ﬁrst periodeﬁects on the Turkish stock market.

Multiple policy interest rates and economic performance in a multiple monetary-policy-tool environment,Serdar Varlik; M Hakan Berument,Abstract This paper assesses the individual effects on economic performance of differentmonetary policy interest rates for a central bank. To measure these effects; we employ anextension of existing Factor-Augmented Vector Autoregressive (FAVAR) models; such thatthe number of monetary policy variables can be captured with a few unobservable factors;as well as economic state variables with other unobservable factors. The empirical evidencefrom Turkey suggests that the four interest rates we consider as policy tools for the centralbank affect economic state variables in different magnitudes. Thus; selecting different policytools provides an environment that allows determining the effects of each tool fordifferentiated economic outcomes.,International Review of Economics & Finance,2017,*

Employing a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) methodology; theeffects of different real exchange rate shocks on the Turkish export demand is examined byusing quarterly data from the Turkey's 15 major trade partners. The study finds that thedepreciation of the aggregate real exchange rate affected the Turkish export demandpositively and significantly for three quarters. After accounting for the effect of the aggregatereal exchange rate; this study empirically shows that the responses of Turkish exports toindividual bilateral real exchange rate shocks are not uniform across countries.,*,2015,*

Even if we fail to find a long-runrelationship between aggregate output and total employment; there are long-runrelationships for the aggregate output with non-agricultural employment and sectoralemployment levels for seven of nine sectors that we consider. However; a furtherinvestigation for the output and employment relationship within a short-run perspective donot reveal statistically significant relationships for either total employment; or non-agricultureemployment or the eight out of the nine sectors that we consider. Thus; it seems thatsustainable growth is an essential economic agenda for employment generation concerningthe sectors and that there is a longrun link but weak short run link with demand.,*,2013,*

1680-1747 Ottoman Budgets and Deficits Sustainability in a Period of Fiscal Transition: Wars and Administrative Changes,Hakan Berument; Nuray Oguz,This paper studies the sustainability of the Ottoman budget for the period from 1680 to 1747;during different sultanates and war eras. Moreover; we investigate whether the relationshipbetween government revenues and expenditures changes in the period of culus. Theempirical evidence gathered in this paper suggests that during the sample period; except forthe sultanate era of Mahmut I; the Ottoman budget was not sustainable. The other interestingresult of the study is that culus payments had a significant tax increasing effect. Moreover;the distribution of culus deteriorated the sustainability of budget.,*,2004,*

Multiple Equilibria in Inflation-Deficit Relationship,H Berument; K Malatyalı; B Neyaptı,The purpose of this article is to show that the relationship between the deficit and inflation inTurkey is not linear; rather; budget deficit is a concave function of inflation. This suggests thatfor a given level of PSBR/GNP ratio; there are two possible levels of inflation.Metin (1996)argues that there is a cointegrating linear relationship between inflation and the publicsector borrowing requirement in Turkey. Bruno and Fischer (1990); on the other hand; arguethat inflation and budget deficit relation can be characterized by multiple equilibria. In thispaper; we test these hypotheses for Turkey by using annual data from 1982 to 1998. Afterinvestigating specifications with higher degrees; we decided to define the public sectorborrowing requirement as a second degree polynomial in the inflation rate. We estimatedthe model under various specifications; by using different lags and alternative sets of …,*,*,*

AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE: EVIDENCE FROM BEŞİKTAŞ-TURKEY,HAKAN BERUMENT; ONUR INCE; ERAY M YUCEL,Abstract: This paper investigates the connection between Turkish industrial productiongrowth and the success of Beşiktaş; which is a popular Turkish soccer team. The empiricalevidence provided in the paper suggests that industrial production growth tends to increasewith the success of Beşiktaş in European cups. Moreover; if the winnings are indisplacement; the increase in industrial production is higher than if the winnings are in thehome field. On the other hand; findings on the effects of domestic games on industrialperformance are not statistically significant.(JEL: C51; J28; L83),*,*,*
FOOTBALL AND STOCK MARKET RISK: EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THE ISTANBUL STOCK EXCHANGE,M Hakan Berument; Nildag Basak Ceylan,ABSTRACT There is an emerging but important literature on the effect of football events onstock market returns. After a loss of a football team that they support; agents discount thefuture events less favorably due to worse mood and decrease risk tolerance. This decreasesthe price of equity and stock market return. The opposite is also documented after a win. Thisstudy directly assesses the change in risk measure after a sport event. We hypothesize thatresults (wins and losses) of Turkish football (soccer) teams against foreign rivals affect therisk perception of the Turkish people. These hypotheses are tested for the internationalmatches of Turkey's three most popular national teams (Besiktas;,*,*,*
