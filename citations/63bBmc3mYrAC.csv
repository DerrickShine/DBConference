Minimal probing: supporting expensive predicates for top-k queries,Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract This paper addresses the problem of evaluating ranked top-k queries withexpensive predicates. As major DBMSs now all support expensive user-defined predicatesfor Boolean queries; we believe such support for ranked queries will be even moreimportant: First ranked queries often need to model user-specific concepts of preference;relevance; or similarity; which call for dynamic user-defined functions. Second; middlewaresystems must incorporate external predicates for integrating autonomous sources typicallyaccessible only by per-object queries. Third; fuzzy joins are inherently expensive; as theyare essentially user-defined operations that dynamically associate multiple relations. Thesepredicates; being dynamically defined or externally accessed; cannot rely on indexmechanisms to provide zero-time sorted output; and must instead require per-object …,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2002,342
Automatic categorization of query results,Kaushik Chakrabarti; Surajit Chaudhuri; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract Exploratory ad-hoc queries could return too many answers-a phenomenoncommonly referred to as" information overload". In this paper; we propose to automaticallycategorize the results of SQL queries to address this problem. We dynamically generate alabeled; hierarchical category structure-users can determine whether a category is relevantor not by examining simply its label; she can then explore just the relevant categories andignore the remaining ones; thereby reducing information overload. We first developanalytical models to estimate information overload faced by a user for a given exploration.Based on those models; we formulate the categorization problem as a cost optimizationproblem and develop heuristic algorithms to compute the min-cost categorization.,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2004,117
Personalized top-k skyline queries in high-dimensional space,Jongwuk Lee; Gae-won You; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract As data of an unprecedented scale are becoming accessible; it becomes more andmore important to help each user identify the ideal results of a manageable size. As such amechanism; skyline queries have recently attracted a lot of attention for its intuitive queryformulation. This intuitiveness; however; has a side effect of retrieving too many results;especially for high-dimensional data. This paper is to support personalized skyline queriesas identifying “truly interesting” objects based on user-specific preference and retrieval sizek. In particular; we abstract personalized skyline ranking as a dynamic search over skylinesubspaces guided by user-specific preference. We then develop a novel algorithmnavigating on a compressed structure itself; to reduce the storage overhead. Furthermore;we also develop novel techniques to interleave cube construction with navigation for …,Information Systems,2009,77

Efficient text proximity search,Ralf Schenkel; Andreas Broschart; Seungwon Hwang; Martin Theobald; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract In addition to purely occurrence-based relevance models; term proximity has beenfrequently used to enhance retrieval quality of keyword-oriented retrieval systems. Whilethere have been approaches on effective scoring functions that incorporate proximity; therehas not been much work on algorithms or access methods for their efficient evaluation. Thispaper presents an efficient evaluation framework including a proximity scoring functionintegrated within a top-k query engine for text retrieval. We propose precomputed andmaterialized index structures that boost performance. The increased retrieval effectivenessand efficiency of our framework are demonstrated through extensive experiments on a verylarge text benchmark collection. In combination with static index pruning for the proximitylists; our algorithm achieves an improvement of two orders of magnitude compared to a …,International Symposium on String Processing and Information Retrieval,2007,74
Costriage: A cost-aware triage algorithm for bug reporting systems,Jinwoo Park; Muwoong Lee; Jinhan Kim; Seungwon Hwang; Sunghun Kim,Abstract 'Who can fix this bug?'is an important question in bug triage to “accurately” assigndevelopers to bug reports. To address this question; recent research treats it as a optimizingrecommendation accuracy problem and proposes a solution that is essentially an instanceof content-based recommendation (CBR). However; CBR is well-known to cause over-specialization; recommending only the types of bugs that each developer has solved before.This problem is critical in practice; as some experienced developers could be overloaded;and this would slow the bug fixing process. In this paper; we take two directions to addressthis problem: First; we reformulate the problem as an optimization problem of both accuracyand cost. Second; we adopt a content-boosted collaborative filtering (CBCF); combining anexisting CBR with a collaborative filtering recommender (CF); which enhances the …,Proceedings of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2011,69
Boolean+ ranking: querying a database by k-constrained optimization,Zhen Zhang; Seung-won Hwang; Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang; Min Wang; Christian A Lang; Yuan-chi Chang,Abstract The wide spread of databases for managing structured data; compounded with theexpanded reach of the Internet; has brought forward interesting data retrieval and analysisscenarios to RDBMS. In such settings; queries often take the form of k-constrainedoptimization; with a Boolean constraint and a numeric optimization expression as the goalfunction; retrieving only the top-k tuples. This paper proposes the concept of supporting suchqueries; as their nature implies; by a functional optimization machinery over the searchspace of multiple indices. To realize this concept; we combine the dual perspectives ofdiscrete state search (from the view of indices) and continuous function optimization (fromthe view of goal functions). We present; as the marriage of the two perspectives; the OPT*framework; which encodes k-constrained optimization as an A* search over the …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,54
Towards an Intelligent Code Search Engine.,Jinhan Kim; Sanghoon Lee; Seung-won Hwang; Sunghun Kim,Abstract Software developers increasingly rely on information from the Web; such asdocuments or code examples on Application Programming Interfaces (APIs); to facilitatetheir development processes. However; API documents often do not include enoughinformation for developers to fully understand the API usages; while searching for good codeexamples requires non-trivial effort. To address this problem; we propose a novel codesearch engine; combining the strength of browsing documents and searching for codeexamples; by returning documents embedded with high-quality code example summariesmined from the Web. Our evaluation results show that our approach provides codeexamples with high precision and boosts programmer productivity.,AAAI,2010,52
Instant code clone search,Mu-Woong Lee; Jong-Won Roh; Seung-won Hwang; Sunghun Kim,Abstract In this paper; we propose a scalable instant code clone search engine for large-scale software repositories. While there are commercial code search engines available; theytreat software as text and often fail to find semantically related code. Meanwhile; existingtools for semantic code clone searches take a" post-mortem" approach involving thedetection of clones" after" the code development is completed; and hence; fail to return theresults instantly. In clear contrast; we combine the strength of these two lines of existingresearch; by supporting instant code clone detection. To achieve this goal; we proposescalable indexing structures on vector abstractions of code. Our proposed algorithms allowdevelopers to detect clones of a given code segment among the 1.7 million code segmentsfrom 492 open source projects in sub-second response times; without compromising the …,Proceedings of the eighteenth ACM SIGSOFT international symposium on Foundations of software engineering,2010,51
Attribute extraction and scoring: A probabilistic approach,Taesung Lee; Zhongyuan Wang; Haixun Wang; Seung-won Hwang,Knowledge bases; which consist of concepts; entities; attributes and relations; areincreasingly important in a wide range of applications. We argue that knowledge aboutattributes (of concepts or entities) plays a critical role in inferencing. In this paper; wepropose methods to derive attributes for millions of concepts and we quantify the typicality ofthe attributes with regard to their corresponding concepts. We employ multiple data sourcessuch as web documents; search logs; and existing knowledge bases; and we derivetypicality scores for attributes by aggregating different distributions derived from differentsources using different methods. To the best of our knowledge; ours is the first approach tointegrate concept-and instance-based patterns into probabilistic typicality scores that scaleto broad concept space. We have conducted extensive experiments to show the …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,50
BSkyTree: scalable skyline computation using a balanced pivot selection,Jongwuk Lee; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract Skyline queries have gained a lot of attention for multi-criteria analysis in large-scale datasets. While existing skyline algorithms have focused mostly on exploiting datadominance to achieve efficiency; we propose that data incomparability should be treated asanother key factor in optimizing skyline computation. Specifically; to optimize both factors;we first identify common modules shared by existing non-index skyline algorithms; and thenanalyze them to develop a cost model to guide a balanced pivot point selection. Based onthe cost model; we lastly implement our balanced pivot selection in two algorithms;BSkyTree-S and BSkyTree-P; treating both dominance and incomparability as key factors.Our experimental results demonstrate that proposed algorithms outperform state-of-the-artskyline algorithms up to two orders of magnitude.,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2010,46
Spatial skyline queries: An efficient geometric algorithm,Wanbin Son; Mu-Woong Lee; Hee-Kap Ahn; Seung-Won Hwang,Abstract As more data-intensive applications emerge; advanced retrieval semantics; such asranking and skylines; have attracted attention. Geographic information systems are such anapplication with massive spatial data. Our goal is to efficiently support skyline queries overmassive spatial data. To achieve this goal; we first observe that the best known algorithm VS2; despite its claim; may fail to deliver correct results. In contrast; we present a simple andefficient algorithm that computes the correct results. To validate the effectiveness andefficiency of our algorithm; we provide an extensive empirical comparison of our algorithmand VS 2 in several aspects.,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2009,43
Predictive parallelization: Taming tail latencies in web search,Myeongjae Jeon; Saehoon Kim; Seung-won Hwang; Yuxiong He; Sameh Elnikety; Alan L Cox; Scott Rixner,Abstract Web search engines are optimized to reduce the high-percentile response time toconsistently provide fast responses to almost all user queries. This is a challenging taskbecause the query workload exhibits large variability; consisting of many short-runningqueries and a few long-running queries that significantly impact the high-percentileresponse time. With modern multicore servers; parallelizing the processing of an individualquery is a promising solution to reduce query execution time; but it gives limited benefitscompared to sequential execution since most queries see little or no speedup whenparallelized. The root of this problem is that short-running queries; which dominate theworkload; do not benefit from parallelization. They incur a large parallelization overhead;taking scarce resources from long-running queries. On the other hand; parallelization …,Proceedings of the 37th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research & development in information retrieval,2014,41
Nncluster: An efficient clustering algorithm for road network trajectories,Gook-Pil Roh; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract With the advent of ubiquitous computing; we can easily acquire the locations ofmoving objects. This paper studies clustering problems for trajectory data that is constrainedby the road network. While many trajectory clustering algorithms have been proposed; theydo not consider the spatial proximity of objects across the road network. For this kind of data;we propose a new distance measure that reflects the spatial proximity of vehicle trajectorieson the road network; and an efficient clustering method that reduces the number of distancecomputations during the clustering process. Experimental results demonstrate that ourproposed method correctly identifies clusters using real-life trajectory data yet reduces thedistance computations by up to 80% against the baseline algorithm.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,38
Telescope: Zooming to interesting skylines,Jongwuk Lee; Gae-won You; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract As data of an unprecedented scale are becoming accessible; skyline queries havebeen actively studied lately; to retrieve “interesting” data objects that are not dominated byany other objects; ie; skyline objects. When the dataset is high-dimensional; however; suchskyline objects are often too numerous to identify truly interesting objects. This paper studiesthe “curse of dimensionality” problem in skyline queries. That is; our work complementsexisting research efforts to address this “curse of dimensionality”; by ranking skyline objectsbased on user-specific qualitative preference. In particular; Algorithm Telescope abstractsskyline ranking as a dynamic search over skyline subspaces guided by user-specificpreference with correctness and optimality guarantees.

Optimizing top-k queries for middleware access: A unified cost-based approach,Seung-won Hwang; Kevin Chen-chuan Chang,Abstract This article studies optimizing top-k queries in middlewares. While many assortedalgorithms have been proposed; none is generally applicable to a wide range of possiblescenarios. Existing algorithms lack both the “generality” to support a wide range of accessscenarios and the systematic “adaptivity” to account for runtime specifics. To fulfill this criticallacking; we aim at taking a cost-based optimization approach: By runtime search over aspace of algorithms; cost-based optimization is general across a wide range of accessscenarios; yet adaptive to the specific access costs at runtime. While such optimization hasbeen taken for granted for relational queries from early on; it has been clearly lacking forranked queries. In this article; we thus identify and address the barriers of realizing such aunified framework. As the first barrier; we need to define a “comprehensive” space …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2007,38
Scalable load balancing in cluster storage systems,Gae-won You; Seung-won Hwang; Navendu Jain,Abstract Enterprise and cloud data centers are comprised of tens of thousands of serversproviding petabytes of storage to a large number of users and applications. At such a scale;these storage systems face two key challenges:(a) hot-spots due to the dynamic popularityof stored objects and (b) high reconfiguration costs of data migration due to bandwidthoversubscription in the data center network. Existing storage solutions; however; areunsuitable to address these challenges because of the large number of servers and dataobjects. This paper describes the design; implementation; and evaluation of Ursa; whichscales to a large number of storage nodes and objects and aims to minimize latency andbandwidth costs during system reconfiguration. Toward this goal; Ursa formulates anoptimization problem that selects a subset of objects from hot-spot servers and performs …,Proceedings of the 12th International Middleware Conference,2011,37
Web scale taxonomy cleansing,Taesung Lee; Zhongyuan Wang; Haixun Wang; Seung-won Hwang,ABSTRACT Large ontologies and taxonomies are automatically harvested from web-scaledata. These taxonomies tend to be huge; noisy; and contains little context. As a result;cleansing and enriching those largescale taxonomies becomes a great challenge. A naturalway to enrich a taxonomy is to map the taxonomy to existing datasets that contain richinformation. In this paper; we study the problem of matching two web scale taxonomies.Besides the scale of the problem; we address the challenge that the taxonomies may notcontain enough context (such as attribute values). As existing entity resolution techniquesare based directly or indirectly on attribute values as context; we must explore externalevidence for entity resolution. Specifically; we explore positive and negative evidence inexternal data sources such as the web and in other taxonomies. To integrate positive and …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,33
Adding examples into java documents,Jinhan Kim; Sanghoon Lee; Seung-won Hwang; Sunghun Kim,Code examples play an important role to explain the usage of Application ProgrammingInterfaces (APIs); but most API documents do not provide sufficient code examples. Forexample; for the JDK 5 documents (JavaDocs); only 2% of APIs have code examples. In thispaper; we propose a technique that automatically augments API documents with codeexamples. Our approach finds and embeds code examples for more than 75% of the APIs inJavaDocs 5.,Automated Software Engineering; 2009. ASE'09. 24th IEEE/ACM International Conference on,2009,33

Rv-svm: An efficient method for learning ranking svm,Hwanjo Yu; Youngdae Kim; Seungwon Hwang,Abstract Learning ranking (or preference) functions has become an important data miningtask in recent years; as various applications have been found in information retrieval. Amongrank learning methods; ranking SVM has been favorably applied to various applications; eg;optimizing search engines; improving data retrieval quality. In this paper; we first develop a 1-norm ranking SVM that is faster in testing than the standard ranking SVM; and proposeRanking Vector SVM (RV-SVM) that revises the 1-norm ranking SVM for faster training. Thenumber of variables in the RV-SVM is significantly smaller; thus the RV-SVM trains muchfaster than the other ranking SVMs. We experimentally compared the RV-SVM with the state-of-the-art rank learning method provided in SVM-light. The RV-SVM uses much less supportvectors and trains much faster for nonlinear kernels than the SVM-light. The accuracies of …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2009,31
Supporting pattern-matching queries over trajectories on road networks,Gook-Pil Roh; Jong-Won Roh; Byoung-Kee Yi,With the advent of ubiquitous computing; we can easily collect large-scale trajectory data;say; from moving vehicles. This paper studies pattern-matching problems for trajectory dataover road networks; which complements existing efforts focusing on (1) a spatiotemporalwindow query for location-based service or (2) euclidean space with no restriction. Incontrast; we first identify some desirable properties for pattern-matching queries to the roadnetwork trajectories. As the existing work does not fully satisfy these properties; we develop(1) trajectory representation and (2) distance metric that satisfy all the desirable propertieswe identified. Based on this representation and metric; we develop efficient algorithms forthree types of pattern-matching queries-whole; subpattern; and reverse subpatternmatching. We analytically validate the correctness of our algorithms and also empirically …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,30
Continuous skylining on volatile moving data,Mu-Woong Lee; Seung-won Hwang,A dynamic skyline query retrieves the moving data objects that are not spatially dominatedby any other object with respect to a given query point. Existing efforts on supporting suchqueries; however; supports location as a single dynamic attribute and one or more staticdimensions. In a clear contrast; this paper focuses on the continuous skyline computation onmoving data with an arbitrary number of dynamic queriable dimensions; eg; to model bothlocation and its volatility; with and without static dimension. Toward the goal; we investigatethe relative positions and velocities of the initial skyline points with respect to the query; toderive a search region for skyline candidates. After retrieving these candidates; we furtherprune out some candidates and examine their spatial relations to monitor the changes in theskyline.,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09.

Enabling soft queries for data retrieval,Hwanjo Yu; Seung-won Hwang; Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang,Abstract Data retrieval finding relevant data from large databases—has become a seriousproblem as myriad databases have been brought online in the Web. For instance; queryingthe for-sale houses in Chicago from realtor. com returns thousands of matching houses.Similarly; querying “digital camera” in froogle. com returns hundreds of thousand of results.This data retrieval is essentially an online ranking problem; ie; ranking data resultsaccording to the user's preference effectively and efficiently. This paper proposes a new rankquery framework; for effectively incorporating “user-friendly” rank-query formulation into“data base (DB)-friendly” rank-query processing; in order to enable “soft” queries ondatabases. Our framework assumes; as the “back-end;” the score-based ranking model forexpressive and efficient query processing. On top of the score-based model; as the “front …,Information Systems,2007,27
Delayed-Dynamic-Selective (DDS) prediction for reducing extreme tail latency in web search,Saehoon Kim; Yuxiong He; Seung-won Hwang; Sameh Elnikety; Seungjin Choi,Abstract A commercial web search engine shards its index among many servers; andtherefore the response time of a search query is dominated by the slowest server thatprocesses the query. Prior approaches target improving responsiveness by reducing the taillatency of an individual search server. They predict query execution time; and if a query ispredicted to be long-running; it runs in parallel; otherwise it runs sequentially. Theseapproaches are; however; not accurate enough for reducing a high tail latency whenresponses are aggregated from many servers because this requires each server to reduce asubstantially higher tail latency (eg; the 99.99 th-percentile); which we call extreme taillatency. We propose a prediction framework to reduce the extreme tail latency of searchservers. The framework has a unique set of characteristics to predict long-running queries …,Proceedings of the Eighth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2015,26
A new approach for processing ranked subsequence matching based on ranked union,Wook-Shin Han; Jinsoo Lee; Yang-Sae Moon; Seung-won Hwang; Hwanjo Yu,Abstract Ranked subsequence matching finds top-k subsequences most similar to a givenquery sequence from data sequences. Recently; Han et al.[12] proposed a solution (referredto here as HLMJ) to this problem by using the concept of the minimum distance matchingwindow pair (MDMWP) and a global priority queue. By using the concept of MDMWP; HLMJcan prune many unnecessary accesses to data subsequences using a lower bounddistance. However; we notice that HLMJ may incur serious performance overhead forimportant types of queries. In this paper; we propose a novel systematic framework to solvethis problem by viewing ranked subsequence matching as ranked union. Specifically; wepropose a notion of the matching subsequence equivalence class (MSEQ) and a novellower bound called the MSEQ-distance. To completely eliminate the performance …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,26
Socialsearch: enhancing entity search with social network matching,Gae-won You; Seung-won Hwang; Zaiqing Nie; Ji-Rong Wen,Abstract This paper introduces the problem of matching people names to theircorresponding social network identities such as their Twitter accounts. Existing tools for thispurpose build upon naive textual matching and inevitably suffer low precision; due to falsepositives (eg; fake impersonator accounts) and false negatives (eg; accounts usingnicknames). To overcome these limitations; we leverage" relational" evidences extractedfrom the Web corpus. In particular; as such an example; weadopt Web document co-occurrences; which can be interpreted as an" implicit" counterpart of Twitter followerrelationships. Using both textual and relational features; we learn a ranking functionaggregating these features for the accurate ordering of candidate matches. Another keycontribution of this paper is to formulate confidence scoring as a separate problem from …,Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2011,26
Probe minimization by schedule optimization: Supporting top-k queries with expensive predicates,Seung-won Hwang; Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang,This paper addresses the problem of evaluating ranked top-k queries with expensivepredicates. As major DBMSs now all support expensive user-defined predicates for Booleanqueries; we believe such support for ranked queries can be even more important: first;ranked queries often need to model user-specific concepts of preference; relevance; orsimilarity; which call for dynamic user-defined functions. Second; middleware systems mustincorporate external predicates for integrating autonomous sources typically accessible onlyby per-object queries. Third; ranked queries often accompany Boolean ranking conditions;which may turn predicates into expensive ones; as the index structure on the predicate builton the base table may be no longer effective in retrieving the filtered objects in order. Fourth;fuzzy joins are inherently expensive; as they are essentially user-defined operations that …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2007,26
Optimizing access cost for top-k queries over Web sources: A unified cost-based approach,Seung-won Hwang; KC-C Chang,We study the problem of supporting ranked queries in middleware environments; wherequeries are evaluated over multiple sources. In particular; we study Web middlewarescenarios; querying over various Web sources. To motivate; consider a Web" travel agent"scenario for finding restaurants and hotels.(We use this real scenario as" benchmark"queries for experiments as well). In particular; how to access sources with differentcapabilities and costs; to answer queries efficiently? As our Web middleware coordinatesvarious sources; each source access incurs network communication and servercomputation. This paper aims at optimizing such access; costs-which dominate the overallquery processing (like I/O in relational DBMS).,Data Engineering; 2005. ICDE 2005.

Navigation system for product search,Jongwuk Lee; Seung-won Hwang; Zaiqing Nie; Ji-Rong Wen,We demonstrate Product EntityCube; a product recommendation and navigation system.While the unprecedented scale of a product search portal enables to satisfy users withdiverse needs; this scale also complicates product recommendation. Specifically; our targetapplication poses a unique challenge of overcoming insufficient user profiles andfeedbacks. To address this problem; we organize query results into clusters representingdifferent user perceptions of similarity; and provide a navigational UI to handle personalinterests. Specifically; we first discuss hybrid object clustering capturing diverse userinterests from millions of Web pages and disambiguating different perceptions using feature-based similarity. We then discuss skyline object ranking to highlight interesting items at eachcluster.

Clustering high dimensional massive scientific datasets,Ekow J Otoo; Arie Shoshani; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract Many scientific applications can benefit from an efficient clustering algorithm ofmassively large high dimensional datasets. However most of the developed algorithms areimpractical to use when the amount of data is very large. Given N objects each defined by anM-dimensional feature vector; any clustering technique for handling very large datasets inhigh dimensional space should run in time O (MN) at best; and O (MN log N) in the worstcase; using no more than O (MN) storage; for it to be practical. We introduce a hybridalgorithm; called HyCeltyc; for clustering massively large high dimensional datasets in O(MN) time which is linear in the size of the data. HyCeltyc; which stands for Hy brid Cel lDensi ty C lustering method; combines a cell-density based algorithm with a hierarchicalagglomerative method to identify clusters in linear time.

Scalable skyline computation using a balanced pivot selection technique,Jongwuk Lee; Seung-Won Hwang,Abstract Skyline queries have recently received considerable attention as an alternativedecision-making operator in the database community. The conventional skyline algorithmshave primarily focused on optimizing the dominance of points in order to remove non-skylinepoints as efficiently as possible; but have neglected to take into account the incomparabilityof points in order to bypass unnecessary comparisons. To design a scalable skylinealgorithm; we first analyze a cost model that copes with both dominance andincomparability; and develop a novel technique to select a cost-optimal point; called a pivotpoint; that minimizes the number of comparisons in point-based space partitioning. We thenimplement the proposed pivot point selection technique in the existing sorting-andpartitioning-based algorithms. For point insertions/deletions; we also discuss how to …,Information Systems,2014,24
Rankfp: A framework for supporting rank formulation and processing,Hwanjo Yu; Seung-won Hwang; KC-C Chang,To enable ad-hoc ranking for data retrieval; we observe two major barriers: first; usability: ad-hoc ranking should be" user friendly"; for ordinary users to easily specify their rankingcriteria. Second; efficiency: ad-hoc ranking should be" database friendly"; to be amenable toefficient processing. This paper proposes a new framework such that: 1) to achieve usability;it allows users to qualitatively and intuitively express their preferences by partial orders onselected examples; from which it effectively learns a quantitative global ranking function; and(2) to achieve efficiency; it integrates the front-end machine learner with a back-end top-kquery processor to evaluate the learned functions. First; to support efficient queryprocessing; our framework assumes the score-based ranking model. Such a model is bothexpressive and amenable to efficient query processing.,Data Engineering; 2005.

Toward efficient multidimensional subspace skyline computation,Jongwuk Lee; Seung-Won Hwang,Abstract Skyline queries have attracted considerable attention to assist multicriteria analysisof large-scale datasets. In this paper; we focus on multidimensional subspace skylinecomputation that has been actively studied for two approaches. First; to narrow down a full-space skyline; users may consider multiple subspace skylines reflecting their interest. Forthis purpose; we tackle the concept of a skycube; which consists of all possible non-emptysubspace skylines in a given full space. Second; to understand diverse semantics ofsubspace skylines; we address skyline groups in which a skyline point (or a set of skylinepoints) is annotated with decisive subspaces. Our primary contributions are to identifycommon building blocks of the two approaches and to develop orthogonal optimizationprinciples that benefit both approaches.

Query result clustering for object-level search,Jongwuk Lee; Seung-won Hwang; Zaiqing Nie; Ji-Rong Wen,Abstract Query result clustering has recently attracted a lot of attention to provide users witha succinct overview of relevant results. However; little work has been done on organizing thequery results for object-level search. Object-level search result clustering is challengingbecause we need to support diverse similarity notions over object-specific features (such asthe price and weight of a product) of heterogeneous domains. To address this challenge; wepropose a hybrid subspace clustering algorithm called Hydra. Algorithm Hydra captures theuser perception of diverse similarity notions from millions of Web pages and disambiguatesdifferent senses using feature-based subspace locality measures. Our proposed solution; bycombining wisdom of crowds and wisdom of data; achieves robustness and efficiency overexisting approaches.

Mining name translations from entity graph mapping,Gae-won You; Seung-won Hwang; Young-In Song; Long Jiang; Zaiqing Nie,Abstract This paper studies the problem of mining entity translation; specifically; miningEnglish and Chinese name pairs. Existing efforts can be categorized into (a) a transliteration-based approach leveraging phonetic similarity and (b) a corpus-based approach exploitingbilingual co-occurrences; each of which suffers from inaccuracy and scarcity respectively. Inclear contrast; we use unleveraged resources of monolingual entity co-occurrences; crawledfrom entity search engines; represented as two entity-relationship graphs extracted from twolanguage corpora respectively. Our problem is then abstracted as finding correct mappingsacross two graphs. To achieve this goal; we propose a holistic approach; of exploiting bothtransliteration similarity and monolingual co-occurrences. This approach; building uponmonolingual corpora; complements existing corpus-based work; requiring scarce …,Proceedings of the 2010 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2010,21
Search structures and algorithms for personalized ranking,Gae-won You; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract As data of an unprecedented scale are becoming accessible on the Web;personalization; of narrowing down the retrieval to meet the user-specific information needs;is becoming more and more critical. For instance; while web search engines traditionallyretrieve the same results for all users; they began to offer beta services to personalize theresults to adapt to user-specific contexts such as prior search history or other applicationcontexts. In a clear contrast to search engines dealing with unstructured text data; this paperstudies how to enable such personalization in the context of structured data retrieval. Inparticular; we adopt contextual ranking model to formalize personalization as a cost-basedoptimization over collected contextual rankings. With this formalism; personalization can beabstracted as a cost-optimal retrieval of contextual ranking; closely matching user-specific …,Information Sciences,2008,21
An efficient method for learning nonlinear ranking SVM functions,Hwanjo Yu; Jinha Kim; Youngdae Kim; Seungwon Hwang; Young Ho Lee,Abstract The problem of learning ranking (or preference) functions has become important inrecent years as various applications have been found in information retrieval. Among therank learning methods; RankSVM has been favorably used in various applications; eg;optimizing search engines and improving data retrieval quality. Fast learning methods forlinear RankSVM (RankSVM with a linear kernel) have been extensively developed; whereasmethods for nonlinear RankSVM (RankSVM with nonlinear kernels) are lacking. This paperproposes an efficient method for learning with nonlinear kernels; called Ranking Vector SVM(RV-SVM). RV-SVM utilizes training vectors rather than pairwise difference vectors todetermine the support vectors; and is thus faster to train than conventional RankSVMs.Experimental comparisons with the state-of-the-art RankSVM implementation provided in …,Information Sciences,2012,20
QSkycube: efficient skycube computation using point-based space partitioning,Jongwuk Lee; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract Skyline queries have gained considerable attention for multi-criteria analysis oflarge-scale datasets. However; the skyline queries are known to return too many results forhigh-dimensional data. To address this problem; a skycube is introduced to efficientlyprovide users with multiple skylines with different strengths. For efficient skycubeconstruction; state-of-the-art algorithms amortized redundant computation among subspaceskylines; or cuboids; either (1) in a bottom-up fashion with the principle of sharing result or(2) in a top-down fashion with the principle of sharing structure. However; we observedfurther room for optimization in both principles. This paper thus aims to design a moreefficient skycube algorithm that shares multiple cuboids using more effective structures.Specifically; we first develop each principle by leveraging multiple parents and a skytree …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,18

Hybrid entity clustering using crowds and data,Jongwuk Lee; Hyunsouk Cho; Jin-Woo Park; Young-rok Cha; Seung-won Hwang; Zaiqing Nie; Ji-Rong Wen,Abstract Query result clustering has attracted considerable attention as a means of providingusers with a concise overview of results. However; little research effort has been devoted toorganizing the query results for entities which refer to real-world concepts; eg; people;products; and locations. Entity-level result clustering is more challenging because diversesimilarity notions between entities need to be supported in heterogeneous domains; eg;image resolution is an important feature for cameras; but not for fruits. To address thischallenge; we propose a hybrid relationship clustering algorithm; called Hydra; using co-occurrence and numeric features. Algorithm Hydra captures diverse user perceptions fromco-occurrence and disambiguates different senses using feature-based similarity. Inaddition; we extend Hydra into Hydra _ gData Hydra gData with different sources; ie …,The VLDB Journal,2013,16
Interactive skyline queries,Jongwuk Lee; Gae-won You; Seung-Won Hwang; Joachim Selke; Wolf-Tilo Balke,Abstract When issuing user-specific queries; users often present vague and impreciseinformation needs. Skyline queries with an intuitive query formulation mechanism identifythe most interesting objects for incomplete user preferences. However; the applicability ofskyline queries suffers from a severe drawback because incomplete user preferences oftenlead to an impractical skyline size. To address this problem; we develop an interactivepreference elicitation framework–while user preferences are collected at each iteration; theframework iteratively updates skylines. In this process; the framework aims to both minimizeuser interaction and maximize skyline reduction size; while the query formulation is stillintuitive. All that users need to do is thus to answer a few well-chosen questions generatedfrom the framework. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework in …,Information Sciences,2012,16
Skyline ranking for uncertain databases,Hyountaek Yong; Jongwuk Lee; Jinha Kim; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract Skyline queries have been actively studied to effectively identify interesting tupleswith low formulation overhead. This paper aims to support skyline queries for uncertain datawith maybe confidence. Prior skyline work for uncertain data assumes that each tuple isexhaustively enumerated with all possible probabilities of alternative confidence. However; itis inappropriate to some real-life scenarios; eg; scientific Web data or privacy-preservingdata; such that each tuple is associated with a probability of existence. We thus proposenovel skyline algorithms that efficiently deal with maybe uncertainty; leveraging auxiliaryindexes; ie; an R-tree or a dominance graph. We also discuss our proposed algorithms overdata dependency. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithms aresignificantly faster than a naive method by orders of magnitude.,Information Sciences,2014,15
MSSQ: Manhattan spatial skyline queries,Wanbin Son; Seung-won Hwang; Hee-Kap Ahn,Abstract Skyline queries have gained attention lately for supporting effective retrieval overmassive spatial data. While efficient algorithms have been studied for spatial skyline queriesusing the Euclidean distance; these algorithms are (1) still quite computationally intensiveand (2) unaware of the road constraints. Our goal is to develop a more efficient algorithm forL 1 distance; also known as Manhattan distance; which closely reflects road networkdistance for metro areas. We present a simple and efficient algorithm which; given a set P ofdata points and a set Q of query points in the plane; returns the set of spatial skyline points injust O (| P| log| P|) time; assuming that| Q|≤| P|. This is significantly lower in complexity thanthe best known method. In addition to efficiency and applicability; our algorithm has anotherdesirable property of independent computation and extensibility to L∞ norm distance …,Information Systems,2014,15
Efficient dual-resolution layer indexing for top-k queries,Jongwuk Lee; Hyunsouk Cho; Seung-won Hwang,Top-k queries have gained considerable attention as an effective means for narrowing downthe overwhelming amount of data. This paper studies the problem of constructing anindexing structure that efficiently supports top-k queries for varying scoring functions andretrieval sizes. The existing work can be categorized into three classes: list-; layer-; and view-based approaches. This paper focuses on the layer-based approach; pre-materializingtuples into consecutive multiple layers. The layer-based index enables us to return top-kanswers efficiently by restricting access to tuples in the k layers. However; we observe thatthe number of tuples accessed in each layer can be reduced further. For this purpose; wepropose a dual-resolution layer structure. Specifically; we iteratively build coarse-levellayers using skylines; and divide each coarse-level layer into fine-level sub layers using …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,14
VSkyline: Vectorization for efficient skyline computation,Sung-Ryoung Cho; Jongwuk Lee; Seung-Won Hwang; Hwansoo Han; Sang-Won Lee,Abstract A dominance test; which decides the dominance relationship between tuples; is acore operation in skyline computation. Optimizing dominance tests can thus improve theperformance of all existing skyline algorithms. Towards this goal; this paper proposes avectorization of dominance tests in SIMD architectures. Specifically; our vectorization canperform the dominance test of multiple consecutive dimensions in parallel; therebyachieving a speedup of SIMD parallelism degree in theory. However; achieving suchperformance gain is non-trivial due to complex control dependencies within the dominancetest. To address this problem; we devise an efficient vectorization; called VSkyline; whichperforms the dominance test with SIMD instructions by determining incomparability in ablock of four dimensional values. Experimental results using a performance monitor show …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2010,14
Optimal preference elicitation for skyline queries over categorical domains,Jongwuk Lee; Gae-won You; Seung-won Hwang; Joachim Selke; Wolf-Tilo Balke,Abstract When issuing user-specific queries; users often have a vaguely defined informationneed. Skyline queries identify the most “interesting” objects for users' incompletepreferences; which provides users with intuitive query formulation mechanism. However; theapplicability of this intuitive query paradigm suffers from a severe drawback. Incompletepreferences on domain values can often lead to impractical skyline result sizes. In particular;this challenge is more critical over categorical domains. This paper addresses this challengeby developing an iterative elicitation framework. While user preferences are collected ateach iteration; the framework aims to both minimize user interaction and maximize skylinereduction. The framework allows to identify a reasonably small and focused skyline set;while keeping the query formulation still intuitive for users. All that is needed is answering …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2008,13
Skyline ranking for uncertain data with maybe confidence,Hyountaek Yong; Jin-ha Kim; Seung-won Hwang,Skyline queries have been actively studied lately as they can effectively identify interestingcandidate objects with low formulation overhead. In particular; this paper studies supportingskyline queries for the uncertain data with “maybe” uncertainty; eg; automatically extracteddata. Prior skyline works on uncertain data assumes that every possible value for anuncertain object can be exhaustively enumerated (ie;“alternatives” uncertainty) which is notapplicable in many extraction scenarios. We develop fast algorithms that outperform thebaseline approach by orders of magnitude and validate them over extensive evaluations.,Data Engineering Workshop; 2008. ICDEW 2008.

Processing and optimizing main memory spatial-keyword queries,Taesung Lee; Jin-woo Park; Sanghoon Lee; Seung-won Hwang; Sameh Elnikety; Yuxiong He,Abstract Important cloud services rely on spatial-keyword queries; containing a spatialpredicate and arbitrary boolean keyword queries. In particular; we study the processing ofsuch queries in main memory to support short response times. In contrast; current state-of-the-art spatial-keyword indexes and relational engines are designed for differentassumptions. Rather than building a new spatial-keyword index; we employ a cost-basedoptimizer to process these queries using a spatial index and a keyword index. We addressseveral technical challenges to achieve this goal. We introduce three operators as thebuilding blocks to construct plans for main memory query processing. We then develop acost model for the operators and query plans. We introduce five optimization techniques thatefficiently reduce the search space and produce a query plan with low cost.

Mining entity translations from comparable corpora: a holistic graph mapping approach,Jinhan Kim; Long Jiang; Seung-won Hwang; Young-In Song; Ming Zhou,Abstract This paper addresses the problem of mining named entity translations fromcomparable corpora; specifically; mining English and Chinese named entity translation. Wefirst observe that existing approaches use one or more of the following named entitysimilarity metrics: entity; entity context; and relationship. Inspired by this observation; in thispaper; we propose a new holistic approach; by (1) combining all similarity types used and(2) additionally considering relationship context similarity between pairs of named entities; amissing quadrant in the taxonomy of similarity metrics. We abstract the named entitytranslation problem as the matching of two named entity graphs extracted from thecomparable corpora. Specifically; named entity graphs are first constructed from comparablecorpora to extract relationship between named entities.

Integrating code search into the development session,Mu-Woong Lee; Seung-won Hwang; Sunghun Kim,To support rapid and efficient software development; we propose to demonstrate our tool;integrating code search into software development process. For example; a developer; rightduring writing a module; can find a code piece sharing the same syntactic structure from alarge code corpus representing the wisdom of other developers in the same team (or in theuniverse of open-source code). While there exist commercial code search engines on thecode universe; they treat software as text (thus oblivious of syntactic structure); and fail atfinding semantically related code. Meanwhile; existing tools; searching for syntactic clones;do not focus on efficiency; focusing on “post-mortem” usage scenario of detecting clones“after” the code development is completed. In clear contrast; we focus on optimizingefficiency for syntactic code search and making this search “interactive” for large-scale …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,10
Skill ontology-based model for quality assurance in crowdsourcing,Kinda El Maarry; Wolf-Tilo Balke; Hyunsouk Cho; Seung-won Hwang; Yukino Baba,Abstract Crowdsourcing continues to gain more momentum as its potential becomes morerecognized. Nevertheless; the associated quality aspect remains a valid concern; whichintroduces uncertainty in the results obtained from the crowd. We identify the differentaspects that dynamically affect the overall quality of a crowdsourcing task. Accordingly; wepropose a skill ontology-based model that caters for these aspects; as a managementtechnique to be adopted by crowdsourcing platforms. The model maintains a dynamicallyevolving ontology of skills; with libraries of standardized and personalized assessments forawarding workers skills. Aligning a worker's set of skills to that required by a task; boosts theultimate resulting quality. We visualize the model's components and workflow; and considerhow to guard it against malicious or unqualified workers; whose responses introduce this …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2014,9
SocialSearch+: enriching social network with web evidences,Gae-won You; Jin-woo Park; Seung-won Hwang; Zaiqing Nie; Ji-Rong Wen,Abstract This paper introduces the problem of searching for social network accounts; eg;Twitter accounts; with the rich information available on the Web; eg; people names;attributes; and relationships to other people. For this purpose; we need to map Twitteraccounts with Web entities. However; existing solutions building upon naive textualmatching inevitably suffer low precision due to false positives (eg; fake impersonatoraccounts) and false negatives (eg; accounts using nicknames). To overcome theselimitations; we leverage “relational” evidences extracted from the Web corpus. We considertwo types of evidence resources—First; web-scale entity relationship graphs; extracted fromname co-occurrences crawled from the Web. This co-occurrence relationship can beinterpreted as an “implicit” counterpart of Twitter follower relationships. Second; web …,World Wide Web,2013,9

We first observethat existing approaches use one or more of the following named entity similarity metrics:entity; entity context; and relationship. Motivated by this observation; we propose a newholistic approach by 1) combining all similarity types used and 2) additionally consideringrelationship context similarity between pairs of named entities; a missing quadrant in thetaxonomy of similarity metrics. We abstract the named entity translation problem as thematching of two named entity graphs extracted from the comparable corpora.

The farthest spatial skyline queries,Gae-won You; Mu-Woong Lee; Hyeonseung Im; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract Pareto-optimal objects are favored as each of such objects has at least onecompetitive edge against all other objects; or “not dominated”. Recently; in the databaseliterature; skyline queries have gained attention as an effective way to identify such pareto-optimal objects. In particular; this paper studies the pareto-optimal objects in perspective offacility or business locations. More specifically; given data points P and query points Q in two-dimensional space; our goal is to retrieve data points that are farther from at least one querypoint than all the other data points. Such queries are helpful in identifying spatial locationsfar away from undesirable locations; eg; unpleasant facilities or business competitors. Tosolve this problem; we first study a baseline Algorithm TFSS and propose an efficientprogressive Algorithm BBFS; which significantly outperforms TFSS by exploiting spatial …,Information Systems,2013,9
Bootstrapping entity translation on weakly comparable corpora,Taesung Lee; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract This paper studies the problem of mining named entity translations fromcomparable corpora with some “asymmetry”.

Ourexperimental results on English-Chinese corpora show that our selective propagationapproach outperforms the previous approaches in named entity translation in terms of themean reciprocal rank by up to 0.16 for organization names; and 0.14 in a low comparabilitycase.,Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers),2013,9
Predictive Mining of Comparable Entities from the Web.,Myungha Jang; Jin-woo Park; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract Comparing entities is an important part of decision making. Several approacheshave been reported for mining comparable entities from Web sources to improve userexperience in comparing entities online. However; these efforts extract only entities explicitlycompared in the corpora; and may exclude entities that occur less-frequently but potentiallycomparable. To build a more complete comparison machine that can infer such missingrelations; here we develop a solution to predict transitivity of known comparable relations.Named CLIQUEGROW; our approach predicts missing links given a comparable entitygraph obtained from versus query logs. Our approach achieved the highest F1-score amongfive link prediction approaches and a commercial comparison engine provided by Yahoo!.,AAAI,2012,9
Exact indexing for support vector machines,Hwanjo Yu; Ilhwan Ko; Youngdae Kim; Seungwon Hwang; Wook-Shin Han,Abstract SVM (Support Vector Machine) is a well-established machine learningmethodology popularly used for classification; regression; and ranking. Recently SVM hasbeen actively researched for rank learning and applied to various applications includingsearch engines or relevance feedback systems. A query in such systems is the rankingfunction F learned by SVM. Once learning a function F or formulating the query; processingthe query to find top-k results requires evaluating the entire database by F. So far; thereexists no exact indexing solution for SVM functions. Existing top-k query processingalgorithms are not applicable to the machine-learned ranking functions; as they often makerestrictive assumptions on the query; such as linearity or monotonicity of functions. Existingmetric-based or reference-based indexing methods are also not applicable; because data …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,9
Surfacing code in the dark: an instant clone search approach,Jin-woo Park; Mu-Woong Lee; Jong-Won Roh; Seung-won Hwang; Sunghun Kim,Abstract In this paper; we study how to “surface” code for instant reference. A traditionalmode of surfacing code has been treating code as text and applying keyword searchtechniques. However; many prior work observes the limitation of such approach:(1) semanticdescription of code is limited to comments and (2) syntactic keyword is often not selectiveenough. In contrast; we discuss enabling techniques and scenarios of instant semantic-based surfacing. For example; developers; during a development session; may referencethe existing code sharing similar semantics; using his code so far as a query. In addition tosuch semantic-based surfacing; we also enhance keyword-based surfacing with semantics;by instantly adding semantic tags for code submitted to the repository. To achieve this goal;we first propose scalable indexing structures on vector abstractions of code. Our …,Knowledge and information systems,2014,8
Qaco: Exploiting partial execution in web servers,Jinhan Kim; Sameh Elnikety; Yuxiong He; Seung-won Hwang; Shaolei Ren,Abstract Web servers provide content to users; with the requirement of providing highresponse quality within a short response time. Meeting these requirements is challenging;especially in the event of load spikes. Meanwhile; we observe that a response to a requestcan be adapted or partially executed depending on current resource availability at theserver. For example; a web server can choose to send a low or medium resolution imageinstead of sending the original high resolution image under resource contention. In thispaper; we exploit partial execution to expose a trade off between resource consumption andservice quality. We show how to manage server resources to improve service quality andresponsiveness. Specifically; we develop a framework; called Quota-based ControlOptimization (QACO). The quota represents the total amount of resources available for all …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM Cloud and Autonomic Computing Conference,2013,8
Ursa: Scalable load and power management in cloud storage systems,Gae-Won You; Seung-Won Hwang; Navendu Jain,Abstract Enterprise and cloud data centers are comprised of tens of thousands of serversproviding petabytes of storage to a large number of users and applications. At such a scale;these storage systems face two key challenges:(1) hot-spots due to the dynamic popularityof stored objects; and (2) high operational costs due to power and cooling. Existing storagesolutions; however; are unsuitable to address these challenges because of the largenumber of servers and data objects. This article describes the design; implementation; andevaluation of Ursa; a system that scales to a large number of storage nodes and objects; andaims to minimize latency and bandwidth costs during system reconfiguration. Toward thisgoal; Ursa formulates an optimization problem that selects a subset of objects from hot-spotservers and performs topology-aware migration to minimize reconfiguration costs.

Prediction and predictability for search query acceleration,Seung-Won Hwang; Saehoon Kim; Yuxiong He; Sameh Elnikety; Seungjin Choi,Abstract A commercial web search engine shards its index among many servers; andtherefore the response time of a search query is dominated by the slowest server thatprocesses the query. Prior approaches target improving responsiveness by reducing the taillatency; or high-percentile response time; of an individual search server. They predict queryexecution time; and if a query is predicted to be long-running; it runs in parallel; otherwise; itruns sequentially. These approaches are; however; not accurate enough for reducing a hightail latency when responses are aggregated from many servers because this requires eachserver to reduce a substantially higher tail latency (eg; the 99.99 th percentile); which we callextreme tail latency. To address tighter requirements of extreme tail latency; we propose anew design space for the problem; subsuming existing work and also proposing a new …,ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB),2016,7
Solving graph isomorphism using parameterized matching,Juan Mendivelso; Sunghwan Kim; Sameh Elnikety; Yuxiong He; Seung-won Hwang; Yoan Pinzón,Abstract We propose a new approach to solve graph isomorphism using parameterizedmatching. To find isomorphism between two graphs; one graph is linearized; ie; representedas a graph walk that covers all nodes and edges such that each element is represented by aparameter. Next; we match the graph linearization on the second graph; searching for abijective function that maps each element of the first graph to an element of the secondgraph. We develop an efficient linearization algorithm that generates short linearization withan approximation guarantee; and develop a graph matching algorithm. We evaluate ourapproach experimentally on graphs of different types and sizes; and compare to theperformance of VF2; which is a prominent algorithm for graph isomorphism. Our empiricalmeasurements show that graph linearization finds a matching graph faster than VF2 in …,International Symposium on String Processing and Information Retrieval,2013,7
Spatial skyline queries: exact and approximation algorithms,Mu-Woong Lee; Wanbin Son; Hee-Kap Ahn; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract As more data-intensive applications emerge; advanced retrieval semantics; such asranking and skylines; have attracted the attention of researchers. Geographic informationsystems are a good example of an application using a massive amount of spatial data. Ourgoal is to efficiently support exact and approximate skyline queries over massive spatialdatasets. A spatial skyline query; consisting of multiple query points; retrieves data pointsthat are not father than any other data points; from all query points. To achieve this goal; wepresent a simple and efficient algorithm that computes the correct results; also propose a fastapproximation algorithm that returns a desirable subset of the skyline results. In addition; wepropose a continuous query algorithm to trace changes of skyline points while a query pointmoves. To validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm; we provide an …,GeoInformatica,2011,7
Commonsense Causal Reasoning between Short Texts.,Zhiyi Luo; Yuchen Sha; Kenny Q Zhu; Seung-won Hwang; Zhongyuan Wang,Abstract Commonsense causal reasoning is the process of capturing and understanding thecausal dependencies amongst events and actions. Such events and actions can beexpressed in terms; phrases or sentences in natural language text. Therefore; one possibleway of obtaining causal knowledge is by extracting causal relations between terms orphrases from a large text corpus. However; causal relations in text are sparse; ambiguous;and sometimes implicit; and thus difficult to obtain. This paper attacks the problem ofcommonsense causality reasoning between short texts (phrases and sentences) using adata driven approach. We propose a framework that automatically harvests a network ofcausal-effect terms from a large web corpus. Backed by this network; we propose a noveland effective metric to properly model the causality strength between terms. We show …,KR,2016,6
KSTR: Keyword-aware skyline travel route recommendation,Yu-Ting Wen; Kae-Jer Cho; Wen-Chih Peng; Jinyoung Yeo; Seung-won Hwang,With the popularity of social media (eg; Facebook and Flicker); users could easily share theircheck-in records and photos during their trips. In view of the huge amount of check-in dataand photos in social media; we intend to discover travel experiences to facilitate tripplanning. Prior works have been elaborated on mining and ranking existing travel routesfrom check-in data. We observe that when planning a trip; users may have some keywordsabout preference on his/her trips. Moreover; a diverse set of travel routes is needed. Toprovide a diverse set of travel routes; we claim that more features of Places of Interests(POIs) should be extracted. Therefore; in this paper; we propose a Keyword-aware SkylineTravel Route (KSTR) framework that use knowledge extraction from historical mobilityrecords and the user's social interactions.

ARIA: Asymmetry Resistant Instance Alignment.,Sanghoon Lee; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract We study the problem of instance alignment between knowledge bases (KBs).Existing approaches; exploiting the “symmetry” of structure and information across KBs;suffer in the presence of asymmetry; which is frequent as KBs are independently built.Specifically; we observe three types of asymmetries (in concepts; in features; and instructures). Our goal is to identify key techniques to reduce accuracy loss caused by eachtype of asymmetry; then design Asymmetry-Resistant Instance Alignment framework (ARIA).ARIA uses twophased blocking methods considering concept and feature asymmetries; witha novel similarity measure overcoming structure asymmetry. Compared to a state-ofthe-artmethod; ARIA increased precision by 19% and recall by 2%; and decreased processing timeby more than 80% in matching large-scale real-life KBs.,AAAI,2014,6

Efficient entity translation mining: A parallelized graph alignment approach,Gae-Won You; Seung-Won Hwang; Young-In Song; Long Jiang; Zaiqing Nie,Abstract This article studies the problem of mining entity translation; specifically; miningEnglish and Chinese name pairs. Existing efforts can be categorized into (a) transliteration-based approaches that leverage phonetic similarity and (b) corpus-based approaches thatexploit bilingual cooccurrences. These approaches suffer from inaccuracy and scarcity;respectively. In clear contrast; we use under-leveraged resources of monolingual entitycooccurrences crawled from entity search engines; which are represented as two entity-relationship graphs extracted from two language corpora; respectively. Our problem is thenabstracted as finding correct mappings across two graphs. To achieve this goal; we proposea holistic approach to exploiting both transliteration similarity and monolingualcooccurrences. This approach; which builds upon monolingual corpora; complements …,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2012,6
Supporting efficient distributed skyline computation using skyline views,Jongwuk Lee; Jinhan Kim; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract Skyline queries return a set of objects; or a skyline; that are not dominated by anyother objects. While providing users with an intuitive query formulation; the skyline queriesmay incur too many results; especially; for high dimensional data. To tackle this problem;subspace skyline queries; which deals with a subset of dimensions; have been recentlystudied. To identify interesting skylines; users can iteratively refine multiple relevantsubspaces for skyline queries. Existing work focuses primarily on supporting efficientsubspace skyline computation in centralized databases. In clear contrast; this paper aims toaddress subspace skyline computation in distributed environments such as the Web.Toward this goal; we make use of pre-computed subspace skylines as views in databases;called skyline views. Specifically; we propose distributed subspace skyline computation …,Information Sciences,2012,6
Web scale entity resolution using relational evidence,Taesung Lee; Zhongyuan Wang; Haixun Wang; Seung-won Hwang,ABSTRACT Entity resolution has been extensively studied. Many approaches have beenproposed; including using machine learning techniques to derive domain-specific lexicalsimilarity measures; or rank entities' attributes by their discriminative power; etc. In thispaper; we study the problem in the setting of matching two web scale taxonomies. Besidesthe scale; we address the challenge that the taxonomies may not contain enough context(such as attributes) for entity resolution; and traditional lexical similarity measures result inmany false positive matches. To tackle this new task; we explore negative evidence in thestructure of the taxonomy; as well as in external data sources such as the web. To integratepositive and negative evidence; we formulate the entity resolution problem as a problem offinding optimal multi-way cuts in a graph. We analyze the complexity of the problem; and …,*,2011,6
SkyTree: scalable skyline computation for sensor data,Jongwuk Lee; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract Skyline queries have gained attention for supporting multi-criteria analysis of large-scale datasets. While a lot of skyline algorithms have been proposed; most of the algorithmsbuild upon pre-computed index structures that cannot generally be supported over sensordata of dynamically changing attribute values. We aim to design a scalable non-indexskyline computation algorithm for sensor data. More specifically; we propose Algorithm SkyTree constructing a dynamic lattice that divides a specific region into several subregionsbased on a pivot point maximizing dominance region. Such structure enables to performregion-wise dominance tests; which eliminates unnecessary point-wise dominance tests. Inaddition; we ensure the progressiveness that has not been supported by any non-indexalgorithm; where we can identify k points maximizing the sum of dominance regions as …,Proceedings of the Third International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery from Sensor Data,2009,6
Supporting personalized top-k skyline queries using partial compressed skycube,Jongwuk Lee; Gae-won You; IkChan Sohn; Seung-won Hwang; Kwangil Ko; Zino Lee,Abstract As near-infinite amount of data are becoming accessible on the Web; it is gettingmore and more important to support intelligent query mechanisms; to help each user toidentify the ideal results of manageable size. As such mechanism; skyline queries havegained a lot of attention lately for its intuitive query formulation. This intuitiveness; however;has a side-effect of generating too many results; especially for high-dimensional data; tosatisfy a wide range of user's needs. Our goal is to support personalized skyline queries asidentifying" truly interesting" objects based on user-specific preference and retrieval size k.While this problem has been studied previously; the proposed solution identifies top-kresults by navigating a" skycube"; which incurs exponential storage overhead to datadimensionality and excessive one-time computational overhead for skycube construction …,Proceedings of the 9th annual ACM international workshop on Web information and data management,2007,6
Personalized ranking: A contextual ranking approach,Gae-won You; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract As data of an unprecedented scale are becoming accessible on the Web;personalization; of narrowing down the retrieval to meet the user-specific information needs;is becoming more and more critical. For instance; in the context of text retrieval; in contrast totraditional web search engines retrieving the same results for all users; major commercialsearch engines are starting to support personalization; improving the search quality byadapting to the user-specific retrieval contexts; eg; prior search history or other applicationcontexts. This paper studies how to enable such personalization in the context of structureddata retrieval. In particular; we adopt context-sensitive ranking model to formalizepersonalization as a cost-based optimization over context-sensitive rankings collected. Withthis formalism; personalization is essentially retrieving the context-sensitive ranking …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2007,6
Supporting ranking for data retrieval,Seung-Won Hwang,The explosion of internet usage has provided users with access to information in anunprecedented scale--The data retrieval problem of finding relevant data has thus become aclear challenge.

An Association Network for Computing Semantic Relatedness.,Keyang Zhang; Kenny Q Zhu; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract To judge how much a pair of words (or texts) are semantically related is a cognitiveprocess. However; previous algorithms for computing semantic relatedness are largelybased on co-occurrences within textual windows; and do not actively leverage cognitivehuman perceptions of relatedness. To bridge this perceptional gap; we propose to utilizefree association as signals to capture such human perceptions. However; free association;being manually evaluated; has limited lexical coverage and is inherently sparse. Wepropose to expand lexical coverage and overcome sparseness by constructing anassociation network of terms and concepts that combines signals from free associationnorms and five types of cooccurrences extracted from the rich structures of Wikipedia.

TPM: Supporting pattern matching queries for road-network trajectory data,Gook-Pil Roh; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract With the advent of ubiquitous computing; we can easily collect large scale trajectorydata from moving vehicles. This paper presents TPM (Trajectory Pattern Miner); a softwareaimed at pattern matching queries for road-network trajectory data; which complementsexisting efforts focusing on (a) a spatio-temporal window query for location-based service or(b) Euclidean space with no restriction. To overcome limitations of prior research; TPMsupports three types of pattern matching queries--whole; subpattern; and reverse sub-pattern matching for road-network trajectories. We demonstrate application scenarios foreach type of pattern matching queries using large-scale real-life trajectory data.,Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2011,5

Verb Pattern: A Probabilistic Semantic Representation on Verbs.,Wanyun Cui; Xiyou Zhou; Hangyu Lin; Yanghua Xiao; Haixun Wang; Seung-won Hwang; Wei Wang,Abstract Verbs are important in semantic understanding of natural language. Traditionalverb representations; such as FrameNet; PropBank; VerbNet; focus on verbs' roles. Theseroles are too coarse to represent verbs' semantics. In this paper; we introduce verb patternsto represent verbs' semantics; such that each pattern corresponds to a single semantic of theverb. First we analyze the principles for verb patterns: generality and specificity. Then wepropose a nonparametric model based on description length. Experimental results prove thehigh effectiveness of verb patterns. We further apply verb patterns to context-awareconceptualization; to show that verb patterns are helpful in semantic-related tasks.,AAAI,2016,4
Toward Scalable Indexing for Top-$ k $ Queries,Jongwuk Lee; Hyunsouk Cho; Sunyou Lee; Seung-won Hwang,A top-k query retrieves the best k tuples by assigning scores for each tuple in a targetrelation with respect to a user-specific scoring function. This paper studies the problem ofconstructing an indexing structure for supporting top-k queries over varying scoring functionsand retrieval sizes. The existing research efforts can be categorized into three approaches:list-; layer-; and view-based approaches. In this paper; we mainly focus on the layer-basedapproach that pre-materializes tuples into consecutive multiple layers. We first propose adual-resolution layer that consists of coarse-level and fine-level layers. Specifically; we buildcoarse-level layers using skylines; and divide each coarse-level layer into fine-levelsublayers using convex skylines. To make our proposed dual-resolution layer scalable; wethen address the following optimization directions: 1) index construction; 2) disk-based …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,4
Robust distributed indexing for locality-skewed workloads,Mu-Woong Lee; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract Multidimensional indexing is crucial for enabling a fast search over large-scaledata. Owing to the unprecedented scale of data; extending such indexing technology hasrecently gained attention in distributed environments. The goal of existing efforts indistributed indexing has been the localization of queries to data residing at a small numberof nodes (ie; locality-preserving indexing) to minimize communication cost. However;considering that workloads often correlate with data locality; such indexing often generateshotspots. Location-based queries are typically skewed to disaster areas during certainperiods of time; eg; during Hurricane Irene; search traffic increased by more than 2000%. Toalleviate such hotspots; we propose workload-balancing as an optimization goal. A costmodel analytically supporting the need for load balancing is first developed; then a …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,4
Scalable entity matching computation with materialization,Sanghoon Lee; Jongwuk Lee; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract Entity matching (EM) is the task of identifying records that refer to the same real-world entity from different data sources. While EM is widely used in data integration and datacleaning applications; the naive method for EM incurs quadratic cost with respect to the sizeof the datasets. To address this problem; this paper proposes a scalable EM algorithm thatemploys a pre-materialized structure. Specifically; once the structure is built; our proposedalgorithm can identify the EM results with sub-linear cost. In addition; as the rules evolve; ouralgorithm can efficiently adapt to new rules by selectively accessing records using thematerialized structure. Our evaluation results show that our proposed EM algorithm issignificantly faster than the state-of-the-art method for extensive real-life datasets.,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,4
Supporting personalized ranking over categorical attributes,Gae-won You; Seung-won Hwang; Hwanjo Yu,Abstract This paper studies how to enable an effective ranked retrieval over data withcategorical attributes; in particular; by supporting personalized ranked retrieval of highlyrelevant data. While ranked retrieval has been actively studied lately; existing efforts havefocused only on supporting ranking over numerical or text data. However; many real-life datacontain a large amount of categorical attributes; in combination with numerical and textattributes; which cannot be efficiently supported–unlike numerical attributes where a naturalordering is inherent; the existence of categorical attributes with no such orderingcomplicates both the formulation and processing of ranking. This paper studies the efficientand effective support of ranking over categorical data; as well as uniform support with othertypes of attributes.,Information Sciences,2008,4

CrowdK: Answering top-k queries with crowdsourcing,Jongwuk Lee; Dongwon Lee; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract In recent years; crowdsourcing has emerged as a new computing paradigm forbridging the gap between human-and machine-based computation. As one of the coreoperations in data retrieval; we study top-k queries with crowdsourcing; namely crowd-enabled top-k queries. This problem is formulated with three key factors; latency; monetarycost; and quality of answers. We first aim to design a novel framework that minimizesmonetary cost when latency is constrained. Toward this goal; we employ a two-phaseparameterized framework with two parameters; called buckets and ranges. On top of thisframework; we develop three methods: greedy; equi-sized; and dynamic programming; todetermine the buckets and ranges. By combining the three methods at each phase; wepropose four algorithms: GdyBucket; EquiBucket; EquiRange; and CrowdK. When the …,Information Sciences,2017,3
Efficient entity matching using materialized lists,Sanghoon Lee; Jongwuk Lee; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract Entity matching (EM) is the task of identifying records that refer to the same entityfrom different sources. EM is widely used in real-world applications such as data integrationand data cleaning; but the naive method of EM leads to exhaustive pair-wise comparisons.To enhance the efficiency of EM; we transform EM into the top-k query problem of identifyingthe best k results for a given match function; and propose a new EM algorithm using pre-materialized lists; which refer to the sorted lists of record pairs. Our proposed algorithmidentifies the EM results with sub-linear cost using the materialized lists. Because it requiresus to materialize the sorted lists with all record pairs; however; this approach can beimpractical. To address this problem; we reduce the size of the materialized lists; whichstores only 1% of all pairs without sacrificing EM accuracy. This method is inspired by the …,Information Sciences,2014,3
Efficient bitmap-based indexing of time-based interval sequences,Jong-won Roh; Seung-won Hwang; Byoung-Kee Yi,Abstract In this paper; we discuss similarity searches for time series data represented asinterval sequences. For instance; the time series of phone call records can be representedby time-based interval sequences; or T-interval sequences; which consist of the start andend times of the call records. To support an efficient similarity search for such sequences; weaddress the desirable semantics for similarity measures for the T-interval sequences;observe how existing measures fail to address such semantics; and propose a new measurethat satisfies all our semantics. We then propose approximate encoding methods for T-interval sequences. More specifically; we propose two bitmap-based feature extractionmethods:(1) a bin-bitmap encoding method that transforms the T-interval sequences intobitmaps of fixed length; and (2) a segmented feature extraction method that takes the …,Information Sciences,2012,3
Escaping a dominance region at minimum cost,Youngdae Kim; Gae-won You; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract Skyline queries have gained attention as an effective way to identify desirableobjects that are “not dominated” by another object in the dataset. From market perspective;such objects can be viewed as marketable; as each of such objects has at least onecompetitive edge against all the other objects; or not dominated. In other words; non-skylineobjects are not marketable; as there always exists another product excelling in all theattributes. The goal of this paper is; for such non-skyline objects; to identify the cost-minimalenhancement to become a skyline point to gain marketability. More specifically; we abstractthis problem as a mixed integer programming problem and develop a novel algorithm forefficiently identifying the optimal solution. Through extensive experiments using syntheticdatasets; we show that our proposed framework is both efficient and scalable over …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2008,3

Predicting Online Purchase Conversion for Retargeting,Jinyoung Yeo; Sungchul Kim; Eunyee Koh; Seung-won Hwang; Nedim Lipka,Abstract Generally 2% of shoppers make a purchase on the first visit to an online store whilethe other 98% enjoys only window-shopping. To bring people back to the store and closethe deal;" retargeting" has been a vital online advertising strategy that leads to" conversion"of window-shoppers into buyers. As such retargeting is more effective as a focused tool; inthis paper; we study the problem of identifying a conversion rate for a given product and itscurrent customers; which is an important analytics metric for retargeting process. Comparedto existing approaches using either of customer-or product-level conversion pattern; wepropose a joint modeling of both level patterns based on the well-studied buying decisionprocess.

Cost-aware triage ranking algorithms for bug reporting systems,Jin-woo Park; Mu-Woong Lee; Jinhan Kim; Seung-won Hwang; Sunghun Kim,Abstract Bug triaging of deciding whom to fix the bug has been studied actively. However;existing work does not consider varying cost of the same bug over developers with diversebackgrounds and experiences. In clear contrast; we argue the “cost” of one bug can be lowfor one developer; while high for another. Based on this view; we study an automatic triagingsystem considering both accuracy and cost. Our preliminary solution; CosTriage; modelsuser-specific experiences and estimated cost on each bug category; obtained from topicmodeling; and assigns the bug to the developer who not only can; but also is expected to fixfast. For user-specific cost modeling; we are inspired by recommender system work; ofestimating user-specific rating of items; eg; movies. With this view; existing triaging work ofcategorizing bugs and assigning developers with experiences in the category falls into …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2016,2
Cross-lingual type inference,Bo Xu; Yi Zhang; Jiaqing Liang; Yanghua Xiao; Seung-won Hwang; Wei Wang,Abstract Entity typing is an essential task for constructing a knowledge base. However; manynon-English knowledge bases fail to type their entities due to the absence of a reasonablelocal hierarchical taxonomy. Since constructing a widely accepted taxonomy is a hardproblem; we propose to type these non-English entities with some widely acceptedtaxonomies in English; such as DBpedia; Yago and Freebase. We define this problem ascross-lingual type inference. In this paper; we present CUTE to type Chinese entities withDBpedia types. First we exploit the cross-lingual entity linking between Chinese and Englishentities to construct the training data. Then we propose a multi-label hierarchicalclassification algorithm to type these Chinese entities. Experimental results show theeffectiveness and efficiency of our method.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2016,2
Understanding Emerging Spatial Entities.,Jinyoung Yeo; Jin-woo Park; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract In Foursquare or Google+ Local; emerging spatial entities; such as new business orvenue; are reported to grow by 1% every day. As information on such spatial entities isinitially limited (eg; only name); we need to quickly harvest related information from socialmedia such as Flickr photos. Especially; achieving high-recall in photo population isessential for emerging spatial entities; which suffer from data sparseness (eg; 71%restaurants of TripAdvisor in Seattle do not have any photo; as of Sep 03; 2015). Our goal isthus to address this limitation by identifying effective linking techniques for emerging spatialentities and photos. Compared with state-of-the-art baselines; our proposed approachimproves recall and F1 score by up to 24% and 18%; respectively. To show the effectivenessand robustness of our approach; we have conducted extensive experiments in three …,AAAI,2016,2
Fine-Grained Semantic Conceptualization of FrameNet.,Jin-woo Park; Seung-won Hwang; Haixun Wang,Abstract Understanding verbs is essential for many natural language tasks. To this end;large-scale lexical resources such as FrameNet have been manually constructed toannotate the semantics of verbs (frames) and their arguments (frame elements or FEs) inexample sentences. Our goal is to “semantically conceptualize” example sentences byconnecting FEs to knowledge base (KB) concepts. For example; connecting Employer FE tocompany concept in the KB enables the understanding that any (unseen) company can alsobe FE examples. However; a naive adoption of existing KB conceptualization technique;focusing on scenarios of conceptualizing a few terms; cannot 1) scale to many FE instances(average of 29.7 instances for all FEs) and 2) leverage interdependence between instancesand concepts. We thus propose a scalable k-truss clustering and a Markov Random Field …,AAAI,2016,2
Long concept query on conceptual taxonomies,Yi Zhang; Yanghua Xiao; Seung-won Hwang; Wei Wang,Abstract: This paper studies the problem of finding typical entities when the concept is givenas a query. For a short concept such as university; this is a well-studied problem of retrievingknowledge base such as Microsoft's Probase and Google's isA database pre-materializingentities found for the concept in Hearst patterns of the web corpus. However; we find mostreal-life queries are long concept queries (LCQs); such as top American private university;which cannot and should not be pre-materialized. Our goal is an online construction of entityretrieval for LCQs. We argue a naive baseline of rewriting LCQs into an intersection of anexpanded set of composing short concepts leads to highly precise results with extremely lowrecall. Instead; we propose to augment the concept list; by identifying related concepts of thequery concept. However; as such increase of recall often invites false positives and …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.09009,2015,2
Online clustering algorithms for semantic-rich network trajectories,Gook-Pil Roh; Seung-won Hwang,With the advent of ubiquitous computing; a massive amount of trajectory data has beenpublished and shared in many websites. This type of computing also provides motivation foronline mining of trajectory data; to fit user-specific preferences or context (eg; time of theday). While many trajectory clustering algorithms have been proposed; they have typicallyfocused on offline mining and do not consider the restrictions of the underlying road networkand selection conditions representing user contexts. In clear contrast; we study an efficientclustering algorithm for Boolean+ Clustering queries using a pre-materialized andsummarized data structure.

Skyline view: Efficient distributed subspace skyline computation,Jinhan Kim; Jongwuk Lee; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract Skyline queries have gained much attention as alternative query semantics withpros (eg low query formulation overhead) and cons (eg large control over result size). Toovercome the cons; subspace skyline queries have been recently studied; where usersiteratively specify relevant feature subspaces on search space. However; existing worksmainly focuss on centralized databases. This paper aims to extend subspace skylinecomputation to distributed environments such as the Web; where the most important issue isto minimize the cost of accessing vertically distributed objects. Toward this goal; we exploitprior skylines that have overlapped subspaces to the given subspace. In particular; wedevelop algorithms for three scenarios–when the subspace of prior skylines is superspace;subspace; or the rest.

Suchprojects; inherently requiring active learning; are reported to have both positive and negativecorrelations for student learning performance and responses. In this paper; we study how tomaximize the traditional benefits of active learning; such as promoting student motivation;while minimizing the negatives; such as students feeling lost and overwhelmed.

Ranking with tagging as quality indicators,Jongwuk Lee; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract As more and more Web documents are getting tagged; using tags to enhance thequality of retrieval has become an emerging challenge in the retrieval. In a clear contrast totraditional retrieval techniques solely focusing on content-based relevance to querykeyword; we aim at enhancing the retrieval with additional contextual information obtainedfrom tags; eg; popularity or reliability of the document. Toward the goal; this paper views atag as a" quality indicator" and classifies tags with various characteristics adopting thetaxonomy proposed in data quality modeling literatures. We then develop a unifiedframework for supporting arbitrary quality indicators in the taxonomy and evaluate itseffectiveness and efficiency over both real-life and synthetic data.,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2008,2
Efficient Keyword-Aware Representative Travel Route Recommendation,Yu-Ting Wen; Jinyoung Yeo; Wen-Chih Peng; Seung-won Hwang,With the popularity of social media (eg; Facebook and Flicker); users can easily share theircheck-in records and photos during their trips. In view of the huge number of user historicalmobility records in social media; we aim to discover travel experiences to facilitate tripplanning. When planning a trip; users always have specific preferences regarding their trips.Instead of restricting users to limited query options such as locations; activities; or timeperiods; we consider arbitrary text descriptions as keywords about personalizedrequirements. Moreover; a diverse and representative set of recommended travel routes isneeded. Prior works have elaborated on mining and ranking existing routes from check-indata. To meet the need for automatic trip organization; we claim that more features of Placesof Interest (POIs) should be extracted. Therefore; in this paper; we propose an efficient …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,1
Understanding relations using concepts and semantics,Jouyon Park; Hyunsouk Cho; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract The Financial Entity Identification and Information Integration (FEIII) task aims at thequestion of understanding relationships among financial entities and their roles using threesentences extracted from each financial contract containing the target word. FEIII task hastwo challenges-1) data sparseness: small training sets (9% of test data) and 2) contextsparseness: limited context (three sentences). Existing statistical approaches; such as Bayesand TF-IDF; cannot evaluate the imporatance of words unobservged in training data; whichis vulnerable to the above challenges. We overcome each challenge by considering 1) theconcepts of words from knowledge bases (Probase) in addition to the words themselves(conceptual feature) and 2) word semantics from distributed representations such asword2vec (semantic feature).

Graph-Based Wrong IsA Relation Detection in a Large-Scale Lexical Taxonomy.,Jiaqing Liang; Yanghua Xiao; Yi Zhang; Seung-won Hwang; Haixun Wang,Abstract Knowledge base (KB) plays an important role in artificial intelligence. Much efforthas been taken to both manually and automatically construct web-scale knowledge bases.Comparing with manually constructed KBs; automatically constructed KB is broader but withmore noises. In this paper; we study the problem of improving the quality for automaticallyconstructed web-scale knowledge bases; in particular; lexical taxonomies of isArelationships. We find that these taxonomies usually contain cycles; which are oftenintroduced by incorrect isA relations. Inspired by this observation; we introduce two kinds ofmodels to detect incorrect isA relations from cycles. The first one eliminates cycles byextracting directed acyclic graphs; and the other one eliminates cycles by grouping nodesinto different levels. We implement our models on Probase; a state-of-the-art …,AAAI,2017,1

ESC is useful in many applications such as related-entity recommendationand query expansion. Many example based entity suggestion solutions are available inexisting literatures. However; they are generally not aware of the concepts of query entitiesthus cannot be used for conceptual explanation.

KBQA: learning question answering over QA corpora and knowledge bases,Wanyun Cui; Yanghua Xiao; Haixun Wang; Yangqiu Song; Seung-won Hwang; Wei Wang,Abstract Question answering (QA) has become a popular way for humans to access billion-scale knowledge bases. Unlike web search; QA over a knowledge base gives out accurateand concise results; provided that natural language questions can be understood andmapped precisely to structured queries over the knowledge base. The challenge; however;is that a human can ask one question in many different ways. Previous approaches havenatural limits due to their representations: rule based approaches only understand a smallset of" canned" questions; while keyword based or synonym based approaches cannot fullyunderstand the questions. In this paper; we design a new kind of question representation:templates; over a billion scale knowledge base and a million scale QA corpora. Forexample; for questions about a city's population; we learn templates such as What's the …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,1

Such entity acquisitionqueries can be useful in many applications such as related-entity recommendation andquery expansion. A number of ESbE query processing solutions exist in the literature.However; they mostly build only on the idea of entity co-occurrences either in text or weblists; without taking advantage of the existence of many web-scale conceptual taxonomiesthat consist of hierarchical isA relationships between entity-concept pairs.

Overcoming Asymmetry in Entity Graphs,Taesung Lee; Young-rok Cha; Seung-won Hwang,This paper studies the problem of mining named entity translations by aligning comparablecorpora. Current state-of-the-art approaches mine a translation pair by aligning an entitygraph in one language to another based on node similarity or propagated similarity ofrelated entities. However; they; building on the assumption of “symmetry”; quickly deteriorateon “weakly” comparable corpora with some asymmetry. In this paper; we pursue twodirections for overcoming relation and entity asymmetry respectively. The first approachstarts from weakly comparable corpora (for high recall) then ensures precision by selectivepropagation only to entities of symmetric relations. The second approach starts from parallelcorpora (for high precision) then enhances recall by extending the translation matrix basedon node similarity and contextual similarity.

Fria: fast and robust instance alignment,Sanghoon Lee; Jongwuk Lee; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract This paper proposes Fria; a fast and robust instance alignment framework acrosstwo independently built knowledge bases (KBs). Our objective is two-fold:(1) to design aneffective instance similarity measure and (2) to build a fast and robust alignment framework.Specifically; Fria consists of two-phases. Fria first achieves high-precision alignment forseed matches which have strong evidence for aligning. To obtain high-recall alignment; Friathen divides non-matched instances according to the types identified from seeds; and givesadditional chances to the same-typed instances to be matched. Experimental results showthat Fria is fast and robust; by achieving comparable accuracy to state-of-the-arts and a 10-times speed up.,Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web,2013,1

In this paper; we study how existing approacheshave failed to support a combination of accuracy and privacy requirements and we proposea new data publishing framework that supports both areas. We show that satisfying bothrequirements is an essential problem and propose two comprehensive algorithms. We alsovalidated the correctness and efficiency of our approach using experiments.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,1
Ranking strategies and threats: a cost-based pareto optimization approach,Youngdae Kim; Gae-won You; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract Skyline queries have gained attention as an effective way to identify desirableobjects that are “not dominated” by another object in the dataset. From market perspective;such objects are favored as pareto-optimal choices; as each of such objects has at least onecompetitive edge against all other objects; or not dominated. In other words; non-skylineobjects have room for pareto-optimal improvements for more favorable positioning in themarket. The goal of this paper is; for such non-skyline objects; to identify the cost-minimalpareto-optimal improvement strategy. More specifically; we abstract this problem as a mixedinteger programming problem and develop a novel algorithm for efficiently identifying theoptimal solution. In addition; the problem can be reversed to identify; for a skyline product;top-k threats that can be competitors after pareto-optimal improvements with the k lowest …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2009,1
A logical account of uncertain databases based on linear logic,Sungwoo Park; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract A formal semantics of uncertain databases typically takes an algebraic approach bymapping an uncertain database to a set of relational databases; or possible worlds. Wepresent a new semantics for uncertain databases which takes a logical approach bytranslating uncertain databases into logical theories. A characteristic feature of oursemantics is that it uses linear logic; instead of propositional logic; as its logical foundation.Linear logic lends itself well to a logical interpretation of uncertain information becauseunlike propositional logic; it treats logical formulae not as persistent facts but as consumableresources.,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Database Theory,2009,1

PerRank: Personalized Rank Retrieval with Categorical and Numerical Attributes,Sangkyum Kim; Jaebum Kim; Younhee Ko; Seung-won Hwang; Jiawei Han,Ranking has been popularly used for intelligent data retrieval in both database and machinelearning communities. Recently; there were studies on integrating these two approaches tosupport soft queries; based on a user's sense of relevance and preference; for ranking withnumerical attributes. However; in real life; it is desirable to use categorical attributes togetherwith numerical ones in ranking. For example; when buying a car; categorical attributes; suchas make; model; color; and equipments; are considered as significant factors as numericalattributes; such as price and year. Meanwhile; users often do not have sufficient domainknowledge at formulating an effective selection query over categories; whereas rankformulation is even more challenging as categories have no inherent ordering.

Approximate Boolean+ Ranking Query Answering Using Wavelets,Youngdae Kim; Seung-won Hwang,As more and more data become accessible; ranking query semantics such as rankedretrieval; possibly combined with Boolean query conditions; has gained a lot of attentionlately. As the formulation of such queries is known to be difficult; we aim at providing quickapproximate answers as cues for interactive query refinements. Toward the goal; we studyapproximate answering techniques for Boolean+ ranking queries. While approximate queryanswering has been studied for Boolean-only queries; we observed that a straightforwardextension of this work for advanced queries incurs prohibitive overheads. We thus propose asystematic framework which significantly outperforms such a naive extension. We alsoempirically validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework.,Web-Age Information Management; 2008. WAIM'08. The Ninth International Conference on,2008,1
Unified framework for top-k query processing in peer-to-peer networks,William G Conner; Seung-won Hwang; Klara Nahrstedt,Supporting queries over dispersed data stored in large-scale distributed systems; such aspeer-to-peer networks; naturally calls for ranked retrieval in order to effectively focus on themost relevant (ie; top-k) results. While top-k retrieval has been actively studied lately;existing algorithms are too restrictive due to their assumptions about how the data ispartitioned amongst the various data sources. Unlike existing approaches that assume asingle type of data partitioning; we generalize the application scenario to include peer-to-peer networks of a potentially large number of peers in which the data might be partitionedin various ways. More specifically; we develop a novel unified top-k query processingframework supporting various types of data partitioning. In order to support top-k queries inour unified framework; we have developed very efficient wavelet-based data synopses …,*,2007,1
Optimizing ranked retrieval over categorical attributes,Seung-won Hwang,As the entry and archival of medical data are being digitized; more and more medical dataare becoming accessible. This paper studies how to enable an effective retrieval of medicaldata by ranked retrieval of only the most relevant highly-ranked data. While ranked retrievalhas been actively studied lately; existing works have focused mainly on supporting rankingover numerical or text data. However; many existing medical data contain a large amount ofcategorical attributes; eg; gender; race profile; or pain type; which cannot be efficientlysupported by either line of existing algorithms Unlike numerical attributes where a naturalordering is inherent; formulating and processing ranked retrieval over categorical attributeswith no such ordering are challenging. This paper studies an efficient and effective supportof ranking over categorical data; and also a uniform support with other types of attributes …,Computer-Based Medical Systems; 2006.

Aspect Sentiment Model for Micro Reviews,Reinald Kim Amplayo; Seung-won Hwang,This paper aims at an aspect sentiment model for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA)focused on micro reviews. This task is important in order to understand short reviewsmajority of the users write; while existing topic models are targeted for expert-level longreviews with sufficient co-occurrence patterns to observe. Current methods on aggregatingmicro reviews using metadata information may not be effective as well due to metadataabsence; topical heterogeneity; and cold start problems. To this end; we propose a modelcalled Micro Aspect Sentiment Model (MicroASM). MicroASM is based on the observationthat short reviews 1) are viewed with sentiment-aspect word pairs as building blocks ofinformation; and 2) can be clustered into larger reviews. When compared to the current state-of-the-art aspect sentiment models; experiments show that our model provides better …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2017 IEEE International Conference on,2017,*
Gradable Adjective Embedding for Commonsense Knowledge,Kyungjae Lee; Hyunsouk Cho; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract Adjective understanding is crucial for answering qualitative or subjective questions;such as “is New York a big city”; yet not as sufficiently studied as answering factoidquestions. Our goal is to project adjectives in the continuous distributional space; whichenables to answer not only the qualitative question example above; but also comparativeones; such as “is New York bigger than San Francisco?”. As a basis; we build on theprobability P (New York—big city) and P (Boston—big city) observed in Hearst patterns froma large Web corpus (as captured in a probabilistic knowledge base such as Probase). Fromthis base model; we observe that this probability well predicts the graded score of adjective;but only for “head entities” with sufficient observations. However; the observation of a city isscattered to many adjectives–Cities are described with 194 adjectives in Probase; and …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2017,*
Multimodal KB Harvesting for Emerging Spatial Entities,Jinyoung Yeo; Hyunsouk Cho; Jin-Woo Park; Seung-Won Hwang,New entities are being created daily. Though the novelty of these entities naturally attractsmentions; due to lack of prior knowledge; it is more challenging to collect knowledge aboutsuch entities than pre-existing entities; whose KBs are comprehensively annotated throughLBSNs and EBSNs. In this paper; we focus on knowledge harvesting for emerging spatialentities (ESEs); such as new businesses and venues; assuming we have only a list of ESEnames. Existing techniques for knowledge base (KB) harvesting are primarily associatedwith information extraction from textual corpora. In contrast; we propose a multimodalmethod for event detection based on the complementary interaction of image; text; and userinformation between multi-source platforms; namely Flickr and Twitter. We empiricallyvalidate our harvesting approaches improve the quality of KB with enriched place and …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2017,*

Probabilistic Prototype Model for Serendipitous Property Mining,Taesung Lee; Seung-won Hwang; Zhongyuan Wang,Abstract Besides providing the relevant information; amusing users has been an importantrole of the web. Many web sites provide serendipitous (unexpected but relevant) informationto draw user traffic. In this paper; we study the representative scenario of mining an amusingquiz. An existing approach leverages a knowledge base to mine an unexpected propertythen find quiz questions on such property; based on prototype theory in cognitive science.However; existing deterministic model is vulnerable to noise in the knowledge base.Therefore; we instead propose to leverage probabilistic approach to build a prototype thatcan overcome noise. Our extensive empirical study shows that our approach not onlysignificantly outperforms baselines by 0.06 in accuracy; and 0.11 in serendipity but alsoshows higher relevance than the traditional relevance-pursuing baseline using TF-IDF.,Proceedings of COLING 2016; the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers,2016,*
Crowdsourcing Identification of License Violations,Sanghoon Lee; Daniel M German; Seung-won Hwang; Sunghun Kim,Abstract Free and open source software (FOSS) has created a large pool of source codesthat can be easily copied to create new applications. However; a copy should preservecopyright notice and license of the original file unless the license explicitly permits such achange. Through software evolution; it is challenging to keep original licenses or chooseproper licenses. As a result; there are many potential license violations. Despite the fact thatviolations can have high impact on protecting copyright; identification of violations is highlycomplex. It relies on manual inspections by experts. However; such inspection cannot bescaled up with open source software released daily worldwide. To make this processscalable; we propose the following two methods: use machine-based algorithms to narrowdown the potential violations; and guide non-experts to manually inspect violations.

Understanding Relation Temporality of Entities,Taesung Lee; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract This paper demonstrates the importance of relation equivalence for entitytranslation pair discovery. Existing approach of understanding relation equivalence hasfocused on using explicit features of cooccurring entities. In this paper; we explore latentfeatures of temporality for understanding relation equivalence; and empirically show that theexplicit and latent features complement each other. Our proposed hybrid approach of usingboth explicit and latent features improves relation translation by 0.16 F1-score; and in turnimproves entity translation by 0.02.,Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers),2014,*

Finding influential products on social domination game,Jinyoung Yeo; Jin-woo Park; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract In this paper; we propose a new type of market model called the social dominationgame model. Given a set C of customers and a set P of products; this model simulatesmarket competition among P and estimates market shares; considering both the dominancerelation between C and P and the influence relation among the members of C. With thismodel; we propose a greedy product positioning algorithm for designing a new product thatapproximately maximizes market share. Our experimental results show that the proposedalgorithm creates a new product gaining up to 97.5% market share of the best product'smarket share obtained by the exact method; while significantly outperforming the exactmethod in terms of running time; ie; by up to two orders of magnitude.,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,*

Efficient and scalable geometric hashing method for searching protein 3D structures,Gook-Pil Roh; Seung-won Hwang; Byoung-Kee Yi,Abstract: As the structural databases continue to expand; efficient methods are required tosearch similar structures of the query structure from the database. There are many previousworks about comparing protein 3D structures and scanning the database with a querystructure. However; they generally have limitations on practical use because of largecomputational and storage requirements. We propose two new types of queries forsearching similar sub-structures on the structural database: LSPM (Local Spatial PatternMatching) and RLSPM (Reverse LSPM). Between two types of queries; we focus on RLSPMproblem; because it is more practical and general than LSPM. As a naive algorithm; weadopt geometric hashing techniques to RLSPM problem and then propose our proposedalgorithm which improves the baseline algorithm to deal with large-scale data and …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1102.2969,2011,*
Online Clustering Algorithms for Semantic-Rich Network,Gook-Pil Rob; Seung-won Hwang,Abstract With the advent of ubiquitous computing; a massive amount of trajectory data hasbeen published and shared in many websites. This type of computing also providesmotivation for online mining of trajectory data; to fit user-speciﬁc preferences or context (eg;time of the day). While many trajectory clustering algorithms have been proposed; they havetypically focused on offline mining and do not consider the restrictions of the underlying roadnetwork and selection conditions representing user contexts. In clear contrast; we study anefficient clustering algorithm for Boolean+ Clustering queries using a pie-materialized andsummarized data structure.

Instant Code Clone Search,Mu-Woong Lee Jong-Won Roh; Seung-won Hwang; Sunghun Kim,ABSTRACT In this paper; we propose a scalable instant code clone search engine for large-scale software repositories. While there are commercial code search engines available; theytreat software as text and often fail to find semantically related code. Meanwhile; existingtools for semantic code clone searches take a “post-mortem” approach involving thedetection of clones “after” the code development is completed; and hence; fail to return theresults instantly. In clear contrast; we combine the strength of these two lines of existingresearch; by supporting instant code clone detection. To achieve this goal; we proposescalable indexing structures on vector abstractions of code. Our proposed algorithms allowdevelopers to detect clones of a given code segment among the 1.7 million code segmentsfrom 492 open source projects in subsecond response times; without compromising the …,*,2010,*

Similarly;e-commerce sites; such as Amazon; are providing personalized product recommendationbased on the purchase history and user browsing behaviors. To achieve this goal; it isimportant to model user preference and mine user preferences from user behaviors (eg;click history) for personalization.

Recommendation: A Less Explored Killer-App of Uncertainty?,Seung-won Hwang; Jong-won Roh,Abstract Due to the unprecedented amount of information available; it is becoming more andmore important to provide personalized recommendations on data; based on past userfeedbacks. However; available user feedbacks or ratings are extremely sparse; whichmotivates the needs for rating prediction. The most widely adopted solution has beencollaborative filtering; which (1) identifies" neighboring" users with similar tastes and (2)aggregates their ratings to predict the ratings of the given user. However; while each of suchaggregation involves varying levels of uncertainty; eg; depending on the distribution ofratings aggregated; which has not been systematically considered in recommendation;though recent study suggests such consideration can boost prediction accuracy.

Supporting stratum access for fuzzy queries,Seung-won Hwang,Abstract This paper addresses the problem of retrieving query results by fuzzy association.Many works have studied applications that associate multiple objects by" fuzzy"(or" soft")conditions. For example; in heterogeneous data integration; similar name constants referringto the same entity are joined by the fuzzy notion of similarity; as they can differ in subtle ways(eg;" Jane Smith" and" J. Smith"). Similarly; in spatial queries; two objects are joined by thefuzzy measure of the distance between the two. However; these works are specific solely tothe specific target scenarios. This paper thus models representative access methods andformalizes this problem of supporting fuzzy associations in general; to unify existingapplications of varying scenarios and even unstudied applications. Further; we proposeoptimal algorithms that uniformly apply to varying access methods across applications.,Proceedings of the 24th IASTED international conference on Database and applications,2006,*

In such an application scenario; a large scale of accessible data frommultiple peers naturally calls for ranked retrieval in order to effectively focus the retrieval onthe most relevant; say top-k results.

These restrictive assumptions limit the flexibility of individual users toissue personalized queries. In contrast; we present efficient algorithms that support top-kretrieval customized to the specific predicates and scoring functions desired by the users.Also; unlike existing approaches that only consider a single type of data partitioning; we …,*,2006,*

Supporting Query-driven Mining over Autonomous Data Sources,Seung-won Hwang,Abstract As more and more data sources become accessible; mining relevant results hasbecome a clear challenge. In particular; this paper studies how to support such mining overautonomous sources with Boolean query capabilities; such as most Web e-commerce siteslike Amazon. com; which have been dominant sources of information recently. This task ischallenging: The notion of relevance is user-specific; in that desirable results may differacross users (and their contexts). Meanwhile; due to the autonomous nature of suchsources; it is becoming more and more unreasonable to expect that each user knowsenough about the underlying data to construct a complete user query describing her specificinformation needs. We thus develop “query completion” techniques to complement anincomplete initial query to retrieve user-specific relevant results of a certain desirable size …,Knowledge Acquisition from Distributed; Autonomous; Semantically Heterogeneous Data and Knowledge Sources (KADASH),*,*
