On-chip quantum simulation with superconducting circuits,Andrew A Houck; Hakan E Türeci; Jens Koch,Abstract Using a well-controlled quantum system to simulate complex quantum matter is anidea that has been around for 30 years and put into practice in systems of ultracold atoms formore than a decade. Much recent excitement has focused on a new implementation ofquantum simulators using superconducting circuits; where conventional microchipfabrication can be used to take design concepts to experimental reality; quickly and flexibly.Because the quantum 'particles' in these simulators are circuit excitations rather thanphysical particles subject to conservation laws; superconducting simulators provide acomplement to ultracold atoms by naturally accessing non-equilibrium physics. Here; wereview the recent wealth of theoretical explorations and experimental prospects of realizingthese new devices.,*,2012,583
Strong interactions in multimode random lasers,Hakan E Türeci; Li Ge; Stefan Rotter; A Douglas Stone,Unlike conventional lasers; diffusive random lasers (DRLs) have no resonator to trap lightand no high-Q resonances to support lasing. Because of this lack of sharp resonances; theDRL has presented a challenge to conventional laser theory. We present a theory able totreat the DRL rigorously and provide results on the lasing spectra; internal fields; and outputintensities of DRLs. Typically DRLs are highly multimode lasers; emitting light at a number ofwavelengths. We show that the modal interactions through the gain medium in such lasersare extremely strong and lead to a uniformly spaced frequency spectrum; in agreement withrecent experimental observations.,Science,2008,340
Unidirectional lasing from InGaN multiple-quantum-well spiral-shaped micropillars,GD Chern; HE Tureci; A Douglas Stone; RK Chang; M Kneissl; NM Johnson,We report unidirectional emission from lasing in In 0.09 Ga 0.91 N/In 0.01 Ga 0.99 N multiple-quantum-well spiral micropillars. Our imaging technique shows that the maximum emissioncomes from the notch of the spiral microcavities at an angle about 40° from the normal of thenotch. At room temperature; the spiral microcavity lases near 400 nm when optically pumpedwith 266 or 355 nm light. A reduction in the lasing threshold and an improvement inunidirectionality occurs when the microcavity is selectively pumped near its boundary.,Applied Physics Letters,2003,270
Pump-induced exceptional points in lasers,Matthias Liertzer; Li Ge; A Cerjan; AD Stone; HE Türeci; S Rotter,Abstract We demonstrate that the above-threshold behavior of a laser can be stronglyaffected by exceptional points which are induced by pumping the laser nonuniformly. Atthese singularities; the eigenstates of the non-Hermitian operator which describes the lasingmodes coalesce. In their vicinity; the laser may turn off even when the overall pump powerdeposited in the system is increased. Such signatures of a pump-induced exceptional pointcan be experimentally probed with coupled ridge or microdisk lasers.,Physical Review Letters,2012,246
Fermionized photons in an array of driven dissipative nonlinear cavities,Iacopo Carusotto; Dario Gerace; HE Tureci; Simone De Liberato; Cristiano Ciuti; A Imamoǧlu,Abstract We theoretically investigate the optical response of a one-dimensional array ofstrongly nonlinear optical microcavities. When the optical nonlinearity is much larger thanboth losses and intercavity tunnel coupling; the nonequilibrium steady state of the system isreminiscent of a strongly correlated Tonks-Girardeau gas of impenetrable bosons.Signatures of strong correlations are identified in the transmission spectrum of the system;as well as in the intensity correlations of the transmitted light. Possible experimentalimplementations in state-of-the-art solid-state devices are discussed.,Physical review letters,2009,213
Reversing the pump dependence of a laser at an exceptional point,M Brandstetter; M Liertzer; C Deutsch; P Klang; J Schöberl; HE Türeci; G Strasser; K Unterrainer; S Rotter,Abstract When two resonant modes in a system with gain or loss coalesce in both theirresonance position and their width; a so-called exceptional point occurs; which acts as asource of non-trivial physics in a diverse range of systems. Lasers provide a natural settingto study such non-Hermitian degeneracies; as they feature resonant modes and a gainmaterial as their basic constituents. Here we show that exceptional points can beconveniently induced in a photonic molecule laser by a suitable variation of the appliedpump. Using a pair of coupled microdisk quantum cascade lasers; we demonstrate that inthe vicinity of these exceptional points the coupled laser shows a characteristic reversal of itspump dependence; including a strongly decreasing intensity of the emitted laser light forincreasing pump power.,Nature communications,2014,183
Dramatic shape sensitivity of directional emission patterns from similarly deformed cylindrical polymer lasers,Harald GL Schwefel; Nathan B Rex; Hakan E Tureci; Richard K Chang; A Douglas Stone; Tahar Ben-Messaoud; Joseph Zyss,Recent experiments on similarly shaped polymer microcavity lasers show a dramaticdifference in the far-field emission patterns. We show; for different deformations of theellipse; quadrupole and hexadecapole; that the large differences in the far-field emissionpatterns are explained by the differing ray dynamics corresponding to each shape.Analyzing the differences in the appropriate phase space for ray motion; it is shown that thediffering geometries of the unstable manifolds of periodic orbits are the decisive factors indetermining the far-field pattern. Surprisingly; we find that strongly chaotic ray dynamics iscompatible with highly directional emission in the far field.,JOSA B,2004,182
The quantum-optical Josephson interferometer,Dario Gerace; Hakan E Türeci; Atac Imamoglu; Vittorio Giovannetti; Rosario Fazio,Abstract The photon-blockade effect; where nonlinearities at the single-photon level alter thequantum statistics of light emitted from a cavity 1; has been observed in cavity quantumelectrodynamics experiments with atomic 2; 3 and solid-state systems 4; 5; 6; 7; 8. Motivatedby the success of single-cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments; the focus hasrecently shifted to the exploration of the rich physics promised by strongly correlatedquantum-optical systems in multicavity and extended photonic media 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14.Even though most cavity quantum electrodynamics structures are inherently dissipative;most of the early work on strongly correlated photonic systems has assumed cavitystructures where losses are essentially negligible. Here we investigate a dissipativequantum-optical system that consists of two coherently driven linear optical cavities …,Nature Physics,2009,161
Self-consistent multimode lasing theory for complex or random lasing media,Hakan E Türeci; A Douglas Stone; B Collier,Abstract A semiclassical theory of single and multimode lasing is derived for open complexor random media using a self-consistent linear response formulation. Unlike standardapproaches which use closed cavity solutions to describe the lasing modes; we introduce anappropriate discrete basis of functions which describe also the intensity and angularemission pattern outside the cavity. This constant flux (CF) basis is dictated by the Greenfunction which arises when formulating the steady state Maxwell-Bloch equations as a self-consistent linear response problem. This basis is similar to the quasibound state basis whichis familiar in resonator theory and it obeys biorthogonality relations with a set of dualfunctions. Within a single-pole approximation for the Green function the lasing modes areproportional to these CF states and their intensities and lasing frequencies are …,Physical Review A,2006,153
Modes of random lasers,Jonathan Andreasen; AA Asatryan; LC Botten; MA Byrne; Hui Cao; Li Ge; Laurent Labonté; Patrick Sebbah; AD Stone; HE Türeci; Christian Vanneste,In conventional lasers; the optical cavity that confines the photons also determines essentialcharacteristics of the lasing modes such as wavelength; emission pattern; directivity; andpolarization. In random lasers; which do not have mirrors or a well-defined cavity; light isconfined within the gain medium by means of multiple scattering. The sharp peaks in theemission spectra of semiconductor powders; first observed in 1999; has therefore lead to anintense debate about the nature of the lasing modes in these so-called lasers with resonantfeedback. We review numerical and theoretical studies aimed at clarifying the nature of thelasing modes in disordered scattering systems with gain. The past decade has witnessedthe emergence of the idea that even the low-Q resonances of such open systems could playa role similar to the cavity modes of a conventional laser and produce sharp lasing peaks …,Advances in Optics and Photonics,2011,139
Dispersive photon blockade in a superconducting circuit,Anthony J Hoffman; Srikanth J Srinivasan; Sebastian Schmidt; Lafe Spietz; José Aumentado; Hakan E Türeci; Andrew A Houck,Abstract Mediated photon-photon interactions are realized in a superconducting coplanarwaveguide cavity coupled to a superconducting charge qubit. These nonresonantinteractions blockade the transmission of photons through the cavity. This so-calleddispersive photon blockade is characterized by measuring the total transmitted power whilevarying the energy spectrum of the photons incident on the cavity. A staircase with fourdistinct steps is observed and can be understood in an analogy with electron transport andthe Coulomb blockade in quantum dots. This work differs from previous efforts in that thecavity-qubit excitations retain a photonic nature rather than a hybridization of qubit andphoton and provides the needed tolerance to disorder for future condensed matterexperiments.,Physical review letters,2011,132
Fresnel filtering in lasing emission from scarred modes of wave-chaotic optical resonators,NB Rex; HE Tureci; HGL Schwefel; RK Chang; A Douglas Stone,Abstract We study lasing emission from asymmetric resonant cavity GaN microlasers. Bycomparing far-field intensity patterns with images of the microlaser we find that the lasingmodes are concentrated on three-bounce unstable periodic ray orbits; ie; the modes arescarred. The high-intensity emission directions of these scarred modes are completelydifferent from those predicted by applying Snell's law to the ray orbit. This effect is due to theprocess of “Fresnel filtering” which occurs when a beam of finite angular spread is incidentat the critical angle for total internal reflection.,Physical review letters,2002,120
Signatures of the superfluid-insulator phase transition in laser-driven dissipative nonlinear cavity arrays,A Tomadin; V Giovannetti; R Fazio; D Gerace; I Carusotto; HE Türeci; A Imamoglu,Abstract We analyze the nonequilibrium dynamics of a gas of interacting photons in an arrayof coupled dissipative nonlinear cavities when driven by a pulsed external coherent field.Using a mean-field approach; we show that the response of the system is strongly sensitiveto the underlying (equilibrium) quantum phase transition from a Mott insulator to a superfluidstate at commensurate filling. We find that the coherence of the cavity emission after aquantum quench can be used to determine the phase diagram of an optical many-bodysystem even in the presence of dissipation.,Physical Review A,2010,110
Nonequilibrium dynamics of coupled qubit-cavity arrays,Felix Nissen; Sebastian Schmidt; Matteo Biondi; Gianni Blatter; Hakan E Türeci; Jonathan Keeling,Abstract We study the coherence and fluorescence properties of the coherently pumped anddissipative Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model describing polaritons in a coupled-cavityarray. At weak hopping we find strong signatures of photon blockade similar to single-cavitysystems. At strong hopping the state of the photons in the array depends on its size. Whilethe photon blockade persists in a dimer consisting of two coupled cavities; a coherent stateforms on an extended lattice; which can be described in terms of a semiclassical model.,Physical review letters,2012,103
Phase transition of light in cavity QED lattices,Marco Schiro; Mykola Bordyuh; B Öztop; HE Türeci,Abstract Systems of strongly interacting atoms and photons; which can be realized wiring upindividual cavity QED systems into lattices; are perceived as a new platform for quantumsimulation. While sharing important properties with other systems of interacting quantumparticles; here we argue that the nature of light-matter interaction gives rise to uniquefeatures with no analogs in condensed matter or atomic physics setups. By discussing thephysics of a lattice model of delocalized photons coupled locally with two-level systemsthrough the elementary light-matter interaction described by the Rabi model; we argue thatthe inclusion of counterrotating terms; so far neglected; is crucial to stabilize finite-densityquantum phases of correlated photons out of the vacuum; with no need for an artificiallyengineered chemical potential. We show that the competition between photon …,Physical review letters,2012,97
Observation of a dissipation-induced classical to quantum transition,James Raftery; Darius Sadri; Sebastian Schmidt; Hakan E Türeci; Andrew A Houck,Abstract Here; we report the experimental observation of a dynamical quantum phasetransition in a strongly interacting open photonic system. The system studied; comprising aJaynes-Cummings dimer realized on a superconducting circuit platform; exhibits adissipation-driven localization transition. Signatures of the transition in the homodyne signaland photon number reveal this transition to be from a regime of classical oscillations into amacroscopically self-trapped state manifesting revivals; a fundamentally quantumphenomenon. This experiment also demonstrates a small-scale realization of a new class ofquantum simulator; whose well-controlled coherent and dissipative dynamics is suited to thestudy of quantum many-body phenomena out of equilibrium.,Physical Review X,2014,95
Bosonic condensation and disorder-induced localization in a flat band,F Baboux; L Ge; T Jacqmin; M Biondi; E Galopin; A Lemaître; L Le Gratiet; I Sagnes; S Schmidt; HE Türeci; A Amo; J Bloch,Abstract We report on the engineering of a nondispersive (flat) energy band in ageometrically frustrated lattice of micropillar optical cavities. By taking advantage of the non-Hermitian nature of our system; we achieve bosonic condensation of exciton polaritons intothe flat band. Because of the infinite effective mass in such a band; the condensate is highlysensitive to disorder and fragments into localized modes reflecting the elementaryeigenstates produced by geometric frustration. This realization offers a novel approach tostudying coherent phases of light and matter under the controlled interplay of frustration;interactions; and dissipation.,Physical review letters,2016,94
Quantum quench of Kondo correlations in optical absorption,Christian Latta; Florian Haupt; Markus Hanl; Andreas Weichselbaum; Martin Claassen; Wolf Wuester; Parisa Fallahi; Stefan Faelt; Leonid Glazman; Jan von Delft; Hakan E Türeci; Atac Imamoglu,Abstract The interaction between a single confined spin and the spins of an electronreservoir leads to one of the most remarkable phenomena of many-body physics—theKondo effect 1; 2. Electronic transport measurements on single artificial atoms; or quantumdots; have made it possible to study the effect in great detail 3; 4; 5. Here we report opticalmeasurements on a single semiconductor quantum dot tunnel-coupled to a degenerateelectron gas which show that absorption of a single photon leads to an abrupt change in thesystem Hamiltonian and a quantum quench of Kondo correlations. By inferring thecharacteristic power-law exponents from the experimental absorption line shapes; we find aunique signature of the quench in the form of an Anderson orthogonality catastrophe 6; 7;induced by a vanishing overlap between the initial and final many-body wavefunctions …,Nature,2011,89
Nonequilibrium delocalization-localization transition of photons in circuit quantum electrodynamics,S Schmidt; D Gerace; AA Houck; G Blatter; Hakan E Türeci,Abstract We show that photons in two tunnel-coupled microwave resonators each containinga single superconducting qubit undergo a sharp nonequilibrium delocalization-localization(self-trapping) transition due to strong photon-qubit coupling. We find that self-trapping ofphotons in one of the resonators (spatial localization) forces the qubit in the oppositeresonator to remain in its initial state (energetic localization). This allows for an easyexperimental observation of the transition by local readout of the qubit state. Dissipation ofphotons and decoherence of the qubit favor the self-trapped regime.,Physical Review B,2010,85
Modes of wave-chaotic dielectric resonators,Hakan E Tureci; Harald GL Schwefel; Philippe Jacquod; A Douglas Stone,Abstract: Dielectric optical micro-resonators and micro-lasers represent a realization of awave-chaotic system; where the lack of symmetry in the resonator shape leads to non-integrable ray dynamics. Modes of such resonators display a rich spatial structure; andcannot be classified through mode indices which would require additional constants ofmotion in the ray dynamics. Understanding and controlling the emission properties of suchresonators requires the investigation of the correspondence between classical phase spacestructures of the ray motion inside the resonator and resonant solutions of the waveequations. We first discuss the breakdown of the conventional eikonal approximation in theshort wavelength limit; and motivate the use of phase-space ray tracing and phase spacedistributions. Next; we introduce an efficient numerical method to calculate the quasi …,arXiv preprint physics/0308016,2003,85
Unconventional modes in lasers with spatially varying gain and loss,Li Ge; YD Chong; S Rotter; HE Türeci; A Douglas Stone,Abstract We discuss a class of lasing modes created by a spatially inhomogeneous gainprofile. These lasing modes are “extra modes;” in addition to; and very different from;conventional lasing modes; which arise from the passive cavity resonances. These newmodes do not have high intensity across the entire gain region; but instead are localized atthe gain boundary and throughout the gain-free region. They are surface modes; originatingfrom the transmission resonances of the gain-free region. Using an S-matrix description weconnect these surface modes to the lasing modes in P T-symmetric (balanced gain-loss)cavities.,Physical Review A,2011,83
Non-markovian decoherence of localized nanotube excitons by acoustic phonons,Christophe Galland; Alexander Högele; Hakan E Türeci; Ataç Imamoğlu,Abstract We demonstrate that electron-phonon interaction in quantum dots embedded inone-dimensional systems leads to pronounced; non-Markovian decoherence of opticaltransitions. The experiments that we present focus on the line shape of photoluminescencefrom low-temperature axially localized carbon nanotube excitons. The independent bosonmodel that we use to model the phonon interactions reproduces with very high accuracy thebroad and asymmetric emission lines and the weak red-detuned radial breathing modereplicas observed in the experiments. The intrinsic phonon-induced pure dephasing of thezero-phonon line is 2 orders of magnitude larger than the lifetime broadening and is ahallmark of the reduced dimensionality of the phonon bath. The non-Markovian nature of thisdecoherence mechanism may have adverse consequences for applications of one …,Physical review letters,2008,78
Excitations of optically driven atomic condensate in a cavity: theory of photodetection measurements,Barış Öztop; Mykola Bordyuh; Özgür E Müstecaplıoğlu; Hakan E Türeci,Abstract Recent experiments have demonstrated an open system realization of the Dickequantum phase transition in the motional degrees of freedom of an optically driven Bose–Einstein condensate in a cavity. Relevant collective excitations of this light–matter systemare polaritonic in nature; allowing access to the quantum critical behavior of the Dicke modelthrough light leaking out of the cavity. This opens the path to using photodetection-basedquantum optical techniques to study the dynamics and excitations of this elementaryquantum critical system. We first discuss the photon flux observed at the cavity face and findthat it displays a different scaling law near criticality than that obtained from the mean-fieldtheory for the equivalent closed system. Next; we study the second-order correlationmeasurements of photons leaking out of the cavity. Finally; we discuss a modulation …,New Journal of Physics,2012,69
Gaussian-optical approach to stable periodic orbit resonances of partially chaotic dielectric micro-cavities,Hakan E Tureci; HGL Schwefel; A Douglas Stone; EE Narimanov,The quasi-bound modes localized on stable periodic ray orbits of dielectric micro-cavitiesare constructed in the short-wavelength limit using the parabolic equation method. Thesemodes are shown to coexist with irregularly spaced??? chaotic??? modes for the genericcase. The wavevector quantization rule for the quasi-bound modes is derived and given asimple physical interpretation in terms of Fresnel reflection; quasi-bound modes are explictlyconstructed and compared to numerical results. The effect of discrete symmetries of theresonator is analyzed and shown to give rise to quasi-degenerate multiplets; the averagesplitting of these multiplets is calculated by methods from quantum chaos theory.,Optics Express,2002,67
Photon correlations in a two-site nonlinear cavity system under coherent drive and dissipation,Sara Ferretti; Lucio Claudio Andreani; Hakan E Türeci; Dario Gerace,Abstract We calculate the normalized second-order correlation function for a system of twotunnel-coupled photonic resonators; each one exhibiting a single-photon nonlinearity of theKerr type. We employ a full quantum formulation: The master equation for the model; whichtakes into account both a coherent continuous drive and radiative as well as nonradiativedissipation channels; is solved analytically in steady state through a perturbative approach;and the results are compared to exact numerical simulations. The degree of second-ordercoherence displays values between 0 and 1; and divides the diagram identified by the twoenergy scales of the system—the tunneling and the nonlinear Kerr interaction—into twodistinct regions separated by a crossover. When the tunneling term dominates over thenonlinear one; the system state is delocalized over both cavities; and the emitted light is …,Physical Review A,2010,63
Theory of the spatial structure of nonlinear lasing modes,Hakan E Türeci; A Douglas Stone; Li Ge,Abstract A self-consistent integral equation is formulated and solved iteratively whichdetermines the steady-state lasing modes of open multimode lasers. These modes arenaturally decomposed in terms of frequency dependent biorthogonal modes of a linear waveequation and not in terms of resonances of the cold cavity. A one-dimensional cavity laser isanalyzed and the lasing mode is found to have nontrivial spatial structure even in the single-mode limit. In the multimode regime spatial hole-burning and mode competition is treatedexactly. The formalism generalizes to complex; chaotic; and random laser media.,Physical Review A,2007,58
Many-body dynamics of exciton creation in a quantum dot by optical absorption: A quantum quench towards kondo correlations,Hakan E Türeci; M Hanl; M Claassen; A Weichselbaum; T Hecht; B Braunecker; A Govorov; L Glazman; Atac Imamoglu; J von Delft,Abstract We study a quantum quench for a semiconductor quantum dot coupled to aFermionic reservoir; induced by the sudden creation of an exciton via optical absorption. Thesubsequent emergence of correlations between spin degrees of freedom of dot andreservoir; culminating in the Kondo effect; can be read off from the absorption line shape andunderstood in terms of the three fixed points of the single-impurity Anderson model. At lowtemperatures the line shape is dominated by a power-law singularity; with an exponent thatdepends on gate voltage and; in a universal; asymmetric fashion; on magnetic field;indicative of a tunable Anderson orthogonality catastrophe.,Physical review letters,2011,56
Deviation from Snell’s law for beams transmitted near the critical angle: application to microcavity lasers,HE Tureci; A Douglas Stone,We show that when a narrow beam is incident upon a dielectric interface near the criticalangle for total internal reflection it will be transmitted into the far field with an angulardeflection from the direction predicted by Snell's law; because of a phenomenon that we call“Fresnel filtering.” This effect can be quite large for the parameter range that is relevant todielectric microcavity lasers.,Optics letters,2002,56
Ab initio self-consistent laser theory and random lasers,Hakan E Türeci; A Douglas Stone; Li Ge; Stefan Rotter; Robert J Tandy,Abstract We review our recent work leading to steady-state solutions of the semiclassical(Maxwell–Bloch) equations of a laser. These are coupled nonlinear partial differentialequations in space and time which have previously been solved either by fully time-dependent numerical simulations or by using major approximations which neglect nonlinearmodal interactions and/or the openness of the laser system. We have found a time-independent technique for determining these stationary solutions which can treat lasers ofarbitrary complexity and degree of openness. Our method has been shown to agree withtime-dependent numerical solutions to high accuracy and has been applied to find theelectric field patterns (lasing modes) of random lasers; which lack a laser cavity and are sostrongly damped that the linear system has no detectable resonances. Our work provides …,Nonlinearity,2008,54
Steady-state entanglement of spatially separated qubits via quantum bath engineering,Camille Aron; Manas Kulkarni; Hakan E Türeci,Abstract We propose a scheme for driving a dimer of spatially separated qubits into amaximally entangled nonequilibrium steady state. A photon-mediated retarded interactionbetween the qubits is realized by coupling them to two tunnel-coupled leaky cavities whereeach cavity is driven by a coherent microwave tone. The proposed cooling mechanism relieson striking the right balance between the unitary and driven-dissipative dynamics of thequbit subsystem. We map the dimer to an effective transverse-field isotropic XY modelcoupled to a nonequilibrium bath that can be suitably engineered through the choice of drivefrequencies and amplitudes. We show that both singlet and triplet states can be obtainedwith remarkable fidelities. The proposed protocol can be implemented with asuperconducting circuit architecture that was recently experimentally realized and paves …,Physical Review A,2014,42
Beyond strong coupling in a multimode cavity,Neereja M Sundaresan; Yanbing Liu; Darius Sadri; László J Szőcs; Devin L Underwood; Moein Malekakhlagh; Hakan E Türeci; Andrew A Houck,Abstract Here; we report an experimental realization of multimode strong coupling in cavityquantum electrodynamics. This novel regime is achieved when a single artificial atom issimultaneously strongly coupled to a large; but discrete; number of nondegenerate photonicmodes of a cavity with coupling strengths comparable to the free spectral range. Ourexperiment reveals complex quantum multimode dynamics and spontaneous generation ofquantum coherence; as evidenced by resonance fluorescence spanning many modes andultranarrow linewidth emission. This work opens a new avenue for future experiments inlight-matter interactions and poses a challenge to current theoretical approaches to its study.,Physical Review X,2015,41
Quantitative verification of ab initio self-consistent laser theory,Li Ge; Robert J Tandy; A Douglas Stone; Hakan E Türeci,We generalize and test the recent??? ab initio??? self-consistent (AISC) time-independentsemiclassical laser theory. This self-consistent formalism generates all the stationary lasingproperties in the multimode regime (frequencies; thresholds; internal and external fields;output power and emission pattern) from simple inputs: the dielectric function of the passivecavity; the atomic transition frequency; and the transverse relaxation time of the lasingtransition. We find that the theory gives excellent quantitative agreement with full time-dependent simulations of the Maxwell-Bloch equations after it has been generalized to dropthe slowly-varying envelope approximation. The theory is infinite order in the non-linear hole-burning interaction; the widely used third order approximation is shown to fail badly.,Optics express,2008,41
Antisymmetric PT-photonic structures with balanced positive-and negative-index materials,Li Ge; Hakan E Türeci,Abstract We propose a class of synthetic optical materials in which the refractive indexsatisfies n (− x)=− n*(x). We term such systems antisymmetric parity-time (APT) structures.Unlike PT-symmetric systems; which require balanced gain and loss; ie; n (− x)= n*(x); APTsystems consist of balanced positive-and negative-index materials. Despite the seeminglyPT-symmetric optical potential V (x)≡ n (x) 2 ω 2/c 2; APT systems are not invariant undercombined PT operations due to the discontinuity of the spatial derivative of the wavefunction. We show that APT systems can display intriguing properties; such as spontaneousphase transition of the scattering matrix; a flat total transmission band; and a continuouslasing spectrum.,Physical Review A,2013,37
Cavity-mediated near-critical dissipative dynamics of a driven condensate,Manas Kulkarni; Baris Öztop; Hakan E Türeci,Abstract We investigate the near-critical dynamics of atomic density fluctuations in thenonequilibrium self-organization transition of an optically driven quantum gas coupled to asingle mode of a cavity. In this system cavity-mediated long-range interactions betweenatoms; tunable by the drive strength; lead to softening of an excitation mode recentlyobserved in experiments. This phenomenon has previously been studied within a two-modeapproximation for the collective motional degrees of freedom of the atomic condensate;which results in an effective open-system Dicke model. Here; including the full spectrum ofatomic modes we find a finite lifetime for a rotonlike mode in the Bogoliubov excitationspectrum that is strongly pump dependent. The corresponding decay rate and criticalexponents for the phase transition are calculated explaining the nonmonotonic pump …,Physical review letters,2013,36
Stabilizing entanglement via symmetry-selective bath engineering in superconducting qubits,ME Kimchi-Schwartz; L Martin; E Flurin; C Aron; M Kulkarni; HE Tureci; I Siddiqi,Abstract Bath engineering; which utilizes coupling to lossy modes in a quantum system togenerate nontrivial steady states; is a tantalizing alternative to gate-and measurement-based quantum science. Here; we demonstrate dissipative stabilization of entanglementbetween two superconducting transmon qubits in a symmetry-selective manner. We utilizethe engineered symmetries of the dissipative environment to stabilize a target Bell state; wefurther demonstrate suppression of the Bell state of opposite symmetry due to parityselection rules. This implementation is resource efficient; achieves a steady-state fidelity F=0.70; and is scalable to multiple qubits.,Physical review letters,2016,34
Progress in asymmetric resonant cavities: Using shape as a design parameter in dielectric microcavity lasers,HGL Schwefel; HE Tureci; A Douglas Stone; RK Chang,Abstract We report on progress in developing optical microresonators and micro-lasersbased on deformations of dielectric spheres and cylinders. We review the differentsemiconductor and polymer dye microlasers which have been developed and demonstratedusing this approach. All the lasers exhibit highly directional emission despite the presence ofray chaos in the system. Lasing has been demonstrated using both optical pumping andelectrical pumping in the case of InGaP quantum cascade lasers and very recently in GaNMQW lasers. Lasing modes based on stable and unstable periodic orbits have been foundas well as modes based on chaotic whispering gallery orbits; the lasing mode depends onthe material; shape and index of refraction. The lasing from modes based on unstable orbitsdominated for certain shapes in the GaN cylinder lasers; and is related to the “scarred” …,*,2004,34
Spin-orbit interaction in quantum dots in the presence of exchange correlations: An approach based on a good-spin basis of the universal Hamiltonian,Hakan E Türeci; Y Alhassid,Abstract We discuss the problem of spin-orbit interaction in a two-dimensional chaotic ordiffusive quantum dot in the presence of exchange correlations. Spin-orbit scattering breaksspin rotation invariance; and in the crossover regime between different symmetries of thespin-orbit coupling; the problem has no closed solution. A conventional choice of a many-particle basis in a numerical diagonalization is the set of Slater determinants built from thesingle-particle eigenstates of the one-body Hamiltonian (including the spin-orbit terms). Wedevelop a different approach based on the use of a good-spin many-particle basis that iscomposed of the eigenstates of the universal Hamiltonian in the absence of spin-orbitscattering. We introduce a complete labeling of this good-spin basis and use angularmomentum algebra to calculate in closed form the matrix elements of the spin-orbit …,Physical Review B,2006,32
Strong electron-hole exchange in coherently coupled quantum dots,Stefan Fält; Mete Atatüre; Hakan E Türeci; Yong Zhao; Antonio Badolato; Atac Imamoglu,Abstract We have investigated few-body states in vertically stacked quantum dots. Becauseof a small interdot tunneling rate; the coupling in our system is in a previously unexploredregime where electron-hole exchange plays a prominent role. By tuning the gate bias; weare able to turn this coupling off and study a complementary regime where total electron spinis a good quantum number. The use of differential transmission allows us to obtainunambiguous signatures of the interplay between electron and hole-spin interactions. Smalltunnel coupling also enables us to demonstrate all-optical charge sensing; where aconditional exciton energy shift in one dot identifies the charging state of the coupledpartner.,Physical review letters,2008,31
Ray-wave correspondence in the nonlinear description of stadium-cavity lasers,Susumu Shinohara; Takahisa Harayama; Hakan E Türeci; A Douglas Stone,Abstract We show that the solution of fully nonlinear lasing equations for stadium cavitiesexhibits a highly directional emission pattern. This directionality can be well explained by aray-dynamical model; where the dominant ray-escape dynamics is governed by the unstablemanifolds of the unstable short periodic orbits for the stadium cavity. Investigating the cold-cavity modes relevant for the lasing; we found that all of the high-Q modes have theemission directionality corresponding to that of the ray-dynamical model.,Physical Review A,2006,31
Anomalous transient amplification of waves in non-normal photonic media,Konstantinos G Makris; Li Ge; HE Türeci,Abstract Dissipation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in dynamical systems encountered innature because no finite system is fully isolated from its environment. In optical systems; akey challenge facing any technological application has traditionally been the mitigation ofoptical losses. Recent work has shown that a new class of optical materials that consist of aprecisely balanced distribution of loss and gain can be exploited to engineer novelfunctionalities for propagating and filtering electromagnetic radiation. Here we show ageneric property of optical systems that feature an unbalanced distribution of loss and gain;described by non-normal operators; namely; that an overall lossy optical system cantransiently amplify certain input signals by several orders of magnitude. We present amathematical framework to analyze the dynamics of wave propagation in media with an …,Physical Review X,2014,30
Cavity-coupled double-quantum dot at finite bias: Analogy with lasers and beyond,Manas Kulkarni; Ovidiu Cotlet; Hakan E Türeci,Abstract We present a theoretical and experimental study of photonic and electronictransport properties of a voltage biased InAs semiconductor double quantum dot (DQD) thatis dipole coupled to a superconducting transmission line resonator. We obtain the masterequation for the reduced density matrix of the coupled system of cavity photons and DQDelectrons accounting systematically for both the presence of phonons and the effect of leadsat finite voltage bias. We subsequently derive analytical expressions for transmission; phaseresponse; photon number; and the nonequilibrium steady-state electron current.

Exotic attractors of the nonequilibrium rabi-hubbard model,M Schiró; C Joshi; M Bordyuh; R Fazio; J Keeling; HE Türeci,Abstract We explore the phase diagram of the dissipative Rabi-Hubbard model; as could berealized by a Raman-pumping scheme applied to a coupled cavity array. There exist variousexotic attractors; including ferroelectric; antiferroelectric; and incommensurate fixed points;as well as regions of persistent oscillations. Many of these features can be understoodanalytically by truncating to the two lowest lying states of the Rabi model on each site. Wealso show that these features survive beyond mean field; using matrix product operatorsimulations.,Physical review letters,2016,22
Photon-mediated interactions: a scalable tool to create and sustain entangled states of N atoms,Camille Aron; Manas Kulkarni; Hakan E Türeci,Abstract We propose and study the use of photon-mediated interactions for the generation oflong-range steady-state entanglement between N atoms. Through the judicious use ofcoherent drives and the placement of the atoms in a network of cavity QED systems; abalance between their unitary and dissipative dynamics can be precisely engineered tostabilize a long-range correlated state of qubits in the steady state. We discuss the generaltheory behind such a scheme and present an example of how it can be used to drive aregister of N atoms to a generalized W state and how the entanglement can be sustainedindefinitely. The achievable steady-state fidelities for entanglement and its scaling with thenumber of qubits are discussed for presently existing superconducting quantum circuits.While the protocol is primarily discussed for a superconducting circuit architecture; it is …,Physical Review X,2016,22
Route from spontaneous decay to complex multimode dynamics in cavity QED,Dmitry O Krimer; Matthias Liertzer; Stefan Rotter; Hakan E Türeci,Abstract We study the non-Markovian quantum dynamics of an emitter inside an openmultimode cavity; focusing on the case where the emitter is resonant with high-frequencycavity modes. Based on a Green's-function technique suited for open photonic structures; westudy the crossovers between three distinct regimes as the coupling strength is graduallyincreased:(i) overdamped decay with a time scale given by the Purcell modified decayrate;(ii) underdamped oscillations with a time scale given by the effective vacuum Rabifrequency; and (iii) pulsed revivals. The final multimode strong-coupling regime (iii) givesrise to quantum revivals of the atomic inversion on a time scale associated with the cavityround-trip time. We show that the crucial parameter to capture the crossovers between theseregimes is the nonlinear Lamb shift; accounted for exactly in our formalism.,Physical Review A,2014,22
Coherent optical manipulation of triplet-singlet states in coupled quantum dots,Hakan E Türeci; JM Taylor; A Imamoglu,Abstract We show that spin-orbit coupling in a quantum dot molecule allows for coherentmanipulation of two-electron spin states using Raman transitions. Such two-electron spinstates defined by the singlet and triplet states of two exchange-coupled quantum dots canhave favorable coherence properties. In addition; two of the four metastable ground states inthis system can be used as auxiliary states that could facilitate implementation of tasks suchas mapping of spin states to that of a single propagating photon. We find that even weakspin-orbit effects—manifesting themselves as slightly different g factors for the electron andthe hole—would allow for the coherent Raman coupling of the singlet-triplet states. We alsodiscuss the possibilities for implementing quantum optical techniques for spin preparationand manipulation.,Physical Review B,2007,22
Mode competition and output power in regular and chaotic dielectric cavity lasers,Hakan E Tureci; A Douglas Stone,We use the multi-mode lasing equations of Haken to analyze the stationary state lasingpatterns of two-dimensional dielectric microcavity lasers of different shape; including thecircle and various smooth deformations of the circle. We find a generic increase in the poweroutput with deformation which is relatively insensitive to the specific form of the shapedeformation. In addition we find strong mode selection in favor of librational modes(including but not solely the bow-tie modes) in the case when the pumping is concentratednear the center of the cavity. These results point towards an explanation of the dramaticresults on power increase with deformation obtained by Gmachl et al. in quantum cascademicro-cylinder lasers. The sensitivity of the lasing solutions to the nature of the ray dynamics(chaotic; integrable and mixed) will also be analyzed.,Laser Resonators and Beam Control VIII,2005,22
Enhancement of laser power-efficiency by control of spatial hole burning interactions,Li Ge; Omer Malik; Hakan E Türeci,Abstract The laser is an out-of-equilibrium nonlinear wave system where the interplay of thecavity geometry and nonlinear wave interactions mediated by the gain medium determinesthe self-organized oscillation frequencies and the associated spatial field patterns. In thesteady state; a constant energy flux flows through the laser from the pump to the far field;with the ratio of the total output power to the input power determining the power-efficiency.Although nonlinear wave interactions have been modelled and well understood since theearly days of laser theory; their impact on the power-efficiency of a laser system is poorlyunderstood. Here; we show that spatial hole burning interactions generally decrease thepower-efficiency. We then demonstrate how spatial hole burning interactions can becontrolled by a spatially tailored pump profile; thereby boosting the power-efficiency; in …,Nature Photonics,2014,20
Pattern formation and strong nonlinear interactions in exciton-polariton condensates,Li Ge; Ani Nersisyan; Baris Oztop; Hakan E Tureci,Abstract: Exciton-polaritons generated by light-induced potentials can spontaneouslycondense into macroscopic quantum states that display nontrivial spatial and temporaldensity modulation. While these patterns and their dynamics can be reproduced through thesolution of the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation; a predictive theory of their thresholds;oscillation frequencies; and multi-pattern interactions has so far been lacking. Here werepresent such an approach based on the linear non-Hermitian modes of the complex-valued light-induced potential. We provide a simple analytic expression for the lowestthresholds that is able to explain the modal patterns observed in recent experiments forvarious pump geometries. We also show that the evolution of the condensate withincreasing pump strength is strongly geometry dependent and can display contrasting …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1311.4847,2013,17
Origin and implications of an A 2-like contribution in the quantization of circuit-QED systems,Moein Malekakhlagh; Hakan E Türeci,Abstract By placing an atom into a cavity; the electromagnetic mode structure of the cavity ismodified. In cavity QED; one manifestation of this phenomenon is the appearance of agauge-dependent diamagnetic term; known as the A 2 contribution. Although in atomiccavity QED; the resulting modification in the eigenmodes is negligible; in recentsuperconducting circuit realizations; such corrections can be observable and may havequalitative implications. We revisit the canonical quantization procedure of a circuit-QEDsystem consisting of a single superconducting transmon qubit coupled to a multimodesuperconducting microwave resonator. A complete derivation of the quantum Hamiltonian ofan open circuit-QED system consisting of a transmon qubit coupled to a leaky transmissionline cavity is presented.

Quantum phase transition of light in the Rabi–Hubbard model,M Schiró; M Bordyuh; B Öztop; HE Türeci,Abstract We discuss the physics of the Rabi–Hubbard model describing large arrays ofcoupled cavities interacting with two level atoms via a Rabi nonlinearity. We show that theinclusion of counter-rotating terms in the light–matter interaction; often neglected intheoretical descriptions based on Jaynes–Cumming models; is crucial to stabilize finite-density quantum phases of correlated photons with no need for an artificially engineeredchemical potential. We show that the physical properties of these phases and the quantumphase transition occurring between them is remarkably different from those of interactingbosonic massive quantum particles. The competition between photon delocalization andRabi nonlinearity drives the system across a novel Z 2 parity symmetry-breaking quantumphase transition between two gapped phases; a Rabi insulator and a delocalized super …,Journal of Physics B: Atomic; Molecular and Optical Physics,2013,15

Self-protected polariton states in photonic quantum metamaterials,Matteo Biondi; Sebastian Schmidt; Gianni Blatter; Hakan E Türeci,Abstract We investigate the single-photon transport properties of a one-dimensional coupledcavity array (CCA) containing a single qubit in its central site by coupling the CCA to twotransmission lines supporting propagating bosonic modes with linear dispersion. We findthat even in the nominally weak light-matter coupling regime; the transmission through along array exhibits two ultra-narrow resonances corresponding to long-lived; self-protectedpolaritonic states localized around the site containing the qubit. The lifetime of these states isfound to increase exponentially with the number of array sites; in sharp distinction to thepolaritonic Bloch modes of the cavity array.,Physical Review A,2014,13
Polarization properties and dispersion relations for spiral resonances of a dielectric rod,Harald GL Schwefel; A Douglas Stone; Hakan E Tureci,Dielectric microcavities based on cylindrical and deformed cylindrical shapes have beenemployed as resonators for microlasers. Such systems support spiral resonances with finitemomentum along the cylinder axis. For such modes the boundary conditions do notseparate; and simple TM and TE polarization states do not exist. We formulate a theory forthe dispersion relations and polarization properties of such resonances for an infinitedielectric rod of arbitrary cross section and then solve for these quantities for the case of acircular cross section (cylinder). Useful analytic formulas are obtained using the eikonal(Einstein–Brillouin–Keller) method; which are shown to be excellent approximations to theexact results from the wave equation. The major finding is that the polarization of theradiation emitted into the far field is linear up to a polarization critical angle (PCA) at …,JOSA B,2005,12
Proposed Rabi-Kondo correlated state in a laser-driven semiconductor quantum dot,Björn Sbierski; Markus Hanl; Andreas Weichselbaum; Hakan E Türeci; M Goldstein; Leonid I Glazman; Jan von Delft; Atac İmamoğlu,Abstract Spin exchange between a single-electron charged quantum dot and itinerantelectrons leads to an emergence of Kondo correlations. When the quantum dot is drivenresonantly by weak laser light; the resulting emission spectrum allows for a direct probe ofthese correlations. In the opposite limit of vanishing exchange interaction and strong laserdrive; the quantum dot exhibits coherent oscillations between the single-spin and opticallyexcited states. Here; we show that the interplay between strong exchange andnonperturbative laser coupling leads to the formation of a new nonequilibrium quantum-correlated state; characterized by the emergence of a laser-induced secondary spinscreening cloud; and examine the implications for the emission spectrum.,Physical review letters,2013,11
Threshold current reduction and directional emission of deformed microdisk lasers via spatially selective electrical pumping,Nyan L Aung; Li Ge; Omer Malik; Hakan E Türeci; Claire F Gmachl,We report on laser threshold current reduction and directional emission from quadrupole-shaped AlGaInAs microdisk diode lasers by selective electrical pumping. The directionalemission results from breaking the 2-fold rotation symmetry of the system by the introductionof a triangle-shaped contact geometry; and the laser threshold reduction results from a smallcurrent injection area. Room temperature laser operation is achieved in both pulsed andcontinuous-wave operation for a microdisk radius of 50 μ m and deformation constant of ε=0.09; with optical output power of more than 8 mW and 3 mW; respectively. Under pulsedoperation; the minimum measured threshold current for selectively pumped microlasers is42 mA; significantly lower than the minimum measured threshold current for uniformlypumped microlasers (58 mA) and standard ridge lasers (80 mA) of the same device size …,Applied Physics Letters,2015,10
Stochastic differential equations for quantum dynamics of spin-boson networks,Stephan Mandt; Darius Sadri; Andrew A Houck; Hakan E Türeci,Abstract A popular approach in quantum optics is to map a master equation to a stochasticdifferential equation; where quantum effects manifest themselves through noise terms. Wegeneralize this approach based on the positive-P representation to systems involving spin;in particular networks or lattices of interacting spins and bosons. We test our approach on adriven dimer of spins and photons; compare it to the master equation; and predict a noveldynamic phase transition in this system. Our numerical approach has scaling advantagesover existing methods; but typically requires regularization in terms of drive and dissipation.,New Journal of Physics,2015,10
Different doping from apical and planar oxygen vacancies in Ba 2 CuO 4− δ and La 2 CuO 4− δ: First-principles band structure calculations,Thomas Jarlborg; Bernardo Barbiellini; RS Markiewicz; Arun Bansil,Abstract First-principles band structure calculations for large supercells of Ba 2 CuO 4− δand La 2 CuO 4− δ with different distributions and concentrations of oxygen vacancies showthat the effective doping on copper sites strongly depends on where the vacancy is located.A vacancy within the Cu layer produces a weak doping effect while a vacancy located at anapical oxygen site acts as a stronger electron dopant on the copper layers and graduallybrings the electronic structure close to that of La 2− x Sr x CuO 4. These effects are robustand only depend marginally on lattice distortions. Our results show that deoxygenation canreduce the effect of traditional La/Sr or La/Nd substitutions. Our study clearly identifieslocation of the dopant in the crystal structure as an important factor in doping of the cuprateplanes.,Physical Review B,2012,10
Wave chaos in dielectric resonators: asymptotic and numerical approaches,Hakan E Tureci,Abstract Dielectric optical micro-resonators and micro-lasers represent a realization of awave-chaotic system; where the lack of symmetry in the resonator shape leads to non-integrable ray dynamics in the short-wavelength limit. Understanding and controlling theemission properties of such resonators requires the investigation of the correspondencebetween classical phase space structures of the ray motion inside the resonator and wave-functions. Semi-classical approaches to the resonances of deformed cylindrical resonatorsare analyzed first within the closed limit; which corresponds to the quantum billiard problemfrom the field of quantum chaos. The results are then generalized to the dielectric case. Wedevelop an efficient numerical algorithm to calculate the quasi-bound modes of dielectricresonators; which play a crucial role in determining the emission properties of micro …,*,2003,10
Nonequilibrium gas-liquid transition in the driven-dissipative photonic lattice,Matteo Biondi; Gianni Blatter; Hakan E Türeci; Sebastian Schmidt,Abstract We study the nonequilibrium steady state of the driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbardmodel with Kerr nonlinearity. Employing a mean-field decoupling for the intercavity hoppingJ; we find that the steep crossover between low and high photon-density states inheritedfrom the single cavity transforms into a gas–liquid bistability at large cavity-coupling J. Weformulate a van der Waals–like gas–liquid phenomenology for this nonequilibrium settingand determine the relevant phase diagrams; including a new type of diagram where a lobe-shaped boundary separates smooth crossovers from sharp; hysteretic transitions.Calculating quantum trajectories for a one-dimensional system; we provide insights into themicroscopic origin of the bistability.,Physical Review A,2017,9
Gain-tunable optomechanical cooling in a laser cavity,Li Ge; Sanli Faez; Florian Marquardt; Hakan E Türeci,Abstract We study the optical cooling of the cavity mirror in an active laser cavity. We find thatthe optical damping rate is vanishingly small for an incoherently pumped laser abovethreshold. In the presence of an additional external coherent drive however; the opticaldamping rate can be enhanced substantially with respect to that of a passive cavity. Weshow that the strength of the incoherent pump provides the means to tune the opticaldamping rate and the steady state phonon number. The system is found to undergo atransition from the weak optomechanical coupling regime to the strong optomechanicalcoupling regime as the strength of the incoherent pump is varied.,Physical Review A,2013,9

We next reformulate the singularitycondition in terms of a flow in the space of an auxiliary one-parameter family ofeigenproblems and argue that the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are analytic functionswithin a certain domain. Based on this analytic behavior; we present a numerical algorithmto compute a range of billiard eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors by only twodiagonalizations.,Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical,2007,9

Interacting quantum dot coupled to a Kondo spin: A universal Hamiltonian study,Stefan Rotter; Hakan E Türeci; Yoram Alhassid; A Douglas Stone,Abstract We study a Kondo spin coupled to a mesoscopic interacting quantum dot that isdescribed by the “universal Hamiltonian.” The problem is solved numerically bydiagonalizing the system Hamiltonian in a good-spin basis and analytically in the weak andstrong Kondo coupling limits. The ferromagnetic exchange interaction within the dot leads toa stepwise increase of the ground-state spin (Stoner staircase); which is modified nontriviallyby the Kondo interaction. We find that the spin-transition steps move to lower values of theexchange coupling for weak Kondo interaction; but shift back up for sufficiently strong Kondocoupling. The interplay between Kondo and ferromagnetic exchange correlations can beprobed with experimentally tunable parameters.,Physical review letters,2008,8
Stable switching among high-order modes in polariton condensates,Yongbao Sun; Yoseob Yoon; Saeed Khan; Li Ge; Mark Steger; Loren N Pfeiffer; Ken West; Hakan E Türeci; David W Snoke; Keith A Nelson,Abstract We report multistate optical switching among high-order bouncing-ball modes(“ripples”) and whispering-gallery modes (“petals”) of exciton-polariton condensates in alaser-generated annular trap. By tailoring the diameter and power of the annular trap; thepolariton condensate can be switched among different trapped modes; accompanied byredistribution of spatial densities and superlinear increase in the emission intensities;implying that polariton condensates in this geometry could be exploited for an all-opticalmultistate switch. A model based on non-Hermitian modes of the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation reveals that this mode switching arises from competition between pump-induced gain and in-plane polariton loss. The parameters for reproducible switching amongtrapped modes have been measured experimentally; giving us a phase diagram for mode …,Physical Review B,2018,7
Non-Hermitian coupled-mode theory for incoherently pumped exciton-polariton condensates,Saeed Khan; Hakan E Türeci,Abstract The generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation (gGPE) is an effectivephenomenological description for the dynamics of incoherently pumped exciton-polaritoncondensates. However; a brute force numerical simulation of the gGPE provides littlephysical insight into condensate formation under arbitrary pumping configurations; and isdemanding in terms of computational resources. We introduce in this paper a modaldescription of polariton condensation under incoherent pumping of arbitrary spatial profile;based on eigenmodes of the non-Hermitian generator of the linearized dynamics. A pump-dependent basis is then introduced to formulate a temporal coupled-mode theory thatcaptures condensate dynamics in the presence of all nonlinear interactions. Simulationsusing a single set of modes for a given pumping and trapping configuration agree very …,Physical Review A,2016,7

Shedding light on non-equilibrium dynamics of a spin coupled to fermionic reservoir,Hakan E Türeci; M Hanl; M Claassen; A Weichselbaum; T Hecht; B Braunecker; A Govorov; L Glazman; J Von Delft; A Imamoglu,Abstract: A single confined spin interacting with a solid-state environment has emerged asone of the fundamental paradigms of mesoscopic physics. In contrast to standard quantumoptical systems; decoherence that stems from these interactions can in general not betreated using the Born-Markov approximation at low temperatures. Here we study the non-equilibrium dynamics of a single-spin in a semiconductor quantum dot adjacent to afermionic reservoir and show how the dynamics can be revealed in detail in an opticalabsorption experiment. We show that the highly asymmetrical optical absorption lineshapeof the resulting Kondo exciton consists of three distinct frequency domains; corresponding toshort; intermediate and long times after the initial excitation; which are in turn described bythe three fixed points of the single-impurity Anderson Hamiltonian.

Correlated phonons and the T c-dependent dynamical phonon anomalies,T Hakioğlu; H Türeci,Abstract Anomalously large low-temperature phonon anharmonicities can lead to static aswell as dynamical changes in the low-temperature properties of the electron-phonon system.In this work; we focus our attention on the dynamically generated low-temperaturecorrelations in an interacting electron-phonon system using a self-consistent dynamicalapproach in the intermediate coupling range. In the context of the model; the polaroncorrelations are produced by the charge-density fluctuations which are generateddynamically by the electron-phonon coupling. Conversely; the latter is influenced in thepresence of the former. The purpose of this work is to examine the dynamics of this dualmechanism between the two using the illustrative Fröhlich model. In particular; the influenceof the low-temperature phonon dynamics on the superconducting properties in the …,Physical Review B,1997,7
Cutoff-free circuit quantum electrodynamics,Moein Malekakhlagh; Alexandru Petrescu; Hakan E Türeci,Abstract Any quantum-confined electronic system coupled to the electromagnetic continuumis subject to radiative decay and renormalization of its energy levels. When coupled to acavity; these quantities can be strongly modified with respect to their values in vacuum.Generally; this modification can be accurately captured by including only the closestresonant mode of the cavity. In the circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture; it is;however; found that the radiative decay rates are strongly influenced by far off-resonantmodes. A multimode calculation accounting for the infinite set of cavity modes leads todivergences unless a cutoff is imposed. It has so far not been identified what the source ofdivergence is. We show here that unless gauge invariance is respected; any attempt at thecalculation of circuit QED quantities is bound to diverge. We then present a theoretical …,Physical review letters,2017,6
Non-Markovian dynamics of a superconducting qubit in an open multimode resonator,Moein Malekakhlagh; Alexandru Petrescu; Hakan E Türeci,Abstract We study the dynamics of a transmon qubit that is capacitively coupled to an openmultimode superconducting resonator. Our effective equations are derived by eliminatingresonator degrees of freedom while encoding their effect in the Green's function of theelectromagnetic background. We account for the dissipation of the resonator exactly byemploying a spectral representation for the Green's function in terms of a set of non-Hermitian modes and show that it is possible to derive effective Heisenberg-Langevinequations without resorting to the rotating-wave; two-level; Born; or Markov approximations.A well-behaved time-domain perturbation theory is derived to systematically account for thenonlinearity of the transmon.

Solid-state spin-photon quantum interface without spin-orbit coupling,Martin Claassen; Hakan E Türeci; Atac Imamoğlu,Abstract We show that coherent optical manipulation of a single confined spin is possibleeven in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. To this end; we consider the non-Markoviandynamics of a single valence orbital hole spin that has optically induced spin-exchangecoupling to a low-temperature partially polarized electron gas. We show that the fermionicnature of the reservoir induces a coherent component to the hole spin dynamics that doesnot generate entanglement with the reservoir modes. We analyze in detail the competition ofthis reservoir-assisted coherent contribution with dissipative components displayingmarkedly different behavior at different time scales and determine the fidelity of opticallycontrolled spin rotations.,Physical review letters,2010,6

Locally-outcoupled cavity resonator having unidirectional emission,*,A locally-outcoupled optical resonator has whispering gallery modes existing in a nearlycircular resonator.

Interaction-induced mode switching in steady-state microlasers,Li Ge; David Liu; Alexander Cerjan; Stefan Rotter; Hui Cao; Steven G Johnson; Hakan E Türeci; A Douglas Stone,We demonstrate that due to strong modal interactions through cross-gain saturation; theonset of a new lasing mode can switch off an existing mode via a negative power slope. Inthis process of interaction-induced mode switching (IMS) the two involved modes maintaintheir identities; ie they do not change their spatial field patterns or lasing frequencies. For afixed pump profile; a simple analytic criterion for the occurrence of IMS is given in terms oftheir self-and cross-interaction coefficients and non-interacting thresholds; which is verifiedfor the example of a two-dimensional microdisk laser. When the spatial pump profile isvaried as the pump power is increased; IMS can be induced even when it would not occurwith a fixed pump profile; as we show for two coupled laser cavities. Our findings apply tosteady-state lasing and are hence different from dynamical mode switching or hopping …,Optics Express,2016,5
Inverse Vernier effect in coupled lasers,Li Ge; Hakan E Türeci,Abstract In this report we study the Vernier effect in coupled laser systems consisting of twocavities. We show that depending on the nature of their coupling; not only can the“supermodes” formed at overlapping resonances of these two cavities have the lowestthresholds as previously found; leading to lasing at these overlapping resonances and amanifestation of the typical Vernier effect; but also they can have increased thresholds andare hence suppressed; which can be viewed as an inverse Vernier effect. The inverseVernier effect can also lead to an increased free spectrum range and possibly single-modelasing; which may explain the experimental findings in several previous studies. Weillustrate this effect using two coupled micro-ring cavities and a micro-ring cavity coupled to aslab cavity; and we discuss its relation to the existence of exceptional points in coupled …,Physical Review A,2015,5

We show; for different deformations of theellipse; quadrupole and hexadecapole; that the large differences in the far-field emissionpatterns are explained by the differing ray dynamics corresponding to each shape.Analyzing the differences in the appropriate phase space for ray motion; it is shown that thediffering geometries of the unstable manifolds of periodic orbits are the decisive factors indetermining the far-field pattern. Surprisingly; we find that strongly chaotic ray dynamics iscompatible with highly directional emission in the far field.© 2004 Optical Society of AmericaOCIS codes: 140.3410; 140.1540; 140.4780; 140.3580; 350.3950.,QELS 2002 Technical Digest,2002,4

Employing a mean-field decoupling for the intercavity hopping$ J $; we find that the crossover between low and high photon-number states inherited fromthe single cavity transforms into a gas--liquid bistability at large $ J $. We determine theboundary separating smooth and sharp gas--liquid transitions in the $\Delta $--$ J $diagram; where the detuning $\Delta $ relates to the liquid-phase photon density; and findthat it exhibits a lobe structure strikingly reminiscent of the phase boundary in the equilibriumphase diagram of the Bose-Hubbard model.

Convergent expressions for Purcell rate and Lamb shift of superconducting qubit in an open multimode resonator,Alexandru Petrescu; Moein Malekakhlagh; Hakan Tureci,Abstract The accurate calculation of the Purcell decay rate and the Lamb shift of an atom inan open multimode environment is a long-standing problem. This problem attained a moreimmediate and practical significance with the advent of quantum information processing withsuperconducting quantum circuits. It is now recognized that any attempt at the more accuratecalculation of circuit QED quantities gives rise to divergent results unless high frequencycutoffs are introduced. We resolve this problem by presenting convergent expressions forthe Lamb shift and Purcell decay rate of a superconducting qubit coupled to an openmultimode resonator.

In cavity QED; this phenomenon manifests itself through theappearance of the A 2-contribution; a gauge-dependent diamagnetic term. Despite thenegligible effect in the case of atomic cavity QED systems; in recent superconducting circuitrealizations these corrections may be observable and have qualitative implications. In thistalk; we revisit the canonical quantization of a circuit QED system consisting of a singlesuperconducting transmon qubit coupled to a multimode superconducting microwaveresonator. We introduce a new set of modes that properly satisfies current conservation inthe entire circuit and discuss how in terms of this set of modes; light-matter coupling candeviate drastically from the previous theories in the literature. Finally; we present a sum …,APS Meeting Abstracts,2016,2
Multimode Strong Coupling in Circuit QED,Neereja Sundaresan; Yanbing Liu; Darius Sadri; Laszlo Szocs; Devin Underwood; Moein Malekakhlagh; Hakan Tureci; Andrew Houck,Abstract We present experimental and theoretical studies in the multimode strong coupling(MMSC) regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). In MMSC; a single atom issimultaneously coupled to a large; but discrete; number of cavity harmonics; with atom-modecoupling strengths comparable to the free spectral range (FSR). This regime is readilyaccessible in circuit QED; by strongly coupling a transmon qubit to a low fundamentalfrequency microwave cavity. We present some key results from our original experiment (PRX5; 021035; 2015); in which a transmon qubit; resonant with the 75th harmonic of a 90 MHzcavity; reached qubit-mode coupling strengths exceeding 30MHz. When this system iscoherently driven; we observed complex multimode fluorescence; with the notable formationof ultra-narrow linewidths.

Amplitude Bistability in the Multimode Regime of Circuit-QED,Moein Malekakhlagh; Neereja Sundaresan; Yanbing Liu; Darius Sadri; Andrew Houck; Hakan Tureci,Abstract In theory of dynamical systems; bistability refers to a situation where the system hastwo possible stable equilibrium states. For certain optical devices; it is possible to have tworesonant transmission states that only differ in amplitude and is referred as``opticalamplitude bistability.''This phenomenon occurs due to nonlinear nature of light-matterinteraction where the light absorption or blockade by the absorber strongly depends on thedrive strength. The transition between these two bistable solutions happens when theabsorber is saturated and no longer capable of blocking light. In this talk; we study thedynamics of a transmon qubit coupled to a large number of modes of a longsuperconducting resonator and driven by an external microwave drive. We introduce ageneralized theory of multimode amplitude bistability first discussed by CM Savage and …,APS Meeting Abstracts,2015,2
Toward Resource-Efficient Deterministic Entanglement in 3D Superconducting Qubits,ME Schwartz; L Martin; C Aron; M Kulkarni; HE Tureci; I Siddiqi,Abstract We present progress towards deterministic entanglement in a three-dimensional;superconducting qubit architecture; using only one continuous drive to engineer steady-state entanglement. Our protocol uses two (nominally) identical copper waveguide cavitiesthat each contain a transmon qubit. The cavities are directly coupled to one another andhybridize into symmetric and antisymmetric modes. The coupling of the cavities introduces acavity-mediated qubit coupling that splits the degeneracy between the singlet and tripletstates in the odd-parity subspace. By driving the cavities symmetrically and carefully tuningthe single drive amplitude and frequency to take advantage of the hybridized cavity densityof states; we aim to achieve bipartite entanglement that is stable against both dephasing andfinite qubit lifetime. In this talk; we present experimental progress towards this cavity …,APS Meeting Abstracts,2015,2
Non-Markovian Qubit Dynamics in Multimode Superconducting circuit cavities,Moein Malekakhlagh; Hakan Tureci; Dmitry Krimer; Matthias Liertzer; Stefan Rotter,Abstract Circuit QED provides a unique platform to investigate the quantum dynamics of anemitter while it is coupled to a large number of modes of an open multimodesuperconducting microwave resonator. In this talk; we will use a recently developed Green'sfunction method for open photonic systems to study the dynamics of a superconductingtransmon qubit coupled to a long superconducting microwave resonator. Then; we find thecrossover between three distinct regimes as the qubit-resonator coupling strength isgradually increased: 1. Overdamped decay with a timescale associated with Purcellmodified decay rate 2. Underdamped oscillations with a timescale given by the effectivevacuum Rabi frequency 3. Pulsed revivals with a timescale given by the resonator round-triptime,APS Meeting Abstracts,2014,2
Losing Emission from Stable and Unstable Modes of Deformed GaN Microdisks,Hakan E Tureci; Nathan B Rex; Harald GL Schwefel; Richard K Chang; A Douglas Stone,Deformed micro-disk lasers are known to provide low-threshold directional lasing.'Themodes which are found to provide feedback have usually simple geometric interpretations.The bowtie mode observed in1 is based on a stable four-bounce periodic ray orbit (PRO).Here; we report data from GaN micro-disk lasers at various deformations; where the lasingmodes are also found to be based on distinct PROs; but with varying stabilities. Thequadrupolar-deformed laser (QD) at e= 0.12 analyzed in detail in2 is found to lase onunstable triangular PROs; which strike the boundary near the critical angle. In case of thehexa-decapolar deformed laser (Q-HD); it is shown that one and the same PRO isresponsible for lasing over a wide range of deformations; although it undergoes a stable-to-unstable transition in that range. Furthermore; we show that a naive application of Snell's …,Quantum Electronics and Laser Science Conference,2002,2
Fluxon-Based Quantum Simulation in Circuit QED,Alexandru Petrescu; Hakan E Türeci; Alexey V Ustinov; Ioan M Pop,Abstract: Long-lived fluxon excitations can be trapped inside a superinductor ring; which isdivided into an array of loops by a periodic sequence of Josephson junctions in the quantumregime; thereby allowing fluxons to tunnel between neighboring sites. By tuning theJosephson couplings; and implicitly the fluxon tunneling probability amplitudes; a wide classof 1D tight-binding lattice models may be implemented and populated with a stable numberof fluxons. We illustrate the use of this quantum simulation platform by discussing the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model in the 1-fluxon subspace; which hosts a symmetry protectedtopological phase with fractionally charged bound states at the edges. This pair of localizededge states could be used to implement a superconducting qubit increasingly decoupledfrom decoherence mechanisms.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1712.08630,2017,1
Spatial correlations in driven-dissipative photonic lattices,Matteo Biondi; Saskia Lienhard; Gianni Blatter; Hakan E Türeci; Sebastian Schmidt,Abstract We study the nonequilibrium steady-state of interacting photons in cavity arrays asdescribed by the driven-dissipative Bose–Hubbard and spin-1/2 XY model. For this purpose;we develop a self-consistent expansion in the inverse coordination number of the array($\sim 1/z $) to solve the Lindblad master equation of these systems beyond the mean-fieldapproximation. Our formalism is compared and benchmarked with exact numerical methodsfor small systems based on an exact diagonalization of the Liouvillian and a recentlydeveloped corner-space renormalization technique. We then apply this method to obtaininsights beyond mean-field in two particular settings:(i) we show that the gas–liquidtransition in the driven-dissipative Bose–Hubbard model is characterized by large densityfluctuations and bunched photon statistics.(ii) We study the antibunching–bunching …,New Journal of Physics,2017,1
Energy dependence and scaling property of localization length near a gapped flat band,Li Ge; Hakan E Tureci,Abstract: Using a tight-binding model for a one-dimensional Lieb lattice; we show that thelocalization length near a gapped flat band behaves differently from the typical Urbach tail ina band gap: instead of reducing monotonically as the energy E moves away from the flatband energy E_ {FB}; the presence of the flat band causes a nonmonotonic energydependence of the localization length. This energy dependence follows a scaling propertywhen the energy is within the spread (W) of uniformly distributed diagonal disorder; ie thelocalization length is only a function of (E-E_ {FB})/W. Several other lattices are compared todistinguish the effect of the flat band on the localization length; where we eliminate; shift; orduplicate the flat band; without changing the dispersion relations of other bands. Using thetop right element of the Green's matrix; we derive an analytical relation between the …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1509.00881,2015,1
A chaotic approach clears up imaging,Harald GL Schwefel; Hakan E Türeci,Summary Lasers appear to be ideal light sources for a variety of projection and imagingsystems because of their spectral brightness and their ability to produce a beam of light thatcan be tightly collimated to travel long distances. Lasers owe these extraordinary propertiesto a quality called coherence. Yet; lasers are not widely used in imaging and projectionapplications; because the coherence of laser light is just too extreme. Spatiotemporalcoherence of the imaging source leads to artifacts such as speckle; caused by theuncontrolled scattering of laser light and multipath interference that degrade the imageconsiderably. Redding et al.(1) now report how a semiconductor laser based on a chaoticcavity can offer a “compact” solution to this problem. The availability of such low-cost; on-chip semiconductor lasers and the possibility to electrically modulate them make such …,Science,2015,1
Collective excitations of a laser driven atomic condensate in an optical cavity,B Öztop; Ö E Müstecaplıoğlu; Hakan E Türeci,Abstract We theoretically examine collective excitations of an optically driven atomic Bose–Einstein condensate; coupled to a high-finesse optical cavity. This open system has beenrecently used for the experimental demonstration of the Dicke superradiance of cavityphotons; which is simultaneously and mutually triggered by spontaneous breaking oftranslational symmetry of the condensate into a crystalline order. We first develop a Hartree–Fock mean field dynamical model of the physical system. Using this model; we compute thedynamics of the cavity photons; the condensate density profile and the Dicke phasetransition diagram. Both the imaginary-time and real-time evolution methods are used in thecalculations. Collective excitations are determined by the solving Bogoliubov–de Gennesequations.

Multi-mode lasing theory for complex or random lasers,A Douglas Stone; Hakan E Tureci,A long-standing problem in laser theory is the formulation of a model for lasing which correctlytreats the openness of the lasing medium/cavity and the non-linearity of the coupled matter-fieldequations. This mathematical challenge has become of great relevance with the current highinterest in complex or random lasers; for which the mode geometry is not fixed by the placementand orientation of mirrors and one typically has multi-mode lasing behavior. In this case manyspatially complex internal modes contribute to the external emission pattern and we currentlylack any theory to predict the directionality of emission patterns and to understand and predictthe output power as a function of pump strength. One class of systems of particular interest inthis regard are dielectric cavity lasers with complex and sometimes chaotic ray dynamics[1-3]; another class are ``random" lasers [4] in which light undergoes diffusive motion …,Photonic Metamaterials: From Random to Periodic,2006,1
Excitable Dynamics in a Josephson Junction Circuit,Gerasimos Angelatos; Hakan Tureci,In excitable systems; a small input pulse which is above threshold triggers a large outputpulse; after which the system relaxes back to the ground state. The notion of excitabilityplays an important role in several reaction-diffusion systems and in spiking behaviour ofnerve cells; and excitable lasers allow for the development of optical neural networks. Wepropose a Josephson junction based circuit that exhibits excitability and explore itsdynamics. We analyse this device using traditional master equation techniques as well as aphase-space stochastic differential equation approach ideally suited to these large; open;and out-of-equilibrium quantum systems. In particular; we highlight the important role ofquantum noise in this system and describe possible experimental implementations.,Bulletin of the American Physical Society,2018,*
T 1 renormalization of transmon qubits versus drive power,Hakan Tureci; Moein Malekakhlagh; Alexandru Petrescu,Recent experiments in circuit QED with a transmon qubit have found a strong dependenceof the qubit relaxation rate on the read-out drive power [1].

We consider a general situation where the qubit isembedded in an open linear electromagnetic environment; whose properties aredetermined by its Maxwell Green's function [2]. The two calculation strategies providesystematic corrections to the system poles to arbitrary order and are not limited by Hilbertspace truncation.,Bulletin of the American Physical Society,2018,*
Frequency combs in a Josephson junction circuit,Saeed Khan; Hakan Tureci,We investigate the dynamics of a microwave-driven Josephson junction capacitivelycoupled to a linear oscillator [1].

A Multimode Dial for Interatomic Interactions,Hakan E Türeci,Figure 1: Lev and colleagues [1] have demonstrated tunable photon-mediated interatomicinteractions by using a point-like atomic condensate (orange circle with solid line) in anoptical cavity (blue) that has an adjustable length (L) and is appropriately “pumped” with alaser beam (red). In the single-light-mode cavity regime (upper panel; 𝛿 L= 2 9. 2 𝜇 m); asingle mode mediates the interaction between the atomic condensate and its mirror image(orange circle with dashed line). In the multimode cavity regime (lower panel; 𝛿 L= 0 𝜇 m);the interaction is mediated by a bowtie-like mode that is formed from the superposition ofmany modes and is pinned to the condensate position. The interaction strength as a functionof the condensate's position x 1 in each case (middle panel) is determined through a simplerelationship between the interaction strength and the threshold pump power at which the …,Physics,2018,*

Competing role of interactions in synchronisation of exciton–polariton condensates,Saeed A Khan; Hakan E Türeci,Abstract We present a theoretical study of synchronisation dynamics of incoherently pumpedexciton–polariton condensates in coupled polariton traps. Our analysis is based on acoupled-mode theory for the generalised Gross–Pitaevskii equation; which employs anexpansion in non-Hermitian; pump-dependent modes appropriate for the pumped geometry.We find that polariton–polariton and reservoir-polariton interactions play competing rolesand lead to qualitatively different synchronised phases of the coupled polariton modes aspumping power is increased. Crucially; these interactions can also act against each other tohinder synchronisation. We map out a phase diagram and discuss the generalcharacteristics of these phases using a generalised Adler equation.,New Journal of Physics,2017,*
Stochastic methods for driven-dissipative quantum optics,Gerasimos Angelatos; Hakan Tureci,Abstract Driven-dissipative non-linear quantum circuits may display dynamics that is difficultto accurately capture using a master equation approach. To keep pace with rapidexperimental progress and increasing complexity in superconducting circuit quantumelectrodynamics systems; an effective computational approach is needed that is not limitedby Hilbert space truncation. We present a stochastic differential equation method to calculatedynamical observables which is based on an exact phase-space representation of thequantum density matrix. This formalism is an extension of our previous work and we presentresults for the full quantum dynamics of driven cavity-qubit systems for which thesemiclassical dynamics does not settle to a steady-state. In this parameter regime; thequantum system under consideration is most sensitive to noise. This stochastic approach …,APS Meeting Abstracts,2017,*
Nonreciprocal Signal Routing in an Active Quantum Network,Hakan E Tureci; Anja Metelmann,Abstract As superconductor quantum technologies are moving towards large-scaleintegrated circuits; a robust and flexible approach to routing photons at the quantum levelbecomes a critical problem. Active circuits; which contain driven linear or non-linearelements judiciously embedded in the circuit offer a viable solution. We present a generalstrategy for routing non-reciprocally quantum signals between two sites of a given lattice ofresonators; implementable with existing superconducting circuit components. Our approachmakes use of a dual lattice of superconducting non-linear elements on the links connectingthe nodes of the main lattice. Solutions for spatially selective driving of the link-elements canbe found; which optimally balance coherent and dissipative hopping of microwave photonsto non-reciprocally route signals between two given nodes.

Interaction-induced mode switching and threshold condensation in steady-state microlasers,L Ge; D Liu; SG Johnson; S Rotter; HE Türeci; A Cerjan; H Cao; AD Stone,In this talk we discuss two novel effects in steady state microlasers. The first one isinteraction-induced mode switching (IMS); where the onset of a new lasing mode switchesoff an existing mode via a negative power slope. It's a deterministic effect in steady statelasing and caused by cross saturation of the gain medium; hence it's different from dynamicmode switching or hopping. For a fixed pump profile; a simple analytic criterion for theoccurrence of IMS is given in terms of their self-and cross-interaction coefficients and non-interacting thresholds; which is verified for the example of a two-dimensional microdisklaser. When the spatial pump profile is varied as the pump power is increased; IMS can beinduced even when it would not occur with a fixed pump profile; as we show for two coupledlaser cavities.,Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS),2016,*
Directionality in photonic arrays via dissipation engineering,A Metelmann; HE Türeci,Abstract Achieving control over the direction of propagation of photons in one and higherdimensional structures is of high interest in a large number of research fields; eg in photoniccrystals; metamaterials or superconducting circuit setups. Nonreciprocal devices can act ascirculators and optical isolators; but they are hard to implement on chip because they requirelarge magnetic fields. Several proposals have been made to overcome this limitation. Apossible route to achieve directional properties in an optical device without utilizing theeffect of Faraday rotation; is for example via the introduction of distinct phases via externaldriving or dynamical modulation of the refractive index. In this talk; we follow a different routeby using dissipation engineering to obtain control over the propagation direction of photonsin one and two dimensional structures.

Engineering non-Hermitian optical potentials for Polariton Condensation,Saeed Khan; Li Ge; Hakan Tureci,Abstract We present a theoretical study of incoherently pumped exciton-polaritoncondensates in general cavity geometries; based on an analysis of the linear non-Hermitianmodes of the (optical) pump induced potential. An analytical description is obtained for howthe threshold pump power for condensation into a specific mode depends quantitatively onthe relative spatial profiles of that mode and the pump. Specifically; we show that for ageneral pump profile; modes which best organize to balance the amplification from thepump against the repulsive pump potential achieve the lowest threshold power. Reversingthis idea; choosing the spatial profile of the pump provides control over which spatial modecondenses at lowest power.

Recent work has shown that a new class ofoptical materials; called Parity-Time symmetric materials; that consist of a precisely balanceddistribution of loss and gain can be exploited to engineer novel functionalities forpropagating and filtering electromagnetic radiation. Here we show a generic property ofoptical systems that feature an arbitrary distribution of loss and gain; described by non-Hermitian operators; namely that overall lossy optical systems can transiently amplify certaininput signals by several orders of magnitude.

Quantum Phase Transition (QPT) ofphotons in arrays of coupled cavities described by models of closed systems such as theJaynes-Cummings-Hubbard and the Rabi-Hubbard models (RHM)[1-8] have been studiedextensively during last few years [1-8]. Our aim is to describe more realistic situations inwhich the system is open to an environment. We consider the RHM in which photons canleak out of the cavities.

Circuit quantum electrodynamics with a multi-mode cavity,Neereja Sundaresan; Devin Underwood; William Shanks; Hakan Tureci; Andrew Houck,Abstract In most single-cavity experiments studied using circuit quantum electrodynamics;the quantum dynamics consist of superconducting qubit (s) interacting with the fundamentalelectromagnetic mode of the cavity. For these cavities; the modes are very widely separatedand thus higher modes fall outside the microwave regime; inaccessible using standardexperimental setup. In a multi-mode cavity; mode spacing is significantly smaller.Specifically; the multi-mode cavity allows us to access a new type of ultra-strong coupling inwhich the qubit-cavity coupling can be large compared with the mode spacing. In thisregime; pulsed revivals on the timescale of half the cavity round-trip time have beenpredicted.

Cavity-mediated near-critical dissipative dynamics of a driven condensate,Baris Oztop; Manas Kulkarni; Hakan Tureci,Abstract We investigate the near-critical dynamics of atomic density fluctuations in the non-equilibrium self-organization transition of an optically driven quantum gas coupled to asingle mode of a cavity. In this system cavity-mediated long-range interactions betweenatoms; tunable by the drive strength; lead to softening of an excitation mode recentlyobserved in experiments. This phenomenon has previously been studied within a two-modeapproximation for the collective motional degrees of freedom of the atomic condensatewhich results in an effective open-system Dicke model. Here; including the full spectrum ofatomic modes we find a finite lifetime for a roton-like mode in the Bogoliubov excitationspectrum that is strongly pump-dependent.

Rabi-Kondo correlated state in a laser-driven quantum dot,Moshe Goldstein; Bjoern Sbierski; Markus Hanl; Andreas Weichselbaum; Hakan Tureci; Leonid Glazman; Jan von Delft; Atac Imamoglu,Abstract Spin exchange between a single-electron charged quantum dot and itinerantelectrons leads to the emergence of Kondo screening. When the quantum dot is drivenresonantly by a weak laser light; the resulting emission spectrum serves as a direct probe ofthese correlations. In the opposite limit of vanishing exchange interaction and strong laserdrive; the quantum dot exhibits coherent Rabi oscillations between the single-spin andoptically excited states at the``bare''frequency Omega. Here we show that the interplaybetween strong exchange and non-perturbative laser coupling leads to the formation of anew non-equilibrium quantum-correlated state; featuring a second screening cloud. Weelucidate the signatures of that state in the spectrum of luminescence. The spectrum consistsof a delta-function peak at the laser light frequency (the peak weight scales as Omega 2/3 …,APS Meeting Abstracts,2013,*
Gain-enhanced optical cooling in cavity optomechanics,Li Ge; Sanli Faez; Florian Marquardt; Hakan Tureci,Abstract We study the optical cooling of the mechanical motion of the resonator mirror in acavity-optomechanical system that contains an optical gain medium. We find that the opticaldamping caused by radiation pressure force is vanishingly small if the active medium ispumped incoherently above its lasing threshold. In addition; we find that the spontaneousemission of the active medium always tends to increase the final effective temperature of themechanical motion. In the presence of an additional seeding signal; ie a coherent drive offixed frequency within the width of the gain curve however; we find that the cooling rate canbe enhanced significantly with respect to that of a passive cavity. We attribute this effect to areduced effective optical damping in the presence of incoherent pumping.,APS Meeting Abstracts,2013,*
Simulation of a Non-Equilibrium Localization Transition of Photons in a Superconducting Circuit-QED Dimer,Darius Sadri; James Raftery; Andrew Houck; Hakan Tureci; Sebastian Schmidt; Devin Underwood; Will Shanks; Srikanth Srinivasan; Mikola Bordyuh,Abstract The exponential scaling of Hilbert space dimension with number of quantumdegrees of freedom; while serving as a resource for quantum computation; makes simulationof large quantum systems on classical computers prohibitive; particularly when interactionswith an environment are included. Quantum simulation promises to make possible theinvestigation of rich quantum behavior on a controlled quantum mechanical device(effectively a specialized quantum computer); deepening our understanding of fascinatingphysics such as quantum phase transitions; non-equilibrium quantum dynamics; andquantum chaos. Superconducting circuit Quantum Electrodynamics (cQED) is a promisingframework for the realization of such simulators.

Experimental investigation of a nonequilibrium delocalization-localization crossover of photons in circuit quantum electrodynamics,James Raftery; Darius Sadri; Mykola Bordyuh; Devin Underwood; William Shanks; Srikanth Srinivasan; Sebastian Schmidt; Hakan Tureci; Andrew Houck,Abstract We report measurements of the time-dynamics of a Jaynes-Cummings dimer. Thedimer is fabricated in the circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architecture; with twocoupled resonators each coupled to a single transmon qubit. Such a system is predicted toexhibit three distinct behavioral regimes: delocalized; in which photons can oscillatebetween the two cavities; localized; in which photons are locked into a single cavity; andexiguous; in which extremely low photon numbers lead to the disappearance of locking.Dissipation in the system drives crossovers between the regimes. The experimentalmeasurements of the on and off-site correlation functions will be presented.,APS Meeting Abstracts,2013,*
Many body physics with light,Hakan E Tureci,Abstract Systems of strongly interacting atoms and photons; which can be realized wiring upindividual Cavity QED (CQED) systems into lattices; are perceived as a new platform forquantum simulation. While sharing important properties with other systems of interactingquantum particles; the nature of light-matter interaction gives rise to unique features with noanalogs in condensed matter or atomic physics setups. Such Lattice CQED systems operateon polaritonic quasi-particles that are hybrids of light and matter in a controllable proportion;combining long-range coherence of photons and strong interactions typically displayed bymassive particles.

Excitations of a driven condensate in a cavity: dynamics of the roton-like mode,Baris Oztop; Manas Kulkarni; Hakan Tureci,Abstract Recent experiments have demonstrated the superfluid-supersolid quantum phasetransition (PT) of an optically driven Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC); via the observation ofa roton-like softening of a mode in the Bogoliubov excitation spectrum. This phenomenon isusually studied within two-mode approximation for the BEC which results in Dicke-likeeffective model. In this system; the long-range interactions between the atoms are mediatedby cavity photons and the strength of the interactions is controlled by pump power. In thiswork; we investigate the effect of including the full spectrum of atomic modes. We find a finitelifetime for the roton-like mode below the threshold that is strongly pump-dependent. Thecorresponding decay rate and critical exponents for the PT are calculated.,APS Meeting Abstracts,2013,*
Experimental investigation of a nonequilibrium delocalization-localization transition of photons in circuit quantum electrodynamics,James Raftery; Devin Underwood; William Shanks; Srikanth Srinivasan; Anthony Hoffman; Hakan Tureci; Andrew Houck,Abstract Strong photon-qubit coupling in the circuit quantum electrodynamics architecturemay lead to quantum phase transitions of light. Recent theoretical and experimental effortshave been made toward examining such quantum phase transitions in large systems;however; interesting crossovers may also exist in significantly smaller and more controllablesystems. A sharp nonequilibrium self-trapping transition of light has been predicted in asystem comprising two coupled resonators each containing a single qubit. A delocalizedregime; where photons coherently oscillate between the two cavities; transitions viadissipation into a localized regime; where photons cannot tunnel.

TUTORIAL: Laser emission and coherent control of absorption in complex and random systems,A Douglas Stone; Yidong Chong; Li Ge; Hakan Tureci,An outstanding problem in laser theory has been how to formulate and solve the lasing equationsin a manner which takes into account the openness of the laser cavity exactly. This problem becomesmore acute when discussing modern complex laser cavities; such as photonic crystal lasers[1]; chaotic asymmetric resonant cavity lasers [2]; or“cavity-less” lasers; such as random lasers[3]; or cold atom lasers [4]. In these cases the openness of the cavity cannot be described bysimple reflection and transmission coefficients at the boundary; as the emission pattern in thefar-field will be a complicated function of the cavity shape and internal index variation. Moreoverresonances of the system cannot in general be associated with simple closed raytrajectories; due to the chaotic or diffusive ray motion. Finally; when openness and gain are takeninto account; the relevant equations becomes non-hermitian; the lasing modes are not …,Frontiers in Optics,2011,*

Experimentally; the intrinsic quantum nature of a single QD inspatial and spectral overlap to a high-quality factor cavity mode has been demonstrated bothindirectly and directly by measuring the photon anti-bunching under non-resonant [1] and resonant[2] conditions; respectively. This is an unequivocal probe that strongly coupled QD-cavity systemsdisplay nonlinearities at the single photon level [3]. Now that single-cavity quantum electrodynamics(QED) is experimentally well established; a new and stimulating research avenue is definedfrom the rich possibilities offered by multi-cavity systems; in which each resonator exhibits a sizeablesingle- photon nonlinearity.

Quantum and Nonlinear Optics in Complex Photonic Media,Hakan E Türeci,Traditionally; quantum and non-linear optics studies the interactions between emitters and electromagneticfields at few and many-photon levels; respectively. Early work in these fields focused on genericemitters such as two level atoms embedded in simple photonic media such as translationallyinvariant systems or Fabry-Perot- type cavities. With the progress in nanofabrication capa- bihtieshowever; the field saw the introduction of increas- ingly more complex photonic componentsfor improved functionality; efficiency and robustness. A few examples of such complex photonicmedia are mesoscopic dielec- tric microcavities [1]; disordered photonic systems [2]; and photoniccrystal defect cavities [3]. These are char- acterized by a certain degree of spatial complexityand openness (optical leakage) and therefore pose a chal- lenge to the established techniquesof quantum optics and laser physics that rely on a hermitian description of the light …,AIP Conference Proceedings,2009,*
Lasing in chaotic and random scattering media,Hakan E Türeci; Li Ge; A Douglas Stone; Robert J Tandy; Stefan Rotter,The semiclassical laser theory embodied in its most basic form in Maxwell-Bloch (MB) equationsdescribes the oscillations of a majority of laser systems known today. It does so by coupling theelectromagnetic field; described by Maxwell's equations to the non-linear polarization of the gainmedium; described by quantum equations of motion. This theory describes all of the characteristicnon-linear phenomena observed in lasers such as mode competition and selection; frequencypulling/pushing; bistability; synchronization; frequency and phase locking. The laser is intrinsicallyan open system; and the electric field in a laser is generated by the stimulated emission of lightfrom a collection of quantum emitters which are incoherently driven. The stationary electric fieldin the laser cavity does not conserve energy; the flow of light energy (magnitude of the Poyntingvector) is increasing along the cavity in the direction of the output(s).

Theory of the Spatial Structure of Non-linear Modes in Novel and Complex Laser Cavities,A Douglas Stone; Hakan E Tureci; Li Ge; Stefan Rotter,A new formalism [1; 2] for calculating exact steady-state non-linear multi-mode lasing statesfor complex resonators is developed and applied to conventional edge-emitting lasers andto lasers with chaotic or random cavities. The theory solves a long-standing problem inlasing theory: how to describe the multi-mode lasing states of an open cavity. Moreover itincludes the effects of mode competition and spatial hole-burning to all orders within theapproximation of stationary inversion. Lasing modes are expanded in terms of sets ofbiorthogonal" constant flux"(CF) states and satisfy a self-consistent equation. For highfinesse cavities each lasing mode is proportional to one CF state which inside the cavitybehaves like a linear resonance; for low finesse as in a random laser; novel compositemodes are predicted which do not correspond to any passive cavity resonance.,Transparent Optical Networks; 2007.

In particular; we investigate theinfluence of a ferromagnetic exchange interaction among the dot electrons and the effect ofan applied Zeeman field. This problem is addressed with the help of a numerical algorithmthat allows for an exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in a good total spin basis [1] of thedot plus the Kondo spin.

Highly Directional Emission in Stadium-Cavity Lasers,Susumu Shinohara; Takahisa Harayama; Hakan E Tureci; A Douglas Stone,In two-dimensional microcavity lasers; as a way to extract highly directional emission; it hasbeen proposed to deform the cavity shape smoothly from perfect circularity. As a result; raysstart to exhibit a variety of dynamics from integrable to strongly chaotic; which is tunable bythe deformation. The ray picture has been providing a simple and intuitive method to explainexperimental observations of emission directionality. For example; emission directionalityhas been associated with the existence of a periodic ray orbit with a particular geometry;drastic shape dependence of emission directionality has been successfully explained by thedifference of phase space structure; and the far-field intensity patterns have been closelyreproduced by ray-tracing simulations. Among various cavity shapes the stadium is a simplegeometry for which ray dynamics has been proven to become strongly chaotic. That is; for …,Transparent Optical Networks; 2006 International Conference on,2006,*

Spin-Orbit effects in Quantum Dots: Interplay of disorder and interactions,Hakan E Türeci; Y Alhassid; A Douglas Stone,Abstract Disordered or chaotic quantum dots with a large Thouless conductance g provide atractable experimental and theoretical system for studying electron-electron interactionswithin the framework of the universal Hamiltonian. In particular; good agreement betweentheory and experiment is observed for the mesoscopic fluctuations of the conductance indots with negligible spin-orbit scattering [1]. Here we focus on the effects of a tunable spin-orbit scattering within the universal Hamiltonian model. The presence of spin-orbit scatteringwas shown to introduce new symmetry limits of the single-particle Hamiltonian [2].

An improvedtreatment is presented in which the modal expansion is in terms of linear amplifying states;which are solutions of the wave equation for piecewise constant (in space) complex(amplifying) index of refraction with real k; and satisfy somewhat more complicatedorthogonality relations. Mode selection; shape sensitivity and power output in the manymode regime for circular as well as deformed lasers are studied. It is found that spatiallyselective pumping plays a key role in the selection of bow-tie modes but may not be crucialfor obtaining a large power increase with deformation.

Interaction-Induced Mode Switching in Microlasers,Li Ge; David Liu; Steven G Johnson; Stefan Rotter; Hakan E Türeci; Alexander Cerjan; Hui Cao; A Douglas Stone,We demonstrate that due to strong modal interactions through cross-gain saturation; theonset of a new lasing mode can switch off an existing mode via a negative power slope. Inthis process of interaction-induced mode switching (IMS) the two involved modes maintaintheir identities; ie they do not change their spatial field patterns or lasing frequencies. For afixed pump profile; a simple analytic criterion for the occurrence of IMS is given in terms oftheir self-and cross-interaction coefficients and non-interacting thresholds; which is verifiedfor the example of a two-dimensional microdisk laser. When the spatial pump profile isvaried as the pump power is increased; IMS can be induced even when it would not occurwith a fixed pump profile; as we show for two coupled laser cavities. Our findings may havepotential applications in robust and flexible all-optical switching.,*,*,*
