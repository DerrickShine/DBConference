Improved grid search method: an efficient tool for global computation of periodic orbits,GA Tsirogiannis; EA Perdios; VV Markellos,Abstract We present an improved grid search method for the global computation of periodicorbits in model problems of Dynamics; and the classification of these orbits into families. Themethod concerns symmetric periodic orbits in problems of two degrees of freedom with aconserved quantity; and is applied here to problems of Celestial Mechanics. It consists oftwo main phases; a global sampling technique in a two-dimensional space of initialconditions and a data processing procedure for the classification (clustering) of the periodicorbits into families characterized by continuous evolution of the orbital parameters ofmember orbits. The method is tested by using it to recompute known results. It is thenapplied with advantage to the determination of the branch families of the family f ofretrograde satellites in Hill's Lunar problem; and to the determination of irregular families …,Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy,2009,23
Computation of the Liapunov orbits in the photogravitational RTBP with oblateness,GA Tsirogiannis; CN Douskos; EA Perdios,Abstract We study the periodic motion around the collinear equilibrium points of therestricted three-body problem when the primary is a source of radiation and the secondary isan oblate spheroid. In particular; the Liapunov families of two and three dimensionalperiodic orbits are computed. In order to gain the appropriate initial conditions a third-fourthorder Lindstedt-Poincaré local analysis is used. The stability of these families is alsocomputed.,Astrophysics and Space Science,2006,20
A graph based methodology for mission design,George A Tsirogiannis,Abstract A space mission design methodology is presented; where initial and final orbits areconnected through segments of periodic orbits. After a discretization of the solution space;the problem of mission design is transformed into an equivalent combinatorial optimizationproblem. Specifically; a graph is constructed that represents periodic orbits connected by theexecution of impulsive maneuvers. A low computational complexity algorithm for thistransformation is introduced. An efficient combinatorial optimization algorithm that solves theshortest path problem is described. Subject to the initial discretization of the solution space;an optimal sequence of coastal arcs is determined for a low total Delta-V mission. Finally;the proposed methodology is applied to the design of a hypothetical Saturn–Titan systemmission.,Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy,2012,12
A greedy global search algorithm for connecting unstable periodic orbits with low energy cost.,GA Tsirogiannis; VV Markellos,Abstract A method for space mission trajectory design is presented in the form of a greedyglobal search algorithm. It uses invariant manifolds of unstable periodic orbits and its mainadvantage is that it performs a global search for the suitable legs of the invariant manifoldsto be connected for a preliminary transfer design; as well as the appropriate points of thelegs for maneuver application. The designed indirect algorithm bases the greedy choice onthe optimality conditions that are assumed for the theoretical minimum transfer cost of aspacecraft when using invariant manifolds. The method is applied to a test case spacemission design project in the Earth–Moon system and is found to compare favorably withprevious techniques applied to the same project.,Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy,2013,7
Global Data Clustering for Periodic Orbits,GA Tsirogiannis; EA Perdios; VV Markellos,Abstract. We outline a procedure for the classification (clustering) of periodic orbits intofamilies. This complements the traditional grid search method and makes redundant thenumerical continuation of the families with predictor–corrector techniques; that wouldotherwise be required for the determination of their continuously evolving properties (suchas period and stability). Thus; substantial economy in computing time and user interventionis gained in achieving the final task of a full description of the families and their properties.,Dynamics of Celestial Bodies: Proceedings of the 2008 International Conference in Honor of John D.

A two-level perturbation method for connecting unstable periodic orbits with low fuel cost and short time of flight: application to a lunar observation mission,George A Tsirogiannis; Kathryn E Davis,Abstract The proposed method connects two unstable periodic orbits by employingtrajectories of their associated invariant manifolds that are perturbed in two levels. A firstlevel of velocity perturbations is applied on the trajectories of the discretized manifolds at thepoints where they approach the nominal unstable periodic orbit in order to accelerate them.A second level of structured velocity perturbations is applied to trajectories that have alreadybeen subjected to first level perturbations in order to approximately meet the necessaryconditions for a low\varDelta V Δ V transfer. Due to this two-level perturbation approach; thenumber of the trajectories obtained is significantly larger compared with approaches thatemploy traditional invariant manifolds. For this reason; the problem of connecting twounstable periodic orbits through perturbed trajectories of their manifolds is transformed …,Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy,2016,*
