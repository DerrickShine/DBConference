PRIMA: A DBMS prototype supporting engineering applications,Theo Härder; Klaus Meyer-Wegener; Bernhard Mitschang; Andrea Sikeler,The design of the Molecule-Atom Data model; aimed at the effective support of engineeringapplications; is justified and described with its essential properties and features. MAD offersdirect and symmetric management of network structures and recursiveness; dynamic objectdefinition and object handling allowing for both vertical and horizontal access. Its prototypeimplementation PRIMA is discussed using a multi-level model for the DBMS architecture.Our DBMS kernel provides a variety of access path structures; tuning mechanisms; andperformance enhancements transparent at the data model interface. PRIMA is assumed tobe used in different run-time environments including workstation coupling and multi-processor systems. In particular; it serves as a research vehicle to investigate theexploitation of" semantic parallelism" in single user operations.,*,1987,155
A model-based; open architecture for mobile; spatially aware applications,Daniela Nicklas; Matthias Großmann; Thomas Schwarz; Steffen Volz; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract With the emerging availability of small and portable devices that are able todetermine their position and to communicate wirelessly; mobile and spatially awareapplications become feasible. These applications rely on information that is bound tolocations. In this paper we present ne X us; a platform for such applications; which is openfor both new applications and new information providers; similar to the World Wide Web.Distributed servers provide location-based information; which is federated to an integratedview for the applications. To achieve this goal; we present the concept of the AugmentedWorld Model; which is a common data model for location-based information. We give anexample to show how applications can use this platform.,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2001,101
On building location aware applications using an open platform based on the NEXUS Augmented World Model,Daniela Nicklas; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract How should the World Wide Web look like if it were for location-based information?And how would mobile; spatially aware applications deal with such a platform? In this paperwe present the neXus Augmented World Model; an object oriented data model which playsa major role in an open framework for both providers of location-based information and newkinds of applications: the neXus platform. We illustrate the usability of the model with severalsample applications and show the extensibility of this framework. At last we present astepwise approach for building spatially aware applications in this environment.,Software and Systems Modeling,2004,61
On parallel processing of aggregate and scalar functions in object-relational DBMS,Michael Jaedicke; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract Nowadays parallel object-relational DBMS are envisioned as the next great wave;but there is still a lack of efficient implementation concepts for some parts of the proposedfunctionality. Thus one of the current goals for parallel object-relational DBMS is to movetowards higher performance. In this paper we develop a framework that allows to processuser-defined functions with data parallelism. We will describe the class of partitionablefunctions that can be processed parallelly. We will also propose an extension which allowsto speed up the processing of another large class of functions by means of parallel sorting.Functions that can be processed by means of our techniques are often used in decisionsupport queries on large data volumes; for example. Hence a parallel execution isindispensable.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1998,61
An approach to optimize data processing in business processes,Marko Vrhovnik; Holger Schwarz; Oliver Suhre; Bernhard Mitschang; Volker Markl; Albert Maier; Tobias Kraft,Abstract In order to optimize their revenues and profits; an increasing number of businessesorganize their business activities in terms of business processes. Typically; they automateimportant business tasks by orchestrating a number of applications and data stores.Obviously; the performance of a business process is directly dependent on the efficiency ofdata access; data processing; and data management. In this paper; we propose a frameworkfor the optimization of data processing in business processes. We introduce a set of rewriterules that transform a business process in such a way that an improved execution withrespect to data management can be achieved without changing the semantics of the originalprocess. These rewrite rules are based on a semi-procedural process graph model thatexternalizes data dependencies as well as control flow dependencies of a business …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,59

Data mining-driven manufacturing process optimization,Christoph Gröger; Florian Niedermann; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract—High competitive pressure in the global manufac-turing industry makes efficient;effective and continuously improved manufacturing processes a critical success factor. Yet;existing analytics in manufacturing; eg; provided by Manufacturing Execution Systems; arecoined by major shortcomings considerably limiting continuous process improvement. Inparticular; they do not make use of data mining to identify hidden patterns in manufacturing-related data. In this article; we present indication-based and pattern-based manufacturingprocess optimization as novel data mining approaches provided by the AdvancedManufacturing Analytics Platform. We demonstrate their usefulness through use cases anddepict suitable data mining techniques as well as implementation details.,Proceedings of the world congress on engineering,2012,56
Extending the relational algebra to capture complex objects,Bernhard Mitschang,An important direction in database research for non-standard applications (eg engineeringor design applications) deals with adequate support for complex objects. Without doubt; theprovision of network structures and shared subobjects as well as support for dynamic objectdefinition and appropriate manipulation facilities is urgently needed for natural and accuratemodeling as well as for efficient processing of the applications' objects. These concepts arethe major concern of the molecule-atom data model (MAD model) and its molecule algebrawhich is introduced in this paper. They make the model stand out compared to the relationalmodel and even to models limited to hierarchical and statically defined complex objects. Bymeans of the molecule algebra a precise and complete specification of one conceivablekind of complex object processing and its inherent semantics is provided. Furthermore …,*,1989,55
Native support of multi-tenancy in RDBMS for software as a service,Oliver Schiller; Benjamin Schiller; Andreas Brodt; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract Software as a Service (SaaS) facilitates acquiring a huge number of small tenantsby providing low service fees. To achieve low service fees; it is essential to reduce costs pertenant. For this; consolidating multiple tenants onto a single relational schema instanceturned out beneficial because of low overheads per tenant and scalable manageability. Thisapproach implements data isolation between tenants; per-tenant schema extension andfurther tenant-centric data management features in application logic. This is complex;disables some optimization opportunities in the RDBMS and represents a conceptualmisstep with Separation of Concerns in mind. Therefore; we contribute first features of aRDBMS to support tenant-aware data management natively. We introduce tenants as first-class database objects and propose the concept of a tenant context to isolate a tenant …,Proceedings of the 14th international conference on extending database technology,2011,53
Processing and transaction concepts for cooperation of engineering workstations and a database server,Theo Härder; Ch Hübel; Klaus Meyer-Wegener; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract A DBMS kernel architecture is proposed for improved DB support of engineeringapplications running on a cluster of workstations. Using such an approach; part of the DBMScode—an application-specific layer—is allocated close to the corresponding application ona workstation while the kernel code is executed on a central server. Emperical performanceresults from DB-based engineering applications are reported to justify the chosen DBMSarchitecture. The paper focuses on design issues of the application layer including servercoupling; processing model and application interface. Moreover; a transaction model forlong-term database work in a coupled workstation-server environment is investigated indetail.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,1988,49
Towards location-based games,Daniela Nicklas; Christoph Pfisterer; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract—In this paper we investigate the basic properties of location-based games. Thisnew type of game is made possible by the recent advances of mobile computing hardwareand infrastructure. Players act not by pressing buttons or moving pawns on a board; but bymoving around themselves in the real world. We present a simple classification of location-based games; and show how these games can be designed and implemented. With someadaptations; game concepts from existing board and computer games can be mapped tomake location-based games more interesting and fun to play. Our methods aredemonstrated with three actual game examples. Further; common infrastructurerequirements are deduced and we show how the open platform developed by the NEXUSworking group fulfills them.,Proceedings of the international conference on applications and development of computer games in the 21st century: ADCOG,2001,46
Towards a unified view of design data and knowledge representation,Bernhard Mitschang,Adequate information modeling in non-standard application areas (eg engineeringapplications such as CAD/CAM; VLSI design or knowledgebased applications) requires theabstraction concepts of classification; aggregation; generalization; and association. TheMolecule-Atom Data model (MAD) designed for the effective support of such an informationmodel is justified and described with its essential properties and features. MAD offersdynamic object definition and object handling; based on direct and symmetric managementof network structures and recursiveness. These generic mechanisms can be used to mapthe above mentioned abstraction concepts in a straight-forward manner. Thus; the mappingof a wide variety of semantic and object-oriented modeling constructs; including complexobjects with shared subobjects; becomes feasible. All these concepts are illustrated by …,*,1988,46
Capturing design dynamics/spl minus/the CONCORD approach,Norbert Ritter; Bernhard Mitschang; Theo Harder; Michael Gesmann; Harald Schoning,'Computer-Supported Cooperative Work'is a young research area considering applicationswith strong demands on database technology. Design applications need support forcooperation and some means for controlling their inherent dynamics. However; today's CADsystems consisting of a collection of diverse design tools typically do not support theserequirements. Therefore; an encompassing processing model is needed that covers theoverall design process in general as well as CAD-tool application in particular. TheCONCORD model described in the paper; reflects the distinct properties of design processdynamics by distinguishing three levels of abstraction.

Privacy management for mobile platforms--a review of concepts and approaches,Christoph Stach; Bernhard Mitschang,The still rising popularity of modern mobile phones results in an increased demand formanifold applications for these devices. As Android OS supports the development andusage of third-party software greatly; there are more and more developers for this platform.However; many of those applications handle private data grossly negligent whichimmediately leads to serious privacy concerns. To make matters worse; the current Androidpermission rules are much too coarse and incomprehensible from the average user'sperspective. But even if s/he understands the meaning of the permissions; s/he must eitheraccept all of them or waive the application. Therefore we review concepts and approachestowards effective privacy management for mobile platforms.

Grand tour of concepts for object-orientation from a database point of view,Nelson M Mattos; Klaus Meyer-Wegener; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract Over the last few years; object-orientation has gained more and more importancewithin several disciplines of computer science (eg programming languages; knowledgeengineering; and database systems). Numerous papers have defined one or another of itsunderlying concepts (sometimes in quite different ways); and some systems have beendeveloped following those heterogeneous definitions. Nevertheless; papers investigatingthe dependencies and degrees of freedom of these concepts are rarely found. For thisreason; the goal of this paper is not to add yet another definition of object-oriented concepts;but to identify existing relationships among these basic concepts that allow one to cover andclassify various conceivable combinations of these conceptual building blocks.Dependencies; orthogonalities; and relations among concepts like object identity …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,1993,39
Deep integration of spatial query processing into native RDF triple stores,Andreas Brodt; Daniela Nicklas; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract Semantic Web technologies; most notably RDF; are well-suited to cope with typicalchallenges in spatial data management including analyzing complex relations betweenentities; integrating heterogeneous data sources and exploiting poorly structured data; eg;from web communities. Also; RDF can easily represent spatial relationships; as long as thelocation information is symbolic; ie; represented by places that have a name. What is widelymissing is support for geographic and geometric information; such as coordinates or spatialpolygons; which is needed in many applications that deal with sensor data or map data. Thiscalls for efficient data management systems which are capable of querying large amounts ofRDF data and support spatial query predicates.

Context-aware mashups for mobile devices,Andreas Brodt; Daniela Nicklas; Sailesh Sathish; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract With the Web 2.0 trend and its participation of end-users more and more data andinformation services are online accessible; such as web sites; Wikis; or web services. So-called mashups—web applications that integrate data from more than one source into anintegrated service—can be easily realized using scripting languages. Also; mobile devicesare increasingly powerful; have ubiquitous access to the Web and feature local sensors;such as GPS. Thus; mobile applications can adapt to the mobile user's current situation. Weexamine how context-aware mashups can be created. One challenge is the provisioning ofcontext data to the mobile application. For this; we discuss different ways to integrate contextdata; such as the user's position; into web applications. Moreover; we assess different dataformats and the overall performance. Finally; we present the Telar mashup platform; a …,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2008,35

Deep Business Optimization: A Platform for Automated Process Optimization.,Florian Niedermann; Sylvia Radeschütz; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract: The efficient and effective design; execution and adaption of its core processes isvital for the success of most businesses and a major source of competitive advantage.Despite this critical importance; process optimization today largely depends on manualanalytics and the ability of business analysts to spot the" right" designs and areas ofimprovement. This is because current techniques typically fall short in three areas: they failto integrate relevant data sources; they do not provide optimal analytical procedures andthey leave it up to analysts to identify the best process design. Hence; we propose in thispaper a platform that enables (semi-) automated process optimization during the processdesign; execution and analysis stages; based on insights from specialized analyticalprocedures running on an integrated warehouse containing both process and operational …,ISSS/BPSC,2010,28

Sql/xnf-processing composite objects as abstractions over relational data,Bernhard Mitschang; Hamid Pirahesh; Peter Pistor; Bruce Lindsay; N Sudkamp,An extension to SQL; called the SQL extended normal form (XNF); is discussed. It enhancesrelational technology by a composite object facility; which comprises not only extraction ofcomposite objects from existing databases but also efficient navigation and manipulationfacilities provided by an appropriate application programming interface. The language itselfallows sharing of the database among normal form SQL applications and composite objectapplications. It provides proper subsetting of the database and subsequent structuring;exploiting subobject sharing and recursion; all based on its powerful composite objectconstructor concept; which is closed under the language operations. XNF is integrated intothe relational framework; thus benefiting from the available technology such as relationalengine and query optimization.,Data Engineering; 1993. Proceedings.

Topaz: a cost-based; rule-driven; multi-phase parallelizer,Clara Nippl; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract Currently the key problems of query optimization are extensibility imposed by object-relational technology; as well as query complexity caused by forthcoming applications; suchas OLAP. We propose a generic approach to parallelization; called TOPAZ. Different formsof parallelism are exploited to obtain maximum speedup combined with lowest resourceconsumption. The necessary abstractions wrt operator characteristics and systemarchitecture are provided by rules that are used by a cost-based; top-down search engine. Amulti-phase pruning based on a global analysis of the plan efficiently guides the searchprocess; thus considerably reducing complexity and achieving optimization performance.Since TOPAZ solely relies on the widespread concepts of iterators and data rivers commonto (parallel) execution models; it fits as an enabling technology into most state-of-the-art …,VLDB,1998,27
The operational process dashboard for manufacturing,Christoph Gröger; Mark Hillmann; Friedemann Hahn; Bernhard Mitschang; Engelbert Westkämper,Abstract Agility is a critical success factor for manufacturers in today's volatile globalenvironment and requires employees monitoring their performance and reacting quickly toturbulences. Thus; comprehensive information provisioning on all hierarchy levels is neces-sary. Yet; existing IT systems; eg; Manufacturing Execution Systems; scarcely addressinformation needs of workers on the shop floor level. This causes uncoordinated waitingtimes; inflexibility and costly communication. To address these issues; we present theOperational Process Dashboard for Manufacturing (OPDM); a mobile dashboard for shopfloor workers. We identify process-oriented information needs; develop technical dashboardservices and define IT requirements for an implementation.,Procedia CIRP,2013,25
Business process optimization using formalized optimization patterns,Florian Niedermann; Sylvia Radeschütz; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract The success of most of today's businesses is tied to the efficiency and effectivenessof their core processes. Yet; two major challenges often prevent optimal processes: First; theanalysis techniques applied during the optimization are inadequate and fail to include allrelevant data sources. Second; the success depends on the abilities of the individualanalysts to spot the right designs amongst a plethora of choices. Our deep BusinessOptimization Platform addresses these challenges through specialized data integration;analysis and optimization facilities. In this paper; we focus on how it uses formalized processoptimization patterns for detecting and implementing process improvements.,International Conference on Business Information Systems,2011,23
A System for Data Change Propagation in Heterogeneous Information Systems.,Carmen Constantinescu; Uwe Heinkel; Ralf Rantzau; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract: Today; it is common that enterprises manage several mostly heterogeneousinformation systems to supply their production and business processes with data. There is aneed to exchange data between the information systems while preserving system autonomy.Hence; an integration approach that relies on a single global enterprise data schema isruled out. This is also due to the widespread usage of legacy systems. We propose asystem; called Propagation Manager; which manages dependencies between data objectsstored in different information systems. A script specifying complex data transformations andother sophisticated activities; like the execution of external programs; is associated witheach dependency. For example; an object update in a source system can trigger datatransformations of the given source data for each destination system that depends on the …,ICEIS,2002,23
Improving the Processing of Decision Support Queries: The case for a DSS optimizer,Holger Schwarz; Ralf Wagner; Bernhard Mitschang,Many decision support applications are built upon data mining and OLAP tools and allowusers to answer information requests based on a data warehouse that is managed by apowerful DBMS. We focus on tools that generate sequences of SQL statements in order toproduce the requested information. Our thorough analysis revealed that many sequences ofqueries that are generated by commercial tools are not very efficient. An optimized systemarchitecture is suggested for these applications. The main component is a DSS optimizerthat accepts previously generated sequences of queries and remodels them according to aset of optimization strategies; before they are executed by the underlying database system.The advantages of this extended architecture are discussed and a couple of appropriateoptimization strategies are identified.

Usability analysis of compression algorithms for position data streams,Nicola Hönle; Matthias Grossmann; Steffen Reimann; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract With the increasing use of sensor technology; the compression of sensor datastreams is getting more and more important to reduce both the costs of further processing aswell as the data volume for persistent storage. A popular method for sensor datacompression is to smooth the original measurement curve by an approximated curve; whichis bounded by a given maximum error value. Measurement values from positioning systemslike GPS are an interesting special case; because they consist of two spatial and onetemporal dimension. Therefore various standard techniques for approximation calculationslike regression or line simplification algorithms cannot be directly applied.

For the operator; we implemented various compression algorithms for …,Proceedings of the 18th SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2010,22
NexusDS: a flexible and extensible middleware for distributed stream processing,Nazario Cipriani; Mike Eissele; Andreas Brodt; Matthias Grossmann; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract Techniques for efficient and distributed processing of huge; unbound data streamshave made some impact in the database community. Sensors and data sources; such asposition data of moving objects; continuously produce data that is consumed; eg; by location-aware applications. Depending on the domain of interest; eg visualization; the processing ofsuch data often depends on domain-specific functionality. This functionality is specified interms of dedicated operators that may require specialized hardware; eg GPUs. This createsa strong dependency which a data stream processing system must consider when deployingsuch operators. Many data stream processing systems have been presented so far.However; these systems assume homogeneous computing nodes; do not consider operatordeployment constraints; and are not designed to address domain-specific needs.

Method and apparatus for optimization in workflow management systems,*,Activities within a workflow are either data management activities (DMAs) or non-DMAs. Aworkflow is typically carried out by a system by executing one activity after the other. Thiscan; however; be very time consuming. A method and system are provided for optimizing agroup of activities (GOA) comprising a DMA; whereby the GOA is comprised in the workflowto improve the overall performance. The method determines the DMAs; and for each DMA; adata level statement (DLS). The GOA is determined and a process graph model (PGM) isdetermined from the GOA so that the DLS is comprised in the PGM and the semantics of thePGM are identical to those of the GOA. The PGM is optimized for which an optimized GOA isdetermined. The semantics of the optimized GOA are identical to those of the GOA. In theworkflow; the GOA is replaced by the optimized GOA.,*,2009,22

One of the input data classes has not been covered so far. For this class;we propose several new algorithms. Thus; for the first time; we are able to identify theoptimal algorithm to use for any given input dataset.

For an optimization of processes; a profound analysis of all relevant informationin the company is necessary. Analyses typically specialize either on process analysis or ondata warehousing of operational data. A consolidation of major business data sources isneeded to analyze and optimize processes in a much more comprehensive scope. Thispaper introduces a framework that offers various alternatives for matching process data andoperational data to obtain a consolidated data description.,*,2008,19
Supporting manufacturing design by analytics; continuous collaborative process improvement enabled by the advanced manufacturing analytics platform,Christoph Gröger; Florian Niedermann; Holger Schwarz; Bernhard Mitschang,The manufacturing industry is faced with global competition making efficient; effective andcontinuously improved manufacturing processes a critical success factor. Yet; mediadiscontinuities; the use of isolated analysis methods on local data sets as well as missingmeans for sharing analysis results cause a collaborative gap in Manufacturing ProcessManagement that prohibits continuous process improvement.

Query processing for complex objects,Theo Härder; Bernhard Mitschang; Harald Schöning,Abstract Over the last few years several new data models together with their languages havebeen developed to meet the increasing requirements of engineering or office applications. Amajor characteristic of these data models is their ability to process and manage complexobjects which the relational model does not provide adequate support for. Whereas theproblem of query translation for relational languages has provoked broad research activitiesduring the last fifteen years; the analogous problem of translating non-procedural queries oncomplex objects into lower level programs for efficient execution has received only littleattention. This paper tries to reveal the new aspects of query translation and execution oncomplex objects as compared to similar activities when processing flat relations. For thispurpose; we investigate the essential concepts necessary to perform compilation …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,1992,18
Design-time process optimization through optimization patterns and process model matching,Florian Niedermann; Sylvia Radeschutz; Bernhard Mitschang,The goal of process design is the construction of a process model that is a priori optimal wrtthe goal (s) of the business owning the process. Process design is therefore a major factor indetermining the process performance and ultimately the success of a business. Despite thisimportance; the designed process is often less than optimal. This is due to two majorchallenges: First; since the design is an a priori ability; no actual execution data is availableto provide the foundations for design decisions. Second; since modeling decision support istypically basic at best; the quality of the design largely depends on the ability of businessanalysts to make the” right” design choices. To address these challenges; we present in thispaper our deep Business Optimization Platform that enables (semi-) automated processoptimization during process design based on actual execution data.

-Coarse-Grained Optimization: Techniques for Rewriting SQL Statement Sequences,Tobias Kraft; Holger Schwarz; Ralf Rantzau; Bernhard Mitschang,This chapter discusses coarse-grained optimization. The chapter considers a lightweight;heuristic; pre-optimization rewrite phase as a beneficial approach for processing largesequences of correlated SQL statements. Such a rewrite phase is meant to complement theconventional query optimization phase for the individual statements of a sequence. SQLstatement sequences are produced by query generators of applications like relational OLAP(ROLAP) tools and are likely to occur more frequently in the future; when more and morecomplex analysis and report tasks are automated. The chapter argues that an exhaustiveoptimization of such problems with the help of commercial optimization techniques isintolerable; as the measurements revealed. The key idea of the approach; called “coarse-grained optimization;” is to rewrite the given SQL statement sequence into an equivalent …,*,2003,17
Prescriptive analytics for recommendation-based business process optimization,Christoph Gröger; Holger Schwarz; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract Continuously improved business processes are a central success factor forcompanies. Yet; existing data analytics do not fully exploit the data generated duringprocess execution. Particularly; they miss prescriptive techniques to transform analysisresults into improvement actions. In this paper; we present the data-mining-driven concept ofrecommendation-based business process optimization on top of a holistic processwarehouse. It prescriptively generates action recommendations during process execution toavoid a predicted metric deviation. We discuss data mining techniques and data structuresfor real-time prediction and recommendation generation and present a proof of conceptbased on a prototypical implementation in manufacturing.,International Conference on Business Information Systems,2014,16
Prorea: live database migration for multi-tenant rdbms with snapshot isolation,Oliver Schiller; Nazario Cipriani; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract The consolidation of multiple tenants onto a single RDBMS instance turned out tobe benefical with respect to resource utilization and scalability. The consolidation impliesthat multiple tenants share the physical resources available for the RDBMS instance. If theavailable resources tend to get insufficient to meet the SLAs agreed with the tenants;migration of a tenant's database from one RDBMS instance to another is compelling. Highlyavailable services demand for live migration techniques that come with minimal serviceinterruption and low performance impact. This paper meets the demand for live migrationtechniques by contributing ProRea. ProRea is a live database migration approach designedfor multi-tenant RDBMS that run OLTP workloads under snapshot isolation. ProRea extendsconcepts of existing live database migration approaches to accomplish minimal service …,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2013,16
Automated process decision making based on integrated source data,Florian Niedermann; Bernhard Maier; Sylvia Radeschütz; Holger Schwarz; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract Decision activities are frequently responsible for a major part of a process's durationand resource consumption. The automation of these activities hence holds the promise ofsignificant cost and time savings; however; only if the decision quality does not suffer. Toachieve this; it is required to consider data from diverse sources that go beyond the processaudit log; which is why approaches relying solely on it are likely to yield sub-optimal results.We therefore present in this paper an approach to process decision automation thatincorporates data integration techniques; enabling significant improvements in decisionquality.,International Conference on Business Information Systems,2011,16

The Data-driven Factory,Christoph Gröger; Laura Kassner; Eva Hoos; Jan Königsberger; Cornelia Kiefer; Stefan Silcher; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract: Global competition in the manufacturing industry is characterized by ever shorterproduct life cycles; increasing complexity and a turbulent environment. High product quality;continuously improved processes as well as changeable organizational structures constitutecentral success factors for manufacturing companies. With the rise of the internet of thingsand Industrie 4.0; the increasing use of cyber-physical systems as well as the digitalizationof manufacturing operations lead to massive amounts of heterogeneous industrial dataacross the product life cycle. In order to leverage these big industrial data for competitiveadvantages; we present the concept of the data-driven factory.

Design and implementation of the privacy management platform,Christoph Stach; Bernhard Mitschang,Nowadays; mobile platform vendors have to concern themselves increasingly about how toprotect their users' privacy. As Google is less restrictive than their competitors regarding theirterms of use for app developers; it is hardly surprising that malware spreads even in GooglePlay. To make matters worse; in Android every user is responsible for his or her private dataand s/he is frequently overwhelmed with this burden because of the fragile Androidpermission mechanism. Thus; the calls for a customizable; fine-grained; context-based;crash-proof; and intuitive privacy management system are growing louder. To cope withthese requests; we introduce the Privacy Management Platform (PMP) and we discuss threealternative implementation strategies for such a system.,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2014 IEEE 15th International Conference on,2014,15
Augmenting olap exploration with dynamic advanced analytics,Benjamin Leonhardi; Bernhard Mitschang; Rubén Pulido; Christoph Sieb; Michael Wurst,Abstract Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) is a popular technique for explorative dataanalysis. Usually; a fixed set of dimensions (such as time; place; etc.) is used to explore andanalyze various subsets of a given; multi-dimensional data set. These subsets are selectedby constraining one or several of the dimensions; for instance; showing sales only in a givenyear and geographical location. Still; such aggregates are often not enough. Importantinformation can only be discovered by combining several dimensions in a multidimensionalanalysis. Most existing approaches allow to add new dimensions either statically ordynamically. These approaches support; however; only the creation of global dimensionsthat are not interactive for the user running the report. Furthermore; they are mostly restrictedto data clustering and the resulting dimensions cannot be interactively refined.

Preprocessing position data of mobile objects,Nicola Hönle; Matthias Grossmann; Daniela Nicklas; Bernhard Mitschang,We present the design and implementation of a component for the preprocessing of positiondata taken from moving objects. The movement of mobile objects is represented bypiecewise functions over time that approximate the real object movement and significantlyreduce the initial data volume such that effcient storage and analysis of object trajectoriescan be achieved. The maximal acceptable deviation-an input parameter of our algorithms-ofthe approximations also includes the uncertainty of the position sensor measurements. Weanalyze and compare five different lossy preprocessing methods. Our results clearly indicatethat even with simple approaches; a more than sufficient overall performance can beachieved.,Mobile Data Management; 2008. MDM'08. 9th International Conference on,2008,15
Building the data warehouse of frequent itemsets in the DWFIST approach,Rodrigo Salvador Monteiro; Geraldo Zimbrão; Holger Schwarz; Bernhard Mitschang; Jano Moreira de Souza,Abstract Some data mining tasks can produce such great amounts of data that we have tocope with a new knowledge management problem. Frequent itemset mining fits in thiscategory. Different approaches were proposed to handle or avoid somehow this problem. Allof them have problems and limitations. In particular; most of them need the original dataduring the analysis phase; which is not feasible for data streams. The DWFIST (DataWarehouse of Frequent ItemSets Tactics) approach aims at providing a powerfulenvironment for the analysis of itemsets and derived patterns; such as association rules;without accessing the original data during the analysis phase. This approach is based on aData Warehouse of Frequent Itemsets. It provides frequent itemsets in a flexible and efficientway as well as a standardized logical view upon which analytical tools can be developed …,International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems,2005,15

Data-intensive intra-and Internet applications-experiences using Java and CORBA in the World Wide Web,Jürgen Sellentin; Bernhard Mitschang,Intra/Internet technology has become a key issue in the development of modern systems.Nowadays; it is no longer sufficient to present static information sheets through the WorldWide Web (WWW). Instead; we need interactive applications that may even computecomplex results or process large data sets. In this paper; we describe a prototype based onJava and CORBA. Both represent modern concepts that have been developed to fulfill theserequirements. Their combination results into the kind of data processing we want to apply tothe WWW:(1) portable; powerful; structured and even reusable client programs instead ofcryptic HTML scripts;(2) well-defined interfaces; and (3) efficient server processes separatedfrom the WWW server and its CGI extensions.

Design management in CONCORD: combining transaction management; workflow management and cooperation control,Bernhard Mitschang; Theo Harder; Norbert Ritter,Design management is an encompassing task supporting cooperative design processesentirely. This requirement can best be fulfilled by exploiting concepts from transactionmanagement; workflow management and cooperation control. On the one hand; each ofthese areas must be adapted to the field of design; while on the other hand; the necessity ofan adequate interplay of these components reveals multiple facets of interoperability. TheCONCORD (CONtrolling COopeRation in Design environments) processing model faces allthese problems and allows a straightforward mapping of the processing structurespredominating in design and; thus; serves as a cooperative and interoperable processingmodel for CAD frameworks; eg the PRIMA framework; our testbed and prototype system.

Extended techniques for flexible modeling and execution of data mashups,Pascal Hirmer; Peter Reimann; Matthias Wieland; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract Today; a multitude of highly-connected applications and information systems hold;consume and produce huge amounts of heterogeneous data. The overall amount of data iseven expected to dramatically increase in the future. In order to conduct; eg; data analysis;visualizations or other value-adding scenarios; it is necessary to integrate specific; relevantparts of data into a common source. Due to oftentimes changing environments and dynamicrequests; this integration has to support ad-hoc and flexible data processing capabilities.Furthermore; an iterative and explorative trial-and-error integration based on different datasources has to be possible. To cope with these requirements; several data mashupplatforms have been developed in the past.

A service-based approach for next-generation product lifecycle management,Stefan Silcher; Jorge Minguez; Thorsten Scheibler; Bernhard Mitschang,Nowadays; one of the main challenges for companies is the effective management of IT-systems. In times where requirements and companies change steadily; the IT-infrastructurehas to adopt these changes as well: new systems have to be integrated or existing adapted.Even worse; these systems work together to support business processes of a company and;thus; the infrastructures becomes complex and difficult to manage. The same situation is truefor Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) that accompanies a product development bymeans of interconnected IT systems running on complex IT infrastructures. This paperintroduces a viable solution to the integration of all phases of PLM. An Enterprise ServiceBus (ESB) is employed as the service-based integration and communication infrastructure.Three exemplary scenarios are introduced to describe the benefits of using an ESB as …,Information Reuse and Integration (IRI); 2010 IEEE International Conference on,2010,14
A SOA-based approach for the integration of a data propagation system,Jorge Minguez; Mihály Jakob; Uwe Heinkel; Bernhard Mitschang,Major challenges that companies face nowadays are extremely volatile markets; a globallydistributed supplier network and constantly changing business environments. Thesecircumstances demand a high level of agility and extraordinary flexibility in the businessmodeling and the organizational structures of a company as well as adaptive andinteroperable IT systems. In order to meet these requirements an integration of systemsneeds to be achieved. A possible solution for this problem is Champagne; which is a datapropagation system that ensures the interoperability of enterprise applications at the datalevel. However; Champagne provides a tightly-coupled integration of applications and itsarchitecture lacks the needed flexibility to link business processes. These deficiencies canbe overcome with the adoption of a service-oriented architecture (SOA); based on loosely …,Information Reuse & Integration; 2009. IRI'09.

Secondly; it can beexploited as a basic service within collaboration frameworks to effectively manage commonwork and information spaces.,Computers in Industry,2003,14
SOA-GovMM: A meta model for a comprehensive SOA governance repository,Jan Königsberger; Stefan Silcher; Bernhard Mitschang,In recent years; the paradigm of service-oriented architecture (SOA) has more and morefound its way into many organizations. The SOA principles of loosely coupled and reusableservices has convinced decision makers in many organizations to start SOA initiatives. Yet;the lack of proper governance mechanisms has doomed many projects to fail. Althoughsome SOA governance frameworks exist; they differ highly in scope and none of themcovers the whole spectrum necessary to properly govern a SOA. In this paper we identifyand discuss eleven core areas the governance of a SOA has to cover in order to realize theintended benefit in flexibility and agility. We then analyze and evaluate existing SOAgovernance frameworks with regard to those requirements. Subsequently; we present ameta model composed of four parts: Service Provider; Service Consumer; Organizational …,Information Reuse and Integration (IRI); 2014 IEEE 15th International Conference on,2014,13

FlexMash–flexible data mashups based on pattern-based model transformation,Pascal Hirmer; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract Today; the ad-hoc processing and integration of data is an important issue due tofast growing IT systems and an increased connectivity of the corresponding data sources.The overall goal is deriving high-level information based on a huge amount of low-leveldata. However; an increasing amount of data leads to high complexity and many technicalchallenges. Especially non-IT expert users are overburdened with highly complex solutionssuch as Extract-Transform-Load processes. To tackle these issues; we need a means toabstract from technical details and provide a flexible execution of data processing andintegration scenarios. In this paper; we present an approach for modeling and pattern-basedexecution of data mashups based on Mashup Plans; a domain-specific mashup model thathas been introduced in previous work.

Method and apparatus for optimization in workflow management systems,*,Activities within a workflow are either data management activities (DMAs) or non-DMAs. Aworkflow is typically carried out by a system by executing one activity after the other. Thiscan; however; be very time consuming. A method and system are provided for optimizing agroup of activities (GOA) comprising a DMA; whereby the GOA is comprised in the workflowto improve the overall performance. The method determines the DMAs; and for each DMA; adata level statement (DLS). The GOA is determined and a process graph model (PGM) isdetermined from the GOA so that the DLS is comprised in the PGM and the semantics of thePGM are identical to those of the GOA. The PGM is optimized for which an optimized GOA isdetermined. The semantics of the optimized GOA are identical to those of the GOA. In theworkflow; the GOA is replaced by the optimized GOA.,*,2012,12
DiSCO: A distributed semantic cache overlay for location-based services,Carlos Lubbe; Andreas Brodt; Nazario Cipriani; Matthias Großmann; Bernhard Mitschang,Location-based services (LBS) have gained tremendous popularity with millions ofsimultaneous users daily. LBS handle very large data volumes and face enormous queryloads. Both the data and the queries possess high locality: spatial data is distributed veryunevenly around the globe; query load is different throughout the day; and users oftensearch for similar things in the same places. This causes high load peaks at the data tier ofLBS; which may seriously degrade performance. To cope with these load peaks; we presentDiSCO; a distributed semantic cache overlay for LBS. DiSCO exploits the spatial; temporaland semantic locality in the queries of LBS and distributes frequently accessed data overmany nodes. Based on the Content-Addressable Network (CAN) peer-to-peer approach;DiSCO achieves high scalability by partitioning data using spatial proximity.

Streamjoin: A generic database approach to support the class of stream-oriented applications,Clara Nippl; Ralf Rantzau; Bernhard Mitschang,Today many applications routinely generate large quantities of data. The data often takesthe form of (time) series; or more generally streams; ie an ordered sequence of records.Analysis of this data requires stream processing techniques which differ in significant waysfrom what current database analysis and query techniques have been optimized for. In thispaper we present a new operator; called StreamJoin; that can efficiently be used to solvestream-related problems of various applications; such as universal quantification; patternrecognition and data mining. Contrary to other approaches. StreamJoin processing providesrapid response times; a non-blocking execution as well as economical resource utilization.Adaptability to different application scenarios is realized by means of parameters.

Bymanually building a spatial index; only a fraction of the available resources can be covered.This paper introduces a system for the automatic mapping of web pages to geographicallocations. Our web robot uses several sets of domain specific keywords; lexical contextrules; that are automatically learned; and a hierarchical catalogue of geographical locationsthat provides exact geographical coordinates for locations. Spatially indexed web pages areused to construct Geographical Web Portals; which can be accessed by different location-based applications. In addition; we present experimental results demonstrating the quantityand the quality of automatically indexed web pages.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2005,11
A customizable shared information space to support concurrent design,Aiko Frank; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract Sharing data is an important aspect in distributed design environments and shouldbe supported by an underlying system. Any synchronous access to data is conflict prone.Applying concurrency control and two phase commit are one option to be considered. Butdesign processes also demand for cooperation between the designers. Negotiation aboutactions on the product under design and the early exchange of preliminary results arecrucial issues. Controlled data access by itself does not fulfil all the needs for cooperation.We will present a new approach that relies on a concept and system model which integratesconcurrent activities by a joint information space offering flexible protocols for cooperationon the shared objects. We will describe the customizability of the protocols to effectivelysupport different cooperative scenarios.,Computers in Industry,2002,11
Universal quantification in relational databases: A classification of data and algorithms,Ralf Rantzau; Leonard Shapiro; Bernhard Mitschang; Quan Wang,Abstract Queries containing universal quantification are used in many applications;including business intelligence applications. Several algorithms have been proposed toimplement universal quantification efficiently. These algorithms are presented in an isolatedmanner in the research literature-typically; no relationships are shown between them.Furthermore; each of these algorithms claims to be superior to others; but in fact eachalgorithm has optimal performance only for certain types of input data. In this paper; wepresent a comprehensive survey of the structure and performance of algorithms for universalquantification. We introduce a framework for classifying all possible kinds of input data foruniversal quantification. Then we go on to identify the most efficient algorithm for each suchclass.

Data patterns to alleviate the design of scientific workflows exemplified by a bone simulation,Peter Reimann; Holger Schwarz; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract Scientific workflows often have to process huge data sets in a multiplicity of dataformats. For that purpose; they typically embed complex data provisioning tasks thattransform these heterogeneous data into formats the underlying tools or services canhandle. This results in an increased complexity of workflow design. As scientists typicallydesign their scientific workflows on their own; this complexity hinders them to concentrate ontheir core issue; namely the experiments; analyses; or simulations they conduct. In thispaper; we present the core idea of a pattern-based approach to alleviate the design ofscientific workflows. This approach is particularly targeted at the needs of scientists. Weexemplify and assess the pattern-based design approach by applying it to a complexscientific workflow realizing a real-world simulation of structure changes in bones.,Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2014,10
Design; implementation; and evaluation of a tight integration of database and workflow engines,Peter Reimann; Holger Schwarz; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract. Accessing and processing huge amounts of heterogeneous and distributed dataare some of the major challenges of data-intensive workflows. Traditionally; the descriptionsof such workflows focus on their data flow. Nevertheless; control-flow-oriented workflowlanguages are increasingly adapted to the needs of data-intensive workflows. This providesa common level of abstraction for both data-intensive workflows and classical orchestrationworkflows; eg; business workflows; which then enables a comprehensive optimizationacross all workflows. However; the problem still remains that workflows described in control-flow-oriented languages tend to be less efficient for data-intensive processes compared tospecialized data-flow-oriented approaches. In this article; we propose a new kind ofoptimization targeted at data-intensive workflows that are described in control-flow …,Journal of Information and Data Management,2011,10

On efficiently processing nearest neighbor queries in a loosely coupled set of data sources,Thomas Schwarz; Markus Iofcea; Matthias Grossmann; Nicola Hönle; Daniela Nicklas; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract We propose a family of algorithms for processing nearest neighbor (NN) queries inan integration middleware that provides federated access to numerous loosely coupled;autonomous data sources connected through the internet. Previous approaches for paralleland distributed NN queries considered all data sources as relevant; or determined therelevant ones in a single step by exploiting additional knowledge on object counts per datasource. We propose a different approach that does not require such detailed statistics aboutthe distribution of the data. It iteratively enlarges and shrinks the set of relevant data sources.Our experiments show that this yields considerable performance benefits with regard to bothresponse time and effort.

Advanced data processing in KRISYS: modeling concepts; implementation techniques; and client/server issues,Stefan Deßloch; Theo Härder; Nelson Mattos; Bernhard Mitschang; Joachim Thomas,Abstract The increasing power of modern computers is steadily opening up new applicationdomains for advanced data processing such as engineering and knowledge-basedapplications. To meet their requirements; concepts for advanced data management havebeen investigated during the last decade; especially in the field of object orientation. Overthe last couple of years; the database group at the University of Kaiserslautern has beendeveloping such an advanced database system; the KRISYS prototype. In this article; wereport on the results and experiences obtained in the course of this project. The primaryobjective for the first version of KRISYS was to provide semantic features; such as anexpressive data model; a set-oriented query language; deductive as well as activecapabilities. The first KRISYS prototype became completely operational in 1989. To …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,1998,10
Accelerating Profiling Services by Parallel Database Technology,Clara Nippl; Michael Jaedicke; Bernhard Mitschang,AbstractFull text information retrieval on large doc- ument management systems is increasingin popularity; as more users are gaining access to such systems espe- cially by means of WWWinterfaces. In addition; more and more systems offer a so-called profiling1 service to keep usersinformed on newly published documents that match their interests. These growing volumes poseper- formance requirements that cannot be satisfied by tra- ditional database technology. In thispaper we want to report on how parallel database technology can con- tribute to overcome thisproblem. Our discussion is ex- emplified referring to an existing document manage- ment systemthat is currently migrated from a sequen- tial database system to a parallel one.

Conflict management in CONCORD,Norbert Ritter; Bernhard Mitschang; Theo Härder,Abstract Amongst the most important components in concurrent design/engineeringenvironments is a flexible and sophisticated activity management. Due to the fact thatdesigners and design groups generally work in parallel on a common design task; thusperforming collaborate work; activity management on one hand has to support concurrentdesign; whilst on the other hand it has to deal with any kinds of design conflicts either onbasic design data; derived design objects; or even on applied design strategies or designgoals. Since such undesired events and conflicts may occur; an adequate conflictmanagement has to be provided. In this paper; we discuss the concepts and principles ofconflict handling in design environments. As a result of our considerations; we propose alayered conflict management architecture to be integrated with the existing activity …,Proc. 6th Int.

Use of inherent parallelism in database operations,Theo Härder; Ch Hübel; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract Non-standard applications of database systems (eg CAD) are characterized bycomplex objects and powerful user operations. Units of work decomposed from a single useroperation are said to allow for inherent semantic parallelism when they do not conflict witheach other at the level of decomposition. Hence; they can be scheduled concurrently. Inorder to support this processing scheme it is necessary to organize parallel execution byadequate control units. Therefore; client-server processes and nested transactions areapplied to hierarchically structure the DBS-operations. On the other hand; the DBS-codeitself has to be mapped onto a multiprocessor system to take advantage of multipleprocessing units.,International Conference on Parallel Processing,1986,10
Mobile apps in engineering: a process-driven analysis of business potentials and technical challenges,Eva Hoos; Christoph Gröger; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract Mobile apps on smartphones and tablet PCs get more and more employed inenterprises to optimize business processes; eg by elimination of paper-based datacollection. With respect to engineering; mobile apps provide a huge potential for increasedflexibility and efficiency due to their anywhere and anytime characteristics; eg; for producttesting in the field. However; not every usage of mobile apps is beneficial from a businesspoint of view and existing apps for engineering represent only rudimentary front-ends forstationary IT systems without an app-oriented redesign. Hence; there are three corechallenges to leverage the potential of mobile apps in engineering:(1) identifying value-added app usage scenarios from a process point of view;(2) realizing a task-oriented andcontext-aware user interface design and (3) mastering technical obstacles at the app …,Procedia CIRP,2015,9
The Manufacturing Knowledge Repository,Christoph Gröger; Holger Schwarz; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract: The manufacturing industry is faced with strong competition making the companies'knowledge resources and their systematic management a critical success factor. Yet;existing concepts for the management of process knowledge in manufacturing arecharacterized by major shortcomings. Particularly; they are either exclusively based onstructured knowledge; eg; formal rules; or on unstructured knowledge; such as documents;and they focus on isolated aspects of manufacturing processes. To address these issues; wepresent the Manufacturing Knowledge Repository; a holistic repository that consolidatesstructured and unstructured process knowledge to facilitate knowledge management andprocess optimization in manufacturing. First; we define requirements; especially the types ofknowledge to be handled; eg; data mining models and text documents. On this basis; we …,Consolidating Knowledge to Enable Holistic Process Knowledge Management in Manufacturing.

Efficient domain-specific information integration in Nexus,Thomas Schwarz; Nicola Hönle; Matthias Grossmann; Daniela Nicklas; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract In this paper; we present the Nexus approach to efficient domain-specificintegration of many loosely coupled data sources. A so called information maximizingmediation middleware (IMMM) has to cope with large data volumes and many queries; andat the same time achieve a tight semantic integration for the data instances. For efficiencyand practicability reasons; we propose to use an extensible global schema and a limiteddomain-specific query language. This facilitates employing domain-specific semanticknowledge in the middleware: detect duplicates; merge multiple representations; aggregateand generalize information. Finally; we present a working prototype tailored to the domain ofcontext-aware applications.,Workshop on Information Integration on the Web,2004,9
Design and implementation of a CORBA query service accessing EXPRESS-based data,Jürgen Sellentin; Bernhard Mitschang,We describe the design and implementation of a CORBA query service targeted to accessdata that is defined by the EXPRESS data modeling language. EXPRESS is used primarilyin engineering domains (like CAD/CAM and GIS) to describe mostly product model data (likeparts explosion or product geometry). In order to bring query facilities for EXPRESS-baseddata to CORBA a number of design decisions have to be taken; although the CORBA queryservice is standardized by the OMG. Among the most important and performance-indicatingdecisions are the definition of an appropriate query language and the description of thequery result data structures. We discuss solutions to these topics and report on theexperiences gained in designing and implementing our first CORBA query service forEXPRESS-based data.,Database Systems for Advanced Applications; 1999.

Enhancing knowledge processing in client/server environments,Joachim Thomas; Bernhard Mitschang; N Mattos; Stefan Deßloch,Abstract A great variety of techniques has been developed to optimize and enhance queryprocessing for relational; client/server; distribute~ parallel; and heterogeneous databasesystems (DBS). Baaed on that work and experience; we investigate how far thosetechniques are applicable to query processing in Knowledge Base Management Systems(KBMS). Our reference systemistheKRISYS KBMS that consists of a knowledge-processingsystem at the client (clientbaaed processing) and a data-processing system at the server(databasebackend). We describe a unifying thrnework for query; processing incorporatingboth processing systems (as realized in KRISYS). This allows to distribute and balance theamount of work done in the client and in the server.

An approach to integrated office document processing and management,Nelson Mendonca Mattos; Bernhard Mitschang; Andreas Dengel; Rainer Bleisinger,Abstract We propose an approach towards an integrated document processing andmanagement system that has the intention to capture essentially freely structureddocuments; like those typically used in the office domain. The document analysis systemANASTASIL is capable to reveal the structure as well as the contents of complex paperdocuments. Moreover; it facilitates the handling of the containing information. Analyzeddocuments are stored in the management system KRISYS that is connected to severaldifferent subsequent services. The described system can be considered as an idealextension of the human clerk; making his tasks in information processing easier.

Dynamic ontology-based sensor binding,Pascal Hirmer; Matthias Wieland; Uwe Breitenbücher; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract In recent years; the Internet of Things gains more and more attention through cheaphardware devices and; consequently; an increased interconnection of them. These devicesequipped with sensors and actuators form the foundation for so called smart environmentsthat enable monitoring as well as self-organization. However; an efficient sensor registration;binding; and sensor data provisioning is still a major issue for the Internet of Things. Usually;these steps can take up to days or even weeks due to a manual configuration and bindingby sensor experts that furthermore have to communicate with domain-experts that define therequirements; eg the types of sensors; for the smart environments.

Improving Business Processes through Mobile Apps,Eva Hoos; Christoph Gröger; Stefan Kramer; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract: Mobile apps offer new possibilities to improve business processes. However; theintroduction of mobile apps is typically carried out from a technology point of view. Hence;process improvement from a business point of view is not guaranteed. There is amethodological lack for a holistic analysis of business processes regarding mobiletechnology. For this purpose; we present an analysis framework; which comprises asystematic methodology to identify value-added usage scenarios of mobile technology inbusiness processes with a special focus on mobile apps. The framework is based on multi-criteria analysis and portfolio analysis techniques and it is evaluated in a case-orientedinvestigation in the automotive industry.,proceedings of the 16th International Confrence on Enterprise Information Systems (ICEIS),2014,8
Efficient resource attribute retrieval in RDF triple stores,Andreas Brodt; Oliver Schiller; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract The W3C Resource Description Framework (RDF) is gaining popularity for its abilityto manage semi-structured data without a predefined database schema. So far; most RDFquery processors have concentrated on finding complex graph patterns in RDF; whichtypically involves a high number of joins. This works very well to query resources by therelations between them. Yet; obtaining a record-like view on the attributes of resources; asnatively supported by RDBMS; imposes unnecessary performance burdens; as theindividual attributes must be joined to assemble the final result records. We present anapproach to retrieve the attributes of resources efficiently. We first determine the resources inquestion and then retrieve all their attributes efficiently at once; exploiting contiguousstorage in RDF indexes. In addition; we present an index structure which is specifically …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,8

Service-based integration in event-driven manufacturing environments,Jorge Minguez; Frank Ruthardt; Philipp Riffelmacher; Thorsten Scheibler; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract Constantly changing business conditions require a high level of flexibility inbusiness processes as well as an adaptive and fully interoperable IT infrastructure in today'smanufacturing environments. The lack of flexibility prevents manufacturing companies toimprove their responsiveness and to adapt their workflows to turbulent scenarios. In order toachieve highly flexible and adaptive workflows; information systems in digital factories andshop floors need to be integrated. The most challenging problem in such manufacturingenvironments is the high heterogeneity of the IT landscape; where the integration of legacysystems and information silos has lead to chaotic architectures over the last two decades. Inorder to overcome this issue; we present a flexible integration platform that allows a loosecoupling of distributed services in event-driven manufacturing environments.

A statistics propagation approach to enable cost-based optimization of statement sequences,Tobias Kraft; Holger Schwarz; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract Query generators producing sequences of SQL statements are embedded in manyapplications. As the response time of such sequences is often far from optimal; theiroptimization is an important issue. CGO (Coarse-Grained Optimization) is an appropriateoptimization approach that applies rewrite rules to statement sequences. In previous workon CGO; a heuristic; priority-based control strategy was utilized to choose and executerewrite rules. In this paper; we present an approach to enable cost-based optimization ofstatement sequences. We show how to exploit histogram propagation and the costingcomponent of the underlying database system for this purpose. Our work extends previouswork on histogram propagation. We conclude with experiments demonstrating theeffectiveness of our approach.,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2007,7
Towards an operation model for generated web applications,Mihály Jakob; Holger Schwarz; Fabian Kaiser; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract This paper describes a new approach for the development of data-intensive webapplications that depend on non-trivial data manipulation. E-Commerce web sites; on-lineauction systems and large enterprise web portals fall into this category; as they requirecomprehensive data access; data processing and data manipulation capabilities. However;existing methodologies mainly concentrate on modeling content; navigation andpresentation aspects of read-only web sites.

On sharing of objects in concurrent design,Aiko Frank; Bernhard Mitschang,Sharing data is an important aspect in distributed design environments and should besupported by an underlying system. Any synchronous access to data is conflict prone.Applying concurrency control and two phase commit are an option to be considered. Butdesign processes also demand cooperation between the designers. Negotiation aboutactions on the product under design and the early exchange of preliminary results arecrucial issues. Controlled data access by itself doesn't fulfil all the needs for cooperation. Wepresent a new approach that relies on a concept and system model which integratesconcurrent activities by a common information space offering flexible protocols forcooperation on the shared objects.

A pattern approach to conquer the data complexity in simulation workflow design,Peter Reimann; Holger Schwarz; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract Scientific workflows may be used to enable the collaborative implementation ofscientific applications across various domains. Since each domain has its own requirementsand solutions for data handling; such workflows often have to deal with a highlyheterogeneous data environment. This results in an increased complexity of workflowdesign. As scientists typically design their scientific workflows on their own; this complexityhinders them to concentrate on their core issue; namely the experiments; analyses; orsimulations they conduct.

Improving workflow project quality via business process patterns based on organizational structure aspects,Lucinéia Heloisa Thom; Cirano Iochpe; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract: The correct definition of business process is a key to achieve quality in workflowproject. Accordingly; this paper proposes business (sub) process candidate patterns to beused in business process modelling. The candidate patterns differ from other proposals firstbecause they focus on task flow descriptions and second because they are based onorganizational structural aspects. Our proposal is to store the patterns in the catalogue of theTransactional Metamodel of Business Process introduced in this paper. The metamodelmakes feasible the modelling of business process through the use of business subprocesspatterns based on organizational structural aspects. An additionally feature of themetamodel supports the generation of business subprocess patterns through the BusinessProcess Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL4WS).,XML4BPM 2005,2005,6

Selective storing of mining models for enabling interactive data mining,*,Computerized methods; data processing systems; and computer program products forstoring of data mining models (DMMs) are provided. A new DMM is created having at leastone of the following characteristics: quality and complexity. The new DMM is handled as acandidate for storing in a storage device if a predefined criterion for the characteristics ismet. The sum of the sizes of the new DMM and already stored DMMs is determined. Inresponse to the sum falling below a storage limit; the new DMM is stored in the storagedevice. In response to the sum exceeding the storage limit; a decision is taken based onpriorities of the DMMs which DMMs to store in the storage device.

M-TOP: multi-target operator placement of query graphs for data streams,Nazario Cipriani; Oliver Schiller; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract Nowadays; many applications processes stream-based data; such as financialmarket analysis; network intrusion detection; or visualization applications. To process stream-based data in an application-independent manner; distributed stream processing systemsemerged. They typically translate a query to an operator graph; place the operators tostream processing nodes; and execute them to process the streamed data. The operatorplacement is crucial in such systems; as it deeply influences query execution. Often; differentstream-based applications require dedicated placement of query graphs according to theirspecific objectives; eg bandwidth not less than 500 MBit/s and costs not more that 1 costunit. This fact constraints operator placement. Existing approaches do not take into accountapplication-specific objectives; thus not reflecting application-specific placement …,Proceedings of the 15th Symposium on International Database Engineering & Applications,2011,5
Beyond roles: Prediction model-based process resource management,Florian Niedermann; Alexandru Pavel; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract The outcome of a business process (eg; duration; cost; success rate) dependssignificantly on how well the assigned resources perform at their respective tasks. Currently;this assignment is typically based on a static resource query that specifies the minimumrequirements (eg; role) a resource has to meet. This approach has the major downside thatany resource whatsoever that meets the requirements can be retrieved; possibly selectingresources that do not perform well on the task. To address this challenge; we present andevaluate in this paper a model-based approach that uses data integration and miningtechniques for selecting resources based on their likely performance for the task or sub-process at hand.,International Conference on Business Information Systems,2011,5
Resource discovery protocols for bluetooth-based ad-hoc smart spaces: Architectural considerations and protocol evaluation,Andreas Brodt; Alexander Wobser; Bernhard Mitschang,Ad-hoc smart spaces aim at resource-rich mobile devices sharing resource and context datawith others near them spontaneously. Thus; a device may; eg; obtain a more completecontext model by utilizing sensor data of its neighbors via wireless communication; such asBluetooth. The highly dynamic device neighborhood challenges resource discovery; as thedevices have to organize themselves autonomously. This paper evaluates different resourcediscovery protocols in Bluetooth-based ad-hoc smart spaces. We simulate the protocols indifferent scenarios taking into account the scatternet structure of the network. We suggestrequest flooding for small settings and random replication for medium to large spaces.,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2010 Eleventh International Conference on,2010,5
An XQuery-based trigger service to bring consistency management to data integration systems,Jing Lu; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract Nowadays XML-based data integration systems are accepted as data serviceproviders on the web. In order to make such a data integration system fully equipped withdata manipulation capabilities; programming frameworks which support update at theintegration level are being developed. When the user is permitted to submit updates; it isnecessary to establish the best possible data consistency in the whole data integrationsystem. To that extend; we present an approach based on an XQuery trigger service. Wedefine an XQuery trigger model together with its semantics. We report on the integration ofthe XQuery trigger service into the overall architecture and discuss details of the executionmodel. Experiments show that data consistency is enforced easily; efficiently andconveniently at the global level.,Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Information Integration and Web-based Applications & Services,2008,5
Towards the design of a scalable email archiving and discovery solution,Frank Wagner; Kathleen Krebs; Cataldo Mega; Bernhard Mitschang; Norbert Ritter,Abstract In this paper we propose a novel approach to specialize a general purposeEnterprise Content Management (ECM) System into an Email Archiving and Discovery(EAD) System. The magnitude and range of compliance risks associated with themanagement of EAD is driving investment in the development of more effective and efficientapproaches to support regulatory compliance; legal discovery and content life-cycle needs.Companies must recognize and address requirements like legal compliance; electronicdiscovery; and document retention management. What is needed today are EAD systemscapable to process very high message ingest rates; support distributed full text indexing; andallow forensic search such to support litigation cases. All this must be provided at lowest costwith respect to archive management and administration.

Improving application integration with model-driven engineering,Clemens Dorda; Uwe Heinkel; Bernhard Mitschang,ABSTRACT Modern software for Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) provide tools formodeling integration scenarios. A drawback of these tools is the missing functionality toexchange or integrate models of different EAI products. Consequently; developers candescribe real heterogeneous IT environments only partially. Our goal is to avoid the creationof these so-called 'integration islands'. For that purpose we present an approach whichintroduces an abstract view by technology-independent and multivendor-capable modelingfor both development and maintenance. With this approach; we propose a toolset-andrepository-based refinement of the abstract view to automate the implementation with realproducts and the deployment on real platforms.,*,2007,5

Situation recognition and handling based on executing situation templates and situation-aware workflows,Pascal Hirmer; Matthias Wieland; Holger Schwarz; Bernhard Mitschang; Uwe Breitenbücher; Santiago Gómez Sáez; Frank Leymann,Abstract Today; the Internet of Things has evolved due to an advanced interconnectivity ofhardware devices equipped with sensors and actuators. Such connected environments arenowadays well-known as smart environments. Famous examples are smart homes; smartcities; and smart factories. Such environments should only be called “smart” if they allowmonitoring and self-organization. However; this is a great challenge:(1) sensors have to bebound and sensor data have to be efficiently provisioned to enable monitoring of theseenvironments;(2) situations have to be detected based on sensor data; and (3) based on therecognized situations; a reaction has to be triggered to enable self-organization; eg; throughnotification delivery or the execution of workflows.

The secure data container: an approach to harmonize data sharing with information security,Christoph Stach; Bernhard Mitschang,Smart devices became Marc Weiser's Computer of the 21st Century. Due to their versatility alot of private data enriched by context data are stored on them. Even the health industryutilizes smart devices as portable health monitors and enablers for telediagnosis. So theyrepresent a severe risk for information security. Yet the platform providers' countermeasuresto these threats are by no means sufficient. In this paper we describe how informationsecurity can be improved. Therefore; we postulate requirements towards a secure handlingof data. Based on this requirements specification; we introduce a secure data container asan extension for the Privacy Management Platform. Since a complete isolation of an app isusually not practicable; our approach also provides secure data sharing features. Finally; weevaluate our approach from a technical point of view as well as a security point of view …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2016 17th IEEE International Conference on,2016,4

The Deep Data Warehouse: Link-Based Integration and Enrichment of Warehouse Data and Unstructured Content,Christoph Gröger; Holger Schwarz; Bernhard Mitschang,Data warehouses are at the core of enterprise IT and enable the efficient storage andanalysis of structured data. Besides; unstructured content; eg; emails and documents;constitutes more than half of the entire enterprise data and contains a lot of implicitknowledge about warehouse entities. Thus; holistic ana-lytics require the integration ofstructured warehouse data and unstructured content to generate novel insights. Theseinsights can also be used to enrich the integrated data and to create a new basis for furtheranalytics. Existing integration approaches only support a limited range of analyticalapplications and require the costly adaptation of the warehouse schema.

Elastic load-balancing in a distributed spatial cache overlay,Carlos Lübbe; Anja Reuter; Bernhard Mitschang,Location-based services (LBS) have gained enormous popularity; which imposes increasingquery loads at the data tier of an LBS. Yet; the data access patterns of LBS typically possesshigh temporal and spatial locality. Therefore; a dedicated spatial cache which providesefficient access to the data currently needed may considerably reduce this load. To ensurehigh throughput; multiple cache nodes can collaborate in a distributed spatial cache overlay;which balances load among the nodes. However; load-balancing is a non-trivial task in thiscontext; as load spreads unevenly in space and varies notably over time. This requiresconstant readjustment to shifting hot spots. We present an elastic load-balancingmechanism between cache nodes that is based on the physical model of a particle-springsystem.

A provenance-aware service repository for EAI process modeling tools,Jorge Minguez; Florian Niedermann; Bernhard Mitschang,One of the major challenges for Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) process modelingtools is the continuous adaptation of the business processes and services. Business and ITspecialists are both confronted with a number of problems involved in the adaptation of suchprocesses; such as the lack of support for process lifecycle management; data andfunctional interoperability problems or the appropriate service knowledge base. Currently;most service engineering methods adopt a lifecycle strategy for the design; implementation;deployment and evaluation of services. However; enterprises exploiting service reusabilitylack the knowledge on process dependencies across the entire service lifecycle. Thisknowledge is required by process modeling tools in order to keep EAI processes loosely-coupled.

A mobile data management architecture for interoperability of resource and context data,Andreas Brodt; Oliver Schiller; Sailesh Sathish; Bernhard Mitschang,Mobile devices have become general-purpose computers that are equipped with sensors;constantly access the internet; and almost always accompany the user. Consequently;devices manage many different kinds of data about the user's life and context. There isconsiderable overlap in this data; as different applications handle similar data domains.Applications often keep this data in separated data silos. Web applications; which managelarge amounts of personal data; hardly share this data with other applications at all. This lackof interoperability creates redundancy and impacts usability of mobile devices. We present adata management architecture for mobile devices to support interoperability betweenapplications; devices and web applications at the data management level.

Therefore; we developed a new approach thatintegrates Logistic Simulation and Layout Planning to fulfil the goal of improving theproduction system. Our approach is based on propagation and transformation of datachanges concerning the continuous adaptation tasks among the Layout Planning andLogistics Simulation systems. Instead of relying on a tightly integrated global data schema;we connect systems only as far as required by building “bridges” between them. Thesystems that participate in the integration are kept autonomous. We use several state-of-the-art XML technologies in our integration system.,Proceedings of the 36th CIRP International Seminar on Manufacturing Systems (CIRP ISMS 2003),2003,4
Föderal: Management of Engineering Data Using a Semistructured Data Model.,Christoph Mangold; Ralf Rantzau; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract: The Föderal system is a flexible repository for the management; integration andmodeling of product data. Current systems in this domain employ object-oriented datamodels. Whereas this is adequate for the management of product data; it proves insufficientfor integration and modeling. Present semistructured data models; however; are suitedideally for integration; but data management and also modeling is a problem. In this paperwe describe our approach to narrow down the gap between structured and semistructureddata models. We present the Föderal information system which employs a newsemistructured data model and show how this model can be used in the context ofmanagement; integration; and modeling of engineering data.,ICEIS (3),2003,4

Extracting information andgenerating knowledge from this data is a great challenge. To cope with this issue–oftentimesreferred to as big data problem–we need effective means for efficient data integration; dataprocessing; and data analysis. To enable flexible; explorative and ad-hoc data processing;several data mashup approaches and tools have been developed in the past. One of thesetools is FlexMash–a data mashup tool developed at the University of Stuttgart. By offeringdomain-specific graphical modeling as well as a pattern-based execution; FlexMashenables usage by a wide range of users; both domain experts and technical experts. Thecore idea of FlexMash is a flexible execution of data mashups using different; user-requirement-dependent execution components.

Cooperative service registries for the service-based Product Lifecycle Management architecture,Stefan Silcher; Jan Königsberger; Peter Reimann; Bernhard Mitschang,Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) comprises many different tasks across multipledomains; such as product development and production. Thus; multidisciplinary engineeringteams have to collaborate to successfully design and produce products. Nowadays;engineers are supported with many software solutions; which are tailored to the work ofeach engineer.

The lack of flexibility prevents manufacturing companies fromimproving their responsiveness and adapting their workflows to turbulent scenarios. In orderto achieve highly flexible and adaptive workflows; information systems in digital factoriesand shop floors need to be integrated. The most challenging problem in such manufacturingenvironments is the high heterogeneity of the IT landscape; where the integration of legacysystems and information silos has led to chaotic architectures over the last two decades. Inorder to overcome this issue; the authors present a flexible integration platform that allows aloose coupling of distributed services in event-driven manufacturing environments. The …,*,2013,3

Dynamic provisioning of system topologies in the cloud,Thomas Ritter; Bernhard Mitschang; Cataldo Mega,Abstract Today's IT infrastructures of companies are dimensioned to cover highly diverseworkloads. In particular; it must be guaranteed that peak workloads can be processedaccording to concerted Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Consequently; companies haveto cope with high acquisition costs of IT resources such as machines and software includingcosts for their maintainance and operation to meet these requirements. Thereby; achieving ahigh utilization of the available resources during most of the time is not possible. Based onthese facts; companies endeavor to outsource their IT infrastructure to IT service providers;which in turn intend to offer respectively tailored and on-demand usable IT services usingcloud computing paradigms. Obviously; the IT service providers are anxious to minimize thetotal cost of ownership (TCO) of their operating environments. Therefore; their goal is to …,*,2012,3
Exploiting the symbiotic aspects of process and operational data for optimizing business processes,Sylvia Radeschütz; Marko Vrhovnik; Holger Schwarz; Bernhard Mitschang,A profound analysis of all relevant business data in a company is necessary for optimizingbusiness processes effectively. Current analyses typically run either on business processexecution data or on operational business data. Correlations among the separate data setshave to be found manually under big effort. However; to achieve a more informative analysisand to fully optimize a company's business; an efficient consolidation of all major datasources is indispensable. Recent matching algorithms are insufficient for this task since theyare restricted either to schema or to process matching.

Reference management in a loosely coupled; distributed information system,Matthias Grossmann; Nicola Hönle; Daniela Nicklas; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract References between objects in loosely coupled distributed information systemspose a problem. On the one hand; one tries to avoid referential inconsistencies like; eg;dangling links in the WWW. On the other hand; using strict constraints as in databases mayrestrict the data providers severely. We present the solution to this problem that wedeveloped for the Nexus system. The approach tolerates referential inconsistencies in thedata while providing consistent query answers to users. For traversing references; wepresent a concept based on return references. This concept is especially suitable forinfrequent object migrations and provides a good query performance. For scenarios whereobject migrations are frequent; we developed an alternative concept based on a distributedhash table.,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2008,3

Email archiving and discovery as a service,Frank Wagner; Kathleen Krebs; Cataldo Mega; Bernhard Mitschang; Norbert Ritter,Summary Corporate governance and legislative regulations are forcing companies toextend their IT infrastructure by Email Archive and Discovery (EAD) systems for compliancereasons. Praxis shows that every installation is different from another; not only in terms of theexecution infrastructure; but also in terms of eg document and archiving procedures thatmap a company's own business rules. As a consequence; EAD systems have to be highlycustomizable to their intended usages. For this purpose; we propose a service-orientedapproach at various levels of detail that; on one hand; allows for describing EAD propertiesat the abstract (service) level and; on the other hand; supports the appropriate mapping ofthese services to the existing execution infrastructure. In this paper; we focus on thedevelopment and (architectural) design of an EAD system; which is well suited to fulfill …,*,2008,3
A methodology and guide for effective reuse in integration architectures for enterprise applications,Ralf Wagner; Bernhard Mitschang,Integration architectures for enterprise applications use adapter and middlewaretechnologies to integrate remote systems and to provide uniform access.

This requires to write new adapters even if adapters to theremote systems already exist; however; in incompatible technologies. Our formerlyintroduced visualization approach enables reuse of adapters and even of whole middlewaresystems.

Symbiosis in the Intranet: How Document Retrieval Benefits from Database Information.,Christoph Mangold; Holger Schwarz; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract The enterprise information space is split in two hemispheres. Documents containunstructured or semistructured information; structured information is stored in databases. Asregards the content; both kinds of information are complementary parts. However; enterpriseinformation systems usually focus on one part; only. Our approach improves documentretrieval in the intranet by exploiting the enterprise's databases. In particular; we exploitdatabase information to describe the context of documents and exploit this context toenhance common full text search. In this paper; we show how to model and computedocument context and present results on runtime performance.,COMAD,2006,3

Agent protocols for integration and cooperation in a design application framework,Aiko Frank,Abstract Design is a discipline; which requires support for the combination of differentsystems and tools; spontaneous interaction between designers; sharing of (design) data;and adaptability to altering conditions. When looking at design processes it is a demandingtask to coordinate and organize the work of the different team members.

TOGA—A Customizable Service for Data-Centric Collaboration,Jürgen Sellentin; Aiko Frank; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract Collaboration in cooperative information systems; like concurrent design andengineering; exploits common work and information spaces. In this paper we introduce theTOGA service (T ransaction-O riented G roup and Coordination Service for Data-Centric Applications); which offers group management facilities and a push model for changepropagation wrt shared data; thus allowing for group awareness. Through TOGA'scustomizability and its layered architecture the service can be adapted to a variety ofdifferent collaboration scenarios. Multiple communication protocols (CORBA; UDP/IP;TCP/IP) are supported as well as basic transaction properties. Our approach enables theevolution of a set of separate applications to form a cooperative information system; ie; itprovides a technique towards component-oriented system engineering.

On the application of parallel database technology for large scale document management systems,Alexander Clausnitzer; Michael Jaedicke; Bernhard Mitschang; Clara Nippl; Angelika Reiser; Stephan Zimmermann,Modern document management systems administer an increasing amount of data.Unfortunately traditional database technology cannot satisfy the resulting performancerequirements. We report on how parallel database technology can contribute to make largeand scalable document management systems work. Our discussion clearly shows thatsimply substituting a sequential database system for a parallel one does not necessarilylead to scalability and high performance. In contrast; detailed knowledge of the applicationand document management system is necessary to decide on the optimal architecture of theparallel database system; its query optimization and parallelization strategies; as well as onits data fragmentation scheme and load balancing properties.

Using PRIMA-DBMS as a testbed for parallel complex-object processing,C Hubel; Bernhard Mitschang; Michael Gesmann; Andreas Grasnickel; W Kafer; H Schoning; T Harder,The PRIMA-DBMS approach is explained by introducing PRIMA's architecture and queryprocessing framework. The PRIMA-DBMS constitutes a testbed that is flexible enough tosupport evaluation and validation of quite a variation of different strategies for complex-object processing taking into account different parallelization levels an different hardwareenvironments. Thus; PRIMA marks and important step towards the authors' main researchgoal concerning measures for efficient complex-object processing: the measures that are incompetition with each other are query optimization; query evaluation strategies; andmassive storage; that all benefit from parallelism. The programming environment thatsupports the parallel DBMS processing is introduced with special emphasis on its ability forparametrization and configuration.

Internet of Things Out of the Box: Using TOSCA for Automating the Deployment of IoT Environments,Ana Cristina Franco da Silva; U Breitenbücher; P Hirmer; K Képes; O Kopp; F Leymann; B Mitschang; R Steinke,Abstract: The automated setup of Internet of Things environments is a major challenge dueto the heterogeneous nature of the involved physical components (ie; devices; sensors;actuators). In general; IoT environments consist of (i) physical hardware components;(ii) IoTmiddlewares that bind the hardware to the digital world; and (iii) IoT applications that interactwith the physical devices through the middlewares (eg; for monitoring). Setting up each ofthese requires sophisticated means for software deployment. In this paper; we enable sucha means by introducing an approach for automated deployment of entire IoT environmentsusing the Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications standard. Basedon topology models; all components involved in the IoT environment (devices; IoTmiddlewares; applications) can be set up automatically.

M2DDM–a maturity model for data-driven manufacturing,Christian Weber; Jan Königsberger; Laura Kassner; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract To stay competitive in a global market; companies strive to adjust their ITarchitectures to the characteristics of Industrie 4.0. This means the adaptation of a data-driven manufacturing model; which includes the horizontal and vertical integration of thevalue chain and the management of data across the whole product life cycle. Currentlycompanies face two major problems in this transformation of their IT architectures: 1) Thereare multiple reference architectures for Industrie 4.0; whose suitability has not beenevaluated in a straightforward way. 2) There are no maturity models to objectively assessdata-driven IT architectures. In this work we address these problems by providing anoverview of Industrie 4.0 features in multiple reference architectures and developing amaturity model for IT architectures for data-driven manufacturing.

A mobile dashboard for analytics-based information provisioning on the shop floor,Christoph Gröger; Christoph Stach; Bernhard Mitschang; Engelbert Westkämper,Today's turbulent global environment requires agility and flexibility of manufacturingcompanies to stay competitive. Thus; employees have to monitor their performancecontinuously and react quickly to turbulences which demands real-time informationprovisioning across all hierarchy levels. However; existing manufacturing IT systems; forexample; manufacturing execution systems (MES); do hardly address information needs ofindividual employees on the shop floor. Besides; they do not exploit advanced analytics togenerate novel insights for process optimisation. To address these issues; the operationalprocess dashboard for manufacturing (OPDM) is presented; a mobile data-mining-baseddashboard for workers and supervisors on the shop floor. It enables proactive optimisationby providing analytical information anywhere and anytime in the factory. In this paper; first …,International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing,2016,2
Holistic load-balancing in a distributed spatial cache,Carlos Luebbe; Bernhard Mitschang,A steadily growing number of people using location based services (LBS) inflict massivequery loads on the data tier of an LBS. As such queries usually possess considerableoverlap; multiple cache nodes collaborating in a distributed spatial cache can providescalable access to frequently used data. To preserve high throughput throughout thecomplete execution process; it is necessary to balance the accumulating load among theparticipating cache nodes. In this work; we identify three key-indicators to improve resourceutilization during the load-balancing process: data skew; anticipated data access patternsand dynamic load peaks. For this reason; we introduce a comprehensive mathematicalmodel to express the key-indicators as probability distribution functions. We fuse the differentkey-indicators into a single holistic distribution model. In the course of this; we devise a …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2013 IEEE 14th International Conference on,2013,2

Issues and characteristics of testing as part of the design process in mechanical engineering,Philipp Janowski; Bernhard Mitschang; Andreas Gollmann,The design process is a fundamental part of a product development project lifecycle.However the design is not yet finished after the final CAD models and engineering drawingshave left the CSCW tools. The design process is highly interconnected with subsequentproject phases; especially testing. As; eg in the automotive industry; testing is one of themajor cost drivers in product development; multiple departments across the company haveto collaborate to achieve optimal efficiency. One of the most promising ways to reduce costin testing is the use of the aspiring simulation technology instead of performing all testsphysically. Since most of the data and models needed for the simulations are alreadycreated during the design process; it is important not to lose this information; but to allowconsistent reuse. For this purpose we present the architecture of a Consistent Data …,Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design (CSCWD); 2011 15th International Conference on,2011,2
Design considerations of a flexible data stream processing middleware,Nazario Cipriani; Matthias Grossmann; Harald Sanftmann; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract. Techniques for efficient and distributed processing of huge; unbound data streamshave made some impact in the database community. Distributed data stream processingsystems have emerged providing a distributed environment to process these potentiallyunbound streams of data by a set of processing nodes. A wide range of real-timeapplications process stream-based data. Sensors and data sources; such as position data ofmoving objects; continuously produce data that is consumed by; eg; location-awareapplications. Depending on the domain of interest; the processing of such data oftendepends on domain-specific functionality. For instance; an application which visualizesstream-based data has stringent timing constraints; or may even need a specific hardwareenvironment to smoothly process the data.

TMBP: A Transactional Metamodel for Business Process Modeling Based on Organizational Structure Aspects.,Lucinéia Heloisa Thom; Cirano Iochpe; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract: Business processes executed in organization are automated through a workflowsystem. Currently; there are several metamodels for business process and workflow processmodelling. However; the limitations of these metamodels are twofold: First; the use oforganizational structure aspects is limited and second they don't support business (sub)process patterns based on organizational structure aspects. These limitations may restrictthe accuracy; efficiency; and productivity of the workflow project. This paper addresses theTransactional Metamodel of Business Processes (TMBP). TMBP links organizationalstructure aspects with business (sub) process and makes it feasible to create business (sub)process from the reuse of business (sub) process patterns based on organizational structureaspects.

PRIMA-a database system supporting dynamically defined composite objects,Michael Gesmann; Andreas Grasnickel; Theo Härder; Christoph Hübel; Wolfgang Käfer; Bernhard Mitschang; Harald Schöning,PRIMA [1] is a non-standard database system developed at the University Kaiserslatttem. Itsmajor purpose is the support of engineering design applications; such as VLSI design andsoftware engineering. The applications require tailored application-dependent interfaceswhich; however; all share basic notions like that of a composite object. Hence; the approachof PRIMA is to offer an application-independent complex-object interface(the moleculeatomdata model; shortly called MAD model [3]) and to provide means to easily augment thisinterface by application-dependent functionality. In the following; we will concentrate on theMAD model and its implementation. The MAD model allows for the dynamic definition ofcomplex object types (called molecule~ ypes) at query tiie.

The foundation necessary for this purpose lies in theintegration of sensors; which continuously provide context data of their environment. Basedon this context; changes of state in the environment; ie; situations; can be detected.However; with the huge amount of heterogeneous context and its processing; newchallenges arise. Simultaneously; the dynamic behavior of the environment demandsautomated mechanisms for applications to adapt to the situations automatically and in atimely manner.

Analysis method for conceptual context modeling applied in production environments,Eva Hoos; Matthias Wieland; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract Context-awareness is a well-accepted approach to adapt applications to the needsof a user. Yet; it is hardly used in enterprise information systems; especially in productionenvironments. Production environments are complex due to multi-faced actors; products;manufacturing equipment and processes. Hence; the modeling of context is sophisticated;particularly to determine relevant context. The goal of this paper is to facilitate and supportcontext modeling in production environments. Our contribution is an analysis method forconceptual context modeling suited for Industry 4.0 and an extensible engineering contextmodel as starting point for modeling of different Industry 4.0 use cases. The analysis modelconsists of a graphical notation for a simplified and abstract context model and a template-based concept to detail the model.

Improving problem resolving on the shop floor by context-aware decision information packages,Eva Hoos; Pascal Hirmer; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract. Industry 4.0 with its accompanying trends; such as cyber physical systems andinternet of things; leads to new approaches like self-organization of productionenvironments. However; the human actor still is needed and beneficial for decision-makingin the product lifecycle. For the decision-making process; it is crucial to provide situation-specific data. To address this issue; we introduce decision information packages (DIP);which compose relevant engineering data for a specific context. We analyze therequirements and domain-specific challenges for defining and implementing DIPs byinvestigating a real-world use case scenario at a German car manufacturer. On this basis;we develop a first approach for DIPs which comprises a context-aware engineering datamodel as basis to compose them.,Proceedings of the CAiSE,2017,1

DWFIST: Leveraging calendar-based pattern mining in data streams,Rodrigo Salvador Monteiro; Geraldo Zimbrão; Holger Schwarz; Bernhard Mitschang; Jano Moreira de Souza,Abstract Calendar-based pattern mining aims at identifying patterns on specific calendarpartitions. Potential calendar partitions are for example: every Monday; every first workingday of each month; every holiday. Providing flexible mining capabilities for calendar-basedpartitions is especially challenging in a data stream scenario. The calendar partitions ofinterest are not known a priori and at each point in time only a subset of the detailed data isavailable. We show how a data warehouse approach can be applied to this problem. Thedata warehouse that keeps track of frequent itemsets holding on different partitions of theoriginal stream has low storage requirements. Nevertheless; it allows to derive sets ofpatterns that are complete and precise.

The aim of the german-greek research project ECHO is to support the treatmentof patients; who suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; a chronic respiratorydisease. Usually the patients need to be examined by their physicians on a regular basisdue to their chronic condition. Since this is very time consuming and expensive wedeveloped an eHealth system which allows the physician to monitor patients conditionremotely; eg; via smart phones.

Customization and provisioning of complex event processing using TOSCA,Ana Cristina Franco da Silva; Pascal Hirmer; Uwe Breitenbücher; Oliver Kopp; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract In many Internet of Things scenarios; a large amount of sensor data is continuouslyproduced and exchanged among devices in smart environments. Handling these datacauses great challenges since their processing must occur in a timely manner. Furthermore;the exchanged data must be kept at a minimum in order to efficiently use network resourcesof constrained devices. Complex event processing (CEP) is an established approachfrequently employed to address these challenges. There are many existing means toautomatically provision CEP systems; such as Docker or Ansible. However; the resultinginstances are generic and need customization to be applied to Internet of Things scenarios.More precisely; data sources and sinks need to be bound and queries need to be defined.This customization is a tedious task when conducted manually.

Aspecial case workflow technology is applied to are Data Mashups. In Data Mashups;workflows orchestrate services that specialize on data processing. The workflow model itselfspecifies the order data is processed in. Due to the fact that Data Mashups aim for usabilityof domain-experts with limited IT and programming knowledge; they oftentimes offer a layeron top that abstracts from the concrete workflow model and technology. This model is thentransformed into an executable workflow model. However; transforming and executing themodel as a whole leads to efficiency issues.

A Combination Framework for Exploiting the Symbiotic Aspects of Process and Operational Data in Business Process Optimization,Sylvia Radeschütz; Holger Schwarz; Marko Vrhovnik; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract A profound analysis of all relevant business data in a company is necessary foroptimizing business processes effectively. Current analyses typically run either on businessprocess execution data or on operational business data. Correlations among the separatedata sets have to be found manually under big effort. However; to achieve a moreinformative analysis and to fully optimize a company's business; an efficient consolidation ofall major data sources is indispensable. Recent matching algorithms are insufficient for thistask since they are restricted either to schema or to process matching.

Exploring Calendar-Based Pattern Mining in Data Streams,Rodrigo Monteiro; Geraldo Zimbrão; Holger Schwarz; Bernhard Mitschang; Jano Moreira de Souza,ABStrAct Calendar-based pattern mining aims at identifying patterns on specific calendarpartitions. Potential calendarpartitions are for example: every Monday; every first workingday of each month; every holiday. Providing flexible mining capabilities for calendar-basedpartitions is especially challenging in a data stream scenario. The calendar partitions ofinterest are not known a priori and at each point in time only a subset of the detailed data isavailable. The authors show how a data warehouse approach can be applied to thisproblem. The data warehouse that keeps track of frequent itemsets holding on differentpartitions of the original stream has low storage requirements. Nevertheless; it allows toderive sets of patterns that are complete and precise. Furthermore; the authors demonstratethe effectiveness of their approach by a series of experiments.,Complex Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery for Advanced Retrieval Development: Innovative Methods and Applications: Innovative Methods and Applications,2009,*

A Concept For Applying Model-Driven Engineering To Application Integration,Clemens Dorda; Uwe Heinkel; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract Modem software for Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) provides tools formodeling integration scenarios. A drawback of these tools is the lack of functionality forexchanging or integrating models from different EAI products. Consequently; developers areonly partially able to describe real heterogeneous IT environments. Our goal is to avoid thecreation of these so-called 'integration islands'. For that purpose we present an approachwhich introduces an abstract view by technology-independent and multivendor-capablemodeling for both development and maintenance. With this approach; we propose a toolset-and repository-based refinement of the abstract view to automate implementation with realproducts and deployment on real platforms.,*,2008,*

However; a middleware platform cannot use adapters of adifferent middleware platform; eg a J2EE application server cannot use an SQL wrapper.Even if an SQL wrapper exists for a remote system that is to be integrated by a J2EEapplication server; a separate J2EE connector for that remote system has to be written.Tasks like that occur over and over again and require to invest additional resources whereexisting IT infrastructure should be reused.

Federated Spatial Cursors.,Nazario Cipriani; Matthias Grossmann; Daniela Nicklas; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract. The usage of small mobile devices for data-intensive applications becomes moreand more self-evident. As a consequence we have to consider these devices and theirinherent characteristics in future system designs; like the limitations of memory andcommunication bandwidth. For example; when querying data servers for information; amobile application can hardly anticipate the size of the result set. Our approach is to givemore control over the data delivery process to the application; so that it can be adaptedregarding its device status; the costs and availability of communication channels; and theuser's needs. This paper introduces a flexible and scalable approach by providing spatiallyfederated cursor functionality. It is based on an open federation over a set of loosely coupleddata sources that provide simple object retrieval interfaces.,GeoInfo,2007,*

Architecture considerations for advanced earth observation application systems,Hermann Ludwig Möller; Marcello Mariucci; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract Application systems in the earth observation area can be characterised asdistributed; platform-inhomogeneous; complex; and cost intensive information systems. Inorder to manage the complexity and performance requirements set by these applicationscenarios a number of architectural considerations have to be applied. Among others themost important ones are modularization towards a component architecture andinteroperation within this component model. As will be described in this paper; both aremandatory to achieving a high degree of reusability and extensibility at the component levelas well as to support the necessary scalability properties. In our paper we refer to the state ofthe art in earth observation application systems as well as to a prototype system that reflectsto a high degree the above mentioned system characteristics.,*,1999,*

Ein Ansatz zu graphischen Datenbanken und deren Verwendung in CAD-Systemen,Christoph Hübel; Bernhard Mitschang,Die zentrale Aufgabe eines CAD-Systems ist die adäquate Unterstützung desKonstruktionsvorganges. Dazu müssen die Entwurfsobjekte sowohl graphisch repräsentiertals auch in einer sog. rechnerinternen Darstellung verwaltet werden. Heutzutage stehen fürdiese Aufgaben GKS-orientierte Graphiksysteme sowie Datenbanksysteme mithierarchischer; netzwerkartiger bzw. relationaler Schnittstelle zur Verfügung. Am Beispieldes KUNICAD-Systems (ein datenbankbasierter 3D-Bauteilmodellierer) werden dieSchnittstellen zwischen Graphik-; Anwendungs-und Datenhaltungskomponente aufgezeigtund analysiert.

Service Oriented Computing,Johanna Barzen; Rania Khalaf; Frank Leymann; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract. Creating Internet of Things systems is a complex challenge as it involves bothsoftware and hardware; and because it touches on constrained devices and networks;storage; analytics; automation; and many other topics. This is further complicated by thelarge number of available technologies and the variety of different protocols and standards.To help with the ensuing confusion; we presented Internet of Things Patterns in severalcategories; such as device communication and management; energy supply types; andoperation modes. These patterns describe abstract solutions to common problems and canbe used to understand and design Internet of Things systems. In this paper; we show thatthese patterns can be applied to Smart Factory systems; which is one of the many domainswhere the Internet of Things is applicable.,*,*,*

ICWE2015 Rapid Mashup Challenge: Extended Techniques for Flexible Modeling and Execution of Data Mashups,Pascal Hirmer; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract. Today; a multitude of highly-connected applications and information systems hold;consume and produce huge amounts of heterogeneous data. The overall amount of data iseven expected to dramatically increase in the future. In order to conduct; eg; data analysis;visualizations or other value-adding scenarios; it is necessary to integrate specific; relevantparts of data into a common source. Due to oftentimes changing environments and dynamicrequests; this integration has to support adhoc and flexible data processing capabilities.Furthermore; an iterative and explorative trial-and-error integration based on different datasources has to be possible. To cope with these requirements; several data mashupplatforms have been developed in the past. However; existing solutions oftentimes havelimitations regarding the mentioned requirements.

A Transactional Metamodel For Business Process Modeling With Support To Business Process Patterns,Lucinéia Heloisa Thom; Cirano Iochpe; Bernhard Mitschang,Abstract. Currently; there are several metamodels for business process and workflowprocess modeling. However; the limitations of these metamodels are twofold: First; the use oforganizational structure aspects is limited and second they don't support business (sub)process patterns based on organizational structure aspects. These limitations may restrictthe accuracy; efficiency; and productivity of the workflow project. Thesis result speciallycomprises a Transactional Metamodel of Business Processes (TMBP). TMBP linksorganizational structure aspects with business (sub) process and makes it feasible to createbusiness (sub) process from the reuse of business (sub) process patterns based onorganizational structure aspects. An additional feature of TMBP supports the generation ofbusiness subprocess patterns through the Business Process Execution Language for …,*,*,*
in: Proc. SIGMOD'92; San Diego; Calif.; June 1992; p. 5,Michael Gesmann; Andreas Grasnickel; Theo Härder; Christoph Hübel; Wolfgang Käfer; Bernhard Mitschang; Harald Schöning,PRIMA [1] is a non-standard database system developed at the University Kaiserslautern. Itsmajor purpose is the support of engi- neering design applications; such as VLSI design and softwareen- gineering. The applications require tailored application-dependent interfaces which;however; all share basic notions like that of a composite object. Hence; the approach of PRIMAis to offer an ap- plication-independent complex-object interface (the molecule- atom datamodel; shortly called MAD model [3]) and to provide means to easily augment this interface byapplication-dependent functionality. In the following; we will concentrate on the MAD model andits implementation. The MAD model allows for the dynamic definition of complex object types(called molecule types) at query time. These molecule types together with the database inducesets of molecules which can be retrieved and manipulated by the MAD model's query …,*,*,*

User-Defined Table Operators: Enhancing Extensibility for ORDBMS,Bernhard Mitschang; Michael Jaedicke,Abstract Currently parallel object-relational database technology is setting the direction forthe future of data management. A central enhancement of objectrelational databasetechnology is the possibility to execute arbitrary user-defined functions within SQLstatements. We show the limits of this approach and propose user-defined table operatorsas a new concept that allows the definition and implementation of arbitrary user-defined N-ary database operators; which can be programmed using SQL or Embedded SQL (withsome extensions). Our approach leads to a new dimension of extensibility that allows topush more application code into the server with full support for efficient execution andparallel processing. Furthermore it allows performance enhancements of orders ofmagnitude for the evaluation of many queries with complex user-defined functions as we …,*,*,*
