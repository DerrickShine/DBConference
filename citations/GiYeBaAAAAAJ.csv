Double perovskites as a family of highly active catalysts for oxygen evolution in alkaline solution,Alexis Grimaud; Kevin J May; Christopher E Carlton; Yueh-Lin Lee; Marcel Risch; Wesley T Hong; Jigang Zhou; Yang Shao-Horn,Abstract The electronic structure of transition metal oxides governs the catalysis of manycentral reactions for energy storage applications such as oxygen electrocatalysis. Here weexploit the versatility of the perovskite structure to search for oxide catalysts that are bothactive and stable. We report double perovskites (Ln 0.5 Ba 0.5) CoO 3− δ (Ln= Pr; Sm; Gdand Ho) as a family of highly active catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction upon wateroxidation in alkaline solution. These double perovskites are stable unlike pseudocubicperovskites with comparable activities such as Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3− δ whichreadily amorphize during the oxygen evolution reaction. The high activity and stability ofthese double perovskites can be explained by having the O p-band centre neither too closenor too far from the Fermi level; which is computed from ab initio studies.,Nature communications,2013,358
Electrosynthesis; functional; and structural characterization of a water-oxidizing manganese oxide,Ivelina Zaharieva; Petko Chernev; Marcel Risch; Katharina Klingan; Mike Kohlhoff; Anna Fischer; Holger Dau,In the sustainable production of non-fossil fuels; water oxidation is pivotal. Development ofefficient catalysts based on manganese is desirable because this element is earth-abundant; inexpensive; and largely non-toxic. We report an electrodeposited Mn oxide(MnCat) that catalyzes electrochemical water oxidation at neutral pH at rates that approachthe level needed for direct coupling to photoactive materials. By choice of the voltageprotocol we could switch between electrodeposition of inactive Mn oxides (deposition atconstant anodic potentials) and synthesis of the active MnCat (deposition by voltage-cyclingprotocols). Electron microscopy reveals that the MnCat consists of nanoparticles (100 nm)with complex fine-structure.

Cobalt− oxo core of a water-oxidizing catalyst film,M Risch; V Khare; I Zaharieva; L Gerencser; P Chernev; H Dau,In photosynthesis; water is oxidized at a protein-bound Mn4Ca complex. Artificial water-oxidation catalysts that are similarly efficient and based on inexpensive and abundantmaterials are of great interest. Recently; assembly of a catalyst as an amorphous layer oninert cathodes by electrodeposition starting from an aqueous solution of cobalt ions andpotassium phosphate has been reported. X-ray absorption spectroscopy on the cobaltcatalyst film (CoCF) suggests that its central structural unit is a cluster of interconnectedcomplete or incomplete CoIII− oxo cubanes. Potassium ligation to Co-bridging oxygenscould result in Co3K (μ-O) 4 cubanes; in analogy to the Mn3Ca (μ-O) 4 cubane motifproposed for the photosynthetic Mn complex. The similarities in function and oxidative self-assembly of CoCF and the catalytic Mn complex in photosynthesis are striking. Our study …,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2009,219
Influence of oxygen evolution during water oxidation on the surface of perovskite oxide catalysts,Kevin J May; Christopher E Carlton; Kelsey A Stoerzinger; Marcel Risch; Jin Suntivich; Yueh-Lin Lee; Alexis Grimaud; Yang Shao-Horn,Perovskites such as Ba0. 5Sr0. 5Co0. 8Fe0. 2O3− δ (BSCF82) can be highly active for theoxygen evolution reaction (OER) upon water oxidation in alkaline solution. Here we reportthat BSCF82 can quickly undergo amorphization of its surface at OER potentials; which isaccompanied by reduced surface concentrations of Ba2+ and Sr2+ ions as well asincreased pseudocapacitive and OER currents. Such quick amorphization during OER wasalso observed for perovskite catalysts with similar OER activities such as Ba0. 5Sr0. 5Co0.4Fe0. 6O3− δ and SrCo0. 8Fe0. 2O3− δ. In contrast; perovskite oxides with lower OERactivities than BSCF82 did not undergo this transformation when subjected to identicalelectrochemical conditions.

Electrodes composed of LiCoO2 and LiCoPO4 exhibit progressive deactivationand activation for OER catalysis; respectively; upon potential cycling at neutral pH. Thedeactivation of LiCoO2 and activation of LiCoPO4 are coincident with changes in surfacemorphology and composition giving rise to spinel-like and amorphous surface structures;respectively. The amorphous surface structure of the activated LiCoPO4 is compositionallysimilar to that obtained from the electrodeposition of cobalt oxide materials from phosphate-buffered electrolyte solutions.

We studied the localstructure changes of perovskites LaCoO3; Ba0. 5Sr0. 5Co0. 8Fe0. 2O3-δ; and SrCo0. 8Fe0.2O3-δ before and after OER by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. No change in either localstructure or OER activity was observed for LaCoO3; while considerably enhanced OERactivities and the conversion of the local structure from corner-sharing octahedra to edge-sharing octahedra were noted for Ba0. 5Sr0. 5Co0. 8Fe0. 2O3-δ and SrCo0. 8Fe0. 2O3-δ asa result of the OER.

In this work; wetook advantage of the high intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of La0. 8Sr0.2MnO3− δ (LSMO) and the high intrinsic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of Ba0.5Sr0. 5Co0. 8Fe0. 2O3− δ (BSCF) to develop a novel bifunctional catalyst. We used pulsedlaser deposition to fabricate well-defined surfaces composed of BSCF on thin-film LSMOgrown on (001)-oriented Nb-doped SrTiO3.

Water Oxidation by Electrodeposited Cobalt Oxides—Role of Anions and Redox‐Inert Cations in Structure and Function of the Amorphous Catalyst,Marcel Risch; Katharina Klingan; Franziska Ringleb; Petko Chernev; Ivelina Zaharieva; Anna Fischer; Holger Dau,Abstract For the production of nonfossil fuels; water oxidation by inexpensive cobalt-basedcatalysts is of high interest. Films for the electrocatalysis of water oxidation were obtained byoxidative self-assembly (electrodeposition) from aqueous solutions containing; apart fromCo; either K; Li or Ca with either a phosphate; acetate or chloride anion. X-ray absorptionspectroscopy (XAS) at the Co K-edge revealed clusters of edge-sharing CoO 6 octahedra inall films; but the size or structural disorder of the Co-oxido clusters differed. Whereaspotassium binding is largely unspecific; CaCo 3 O 4 cubanes; which resemble the CaMn 3 O4 cubane of the biological catalyst in oxygenic photosynthesis; may form; as suggested byXAS at the Ca K-edge.

Oxygen electrocatalysis on (001)-oriented manganese perovskite films: Mn valency and charge transfer at the nanoscale,Kelsey A Stoerzinger; Marcel Risch; Jin Suntivich; WM Lü; Jigang Zhou; Michael D Biegalski; Hans M Christen; T Venkatesan; Yang Shao-Horn,We report that the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities of (001)-oriented manganeseperovskite films decrease from 10 to 1 nm by more than an order of magnitude; which can beattributed to the barrier associated with interfacial band bending that impedes electrontransfer to the electrolyte; and reduction of Mn3+ due to charge transfer from the Nb: SrTiO3substrate. Furthermore; we show by substitution in La1− x (Ca; Sr) xMnO3 that Mn3+; notMn4+; is the active valence state for ORR.,Energy & Environmental Science,2013,88

Crucial determinants of electrocatalytic activitywere investigated for a cobalt-based oxide film electrodeposited at various thicknesses oninert electrodes. For water oxidation at low current densities; the turnover frequency (TOF)per cobalt ion of the bulk material stayed fully constant for variation of the thickness of theoxide film by a factor of 100 (from about 15 nm to 1.5 μm). Thickness variation changedneither the nanostructure of the outer film surface nor the atomic structure of the oxidecatalyst significantly. These findings imply catalytic activity of the bulk hydrated oxidematerial. Nonclassical dependence on pH was observed. For buffered electrolytes with pK avalues of the buffer base ranging from 4.7 (acetate) to 10.3 (hydrogen carbonate); the …,ChemSusChem,2014,78
Water oxidation by amorphous cobalt-based oxides: in situ tracking of redox transitions and mode of catalysis,Marcel Risch; Franziska Ringleb; Mike Kohlhoff; Peter Bogdanoff; Petko Chernev; Ivelina Zaharieva; Holger Dau,Water oxidation by amorphous oxides is of high interest in artificial photosynthesis and otherroutes towards non-fossil fuels; but the mode of catalysis in these materials is insufficientlyunderstood. We tracked mechanistically relevant oxidation-state and structural changes ofan amorphous Co-based catalyst film by in situ experiments combining directly synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) with electrocatalysis. Unlike a classical solid-state material; the bulk material is found to undergo chemical changes. Two redoxtransitions at midpoint potentials of about 1.0 V (CoII0. 4CoIII0. 6↔ all-CoIII) and 1.2 V (all-CoIII↔ CoIII0. 8CoIV0. 2) vs. NHE at pH 7 are coupled to structural changes.

Combined high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy(XAS) confirmed the presence of coordination environments such as Co2+ in disorderedprisms and Co4+/Mn4+ in face-shared octahedra. The influence of cobalt and manganesecoordination on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and oxide stability in alkalinesolution was studied. Under cycling; the surface of perovskites that consists of Co2+ inprisms was amorphized and the activity was similar to that of LaCoO3; which has a stablesurface composed of Co3+ in octahedral coordination.

Measuring the pH dependence ofthe OER activity can provide insights on the reaction path that are otherwise difficult toaccess experimentally; in particular on the coupling of protons and electrons during thereaction. We argue that the use of a pH-dependent reference electrode; such as thereversible hydrogen electrode; is more suitable for these studies as it assures that theoverpotential is fixed while varying the pH. We provide criteria for pH dependence when thisreference is used and validate the existing results with our measurements on RuO 2powders.

While they are ubiquitous incatalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR); redoxprocesses occurring on the surface of manganese oxides are poorly understood. We reportvalence changes at OER-and ORR-relevant voltages of a layered manganese oxide filmprepared by electrodeposition. X-ray absorption spectra were collected in situ in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH using inverse partial fluorescence yield (IPFY) at the Mn L3; 2-edgesand partial fluorescence yield (PFY) at the O K-edge. Overall; we found reversible yethysteretic Mn redox and qualitatively reproducible spectral changes by Mn L3; 2 IPFY XAS.Oxidation to a mixed Mn3+/4+ valence preceded the oxygen evolution at 1.65 V vs RHE …,The Journal of Physical Chemistry C,2017,4
Perovskite Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Alkaline Media,Marcel Risch,Oxygen reduction is considered a key reaction for electrochemical energy conversion butslow kinetics hamper application in fuel cells and metal-air batteries. In this review; theprospect of perovskite oxides for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media isreviewed with respect to fundamental insight into activity and possible mechanisms. Forgaining these insights; special emphasis is placed on highly crystalline perovskite films thathave only recently become available for electrochemical interrogation. The prospects forapplications are evaluated based on recent progress in the synthesis of perovskitenanoparticles. The review concludes with the current understanding of oxygen reduction onperovskite oxides and a perspective on opportunities for future fundamental and appliedresearch.,*,2017,4
Insights into Electrochemical Oxidation of NaO2 in Na–O2 Batteries via Rotating Ring Disk and Spectroscopic Measurements,Robert Morasch; David G Kwabi; Michal Tulodziecki; Marcel Risch; Shiyu Zhang; Yang Shao-Horn,O2 reduction in aprotic Na–O2 batteries results in the formation of NaO2; which can beoxidized at small overpotentials (< 200 mV) on charge. In this study; we investigated theNaO2 oxidation mechanism using rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) measurements of Na−O2 reaction products and by tracking the morphological evolution of the NaO2 dischargeproduct at different states of charge using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The resultsshow that negligible soluble species are formed during NaO2 oxidation; and that theoxidation occurs predominantly via charge transfer at the interface between NaO2 andcarbon electrode fibers rather than uniformly from all NaO2 surfaces. X-ray absorption nearedge structure (XANES); and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements showthat the band gap of NaO2 is smaller than that of Li2O2 formed in Li–O2 batteries; in …,*,2016,4
Reversibility of Ferri-/Ferrocyanide Redox during Operando Soft X-ray Spectroscopy,Marcel Risch; Kelsey A Stoerzinger; Tom Z Regier; Derek Peak; Sayed Youssef Sayed; Yang Shao-Horn,The ferri-/ferrocyanide redox couple is ubiquitous in many fields of physical chemistry. Westudied its photochemical response to intense synchrotron radiation by in situ X-rayabsorption spectroscopy (XAS). For photon flux densities equal to and above 2× 1011 s–1mm–2; precipitation of ferric (hydr) oxide from both ferricyanide and ferrocyanide solutionswas clearly detectable; despite flowing fast enough to replace the solution in the flow cellevery 0.4 s (flow rate 1.5 mL/min). During cyclic voltammetry; precipitation of ferric (hydr)oxide was promoted at reducing voltages and observed below 1011 s–1 mm–2. This wasaccompanied by inhibition of the ferri-/ferrocyanide redox; which we probed by time-resolved operando XAS.

Tailoring the Oxygen Evolution Activity and Stability Using Defect Chemistry,Julius Scholz; Marcel Risch; Garlef Wartner; Christoph Luderer; Vladimir Roddatis; Christian Jooss,Abstract Improving the activity of catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requires adetailed understanding of the surface chemistry and structure to deduce structure-functionrelationships (descriptors) for fundamental insight. We chose epitaxial (100)-oriented La 0.6Sr 0.4 Mn 1− δ O 3 (LSMO) thin films as a model system with high electrochemical activitycomparable to (110)-oriented IrO 2 to investigate the effect of Mn off-stoichiometry on bothcatalytic activity and stability. Extensive structural characterization was performed bymicroscopic and spectroscopic methods before and after electrochemical characterizationusing rotating ring-disk studies. Stoichiometric LSMO had the highest activity; while both Mndeficiency and excess reduced the catalytic activity. Furthermore; all samples preserved thecrystal structure up to the very surface.

In situ spectroscopy and mechanistic insights into CO oxidation on transition-metal-substituted ceria nanoparticles,Joseph S Elias; Kelsey A Stoerzinger; Wesley T Hong; Marcel Risch; Livia Giordano; Azzam N Mansour; Yang Shao-Horn,Herein we investigate the reaction intermediates formed during CO oxidation on copper-substituted ceria nanoparticles (Cu0. 1Ce0. 9O2–x) by means of in situ spectroscopictechniques and identify an activity descriptor that rationalizes a trend with other metalsubstitutes (M0. 1Ce0. 9O2–x; M= Mn; Fe; Co; Ni). In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy(XAS) performed under catalytic conditions demonstrates that O2–transfer occurs atdispersed copper centers; which are redox active during catalysis. In situ XAS reveals adramatic reduction at the copper centers that is fully reversible under catalytic conditions;which rationalizes the high catalytic activity of Cu0. 1Ce0. 9O2–x.

Oxygen evolution reaction,Marcel Risch; Jin Suntivich; Yang Shao-Horn,One of the strengths of organic electrochemistry is its variety. Already in a simple beaker-type cell connected to a rectifier; one can conduct countless different electrolyses: anodicoxidations as well as cathodic reductions. The reactions are as manifold as chemistry itself ismanifold thinking only about one of the oldest organic syntheses the Kolbe electrolysis [1]that is utilized till today [2; 3] or the versatile anodic substitution [4] or the electroreductivecoupling as an important electrochemical form of CC coupling [5].

Water Oxidation by Co‐Based Oxides with Molecular Properties,Marcel Risch; Katharina Klingan; Ivelina Zaharieva; Holger Dau,Summary This chapter summarizes early and recent developments relating to the use ofamorphous Co-based oxides for water oxidation. These oxides often consist of Co ions;redox-inactive cations (K; Na; Ca; etc.); anions that can act as proton-accepting bases(phosphate; borate; chloride; etc.); and (layers) of water molecules. These oxide catalystsare denoted as Co catalyst (CoCat); NiCat; or MnCat; according to their respective redox-active metal. These expressions are used irrespective of whether the material waselectrodeposited as a thick film (50–3000 nm) on a planar electrode or synthesized inparticle form. The CoCat function; or the mechanism of electrocatalytic water oxidation; hasbeen studied predominantly by electrochemical methods; such as cyclic voltammetry (CV);potentiostatic polarization; and galvanostatic polarization; all of which may be utilized to …,Molecular Water Oxidation Catalysis: A Key Topic for New Sustainable Energy Conversion Schemes,2014,1
Prospects for band gap engineering by plasma ion implantation,Marcel Risch; Michael P Bradley,Abstract The suitability of plasma ion implantation (PII) for band gap engineering will beexamined by calculations of the band gap's spatial variation. Plasma Ion Implantation is amethod to modify the surface and subsurface properties of materials; the ions surroundingthe target are forced into all plasma exposed surfaces simultaneously by virtue of high-voltage pulses. We calculated the fluence and the ion energy distribution from the dynamicsheath model. The distribution of the ions within the target is subsequently simulated by theTRIDYN software. The concentration profiles are converted into a spatial variation of theband gap. The challenges inherent to the method are discussed by means of the examplesof carbon (C) PII in silicon (Si) as well as nitrogen (N) PII in gallium arsenide (GaAs).

Predicted depth profiles for nitrogen‐ion implantation into gallium arsenide,M Risch; M Bradley,Abstract We present a new method to predict the spatial variation of the band gap in nitrogen-implanted gallium arsenide. Band gap engineering of a GaAsN alloy was employed todesign an emission peak at 1.3 µm. Based on SRIM simulations; we propose aconcentration of 6% N in GaAs at the plateau of the trapezoidal depth profile for the desiredband gap. The depth profile could be manufactured by virtue of subsequent high voltagepulses. Software based on the Lieberman model was developed to predict fluences frommeasurements of a simple Langmuir probe and the time dependent electrode potential.(©2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The promise of nitrogen plasma implanted gallium arsenide for band gap engineering,Marcel Risch,This investigation examines band gap engineering of the GaAsN alloy by means of plasmaion implantation. The strong redshift of the alloy's band gap is suitable for telecommunicationapplications and thus stimulated much interest in recent years. Nitrogen (N) ion implantationinto gallium arsenide (GaAs) results in a thin shallow N-rich layer below the surface.However; the violent implantation process also modifies the concentrations of gallium andarsenide. The core of this thesis is a novel method for prediction of the band gap from theconditions in the processing plasma. The first important variable; the number of implantedions; is obtained from the Lieberman model for the current during high-voltage Plasma IonImplantation (PII). A review of the model's assumptions is provided as well as acomprehensive discussion of the implantation which includes error boundaries. The …,*,2008,1
Environmental TEM Investigation of Electrochemical Stability of Perovskite and Ruddlesden–Popper Type Manganite Oxygen Evolution Catalysts,Daniel Mierwaldt; Vladimir Roddatis; Marcel Risch; Julius Scholz; Janis Geppert; Majid Ebrahimizadeh Abrishami; Christian Jooss,Abstract The sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a grand challengefor energy storage technologies. Several perovskites and other oxides of earth-abundantelements are found to exhibit improved catalytic OER activity. However; less attention is paidto the electrochemical stability; an important factor for large-scale application. The ongoingsearch for stable catalysts calls for characterizing active catalyst surfaces and identifyingmechanisms of deactivation; activation; or repair. In situ techniques are indispensable forthese tasks. This study uses environmental transmission electron microscopy on the highlycorrelated perovskite Pr 1–x Ca x MnO 3 and the Ruddlesden–Popper Pr 0.5 Ca 1.5 MnO 4as model electrodes to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the stability trends identifiedon rotating ring disk electrodes.

Mechanistic Parameters of Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation on LiMn2O4 in Comparison to Natural Photosynthesis,Lennart Köhler; Majid Ebrahimizadeh Abrishami; Vladimir Roddatis; Janis Geppert; Marcel Risch,Abstract Targeted improvement of the low efficiency of water oxidation during the oxygenevolution reaction (OER) is severely hindered by insufficient knowledge of theelectrocatalytic mechanism on heterogeneous surfaces. We chose LiMn 2 O 4 as a modelsystem for mechanistic investigations as it shares the cubane structure with the active site ofphotosystem II and the valence of Mn 3.5+ with the dark-stable S1 state in the mechanism ofnatural photosynthesis. The investigated LiMn 2 O 4 nanoparticles are electrochemicallystable in NaOH electrolytes and show respectable activity in any of the main metrics.

The oxygen evolution half reaction 2H2O+ 4h→ 4H++ O2 is thebottleneck of water-splitting since it requires the coupled transfer of 4 electron holes from thecatalyst surface to the water molecule. This half reaction was comprehensively studied onperovskite catalysts [1]; because they provide high chemical flexibility and the opportunity toselectively tune and adjust the electronic structure to the water oxidation potential by A-andB-site doping.

The Structure of a Water-oxidizing Cobalt Oxide Film and Comparison to the Photosynthetic Manganese Complex,Marcel Risch; Katharina Klingan; Anna Fischer; Holger Dau,Abstract In photosynthesis; water is oxidized at a protein-bound Mn 4 Ca complex. Artificialwater-oxidation catalysts that are similarly efficient and based on inexpensive and abundantmaterials are of great interest. A recently reported inorganic cobalt catalyst (CoCat) forms byelectrodeposition as an amorphous layer on inert anodes; starting from an aqueous solutionof cobalt ions and buffered salts such as potassium phosphate (KP i). X-ray absorptionspectroscopy (XAS) indicates that the central unit of the CoCat is a cluster of edge-sharingCo III (μ-O) 6 octahedra. We find that the apparent cluster nuclearity is higher for filmformation at anode voltages below the water-oxidation threshold. These films exhibit onlyminimally lower cobalt oxidation states than the films of the same thickness but deposited atvoltages supporting water-oxidation.

Structure-function relations in water-oxidizing cobalt oxides investigated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy,Marcel Risch,Zusammenfassung The sustainable; large-scale extraction of protons from water fordihydrogen as a fuel requires utilization of efficient catalysts for (i) water oxidation and (ii)hydrogen formation that are based on inexpensive and abundant materials. The wateroxidation reaction may be the bottleneck for dihydrogen production because it requires anintricate managing of its four-electron/four-proton chemistry by the catalyst. At the atomiclevel; electrochemical water oxidation is only insufficiently understood. In particular; theknowledge about water oxidation is very limited for amorphous transition metal oxides.
