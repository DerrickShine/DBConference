Ontological queries: Rewriting and optimization,Georg Gottlob; Giorgio Orsi; Andreas Pieris,Ontological queries are evaluated against an enterprise ontology rather than directly on adatabase. The evaluation and optimization of such queries is an intriguing new problem fordatabase research. In this paper we discuss two important aspects of this problem: queryrewriting and query optimization. Query rewriting consists of the compilation of anontological query into an equivalent query against the underlying relational database. Thefocus here is on soundness and completeness. We review previous results and present anew rewriting algorithm for rather general types of ontological constraints (descriptionlogics). In particular; we show how a conjunctive query (CQ) against an enterprise ontologycan be compiled into a union of conjunctive queries (UCQ) against the underlying database.Ontological query optimization; in this context; attempts to improve this process so to …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,146

Query rewriting and optimization for ontological databases,Georg Gottlob; Giorgio Orsi; Andreas Pieris,Abstract Ontological queries are evaluated against a knowledge base consisting of anextensional database and an ontology (ie; a set of logical assertions and constraints thatderive new intensional knowledge from the extensional database); rather than directly onthe extensional database. The evaluation and optimization of such queries is an intriguingnew problem for database research. In this article; we discuss two important aspects of thisproblem: query rewriting and query optimization. Query rewriting consists of the compilationof an ontological query into an equivalent first-order query against the underlyingextensional database. We present a novel query rewriting algorithm for rather general typesof ontological constraints that is well suited for practical implementations.

DIADEM: domain-centric; intelligent; automated data extraction methodology,Tim Furche; Georg Gottlob; Giovanni Grasso; Omer Gunes; Xiaoanan Guo; Andrey Kravchenko; Giorgio Orsi; Christian Schallhart; Andrew Sellers; Cheng Wang,Abstract Search engines are the sinews of the web. These sinews have become strained;however: Where the web's function once was a mix of library and yellow pages; it hasbecome the central marketplace for information of almost any kind. We search more andmore for objects with specific characteristics; a car with a certain mileage; an affordableapartment close to a good school; or the latest accessory for our phones. Search engines alltoo often fail to provide reasonable answers; making us sift through dozens of websites withthousands of offers--never to be sure a better offer isn't just around the corner. What searchengines are missing is understanding of the objects and their attributes published onwebsites.

Optimizing query answering under ontological constraints,Giorgio Orsi; Andreas Pieris,Abstract: Ontological queries are evaluated against a database combined with ontologicalconstraints. Answering such queries is a challenging new problem for database research.For many ontological modelling languages; query answering can be solved via queryrewriting: given a conjunctive query and an ontology; the query can be transformed into aﬁrst-order query; called the perfect rewriting; that takes into account the semanticconsequences of the ontology. Then; for every extensional database D; the answer to thequery is obtained by evaluating the rewritten query against D. In this paper we present anew algorithm that computes the perfect rewriting of a conjunctive query wrt a linearDatalog+/-ontology. Also; we provide an experimental comparison of our algorithm withexisting rewriting techniques.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment (PVLDB),2011,31

Opal: automated form understanding for the deep web,Tim Furche; Georg Gottlob; Giovanni Grasso; Xiaonan Guo; Giorgio Orsi; Christian Schallhart,Abstract Forms are our gates to the web. They enable us to access the deep content of websites. Automatic form understanding unlocks this content for applications ranging fromcrawlers to meta-search engines and is essential for improving usability and accessibility ofthe web. Form understanding has received surprisingly little attention other than ascomponent in specific applications such as crawlers. No comprehensive approach to formunderstanding exists and previous works disagree even in the definition of the problem. Inthis paper; we present OPAL; the first comprehensive approach to form understanding. Weidentify form labeling and form interpretation as the two main tasks involved in formunderstanding. On both problems OPAL pushes the state of the art: For form labeling; itcombines signals from the text; structure; and visual rendering of a web page; yielding …,Proceedings of the 21st international conference on World Wide Web,2012,25
Improving search and navigation by combining ontologies and social tags,Silvia Bindelli; Claudio Criscione; Carlo A Curino; Mauro L Drago; Davide Eynard; Giorgio Orsi,Abstract The Semantic Web has the ambitious goal of enabling complex autonomousapplications to reason on a machine-processable version of the World Wide Web. This;however; would require a coordinated effort not easily achievable in practice. On the otherhand; spontaneous communities; based on social tagging; recently achieved noticeableconsensus and diffusion. The goal of the TagOnto system is to bridge between these tworealities by automatically mapping (social) tags to more structured domain ontologies; thus;providing assistive; navigational features typical of the Semantic Web. These novelsearching and navigational capabilities are complementary to more traditional searchengine functionalities.

Icdar 2013 table competition,Max Göbel; Tamir Hassan; Ermelinda Oro; Giorgio Orsi,Table understanding is a well studied problem in document analysis; and many academicand commercial approaches have been developed to recognize tables in several documentformats; including plain text; scanned page images and born-digital; object-based formatssuch as PDF. Despite the abundance of these techniques; an objective comparison of theirperformance is still missing. The Table Competition held in the context of ICDAR 2013 is ourfirst attempt at objectively evaluating these techniques against each other in a standardizedway; across several input formats. The competition independently addresses threeproblems:(i) table location;(ii) table structure recognition; and (iii) these two tasks combined.We received results from seven academic systems; which we have also compared againstfour commercial products.

NYAYA: A system supporting the uniform management of large sets of semantic data,Roberto De Virgilio; Giorgio Orsi; Letizia Tanca; Riccardo Torlone,We present NYAYA; a flexible system for the management of large-scale semantic datawhich couples a general-purpose storage mechanism with efficient ontological queryanswering. NYAYA rapidly imports semantic data expressed in different formalisms intosemantic data kiosks. Each kiosk exposes the native ontological constraints in a uniformfashion using data log±; a very general rule-based language for the representation ofontological constraints. A group of kiosks forms a semantic data market where the data ineach kiosk can be uniformly accessed using conjunctive queries and where users canspecify user-defined constraints over the data.

Accessing and documenting relational databases through OWL ontologies,Carlo Curino; Giorgio Orsi; Emanuele Panigati; Letizia Tanca,Abstract Relational databases have been designed to store high volumes of data and toprovide an efficient query interface. Ontologies are geared towards capturing domainknowledge; annotations; and to offer high-level; machine-processable views of data andmetadata. The complementary strengths and weaknesses of these data models motivate theresearch effort we present in this paper. The goal of this work is to bridge the relational andontological worlds; in order to leverage the efficiency and scalability of relationaltechnologies and the high level view of data and metadata proper of ontologies. The systemwe designed and developed achieves:(i) automatic ontology extraction from relational datasources and (ii) automatic query translation from SPARQL to SQL.

Heuristic ranking in tightly coupled probabilistic description logics,Thomas Lukasiewicz; Maria Vanina Martinez; Giorgio Orsi; Gerardo I Simari,Abstract: The Semantic Web effort has steadily been gaining traction in the recent years. Inparticular; Web search companies are recently realizing that their products need to evolvetowards having richer semantic search capabilities. Description logics (DLs) have beenadopted as the formal underpinnings for Semantic Web languages used in describingontologies. Reasoning under uncertainty has recently taken a leading role in this arena;given the nature of data found on theWeb. In this paper; we present a probabilistic extensionof the DL EL++(which underlies the OWL2 EL profile) using Markov logic networks (MLNs)as probabilistic semantics. This extension is tightly coupled; meaning that probabilisticannotations in formulas can refer to objects in the ontology. We show that; even though thetightly coupled nature of our language means that many basic operations are data …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1210.4894,2012,18

Ontological query answering via rewriting,Georg Gottlob; Giorgio Orsi; Andreas Pieris,Abstract Ontological databases extend traditional databases with ontological constraints.This technology is crucial for many applications such as semantic data publishing andintegration as well as model-driven database design. For many classes of ontologicalconstraints; query answering can be solved via query rewriting. In particular; given aconjunctive query and a set of ontological constraints; the query is compiled into a first-orderquery; called the perfect rewriting; that encodes the intensional knowledge implied by theconstraints. Then; for every database D; the answer is obtained by directly evaluating theperfect rewriting over D. Since first-order queries can be easily translated into SQL;ontological query answering can be delegated to traditional DBMSs. This allows us to utilizeall the query optimization techniques available in the underlying DBMS. This paper …,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2011,18
Little knowledge rules the web: Domain-centric result page extraction,Tim Furche; Georg Gottlob; Giovanni Grasso; Giorgio Orsi; Christian Schallhart; Cheng Wang,Abstract Web extraction is the task of turning unstructured HTML into structured data.Previous approaches rely exclusively on detecting repeated structures in result pages.These approaches trade intensive user interaction for precision. In this paper; we introducethe Amber (“Adaptable Model-based Extraction of Result Pages”) system that replaces thehuman interaction with a domain ontology applicable to all sites of a domain. It modelsdomain knowledge about (1) records and attributes of the domain;(2) low-level (textual)representations of these concepts; and (3) constraints linking representations to records andattributes.

Real understanding of real estate forms,Tim Furche; Georg Gottlob; Giovanni Grasso; Xiaonan Guo; Giorgio Orsi; Christian Schallhart,Abstract Finding an apartment is a lengthy and tedious process. Once decided; one cannever be sure not to have missed an even better offer which would have been just one clickaway. Form understanding is key to automatically access and process all the relevant---andnowadays readily available---data. We introduce opal (ontology-based web pattern analysiswith logic); a novel; purely logical approach to web form understanding: opal labels;structures; and groups form fields according to a domain-specific ontology linked throughphenomenological rules to a logical representation of a DOM. The phenomenological rulesdescribe how ontological concepts appear on the web; the ontology formalizes andstructures common patterns of web pages observed in a domain. A unique feature of opal isthat all domain-independent assumptions about web forms are represented in rules …,Proceedings of the International Conference on Web Intelligence; Mining and Semantics,2011,18

Aggregating semantic annotators,Luying Chen; Stefano Ortona; Giorgio Orsi; Michael Benedikt,Abstract A growing number of resources are available for enriching documents withsemantic annotations. While originally focused on a few standard classes of annotations; theecosystem of annotators is now becoming increasingly diverse. Although annotators oftenhave very different vocabularies; with both high-level and specialist concepts; they also havemany semantic interconnections. We will show that both the overlap and the diversity inannotator vocabularies motivate the need for semantic annotation integration: middlewarethat produces a unified annotation on top of diverse semantic annotators. On the one hand;the diversity of vocabulary allows applications to benefit from the much richer vocabularyavailable in an integrated vocabulary. On the other hand; we present evidence that the mostwidely-used annotators on the web suffer from serious accuracy deficiencies: the overlap …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,15
Problems and opportunities in context-based personalization,Letizia Tanca; Cristiana Bolchini; Elisa Quintarelli; Fabio A Schreiber; Giorgio Orsi,ABSTRACT In a world of global networking; the increasing amount of heterogeneousinformation; available through a variety of channels; has made it difficult for users to find theinformation they need in the current situation; at the right level of detail. This is true not onlywhen accessing information from mobile devices; characterized by limited–althoughgrowing–resources and by high connection costs; but also when using powerful systems;since the amount of “out-of-context” answers to a given user request may be overwhelming.The knowledge of the context in which the data are going to be used can support theprocess of focussing on currently useful; personalized information. The activity needed forcontextaware information personalization provides material for stimulating research; brieflyillustrated in this paper.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,15
CADD: a tool for context modeling and data tailoring,Cristiana Bolchini; CA Curino; Giorgio Orsi; Elisa Quintarelli; Fabio A Schreiber; Letizia Tanca,Nowadays user mobility requires that both content and services be appropriatelypersonalized; in order for the (mobile) user to be always-and anywhere-equipped with theadequate share of data. Thus; the knowledge about the user; the adopted device and theenvironment; altogether called context; has to be taken into account in order to minimize theamount of information imported on mobile devices.

Datalog and its extensions for semantic web databases,Georg Gottlob; Giorgio Orsi; Andreas Pieris; Mantas Šimkus,Abstract Since the early 70s; data management played a central role in organizations andrepresented a challenging area of research. A number of languages have been proposed tomodel; query; and manipulate data; as well as for expressing very general classes ofintegrity constraints; inference procedures; and ontological knowledge. Such languages arenowadays crucial for many applications such as semantic data publishing and integration;decision support; and knowledge management. In this tutorial we first introduce Datalog; apowerful rule-based language originally intended for expressing complex queries overrelational data; and that today is at the basis of languages for the specification ofoptimization and constraint satisfaction problems as well as of ontological constraints in dataand knowledge bases. We then discuss the limitations of Datalog for the semantic web; in …,Reasoning Web International Summer School,2012,14
Querying UML class diagrams,Andrea Calì; Georg Gottlob; Giorgio Orsi; Andreas Pieris,Abstract UML Class Diagrams (UCDs) are the best known class-based formalism forconceptual modeling. They are used by software engineers to model the intensionalstructure of a system in terms of classes; attributes and operations; and to expressconstraints that must hold for every instance of the system. Reasoning over UCDs is ofparamount importance in design; validation; maintenance and system analysis; however; formedium and large software projects; reasoning over UCDs may be impractical. Queryanswering; in particular; can be used to verify whether a (possibly incomplete) instance ofthe system modeled by the UCD; ie; a snapshot; enjoys a certain property.

Data Wrangling for Big Data: Challenges and Opportunities.,Tim Furche; Georg Gottlob; Leonid Libkin; Giorgio Orsi; Norman W Paton,ABSTRACT Data wrangling is the process by which the data required by an application isidentified; extracted; cleaned and integrated; to yield a data set that is suitable forexploration and analysis. Although there are widely used Extract; Transform and Load (ETL)techniques and platforms; they often require manual work from technical and domainexperts at different stages of the process. When confronted with the 4 V's of big data(volume; velocity; variety and veracity); manual intervention may make ETL prohibitivelyexpensive. This paper argues that providing cost-effective; highly-automated approaches todata wrangling involves significant research challenges; requiring fundamental changes toestablished areas such as data extraction; integration and cleaning; and to the ways inwhich these areas are brought together.

Automatically learning gazetteers from the deep web,Tim Furche; Giovanni Grasso; Giorgio Orsi; Christian Schallhart; Cheng Wang,Abstract Wrapper induction faces a dilemma: To reach web scale; it requires automaticallygenerated examples; but to produce accurate results; these examples must have the qualityof human annotations. We resolve this conflict with AMBER; a system for fully automateddata extraction from result pages. In contrast to previous approaches; AMBER employsdomain specific gazetteers to discern basic domain attributes on a page; and leveragesrepeated occurrences of similar attributes to group related attributes into records rather thanrelying on the noisy structure of the DOM. With this approach AMBER is able to identifyrecords and their attributes with almost perfect accuracy (> 98%) on a large sample ofwebsites. To make such an approach feasible at scale; AMBER automatically learns domaingazetteers from a small seed set.

On the interaction of existential rules and equality constraints in ontology querying,Andrea Calì; Georg Gottlob; Giorgio Orsi; Andreas Pieris,Abstract Ontological query processing is an exciting research topic in database theory;knowledge representation; and logic programming. In many cases; ontological constraintsare expressed over an extensional database by extending traditional Datalog rules to allowexistential quantification and equality atoms in the head. The unrestricted use of thesefeatures causes undecidability of query answering and; therefore; their interaction must becontrolled. This work provides a tutorial-like introduction to the problem of query answeringunder existential and equality constraints. We survey the most notable (semantic andsyntactic) restrictions to such constraints ensuring decidability of query answering; and wediscuss their practical application to conceptual modelling.,*,2012,9
Towards user centric schema mapping platform,Guilian Wang; Rami Rifaieh; Joseph Goguen; Vitaliy Zavesov; Arcot Rajasekar; Mark Miller,Abstract Schema mapping is a fundamental problem in many important databaseapplications. The process of mapping discovery is complex and error prone; it cannot befully automated; so user input is necessary. This paper presents SCIA; a system that assistsusers in creating executable mappings between a source schema and a target schema byautomating simple matches and finding critical points where user input is both necessaryand maximally useful. SCIA finds critical points by using path contexts together with acombination of multiple matching algorithms. SCIA also helps users; when a critical pointoccurs; by asking them specific questions with sufficient context and making suggestions foradding semantic information to data transformation; such as join and grouping conditions.SCIA handles complex mappings involving n-to-m matches with semantic functions and …,International Workshop on Semantic Data and Service Integration; SDSI 2007,2007,9
A new perspective in pervasive advertising,Lorenzo Carrara; Giorgio Orsi,Abstract. In commerce; advertising a potential customer with relevant offers is beneficial forboth the advertiser; who increases the chances of acquiring a new customer; and thecustomer himself; who is stimulated to purchase without being overwhelmed by irrelevantads. To achieve this goal; the advertiser must know the situation; the interests and theactivities of his potential customers; in one word; their context. However; the exposure or thecollection of these personal data has a clear repercussion on their privacy and is oftenconstrained by law. PervADs is a usercentred pervasive advertisement-distribution platformwhich maximizes the relevance of the ads sent to potential customers while preserving theirprivacy. The relevance is determined by semantically matching the profile and the context ofthe customer against those carried by the ads; while privacy is guaranteed by a client …,Technical Report; Department of Computer Science,2011,8

We demonstrate WADaR; a scalable and highly automated tool for joint wrapper anddata repair. WADaR uses off-the-shelf entity recognisers to locate target entities in wrapper-generated data. Markov chains are used to determine structural repairs; that are thenencoded into suitable repairs for both the data and corresponding wrappers.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,6
Amber: Automatic supervision for multi-attribute extraction,Tim Furche; Georg Gottlob; Giovanni Grasso; Giorgio Orsi; Christian Schallhart; Cheng Wang,Abstract: The extraction of multi-attribute objects from the deep web is the bridge betweenthe unstructured web and structured data. Existing approaches either induce wrappers froma set of human-annotated pages or leverage repeated structures on the page withoutsupervision. What the former lack in automation; the latter lack in accuracy. Thus accurate;automatic multi-attribute object extraction has remained an open challenge. AMBERovercomes both limitations through mutual supervision between the repeated structure andautomatically produced annotations. Previous approaches based on automatic annotationshave suffered from low quality due to the inherent noise in the annotations and haveattempted to compensate by exploring multiple candidate wrappers. In contrast; AMBERcompensates for this noise by integrating repeated structure analysis with annotation …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1210.5984,2012,6
Forms form patterns: reusable form understanding,Tim Furche; Georg Gottlob; Xiaonan Guo; Giorgio Orsi; Christian Schallhart,ABSTRACT Forms are our gates to the web. They enable us to access the deep content ofweb sites. Automatic form understanding unlocks this content for applications ranging fromcrawlers to meta-search engines and is essential for improving usability and accessibility ofthe web. Form understanding has received surprisingly little attention other than ascomponent in specific applications such as crawlers. No comprehensive approach to formunderstanding exists and previous works disagree even in the definition of the problem. Inthis paper; we present OPAL; the first comprehensive approach to form understanding. Weidentify form labeling and form interpretation as the two main tasks involved in formunderstanding. On both problems OPAL pushes the state of the art: For form labeling; itcombines signals from the text; structure; and visual rendering of a web page; yielding …,Proc. WWW,2012,6
Reasoning over Large Semantic Datasets.,Roberto De Virgilio; Giorgio Orsi; Letizia Tanca; Riccardo Torlone,ABSTRACT This paper presents NYAYA; a flexible system for the management of Semantic-Web data which couples an efficient storage mechanism with advanced and up-to-dateontology reasoning capabilities. NYAYA is capable of processing large Semantic-Webdatasets; expressed in a variety of formalisms; by transforming them into a collection ofSemantic Data Kiosks that expose the native meta-data in a uniform fashion using Datalog±;a very general rule-based language. The kiosks form a Semantic Data Market where thedata in each kiosk can be uniformly accessed using conjunctive queries and where userscan specify user-defined constraints over the data. NYAYA is easily extensible and robust toupdates of both data and meta-data in the kiosk. In particular; a new kiosk of the semanticdata market can be easily built from a fresh Semantic-Web source expressed in …,SEBD,2009,6
Semantic pervasive advertising,Lorenzo Carrara; Giorgio Orsi; Letizia Tanca,Abstract Pervasive advertising targets consumers on-the-move with ads displayed on theirmobile devices. As for web advertising; ads are distributed by embedding them into websitesand apps; easily flooding consumers with a large number of uninteresting offers. As thepervasive setting amplifies traditional issues such as targeting; cost; and privacy; we arguethe need for a new perspective on the problem. We introduce PervADs; a privacy-preserving; user-centric; and pervasive ads-distribution platform which uses semantictechnologies to reason about the consumer's context and the intended target of the ads.,International Conference on Web Reasoning and Rule Systems,2013,5
OPAL: a passe-partout for web forms,Xiaonan Guo; Jochen Kranzdorf; Tim Furche; Giovanni Grasso; Giorgio Orsi; Christian Schallhart,Abstract Web forms are the interfaces of the deep web. Though modern web browsersprovide facilities to assist in form filling; this assistance is limited to prior form fillings orkeyword matching. Automatic form understanding enables a broad range of applications;including crawlers; meta-search engines; and usability and accessibility support forenhanced web browsing. In this demonstration; we use a novel form understandingapproach; OPAL; to assist in form filling even for complex; previously unknown forms. OPALassociates form labels to fields by analyzing structural properties in the HTML encoding andvisual features of the page rendering. OPAL interprets this labeling and classifies the fieldsaccording to a given domain ontology. The combination of these two properties; allowsOPAL to deal effectively with many forms outside of the grasp of existing form filling …,Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on World Wide Web,2012,5
Introduction to the TPLP special issue; logic programming in databases: From Datalog to semantic-web rules,Giorgio Orsi; Letizia Tanca,Abstract Much has happened in data and knowledge base research since the introduction ofthe relational model in Codd (1970) and its strong logical foundations influence its advancesever since. Logic has been a common ground where Database and Artificial Intelligenceresearch competed and collaborated with each other for a long time (Abiteboul et al. 1995).The product of this joint effort has been a set of logic-based formalisms; such as theRelational Calculus (Codd 1970); Datalog (Ceri et al. 1990); Description Logics (Baader etal. 2007); etc.; capturing not only the structure but also the semantics of data in an explicitway; thus enabling complex inference procedures.,Theory and Practice of Logic Programming,2010,4
Joint repairs for web wrappers,Stefano Ortona; Giorgio Orsi; Tim Furche; Marcello Buoncristiano,Automated web scraping is a popular means for acquiring data from the web. Scrapers (orwrappers) are derived from either manually or automatically annotated examples; oftenresulting in under/over segmented data; together with missing or spurious content.Automatic repair and maintenance of the extracted data is thus a necessary complement toautomatic wrapper generation. Moreover; the extracted data is often the result of a long-termdata acquisition effort and thus jointly repairing wrappers together with the generated datareduces future needs for data cleaning. We study the problem of computing joint repairs forXPath-based wrappers and their extracted data. We show that the problem is NP-completein general but becomes tractable under a few natural assumptions. Even tractable solutionsto the problem are still impractical on very large datasets; but we propose an optimal …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,2
Structured aspect extraction,Omer Gunes; Tim Furche; Giorgio Orsi,Abstract Aspect extraction identifies relevant features of an entity from a textual descriptionand is typically targeted to product reviews; and other types of short text; as an enabling taskfor; eg; opinion mining and information retrieval. Current aspect extraction methods mostlyfocus on aspect terms; often neglecting associated modifiers or embedding them in theaspect terms without proper distinction. Moreover; flat syntactic structures are oftenassumed; resulting in inaccurate extractions of complex aspects. This paper studies theproblem of structured aspect extraction; a variant of traditional aspect extraction aiming at afine-grained extraction of complex (ie; hierarchical) aspects. We propose an unsupervisedand scalable method for structured aspect extraction consisting of statistical noun phraseclustering; cPMI-based noun phrase segmentation; and hierarchical pattern induction …,Proceedings of COLING 2016; the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers,2016,2
Consistency checking of re-engineered UML class diagrams via Datalog+/-,Georg Gottlob; Giorgio Orsi; Andreas Pieris,Abstract UML class diagrams (UCDs) are a widely adopted formalism for modeling theintensional structure of a software system. Although UCDs are typically guiding theimplementation of a system; it is common in practice that developers need to recover theclass diagram from an implemented system. This process is known as reverse engineering.A fundamental property of reverse engineered (or simply re-engineered) UCDs isconsistency; showing that the system is realizable in practice. In this work; we investigate theconsistency of re-engineered UCDs; and we show is pspace-complete. The upper bound isobtained by exploiting algorithmic techniques developed for conjunctive query answeringunder guarded Datalog+/-; that is; a key member of the Datalog+/-family of KR languages;while the lower bound is obtained by simulating the behavior of a polynomial space …,International Symposium on Rules and Rule Markup Languages for the Semantic Web,2015,2
Preserving semantics in automatically created ontology alignments,Giorgio Orsi; Letizia Tanca,Abstract In an open world such as the Internet; one of the most challenging tasks is ontologyalignment; which is the process of finding relationships among their elements. Performingthis work in an automated fashion is; however; subject to errors; because of the differentsemantics carried by the same concept in different application domains or because ofdifferent ontology design styles which often produce incompatible ontology structures. In thischapter; we relate the most important approaches to ontology mapping revision; proposing arevision technique which aims at preserving the semantics of the original ontologies.,*,2010,2

A New Perspective in Pervasive Advertising,Giorgio Orsi,Abstract In commerce; advertising a potential customer with relevant off ers is benefi cial forboth the advertiser; who increases the chances of acquiring a new customer; and thecustomer himself; who is stimulated to purchase without being overwhelmed by irrelevantads. To achieve this goal; the advertiser must know the situation; the interests and theactivities of his potential customers; in one word; their context. However; the exposure or thecollection of these personal data has a clear repercussion on their privacy and is oftenconstrained by law. PervADs is a usercentred pervasive advertisement-distribution platformwhich maximizes the relevance of the ads sent to potential customers while preserving theirprivacy. The relevance is determined by semantically matching the pro le and the context ofthe customer against those carried by the ads; while privacy is guaranteed by a client …,*,2011,1

There are high-and low-levelconcepts that are supported by multiple annotators; in addition to a range of annotators withhighly distinct vocabularies; but having many semantic interconnections. We will show thatboth the overlap and the diversity in annotator vocabularies motivate the need for semanticannotation integration: middleware that produces a unified annotation on top of diversesemantic annotators.

Datalog and its extensions for the semantic web,Giorgio Orsi,Abstract Since the early 70s; data management played a central role in organizations andrepresented a challenging area of research. A number of languages have been proposed tomodel; query; and manipulate data; as well as for expressing very general classes ofintegrity constraints; inference procedures; and ontological knowledge. Such languages arenowadays crucial for many applications such as semantic data publishing and integration;decision support; and knowledge management. In this tutorial we first introduce Datalog; apowerful rule-based language originally intended for expressing complex queries overrelational data; and that today is at the basis of languages for the speciﬁcation ofoptimization and constraint satisfaction problems as well as of ontological constraints in dataand knowledge bases. We then discuss the limitations of Datalog for the semantic web; in …,*,2012,*
Heuristic Ranking in Tightly Coupled Probabilistic Description Logics,Giorgio Orsi,Abstract The Semantic Web effort has steadily been gaining traction in the recent years. Inparticular; Web search companies are recently realizing that their products need to evolvetowards having richer semantic search capabilities. Description logics (DLs) have beenadopted as the formal underpinnings for Semantic Web languages used in describingontologies. Reasoning under uncertainty has recently taken a leading role in this arena;given the nature of data found on the Web. In this paper; we present a probabilisticextension of the DL EL++(which underlies the OWL2 EL proﬁle) using Markov logic networks(MLNs) as probabilistic semantics. This extension is tightly coupled; meaning thatprobabilistic annotations in formulas can refer to objects in the ontology. We show that; eventhough the tightly coupled nature of our language means that many basic operations are …,*,2012,*

Progettazione dei Dati con l'Uso del Contesto,Giorgio Orsi,Abstract Gli utenti dei sistemi informativi e di Internet si trovano oggi ad affrontare lanecessita'di contenere il “rumore informativo” in modo da non essere subissati e confusi dauna grande quantita'di dati; spesso poco legati al contesto di fruizione. L'attivita'di adattare idati alle necessita'delle applicazioni può essere assimilata al problema di confezionare unvestito su misura: da qui il nome Data Tailoring. In questo articolo si mostra come le “forbici”usate per questa operazione possano essere rappresentate dal contesto; inteso come uninsieme di variabili che caratterizzano l'ambiente specifico nel quale l'applicazione si trovaad operare.,Mondo Digitale,2008,*
Emergent semantics and cooperation in multi-knowledge environments: the ESTEEM architecture,Carola Aiello; R Baldoni; D Bianchini; C Bolchini; S Bonomi; S Castano; T Catarci; CA Curino; V De Antonellis; A Ferrara; M Melchiori; D Milano; S Montanelli; G Orsi; A Poggi; L Querzoni; E Quintarelli; R Rossato; D Salvi; M Scannapieco; FA Schreiber; L Tanca; S Tucci Pergiovanni,In the present global society; information has to be exchangeable in open and dynamicenvironments; where interacting peers do not necessarily share a common understanding ofthe world at hand; and do not have a complete picture of the context where the interactionoccurs. In this paper; we present the Esteem approach and the related peer architecture foremergent semantics in dynamic and multi-knowledge environments. In Esteem; semanticcommunities are built around declared interests in the form of manifesto ontologies; andtheir autonomous nature is preserved by allowing a shared semantics to naturally emergefrom peer interactions.

X− SOM Results for OAEI 2007,Giorgio Orsi,Abstract This paper summarizes the results of the X-SOM tool in the OAEI 2007 campaign. X-SOM is an extensible ontology mapper that combines various matching algorithms bymeans of a feed-forward neural network. X-SOM exploits logical reasoning and localheuristics to improve the quality of mappings while guaranteeing their consistency.,*,2007,*
Context− aware views for mobile users,Giorgio Orsi,Abstract Independent; heterogeneous; distributed; sometimes transient and mobile datasources produce an enormous amount of information that should be semantically integratedand ﬁltered; or; as we say; tailored; based on the users' interests and context. We propose toexploit knowledge about the user; the adopted device; and the environment-altogethercalled context-to the end of information tailoring. This paper presents the Context DimensionTree; a context model which is the basis for solving the information tailoring problem; alongwith its role in the framework of the Context-ADDICT architecture.,*,2007,*
X− SOM: Ontology Mapping and Inconsistency Resolution,Giorgio Orsi,Abstract Data integration is an old but still open issue in the database research area; whereSemantic Web technologies; such as ontologies; may be of great help. Aim of the Context-ADDICT project is to provide support for the integration and context-aware reshaping of datacoming from heterogeneous data sources. Within this framework; we use ontologyextraction; alignment and tailoring to ﬁnd and solve conﬂicts due to data sourceheterogeneity. In this paper we present X-SOM: an ontology mapping tool developed withinthe Context-ADDICT project. The contribution of this high precision mapping tool istwofold:(i) a modular and extensible architecture that automatically combines severalmatching techniques by means of a neural network; and (ii) a subsystem for the (semi)-automatic resolution of semantic inconsistencies.

Improving Search and Navigation by Combining Ontologies and Social Tags,Carlo A Curino; Davide Eynard; Giorgio Orsi,Abstract. The Semantic Web has the ambitious goal of enabling complex autonomousapplications to reason on a machine-processable version of the World Wide Web. This;however; would require a coordinated effort not easily achievable in practice. On the otherhand; spontaneous communities; based on social tagging; recently achieved noticeableconsensus and diffusion. The goal of the TagOnto system is to bridge between these tworealities by automatically mapping (social) tags to more structured domain ontologies; thus;providing assistive; navigational features typical of the Semantic Web. These novelsearching and navigational capabilities are complementary to more traditional searchengine functionalities. The system; and its intuitive AJAX interface; are released anddemonstrated on-line.,*,*,*
Semantic Data Markets: Store; Reason and Query,Roberto De Virgilio; Giorgio Orsi; Letizia Tanca; Riccardo Torlone,Abstract—This paper presents NYAYA; a flexible system for the management of Semantic-Web data which couples an efficient storage mechanism with advanced and up-to-dateontology reasoning capabilities. NYAYA is capable of processing large Semantic-Webdatasets; expressed in a variety of formalisms; by transforming them into a collection ofSemantic Data Kiosks that expose the native meta-data in a uniform fashion using Datalog±;a very general rule-based language. The kiosks form a Semantic Data Market where thedata in each kiosk can be uniformly accessed using conjunctive queries and where userscan specify user-defined constraints over the data.,*,*,*
