Link prediction using supervised learning,Mohammad Al Hasan; Vineet Chaoji; Saeed Salem; Mohammed Zaki,Abstract Social network analysis has attracted much attention in recent years. Link predictionis a key research direction within this area. In this paper; we study link prediction as asupervised learning task. Along the way; we identify a set of features that are key to theperformance under the supervised learning setup. The identified features are very easy tocompute; and at the same time surprisingly effective in solving the link prediction problem.We also explain the effectiveness of the features from their class density distribution. Thenwe compare different classes of supervised learning algorithms in terms of their predictionperformance using various performance metrics; such as accuracy; precision-recall; F-values; squared error etc. with a 5-fold cross validation. Our results on two practical socialnetwork datasets shows that most of the well-known classification algorithms (decision …,SDM06: workshop on link analysis; counter-terrorism and security,2006,685
Matrix Bit loaded: a scalable lightweight join query processor for RDF data,Medha Atre; Vineet Chaoji; Mohammed J Zaki; James A Hendler,Abstract The Semantic Web community; until now; has used traditional database systems forthe storage and querying of RDF data. The SPARQL query language also closely followsSQL syntax. As a natural consequence; most of the SPARQL query processing techniquesare based on database query processing and optimization techniques. For SPARQL joinquery optimization; previous works like RDF-3X and Hexastore have proposed to use 6-wayindexes on the RDF data. Although these indexes speed up merge-joins by orders ofmagnitude; for complex join queries generating large intermediate join results; the scalabilityof the query processor still remains a challenge. In this paper; we introduce (i) BitMat-acompressed bit-matrix structure for storing huge RDF graphs; and (ii) a novel; light-weightSPARQL join query processing method that employs an initial pruning technique …,Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web,2010,198
Grail: Scalable reachability index for large graphs,Hilmi Yildirim; Vineet Chaoji; Mohammed J Zaki,Abstract Given a large directed graph; rapidly answering reachability queries betweensource and target nodes is an important problem. Existing methods for reachability trade-offindexing time and space versus query time performance. However; the biggest limitation ofexisting methods is that they simply do not scale to very large real-world graphs. We presenta very simple; but scalable reachability index; called GRAIL; that is based on the idea ofrandomized interval labeling; and that can effectively handle very large graphs. Based on anextensive set of experiments; we show that while more sophisticated methods work better onsmall graphs; GRAIL is the only index that can scale to millions of nodes and edges. GRAILhas linear indexing time and space; and the query time ranges from constant time to beinglinear in the graph order and size.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,113
Proteomic and phospho-proteomic profile of human platelets in basal; resting state: insights into integrin signaling,Amir H Qureshi; Vineet Chaoji; Dony Maiguel; Mohd Hafeez Faridi; Constantinos J Barth; Saeed M Salem; Mudita Singhal; Darren Stoub; Bryan Krastins; Mitsunori Ogihara; Mohammed J Zaki; Vineet Gupta,During atherogenesis and vascular inflammation quiescent platelets are activated toincrease the surface expression and ligand affinity of the integrin αIIbβ3 via inside-outsignaling. Diverse signals such as thrombin; ADP and epinephrine transduce signalsthrough their respective GPCRs to activate protein kinases that ultimately lead to thephosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail of the integrin αIIbβ3 and augment its function. Thesignaling pathways that transmit signals from the GPCR to the cytosolic domain of theintegrin are not well defined. In an effort to better understand these pathways; we employeda combination of proteomic profiling and computational analyses of isolated humanplatelets. We analyzed ten independent human samples and identified a total of 1507unique proteins in platelets. This is the most comprehensive platelet proteome assembled …,PloS one,2009,100
Origami: Mining representative orthogonal graph patterns,Mohammad Al Hasan; Vineet Chaoji; Saeed Salem; Jeremy Besson; Mohammed J Zaki,In this paper; we introduce the concept of alpha-orthogonal patterns to mine a representativeset of graph patterns. Intuitively; two graph patterns are alpha-orthogonal if their similarity isbounded above by alpha. Each alpha-orthogonal pattern is also a representative for thosepatterns that are at least beta similar to it. Given user defined alpha; beta isin [0; 1]; the goalis to mine an alpha-orthogonal; beta-representative set that minimizes the set ofunrepresented patterns. We present ORIGAMI; an effective algorithm for mining the set ofrepresentative orthogonal patterns. ORIGAMI first uses a randomized algorithm to randomlytraverse the pattern space; seeking previously unexplored regions; to return a set of maximalpatterns. ORIGAMI then extracts an alpha-orthogonal; beta-representative set from themined maximal patterns. We show the effectiveness of our algorithm on a number of real …,Data Mining; 2007. ICDM 2007.

Recommendations to boost content spread in social networks,Vineet Chaoji; Sayan Ranu; Rajeev Rastogi; Rushi Bhatt,Abstract Content sharing in social networks is a powerful mechanism for discovering contenton the Internet. The degree to which content is disseminated within the network depends onthe connectivity relationships among network nodes. Existing schemes for recommendingconnections in social networks are based on the number of common neighbors; similarity ofuser profiles; etc. However; such similarity-based connections do not consider the amount ofcontent discovered. In this paper; we propose novel algorithms for recommendingconnections that boost content propagation in a social network without compromising on therelevance of the recommendations. Unlike existing work on influence propagation; in ourenvironment; we are looking for edges instead of nodes; with a bound on the number ofincident edges per node. We show that the content spread function is not submodular …,Proceedings of the 21st international conference on World Wide Web,2012,72
Predicting product adoption in large-scale social networks,Rushi Bhatt; Vineet Chaoji; Rajesh Parekh,Abstract Online social networks offer opportunities to analyze user behavior and socialconnectivity and leverage resulting insights for effective online advertising. We study theadoption of a paid product by members of a large and well-connected Instant Messenger(IM) network. This product is important to the business and poses unique challenges toadvertising due to its low baseline adoption rate. We find that adoption by highly connectedindividuals is correlated with their social connections (friends) adopting after them. However;there is little evidence of social influence by these high degree individuals. Further; thespread of adoption remains mostly local to first-adopters and their immediate friends. Weobserve strong evidence of peer pressure wherein future adoption by an individual is morelikely if the product has been widely adopted by the individual's friends.

An integrated; generic approach to pattern mining: data mining template library,Vineet Chaoji; Mohammad Al Hasan; Saeed Salem; Mohammed J Zaki,Abstract Frequent pattern mining (FPM) is an important data mining paradigm to extractinformative patterns like itemsets; sequences; trees; and graphs. However; no practicalframework for integrating the FPM tasks has been attempted. In this paper; we describe thedesign and implementation of the Data Mining Template Library (DMTL) for FPM. DMTLutilizes a generic data mining approach; where all aspects of mining are controlled via a setof properties. It uses a novel pattern property hierarchy to define and mine different patterntypes. This property hierarchy can be thought of as a systematic characterization of thepattern space; ie; a meta-pattern specification that allows the analyst to specify new patterntypes; by extending this hierarchy. Furthermore; in DMTL all aspects of mining are controlledby a set of different mining properties. For example; the kind of mining approach to use …,Data mining and knowledge discovery,2008,47
Robust partitional clustering by outlier and density insensitive seeding,Mohammad Al Hasan; Vineet Chaoji; Saeed Salem; Mohammed J Zaki,Abstract The leading partitional clustering technique; k-means; is one of the mostcomputationally efficient clustering methods. However; it produces a local optimal solutionthat strongly depends on its initial seeds. Bad initial seeds can also cause the splitting ormerging of natural clusters even if the clusters are well separated. In this paper; we propose;ROBIN; a novel method for initial seed selection in k-means types of algorithms. It imposesconstraints on the chosen seeds that lead to better clustering when k-means converges. Theconstraints make the seed selection method insensitive to outliers in the data and also assistit to handle variable density or multi-scale clusters. Furthermore; they (constraints) make themethod deterministic; so only one run suffices to obtain good initial seeds; as opposed totraditional random seed selection approaches that need many runs to obtain good seeds …,Pattern Recognition Letters,2009,45

Community detection in content-sharing social networks,Nagarajan Natarajan; Prithviraj Sen; Vineet Chaoji,Abstract Network structure and content in microblogging sites like Twitter influence eachother---user A on Twitter follows user B for the tweets that B posts on the network; and A maythen re-tweet the content shared by B to his/her own followers. In this paper; we propose aprobabilistic model to jointly model link communities and content topics by leveraging boththe social graph and the content shared by users. We model a community as a distributionover users; use it as a source for topics of interest; and jointly infer both communities andtopics using Gibbs sampling. While modeling communities using the social graph; ormodeling topics using content have received a great deal of attention; a few recentapproaches try to model topics in content-sharing platforms using both content and socialgraph.

DMTL: A generic data mining template library,Mohammad Al Hasan; Vineet Chaoji; Saeed Salem; Nagender Parimi; Mohammed J Zaki,Abstract FPM (Frequent Pattern Mining) is a data mining paradigm to extract informativepatterns from massive datasets. Researchers have developed numerous novel algorithms toextract these patterns. Unfortunately; the focus primarily has been on a small set of popularpatterns (itemsets; sequences; trees and graphs) and no framework for integrating the FPMprocess has been attempted. In this paper we introduce DMTL; a generic pattern mininglibrary which fuses theoretical concepts from formal concept analysis and genericprogramming. It provides a framework that allows mining a large spectrum of patterns. Weexpress each pattern in terms of its relational properties. Describing patterns based on theirproperties results in a pattern concept hierarchy. This hierarchical model is implementedusing principles from generic programming.

Dagger: A scalable index for reachability queries in large dynamic graphs,Hilmi Yildirim; Vineet Chaoji; Mohammed J Zaki,Abstract: With the ubiquity of large-scale graph data in a variety of application domains;querying them effectively is a challenge. In particular; reachability queries are becomingincreasingly important; especially for containment; subsumption; and connectivity checks.Whereas many methods have been proposed for static graph reachability; many real-worldgraphs are constantly evolving; which calls for dynamic indexing. In this paper; we present afully dynamic reachability index over dynamic graphs. Our method; called DAGGER; is alight-weight index based on interval labeling; that scales to million node graphs and beyond.Our extensive experimental evaluation on real-world and synthetic graphs confirms itseffectiveness over baseline methods.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1301.0977,2013,17
ABACUS: mining arbitrary shaped clusters from large datasets based on backbone identification,Vineet Chaoji; Geng Li; Hilmi Yildirim; Mohammed J Zaki,Abstract A wide variety of clustering algorithms exist that cater to applications based oncertain special characteristics of the data. Our focus is on methods that capture arbitraryshaped clusters in data; the so called spatial clustering algorithms. With the growing size ofspatial datasets from diverse sources; the need for scalable algorithms is paramount. Wepropose a shape-based clustering algorithm; ABACUS; that scales to large datasets.ABACUS is based on the idea of identifying the intrinsic structure for each cluster; which wealso refer to as the backbone of that cluster. The backbone comprises of a much smaller setof points; thus giving this method the desired ability to scale to larger datasets. ABACUSoperates in two stages. In the first stage; we identify the backbone of each cluster via aniterative process made up of globbing (or point merging) and point movement operations …,*,2011,16

Further; asubset of edges is determined from the samples of edges based on gain corresponding toeach edge. Also; each node of the subset of edges is having at least one of less than 'K'orequal to 'K'incoming edges. Further; the probability of each edge; of the subset of edges;may be incremented. Furthermore; a final set of edges may be determined by ensuring'K'incoming edges.

A data mining method for short-term load forecasting in power systems,Hiroyuki Mori; Noriyuki Kosemura,抄録 This paper proposes a method for daily maximum load forecasting in power systems. Itis based on the integration of the regression tree and the artificial neural network. In thispaper; the regression tree is used to extract knowledge or rules as a data-mining method.That is useful for the information processing of the complicated data. As a result; theproposed method has an advantage to clarify the cause and effect of dynamic load behaviorin load forecasting. However; the regression tree does not necessarily give good predictionresults in spite of good classification. Therefore; this paper proposes a method for combiningthe classification results of the regression tree with the multi-layer perceptron of a universalnonlinear approximator. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in realdata.,IEEJ transactions on power and energy,2001,14
Document clustering with bursty information,Apirak Hoonlor; Bolesław K Szymanski; Mohamed J Zaki; Vineet Chaoji,Abstract Nowadays; almost all text corpora; such as blogs; emails and RSS feeds; are acollection of text streams. The traditional vector space model (VSM); or bag-of-wordsrepresentation; cannot capture the temporal aspect of these text streams. So far; only a fewbursty features have been proposed to create text representations with temporal modelingfor the text streams. We propose bursty feature representations that perform better than VSMon various text mining tasks; such as document retrieval; topic modeling and textcategorization. For text clustering; we propose a novel framework to generate burstydistance measure. We evaluated it on UPGMA; Star and K-Medoids clustering algorithms.The bursty distance measure did not only perform equally well on various text collections;but it was also able to cluster the news articles related to specific events much better than …,Computing and Informatics,2013,13
Detection of inconsistent regions in video streams,Roger S Gaborski; Vishal S Vaingankar; Vineet S Chaoji; Ankur M Teredesai; Aleksey Tentler,Humans have a general understanding about their environment. We possess a sense ofdistinction between what is consistent and inconsistent about the environment based on ourprior experience. Any aspect of the scene that does not fit into this definition of normalcytends to be classified as an inconsistent event; also referred to as novel event. An exampleof this is a casual observer standing over a bridge on a freeway; tracking vehicle traffic;where the vehicles traveling at or around the same speed limit are generally ignored and avehicle traveling at a much higher (or lower) speed is subject to one's immediate attention.

I-FAC: Efficient fuzzy associative classifier for object classes in images,Ashish Mangalampalli; Vineet Chaoji; Subhajit Sanyal,We present I-FAC; a novel fuzzy associative classification algorithm for object classdetection in images using interest points. In object class detection; the negative class CN isgenerally vague (CN= U− CP; where U and CP are the universal and positive classesrespectively). But; image classification necessarily requires both positive and negativeclasses for training. I-FAC is a single class image classifier that relies only on the positiveclass for training. Because of its fuzzy nature; I-FAC also handles polysemy and synonymy(common problems in most crisp (non-fuzzy) image classifiers) very well. As associativeclassification leverages frequent patterns mined from a given dataset; its performance asadjudged from its false-positive-rate (FPR)-versus-recall curve is very good; especially atlower FPRs when its recall is even better. IFAC has the added advantage that the rules …,Pattern Recognition (ICPR); 2010 20th International Conference on,2010,10

Recursive data mining for author and role identification,Vineet Chaoji; Apirak Hoonlor; Boleslaw Szymanski,Abstract—Like paintings and verbal dialogues; written documents exhibit the author'sdistinctive style and identification of the author of an anonymous document is an importantand challenging task in computer security. Even more challenging is identification of a styleof a group of diverse individuals acting in similar circumstances; like authors writing incertain literary period or people writing in a certain social role. The last application isimportant for analyzing hidden group communicating over the internet in which neitheridentities nor roles of the members are known.

The key aspects ofBitMat are as follows: i) its RDF graph representation is very compact compared to theconventional disk-based and existing main-memory RDF stores; and ii) SPARQL BasicGraph Pattern (BGP) queries are processed using a novel method employing initial pruningtechnique; followed by a subgraph matching algorithm on an BitMat; without uncompressingit at any point. This enables processing queries on very large RDF graphs completely in-memory. We present the key concepts of the Bit-Mat structure and our BGP query processingalgorithm.

Moreprecisely; we want to recognize a group of authors communicating in a specific role withinsuch a community rather than a single author. The challenge here is that the same authormay participate in different roles in communications within the group; in each role havingdifferent authors as peers. An additional challenge of our problem is the length ofcommunications. Each individual exchange in our intended domain; communications withinan Internet community; is relatively short; in the order of several dozens of words; sostandard text mining approaches may fail.

Cognitively motivated habituation for novelty detection in video,A Vaingankar; V Chajoi; R Gaborski; A Teredesai,In this paper we describe the learning component of a framework for novelty detection invideo data. The motivation for this learning component is derived from biologically inspiredtheories such as habituation. We refer to this novelty detection framework as VENUS (VideoExploitation and Novelty Understanding in Streams). Habituation is well known as an effectby which a system ceases to respond after repeated presentations of the same stimulus(Siddle; Kuiack and Kroese 1983). Work by Paul Crook (2000) implements a neural networkto habituate to the surrounding elements and classifies stimulus patterns as familiar or novel.Computational modeling of habituation has been proposed by Wang (1995) and recentlyapplied in mobile robots by Marsland; Nehmzow and Shapiro (1999).

BitMat–Scalable Indexing and Querying of Large RDF Graphs,Medha Atre; Vineet Chaoji; Mohammed J Zaki; James A Hendler,Abstract The growing size of Semantic Web data expressed in the form of ResourceDescription Framework (RDF) has made it necessary to develop effective ways of storingthis data to save space and to query it in a scalable manner. SPARQL–the query languagefor RDF data–closely follows SQL syntax. As a natural consequence most of the RDFstorage and querying engines are based on modern database storage and queryoptimization techniques. Previous work has tried to use vertical partitioning using columnstores (C-Store; MonetDB) and 6-way indexing (RDF-3X; Hexastore) for storage andquerying of RDF data. Although these approaches perform well for highly selective queries;for queries having low-selectivity triple patterns; scalability of the querying method andoptimizations still remain a challenge.

BitPath–Label Order Constrained Reachability in Large Graphs,Medha Atre; Vineet Chaoji; Mohammed J Zaki; James A Hendler,ABSTRACT With ever expanding size of the web; sizes of graphs with semanticrelationships are growing very rapidly. The semantic relationships are typically presented asedge-labeled graphs where nodes are the entities and the edge label signifies therelationships between the two entities. RDF graphs are an example of such graphs. Purereachability queries on these graphs do not give any information about the semanticassociation between two remote entities. On the other hand; the typical size of semanticgraphs present on the web has made general regular path query processing infeasible. Inthis paper we focus on the following graph path query problem–given a source node s; adestination node d and a sequence of ordered edge labels “label seq”; does there exist anypath between the two nodes which has the edges labels in “label seq”(in the given order) …,*,2011,*

The motivation behind this paper is a learning based framework fordetecting novelty within video. Since; humans have a general understanding about theirenvironment and possess a sense of distinction between what is normal and abnormalabout the environment based on our prior experience; any aspect of the scene that does notfit into this definition of normalcy tends to be labeled as a novel event. In this paper; wepropose a computational learning based framework for novelty detection and provide theexperimental evidence to describe the results obtained by this framework. To begin with theframework extracts low-level features from scenes; based on the focus of attention theoryand then combines unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering with habituation …,Proceedings of the Seventeenth International Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society Conference; FLAIRS 2004,2004,*
Feature Partitioning for the Co-Traning Setting,Vineet Chaoji,Abstract Supervised learning algorithms rely on availability of labeled data. Labeled data iseither scarce or involves substantial human effort in the labeling process. These two factors;along with the abundance of unlabeled data; have spurred research initiatives that exploitunlabeled data to boost supervised learning. This genre of learning algorithms that utilizeunlabeled data alongside a small set of labeled data are known as semi-supervisedlearning algorithms. Data characteristics; such as the presence of a generative model;provide the foundation for applying these learning algorithms. Co-training is one such algorithm that leverages existence of two redundant" views" for a data instance. Based onthese two views; the co-training algorithm trains two classifiers using the labeled data. Thesmall set of labeled data results in a pair of weak classi fiers. With the help of the …,*,2004,*
BitPath–Label Order Constrained Reachability Queries for Large RDF Graphs,Medha Atre; Vineet Chaoji; Mohammed J Zaki,Abstract. In this paper we focus on the following constrained reachability problem over edge-labeled graphs like RDF–given source node x; destination node y; and a sequence of edgelabels (a; b; c; d); is there a path between the two nodes such that the edge labels on thepath satisfy a regular expression “* a.* b.* c.* d.*”. A “*” before “a” allows any other edgelabel to appear on the path before edge “a”.“a.*” forces at least one edge with label “a”.“.*”after “a” allows zero or more edge labels after “a” and before “b”. Our query processingalgorithm uses simple divide-and-conquer and greedy pruning procedures to limit thesearch space. However; our graph indexing technique–based on compressed bit-vectors–allows indexing large graphs which otherwise would have been infeasible. We haveevaluated our approach on graphs with more than 22 million edges and 6 million nodes …,*,*,*
