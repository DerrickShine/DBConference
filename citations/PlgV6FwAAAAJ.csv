Robust and fast similarity search for moving object trajectories,Lei Chen; M Tamer Özsu; Vincent Oria,Abstract An important consideration in similarity-based retrieval of moving object trajectoriesis the definition of a distance function. The existing distance functions are usually sensitive tonoise; shifts and scaling of data that commonly occur due to sensor failures; errors indetection techniques; disturbance signals; and different sampling rates. Cleaning data toeliminate these is not always possible. In this paper; we introduce a novel distance function;Edit Distance on Real sequence (EDR) which is robust against these data imperfections.Analysis and comparison of EDR with other popular distance functions; such as Euclideandistance; Dynamic Time Warping (DTW); Edit distance with Real Penalty (ERP); andLongest Common Subsequences (LCSS); indicate that EDR is more robust than Euclideandistance; DTW and ERP; and it is on average 50% more accurate than LCSS.

MOQL: A multimedia object query language,John Z Li; M Tamer Ozsu; Duane Szafron; Vincent Oria,Abstract We describe a general multimedia query language; called MOQL; based onODMG's Object Query Language (OQL). In contrast to previous multimedia query languagesthat are either designed for one particular medium (eg images) or specialized for a particularapplication (eg; medical imaging); MOQL is general in its treatment of multiple media and dierent applications. The language includes constructs to capture the temporal and spatialrelationships in multimedia data as well as functions for query presentation. We illustrate thelanguage features by query examples. The language is implemented for a multimediadatabase built on top of ObjectStore.,Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Multimedia Information Systems,1997,87
An extendible hash for multi-precision similarity querying of image databases,Shu Lin; M Tamer Ozsu; Vincent Oria; Raymond Ng,Abstract We propose multi-precision similarity matching where the image is divided into anumber of subblocks; each with its associated color histogram. We present experimentalresults showing that the spatial distribution information recorded by multiprecision colorhistograms helps to make similarity matching more precise. We also show that sub-imagequeries are much better supported with multi-precision color histograms. To minimize theoverhead; we employ a filtering scheme based on the 3-dimensional average color vectors.We provide a formal result proving that filtering with multi-precision color histograms iscomplete. Finally; we develop a novel extendible hashing structure for indexing the averagecolor vectors. We give experimental results showing that the proposed structure significantlyoutperforms the SR-tree.,VLDB,2001,66
Symbolic representation and retrieval of moving object trajectories,Lei Chen; M Tamer Özsu; Vincent Oria,Abstract Searching moving object trajectories of video databases has been applied to manyfields; such as video data analysis; content-based video retrieval; video scene classification.In this paper; we propose a novel representation of trajectories; called< i> movement patternstrings</i>; which convert the trajectories into symbolic representations. Movement patternstrings encode both the movement direction and the movement distance information of thetrajectories. The distances that are computed in a symbolic space are lower bounds of thedistances of original trajectory data; which guarantees that no false dismissals will beintroduced using movement pattern strings to retrieve trajectories. In order to improve theretrieval efficiency; we define a< i> modified frequency distance</i> for frequency vectorsthat are obtained from movement pattern strings to reduce the dimensionality and the …,Proceedings of the 6th ACM SIGMM international workshop on Multimedia information retrieval,2004,62
Benchmarking spatial joins a la carte,Oliver Gunther; Vincent Oria; Philippe Picouet; J-M Saglio; Michel Scholl,Spatial joins are join operations that involve spatial data types and operators. Spatial accessmethods are often used to speed up the computation of spatial joins. We address the issueof benchmarking spatial join operations. For this purpose; we first present a WWW-basedbenchmark generator to produce sets of rectangles. Using a Web browser experimenterscan specify the number of rectangles in a sample; as well as the statistical distributions oftheir sizes; shapes; and locations. Second; using the generator and a well-defined set ofstatistical models we define several tests to compare the performance of three spatial joinalgorithms: nested loop; scan-and-index; and synchronized tree traversal. We also added areal-life data set from the Sequoia 2000 storage benchmark. Our results show that therelative performance of the different techniques mainly depends on two parameters …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 1998. Proceedings.

Modeling images for content-based queries: The DISIMA approach,Vincent Oria; M Tamer Ozsu; Ling Liu; Xiaobo Li; John Z Li; Youping Niu; Paul J Iglinski,Abstract The DISIMA project aims at building a complete image database system enablingcontent-based querying. The model; the architecture and a query language have beendefined. The prototype is being implemented on top of the ObjectStore DBMS. DISIMAproposes a model for both image and spatial applications. The DISIMA model allows theuser to assign different semantics to an image component (semantic independence) and animage representation can be changed without any effect on applications using it(representation independence). The architecture involves different image sources includingWWW-servers and file systems.

Indexing in-network trajectory flows,Iulian Sandu Popa; Karine Zeitouni; Vincent Oria; Dominique Barth; Sandrine Vial,Abstract Indexing moving objects (MO) is a hot topic in the field of moving objects databasessince many years. An impressive number of access methods have been proposed tooptimize the processing of MO-related queries. Several methods have focused on spatio-temporal range queries; which represent the foundation of MO trajectory queries.Surprisingly; only a few of them consider that the objects movements are constrained. This isan important aspect for several reasons ranging from better capturing the relationshipbetween the trajectory and the network space to more accurate trajectory representation withlower storage requirements. In this paper; we propose T-PARINET; an access method toefficiently retrieve the trajectories of objects moving in networks. T-PARINET is designed forcontinuous indexing of trajectory data flows. The cornerstone of T-PARINET is PARINET …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2011,39
VisualMOQL: The DISIMA visual query language,Vincent Oria; M Tamer Ozsu; Bing Xu; I Cheng; Paul J Iglinski,Multimedia data are now available to a variety of users ranging from naive to sophisticated.To make querying easy; visual query languages have been proposed. Most of theselanguages have a low expressive power and have their own query processors. Efforts havebeen made to design query languages with proper semantics to facilitate query optimizationand processing in existing database systems. The majority of multimedia database systemsare built on top of object or object-relational database systems with the underlying queryfacilities inherited. The DISIMA system is being built on top of a commercial OODBMS andwe have chosen to extend the standard object oriented query language OQL with somemultimedia functionalities. The resulting language is called MOQL. This paper presentsVisualMOQL; a visual query language implementing the image component of MOQL.,Multimedia Computing and Systems; 1999.

Dimensional testing for multi-step similarity search,Michael E Houle; Xiguo Ma; Michael Nett; Vincent Oria,In data mining applications such as subspace clustering or feature selection; changes to theunderlying feature set can require the reconstruction of search indices to supportfundamental data mining tasks. For such situations; multi-step search approaches havebeen proposed that can accommodate changes in the underlying similarity measure withoutthe need to rebuild the index. In this paper; we present a heuristic multi-step searchalgorithm that utilizes a measure of intrinsic dimension; the generalized expansiondimension (GED); as the basis of its search termination condition. Compared to the currentstate-of-the-art method; experimental results show that our heuristic approach is able toobtain significant improvements in both the number of candidates and the running time;while losing very little in the accuracy of the query results.,Data Mining (ICDM); 2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on,2012,26

Using multi-scale histograms to answer pattern existence and shape match queries over time series data,Lei Chen; M Tamer Ozsu; Vincent Oria,Abstract Similarity-based querying of time series data can be categorized as patternexistence queries and shape match queries. Pattern existence queries find the time seriesdata with certain patterns while shape match queries look for the time series data that havesimilar movement shapes. Existing proposals address one of these or the other. In thispaper; we propose multi-scale time series histograms that can be used to answer both typesof queries; thus offering users more flexibility. Multiple histogram levels allow querying atvarious precision levels. Most importantly; the distances of time series histograms at lowerscale are lower bounds of the distances at higher scale; which guarantees that no falsedismissals will be introduced when a multi-step filtering process is used in answering shapematch queries. We further propose to use averages of time series histograms to reduce …,Proc. of 17th Int Conf. on Scientific and Statistical Database Management; CA; USA,2005,22
Modeling Video Data for Content Based Queries: Extending the DISIMA Image Data Model.,Lei Chen; M Tamer Özsu; Vincent Oria,We present an efficient video data model that extends the DISIMA image data model byadding the video components and setting up links between image and video data. Manyvideo data models have been proposed; most of which describe video data independently ofimage data and therefore fail to consider the relationship between videos and images. Ourproposed model expresses the semantics of video data content by means of salient objectsand relationships among them. Connections between video data and DISIMA images aremade through key frames; which are extracted from each shot. Based on these connections;techniques used to query image data may be used to query video data. In addition; a set ofnew predicates has been defined to describe the spatio-temporal characteristics of salientobjects in the video data. MOQL is used as a query language; with which we present …,MMM,2003,22
Flexible integration of multimedia sub-queries with qualitative preferences,Ilaria Bartolini; Paolo Ciaccia; Vincent Oria; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract Complex multimedia queries; aiming to retrieve from large databases those objectsthat best match the query specification; are usually processed by splitting them into a set ofm simpler sub-queries; each dealing with only some of the query features. To determinewhich are the overall best-matching objects; a rule is then needed to integrate the results ofsuch sub-queries; ie; how to globally rank the m-dimensional vectors of matching degrees;or partial scores; that objects obtain on the m sub-queries. It is a fact that state-of-the-artapproaches all adopt as integration rule a scoring function; such as weighted average; thataggregates the m partial scores into an overall (numerical) similarity score; so that objectscan be linearly ordered and only the highest scored ones returned to the user. This choicehowever forces the system to compromise between the different sub-queries and can …,Multimedia Tools and Applications,2007,21

Spatio-temporal compression of trajectories in road networks,Iulian Sandu Popa; Karine Zeitouni; Vincent Oria; Ahmed Kharrat,Abstract With the proliferation of wireless communication devices integrating GPStechnology; trajectory datasets are becoming more and more available. The problemsconcerning the transmission and the storage of such data have become prominent with thecontinuous increase in volume of these data. A few works in the field of moving objectdatabases deal with spatio-temporal compression. However; these works only consider thecase of objects moving freely in the space. In this paper; we tackle the problem ofcompressing trajectory data in road networks with deterministic error bounds. We analyzethe limitations of the existing methods and data models for road network trajectorycompression. Then; we propose an extended data model and a network partitioningalgorithm into long paths to increase the compression rates for the same error bound. We …,GeoInformatica,2015,20
Local summarization and multi-level LSH for retrieving multi-variant audio tracks,Yi Yu; Michel Crucianu; Vincent Oria; Lei Chen,Abstract In this paper we study the problem of detecting and grouping multi-variant audiotracks in large audio datasets. To address this issue; a fast and reliable retrieval method isnecessary. But reliability requires elaborate representations of audio content; whichchallenges fast retrieval by similarity from a large audio database. To find a better tradeoffbetween retrieval quality and efficiency; we put forward an approach relying on localsummarization and multi-level Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH). More precisely; each audiotrack is divided into multiple Continuously Correlated Periods (CCP) of variable lengthaccording to spectral similarity. The description for each CCP is calculated based on itsWeighted Mean Chroma (WMC). A track is thus represented as a sequence of WMCs. Then;an adapted two-level LSH is employed for efficiently delineating a narrow relevant search …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM international conference on Multimedia,2009,19
Combining multi-probe histogram and order-statistics based lsh for scalable audio content retrieval,Yi Yu; Michel Crucianu; Vincent Oria; Ernesto Damiani,Abstract In order to improve the reliability and the scalability of content-based retrieval ofvariant audio tracks from large music databases; we suggest a new multi-stage LSH schemethat consists in (i) extracting compact but accurate representations from audio tracks byexploiting the LSH idea to summarize audio tracks; and (ii) adequately organizing theresulting representations in LSH tables; retaining almost the same accuracy as an exactkNN retrieval. In the first stage; we use major bins of successive chroma features to calculatea multi-probe histogram (MPH) that is concise but retains the information about localtemporal correlations. In the second stage; based on the order statistics (OS) of the MPH; wepropose a new LSH scheme; OS-LSH; to organize and probe the histograms.

Scalable content-based music retrieval using chord progression histogram and tree-structure LSH,Yi Yu; Roger Zimmermann; Ye Wang; Vincent Oria,With more and more multimedia content made available on the Internet; music informationretrieval is becoming a critical but challenging research topic; especially for real-time onlinesearch of similar songs from websites. In this paper we study how to quickly and reliablyretrieve relevant songs from a large-scale dataset of music audio tracks according to melodysimilarity. Our contributions are two-fold:(i) Compact and accurate representation of audiotracks by exploiting music semantics. Chord progressions are recognized from audio signalsbased on trained music rules; and the recognition accuracy is improved by multi-probing.

DISIMA: An object-oriented approach to developing an image database system,Vincent Oria; M Tarner Ozsu; Paul J Iglinski; B Bu; L Irene Cheng,Most image database prototypes and products focus mainly on similarity searches oversyntactic features of images. DISIMA aims at providing querying on both syntactic andsemantic features of images. The content of an image is viewed as a set of salient objects(regions of interest). Salient objects are organized into two levels: physical salient objectsthat store syntactic features and logical salient objects that give the semantics. DISIMAintegrates a declarative query language (MOQL) and a visual query language(VisualMOQL).,Data Engineering; 2000. Proceedings. 16th International Conference on,2000,13
Multi-version music search using acoustic feature union and exact soft mapping,Yi Yu; Kazuki Joe; Vincent Oria; Fabian Moerchen; J Stephen Downie; Lei Chen,Research on audio-based music retrieval has primarily concentrated on refining audiofeatures to improve search quality. However; much less work has been done on improvingthe time efficiency of music audio searches. Representing music audio documents in anindexable format provides a mechanism for achieving efficiency. To address this issue; inthis work Exact Locality Sensitive Mapping (ELSM) is suggested to join the concatenatedfeature sets and soft hash values. On this basis we propose audio-based music indexingtechniques; ELSM and Soft Locality Sensitive Hash (SoftLSH) using an optimized FeatureUnion (FU) set of extracted audio features. Two contributions are made here. First; theprinciple of similarity-invariance is applied in summarizing audio feature sequences andutilized in training semantic audio representations based on regression.

MINDEX: An efficient index structure for salient-object-based queries in video databases,Lei Chen; M Tamer Özsu; Vincent Oria,Abstract. Several salient-object-based data models have been proposed to model videodata. However; none of them addresses the development of an index structure to efficientlyhandle salient-object-based queries. There are several indexing schemes that have beenproposed for spatiotemporal relationships among objects; and they are used to optimizetimestamp and interval queries; which are rarely used in video databases. Moreover; theseindex structures are designed without consideration of the granularity levels of constraintson salient objects and the characteristics of video data. In this paper; we propose amultilevel index structure (MINDEX) to efficiently handle the salient-object-based querieswith different levels of constraints. We present experimental results showing theperformance of different methods of MINDEX construction.,Multimedia Systems,2004,11
Pushing quality of service information and requirements into global query optimization,Haiwei Ye; Brigitte Kerhervé; GV Bochmann; Vincent Oria,In recent years; a lot of research effort has been dedicated to the management of quality ofservice (QoS); mainly in the fields of telecommunication networks and multimedia systems.Emerging applications such as electronic commerce; health-care applications; digitalpublishing or data mining also have requirements regarding the quality of service; the cost ofservice; the quality of data to be delivered; the accuracy and precision of the retrieved data.These examples show the need to consider the concept of QoS from a broader perspective;requiring the collaboration of all the distributed system components involved. In this paper;we propose an approach to integrate user-defined QoS requirements; together with thedynamic properties of the system components involved; into a distributed query processingenvironment.

Similarity queries in the DISIMA image DBMS,Vincent Oria; M Tamer Özsu; Shu Lin; Paul J Iglinski,Abstract In the DISIMA system; an image is composed of salient objects that are regions ofinterest in the image. A salient object has some syntactic properties (shape; color; textures)on which some similarity searches are defined. In addition; a global multi-precision imagesimilarity based on multi-scale color histograms allows similarity queries on images and sub-images.,Proceedings of the ninth ACM international conference on Multimedia,2001,11
Mining user behavior for resource prediction in interactive electronic malls,Silvia Hollfelder; Vincent Oria; M Tamer Ozsu,Applications in virtual multimedia catalogs are highly interactive. Thus; it is difficult toestimate resource demands required for presentation of catalog contents. We propose amethod to predict presentation resource demands in interactive multimedia catalogs. Theprediction is based on the results of mining the virtual mall action log file. The log filetypically contains information about previous user interests and browsing behavior. Thesedata are used for modeling users future behavior within a session. We define heuristics togenerate a start-up user behavior model as a continuous time Markov chain and adapt thismodel during a running session to the current user.,Multimedia and Expo; 2000.

PARINET: A tunable access method for in-network trajectories,Iulian Sandu Popa; Karine Zeitouni; Vincent Oria; Dominique Barth; Sandrine Vial,In this paper we propose PARINET; a new access method to efficiently retrieve thetrajectories of objects moving in networks. The structure of PARINET is based on acombination of graph partitioning and a set of composite B+-tree local indexes. PARINET isdesigned for historical data and relies on the distribution of the data over the network as forhistorical data; the data distribution is known in advance. Because the network can bemodeled using graphs; the partitioning of the trajectory data is based on graph partitioningtheory and can be tuned for a given query load. The data in each partition is indexed on thetime component using B+-trees. We study different types of queries; and provide an optimalconfiguration for several scenarios.

Energy-efficient evaluation of multiple skyline queries over a wireless sensor network,Junchang Xin; Guoren Wang; Lei Chen; Vincent Oria,Abstract Though skyline queries in wireless sensor networks have been intensively studiedin recent years; existing solutions are not optimized for multiple skyline queries as they focuson single full space skyline queries. It is not efficient to individually evaluate skyline queriesespecially in a wireless sensor network environment where power consumption should beminimized. In this paper; we propose an energy-efficient multi-skyline evaluation (EMSE)algorithm to effectively evaluate multiple skyline queries in wireless sensor networks. EMSEfirst utilizes a global optimization mechanism to reduce the number of skyline queries andsave on query propagation cost and parts of redundant result transmission cost as aconsequence.

Modeling shapes in an image database system,Vincent Oria; M Tamer Ozsu; PJ Iglinski; Y Leontiev,Abstract Due to the complex modeling requirement of data handled by image and spatialdatabases; they are most often built on top of object-oriented or object-relational databases.In the DISIMA image database; an image is composed of salient objects and a salient objecthas a shape which is a geometric object. The object-oriented modeling of shapes potentiallyconflicts with the mathematical definitions of geometric objects. Mathematically; a triangleand a rectangle are polygons and a square is a special kind of rectangle. Accordingly; aclass Triangle should be a subclass of the class Polygon. In the same way; a class Squareshould be a subclass of Rectangle which; in turn; should be defined as a subclass ofPolygon. But from the point of view of data representation; this leads to a conflict: A polygonminimally requires a list of n consecutive points for its description; whereas a rectangle …,Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on Multimedia Information System,1999,10
A dynamic view materialization scheme for sequences of query and update statements,Wugang Xu; Dimitri Theodoratos; Calisto Zuzarte; Xiaoying Wu; Vincent Oria,Abstract In a data warehouse design context; a set of views is selected for materialization inorder to improve the overall performance of a given workload. Typically; the workload is aset of queries and updates. In many applications; the workload statements come in a fixedorder. This scenario provides additional opportunities for optimization. Further; it modifiesthe view selection problem to one where views are materialized dynamically during theworkload statement execution and dropped later to free space and prevent unnecessarymaintenance overhead. We address the problem of dynamically selecting and droppingviews when the input is a sequence of statements in order to minimize their overallexecution cost under a space constraint. We model the problem as a shortest path problemin directed acyclic graphs.

Integrating the Results of Multimedia Sub-Queries Using Qualitative Preferences.,Ilaria Bartolini; Paolo Ciaccia; Vincent Oria; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract When similarity queries over multimedia databases are processed by splitting theoverall query condition into a set of sub-queries; the problem of how to efficiently andeffectively integrate the sub-queries' results arises. The common approach is to use a(monotone) scoring function; like min and average; to compute an overall similarity score byaggregating the partial scores an object obtains on the sub-queries. In order to minimize thenumber of database accesses; a “middleware” algorithm; like TA by Fagin; Lotem and Naor;is applied to return only the top k highest scored objects. In this paper we consider the use ofqualitative preferences for the integration of partial scores. With qualitative preferences onecan define arbitrary partial (rather than only linear) orders on database objects; which addsa large flexibility and avoids some drawbacks of scoring functions when query refinement …,Multimedia Information Systems,2004,9
Active caching for similarity queries based on shared-neighbor information,Michael E Houle; Vincent Oria; Umar Qasim,Abstract Novel applications such as recommender systems; uncertain databases; andmultimedia databases are designed to process similarity queries that produce ranked lists ofobjects as their results. Similarity queries typically result in disk access latency and incur asubstantial computational cost. In this paper; we propose an'active caching'technique forsimilarity queries that is capable of synthesizing query results from cached information evenwhen the required result list is not explicitly stored in the cache. Our solution; the CacheEstimated Significance (CES) model; is based on shared-neighbor similarity measures;which assess the strength of the relationship between two objects as a function of thenumber of other objects in the common intersection of their neighborhoods. The proposedmethod is general in that it does not require that the features be drawn from a metric …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,8

VisualMOQL: A visual query language for image databases,Vincent Oria; Bing Xu; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract Since most multimedia database systems are built on top of object or object-relational database systems; they inherit the underlying query facilities. The approach wepresent in this paper is in two steps. The first step is to design a multimedia query languagethat will be used as an internal language. The second step is to define an equivalent visualquery language and a translator to translate a visual query into a query in the internal querylanguage.,*,1998,8
Annotation propagation in image databases using similarity graphs,Michael E Houle; Vincent Oria; Shin'ichi Satoh; Jichao Sun,Abstract The practicality of large-scale image indexing and querying methods dependscrucially upon the availability of semantic information. The manual tagging of images withsemantic information is in general very labor intensive; and existing methods for automatedimage annotation may not always yield accurate results. The aim of this paper is to reduce toa minimum the amount of human intervention required in the semantic annotation of images;while preserving a high degree of accuracy. Ideally; only one copy of each object of interestwould be labeled manually; and the labels would then be propagated automatically to allother occurrences of the objects in the database. To this end; we propose an influencepropagation strategy; SW-KProp; that requires no human intervention beyond the initiallabeling of a subset of the images. SW-KProp distributes semantic information within a …,ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing; Communications; and Applications (TOMM),2013,7
Multi-level index for global and partial content-based image retrieval,Genevieve Jomier; Maude Manouvrier; Vincent Oria; Marta Rukoz,This article presents a quadtree-based data structure for effective indexing of images. Animage is represented by a multi-level feature vector; computed by a recursive decompositionof the image into four quadrants and stored as a full fixed-depth balanced quadtree. A nodeof the quadtree stores a feature vector of the corresponding image quadrant. A more generalquadtree-based structure called QUIP-tree (QUadtree-based Index for image retrieval andPattern search) is used to index the multi-level feature vectors of the images and theirquadrants. A QUIP-tree node is an entry to a set of clusters that groups similar quadrantsaccording to some pre-defined distances. The QUIP-tree allows a multi-level filtering incontent-based image retrieval as well as partial queries on images.,Data Engineering Workshops; 2005. 21st International Conference on,2005,7

Recognition and summarization of chord progressions and their application to music information retrieval,Yi Yu; Roger Zimmermann; Ye Wang; Vincent Oria,Accurate and compact representation of music signals is a key component of large-scalecontent-based music applications such as music content management and near duplicateaudio detection. This problem is not well solved yet despite many research efforts in thisfield. In this paper; we suggest mid-level summarization of music signals based on chordprogressions. More specially; in our proposed algorithm; chord progressions are recognizedfrom music signals based on a supervised learning model; and recognition accuracy isimproved by locally probing n-best candidates. By investigating the properties of chordprogressions; we further calculate a histogram from the probed chord progressions as asummary of the music signal.

Recent RF methods are able to identifycomplex target classes after relatively few feedback iterations. However; because thecomputational complexity of such methods is linear in the size of the database; retrieval canbe quite slow on very large databases. To address this scalability issue for active learning-based RF; we put forward a method that consists in the construction of an index in thefeature space associated to a kernel function and in performing approximate kNNhyperplane queries with this feature space index. The experimental evaluation performed ontwo image databases show that a significant speedup can be achieved at the expense of …,International Journal of Imaging Systems and Technology,2008,6
Towards hypermedia support for database systems,Anirban Bhaumik; Deepti Dixit; R Galmares; A Krishna; M Tzagarakis; M Vaitis; M Bieber; V Oria; Qiang Lu; Firas Alljalad; Li Zhang,Using a dynamic hypermedia engine (DHE); we propose to automate the following featuresfor database systems; both on and off the Web. First we automatically generate links basedon the database's relational (physical) schema and its original (non-normalized) entity-relationship specification. Second; the application developer can specify which kinds ofdatabase elements are related to diverse elements in the same or different databaseapplication; or even another software system. Our current DHE prototype illustrates these fora relational database management system. We propose integrating data warehousingapplications into the DHE.

Querying Images in the DISIMA DBMS.,Vincent Oria; M Tamer Özsu; Paul Iglinski,Abstract Because digital images are not meaningful by themselves; images are oftencoupled with some descriptive or qualitative data in an image database. Moreover thedivision of these data into syntactic (color; shape; texture) and semantic (meaningful realword object or concept) features necessitates novel querying techniques. Most imagesystems and prototypes have focussed on similarity searches based only on the syntacticfeatures. In the DISIMA system we also propose a solution for similarity searches thatcombines color histograms; spatial relationships of image blocks and a hash structure tobetter discriminate among images. Additionally we query images on the basis of salientobjects (regions of interest in images) and their properties. This paper presents the queryingfacilities implemented for the DISIMA system.

Collaborative and trajectory prediction models of medical conditions by mining patients' Social Data,Xiang Ji; Soon Ae Chun; James Geller; Vincent Oria,In the US; 80% of Medicare spending is for managing patients with multiple coexistingconditions. Predicting potentially correlated diseases for an individual patient and correlateddisease progression paths are both important research tasks. For example; obese patientsare at an increased risk for developing type-2 diabetes and hypertension. This correlation iscalled comorbidity relationship. Discovering the comorbidity relationships is complex anddifficult due to the limited access to Electronic Health Records by privacy laws. In this paper;we present a framework called Social Data-based Prediction of Incidence and Trajectory topredict potential risks for medical conditions as well as its progression trajectory to identifythe comorbidity path. The framework utilizes patients' publicly available social media dataand presents a collaborative prediction model to predict the ranked list of potential …,Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,5
Knowledge propagation in large image databases using neighborhood information,Michael E Houle; Vincent Oria; Shin'ichi Satoh; Jichao Sun,Abstract The aim of this paper is to reduce to a minimum the level of human intervention inthe semantic annotation process of images. Ideally; only one copy of each object of interestwould be labeled manually; and the labels would then be propagated automatically to allother occurrences of the objects in the database. To that end; we propose a neighbor-basedinfluence propagation approach KProp which builds a voting model and propagates theknowledge associated to some objects to similar objects. We show that KProp can performefficiently through matrix computations and achieve better performance with fewer labeledexamples per object.,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Multimedia,2011,5
Searching musical audio datasets by a batch of multi-variant tracks,Yi Yu; J Stephen Downie; Lei Chen; Vincent Oria; Kazuki Joe,Abstract Multi-variant music tracks are those audio tracks of a particular song which are sungand recorded by different people (ie; cover songs). As music social clubs grow on theInternet; more and more people like to upload music recordings onto such music social sitesto share their own home-produced albums and participate in Internet singing contests.Therefore it is very important to explore a computer-assisted evaluation tool to detect theseaudio-based multi-variant tracks. In this paper we investigate such a task: the original trackof a song is embedded in datasets; with a batch of multi-variant audio tracks of this song asinput; our retrieval system returns an ordered list by similarity and indicates the position ofrelevant audio track. To help process multi-variant audio tracks; we suggest a semanticindexing framework and propose the Federated Features (FF) scheme to generate the …,Proceedings of the 1st ACM international conference on Multimedia information retrieval,2008,5
Hyperplane Queries in a Feature-Space M-tree for Speeding up Active Learning.,Michel Crucianu; Daniel Estevez; Vincent Oria; Jean-Philippe Tarel,(RF) is a noticeable method for reducing the “semantic gap” between the low-level featuresdescribing the content and the usually higher-level meaning of user's target. While recent RFmethods based on active learning are able to identify complex target classes after relativelyfew iterations; they can be quite slow on very large databases. To address this scalabilityissue for active RF; we put forward a method that consists in the construction of an M-tree inthe feature space associated to a kernel function and in performing approximate kNNhyperplane queries with this feature space M-tree. The experiments performed on two imagedatabases show that a significant speedup can be achieved; at the expense of a limitedincrease in the number of feedback rounds.,BDA,2007,5
Supporting virtual documents in just-in-time hypermedia systems,Li Zhang; Michael Bieber; David Millard; Vincent Oria,Abstract Many analytical or computational applications especially legacy systems createdocuments and display screens in response to user queries" dynamically" or in" real time".These" virtual documents" do not exist in advance and thus hypermedia features must begenerated" just in time"-automatically and dynamically. Additionally the hypermedia featuresmay have to cause target documents to be generated or re-generated.

Foundation of the DISIMA Image Query Languages,Vincent Oria; M Tamer Özsu; Paul J Iglinski,Abstract Because digital images are not meaningful by themselves; images are oftencoupled with some descriptive or qualitative data in an image database. These data; dividedinto syntactic (color; shape; and texture) and semantic (meaningful real word object orconcept) features; necessitate novel querying techniques. Most image systems andprototypes have focussed on similarity searches based upon the syntactic features. In theDISIMA system; we proposed an object-oriented image data model that introduces two maintypes: image (that represents an image and its descriptive properties) and salient object (thatrepresents the semantics of an image). We further defined operations on the images and thesalient objects as new joins. This approach is necessary in order to envision a declarativequery language for images.

Indexing XML Documents: Improving the BUS Method.,Vincent Oria; Amit Shah; Samuel Sowell,Abstract In this paper we propose an indexing method for XML documents that improves theBUS method. The main difficulty in indexing XML documents is that the index mustaccommodate two different worlds that XML brings together: database and informationretrieval. In the database world; indexing is based on the data structure; while indexing ininformation retrieval is based on the text content. One of the original XML document indexingmethods is the Bottom Up Scheme (BUS). This method was then modified to create a bettermechanism for updating structured documents. Despite the significant improvements madeto the Bottom Up Scheme; the experiment still indicated a 240% storage overhead; indexingtime of 4 hours and 43 minutes for 250 MB of documents; and query times as long as 6.46seconds. The solution to minimizing the overhead introduced by the indexing is to reduce …,Multimedia Information Systems,2001,5
Efficient algorithms for similarity search in axis-aligned subspaces,Michael E Houle; Xiguo Ma; Vincent Oria; Jichao Sun,Abstract Many applications—such as content-based image retrieval; subspace clustering;and feature selection—may benefit from efficient subspace similarity search. Given a queryobject; the goal of subspace similarity search is to retrieve the most similar objects from thedatabase; where the similarity distance is defined over an arbitrary subset of dimensions (orfeatures)—that is; an arbitrary axis-aligned projective subspace. Though much effort hasbeen spent on similarity search in fixed subspaces; relatively little attention has been givento the problem of similarity search when the dimensions are specified at query time. In thispaper; we propose several new methods for the subspace similarity search problem.Extensive experiments are provided showing very competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art solutions.,International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications,2014,4
Improving the quality of K-NN graphs for image databases through vector sparsification,Michael E Houle; Xiguo Ma; Vincent Oria; Jichao Sun,Abstract Neighborhood graphs are an essential component of many established methods forcontent-based image retrieval and automated image annotation. The performance of suchmethods relies heavily on the semantic quality of the graphs; which can be measured as theproportion of neighbors sharing the same class label as their query images.

Supplementing virtual documents with just-in-time hypermedia functionality,Li Zhang; Michael Bieber; Min Song; Vincent Oria; David E Millard,Abstract Digital library systems and other analytic or computational applications createdocuments and display screens in response to user queries “dynamically” or in “real time.”These “virtual documents” do not exist in advance; and thus hypermedia features (links;comments; and bookmark anchors) must be generated “just in time”—automatically anddynamically. In addition; accessing the hypermedia features may cause target documents tobe generated or re-generated. This article describes the specific challenges for virtualdocuments and dynamic hypermedia functionality: dynamic regeneration; and dynamicanchor re-identification and re-location.

Defining views in an image database system,Vincent Oria; M Tamer Özsu; Duane Szafron; Paul J Iglinski,Abstract A view mechanism can help handle the complex semantics in emerging applicationareas such as image databases. This paper presents the view mechanism we defined forthe DISIMA image database system. Since DISIMA is being developed on top of an object-oriented database system; we first propose a powerful object-oriented view mechanismbased on the separation between types (interface functions) and classes that manageobjects of the same type. The image view mechanism uses our object-oriented viewmechanism to allow us to give different semantics to the same image. The solution is basedon the distinction between physical salient objects which are interesting objects in an imageand logical salient objects which are the meanings of these objects.,*,1999,4
An interactive multi-instrument database of solar flares,Viacheslav M Sadykov; Alexander G Kosovichev; Vincent Oria; Gelu M Nita,Abstract Solar flares are complicated physical phenomena that are observable in a broadrange of the electromagnetic spectrum; from radio waves to γ-rays. For a morecomprehensive understanding of flares; it is necessary to perform a combined multi-wavelength analysis using observations from many satellites and ground-basedobservatories.

Efficient similarity search within user-specified projective subspaces,Michael E Houle; Xiguo Ma; Vincent Oria; Jichao Sun,Abstract Many applications—such as content-based image retrieval; subspace clustering;and feature selection—may benefit from efficient subspace similarity search. Given a queryobject; the goal of subspace similarity search is to retrieve the most similar objects from thedatabase; where the similarity distance is defined over an arbitrary subset of dimensions (orfeatures)—that is; an arbitrary axis-aligned projective subspace—specified along with thequery. Though much effort has been spent on similarity search in fixed subspaces; relativelylittle attention has been given to the problem of similarity search when the dimensions arespecified at query time. In this paper; we propose new methods for the subspace similaritysearch problem for real-valued data. Extensive experiments are provided showing verycompetitive performance relative to state-of-the-art solutions.,Information Systems,2016,3
Effective and efficient algorithms for flexible aggregate similarity search in high dimensional spaces,Michael E Houle; Xiguo Ma; Vincent Oria,Numerous applications in different fields; such as spatial databases; multimedia databases;data mining; and recommender systems; may benefit from efficient and effective aggregatesimilarity search; also known as aggregate nearest neighbor (AggNN) search. Given agroup of query objects Q; the goal of AggNN is to retrieve the k most similar objects from thedatabase; where the underlying similarity measure is defined as an aggregation (usuallysum or max) of the distances between the retrieved objects and every query object in Q.Recently; the problem was generalized so as to retrieve the k objects which are most similarto a fixed proportion of the elements of Q. This variant of aggregate similarity search isreferred to as “flexible AggNN”; or FANN.

Views or Points of View on Images,Vincent Oria; M TAMER ÖZSU,Images like other multimedia data need to be described as it is difficult to grasp theirsemantics from the raw data. With the emergence of standards like MPEG-7; multimediadata will be increasingly produced together with some semantic descriptors. But adescription of a multimedia data is just an interpretation; a point of view on the data anddifferent interpretations can exist for the same multimedia data. In this paper we explore theuse of view techniques to define and manage different points of view on images. Views havebeen widely used in relational database management systems to extend modelingcapabilities; and to provide logical data independence. Since our image model is defined onan object-oriented model; we will first propose a powerful object-oriented mechanism basedon the distinction between class and type.

Spatial Database Querying with Logic Languages.,Jean-Pierre Cheiney; Vincent Oria,Abstract Several di erent data structures; generally grouped in Raster and Vectorsrepresentation models; are used to store images and all kinds of spatial data. One solution;for a spatial data manipulation language to be independent of the storage model; is to basethe language on the spatial relations of objects (ie the positions of objects relative to eachother). This paper proposes a logic intermediate language allowing a declarative querying.We show that this language can be easily computed by a procedural execution using asmall set of operators. This language enables expression of direction and topological spatialrelations and ensures a physical data independence and the processing can bene t fromspatial access methods. The language is composed of two complementary sub-languages.The rst one uses an object approximate and results in the selection of a set of candidate …,DASFAA,1995,3
Query expansion for content-based similarity search using local and global features,Michael E Houle; Xiguo Ma; Vincent Oria; Jichao Sun,Abstract This article presents an efficient and totally unsupervised content-based similaritysearch method for multimedia data objects represented by high-dimensional feature vectors.The assumption is that the similarity measure is applicable to feature vectors of arbitrarylength. During the offline process; different sets of features are selected by a generalizedversion of the Laplacian Score in an unsupervised way for individual data objects in thedatabase. Online retrieval is performed by ranking the query object in the feature spaces ofcandidate objects. Those candidates for which the query object is ranked highly are selectedas the query results. The ranking scheme is incorporated into an automated queryexpansion framework to further improve the semantic quality of the search result. Extensiveexperiments were conducted on several datasets to show the capability of the proposed …,ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing; Communications; and Applications (TOMM),2017,2
Improving the quality of K-NN graphs through vector sparsification: application to image databases,Michael E Houle; Xiguo Ma; Vincent Oria; Jichao Sun,Abstract K K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) graphs are an essential component of manyestablished methods for content-based image retrieval and automated image annotation.The performance of such methods relies heavily on the semantic quality of the graphs; whichcan be measured as the proportion of neighbors sharing the same class label as their queryimages. Due to the noise in image features; the K-NN graphs produced by existing methodsmay suffer from low semantic quality.

Editorial preface: special issue on multimedia data annotation and retrieval using web 2.0,Richard Chbeir; Vincent Oria,Currently; more than 80% of the information exchanged on the Web carry personal data andare primarily of multimedia nature (video; audio; images; etc.). Two main reasons are behindthis phenomenon: 1) each of the major players on the Internet (individual users; companies;local and/or regional authorities; etc.) is both data producer and data consumer at the sametime; and 2) the use of various tools of Web 2.0 (blogs; social networks; etc.) allows to easesharing; accessing; and publishing information on the Web. While such tools provide usersmany easy-to-use functionalities; several issues; however; remain unaddressed.

Evaluation of queries on tree-structured data using dimension graphs,Theodore Dalamagas; A Koufopoulos; D Theodoratos; Vincent Oria,The recent proliferation of XML-based standards and technologies for managing data on theWeb demonstrates the need for effective and efficient management of tree-structured data.Querying tree-structured data is a challenging issue due to the diversity of the structuralaspect in the same or in different trees. In this paper; we show how to evaluate queries ontree-structured data; called value trees. The formulation of these queries does not dependon the structure of a particular value tree. Our approach exploits semantic informationprovided by dimension graphs. Dimension graphs are semantically rich constructs thatabstract the structural information of the value trees. We show how dimension graphs can beused to query efficiently value trees in the presence of structural differences andirregularities. Value trees and their dimension graphs are represented as XML documents …,Database Engineering and Application Symposium; 2005. IDEAS 2005. 9th International,2005,2
A Framework for Multimedia Database Systems,Vincent Oria; Paul J Iglinski; M Tamer Ozsu,Abstract This paper discusses a general framework for multimedia DBMSs. We use our twoongoing multimedia projects (a SGML/HyTime DBMS and an image DBMS) as examples tosupport the general framework. Although multimedia data (text; sound; image; video andanimation) are di erent in terms of their processing; similarities exist in the ways to handlethese data. They all are big with complex structures and semantics. The semantics have tobe extracted; stored; and indexed to allow content-based queries.,4th African Conference on Research in Computer Science; Dakar; Senegal,1998,2
Improving k-NN graph accuracy using local intrinsic dimensionality,Michael E Houle; Vincent Oria; Arwa M Wali,Abstract The k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) graph is an important data structure for many datamining and machine learning applications. The accuracy of k-NN graphs depends on theobject feature vectors; which are usually represented in high-dimensional spaces. Selectingthe most important features is essential for providing compact object representations and forimproving the graph accuracy. Having a compact feature vector can reduce the storagespace and the computational complexity of search and learning tasks. In this paper; wepropose NNWID-Descent; a similarity graph construction method that utilizes the NNF-Descent framework while integrating a new feature selection criterion; Support-WeightedIntrinsic Dimensionality; that estimates the contribution of each feature to the overall intrinsicdimensionality. Through extensive experiments on various datasets; we show that …,International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications,2017,1

A selective publication model for the web: the webograph approach,Vincent Oria; Trung Tien Phan Quang; Jean-Marc Saglio,We believe that the most important architectural features for the next generation webpublishing systems will certainly be a semantic classification and a selective access toinformation. As the web is becoming the leading publication channel; the publishing systemsshould allow publishers to more effectively control the access to the information to bepresented to the readers. The current'share with all or share with friends only'model islimited; even when the access is restricted with a password; and is far from the way peopleshare information in real life: what is said in private is not always what is said in public andwhat is referred to as public can further be categorised.

Caching has been a usefultechnique for reducing stress on limited resources and improving response time. In thispaper; we propose an'active caching'technique for recommender systems based on a partialorder approach that not only benefits from popularity and temporal locality; but also exploitsspatial locality. This approach allows the processing of answers to neighboring non-cachedqueries in addition to the reporting of cached query results. Test results for several data setsand recommendation techniques show substantial improvement in the cache hit ratio andcomputational costs; while achieving reasonable recall rates.,Proceedings of the third ACM conference on Recommender systems,2009,1

The COSIN alsoincorporates a set of tools to evaluate retrieval performance so researchers can exploredifferent retrieval schemes and parameters (eg recall; precision). The COSIN utilizes a suiteof techniques to detect cover songs including: Pitch+ Dynamic Programming (DP); Chroma+DP; and Semantic Feature Summarization (SFS)+ Hash-Based Approximate Matching(HBAM).

A meta-index to integrate specific indexes: application to multimedia,Ilaria Bartolini; Paolo Ciaccia; Lei Chen; Vincent Oria,Abstract Although applications such as news; e-learning; ecommerce require multimediadata of different types to coexist; data for each media type are often managed separatelybecause technically they do not have much in common. The common approach for providingthe user with an integrated multimedia database is to build an application layer that presentsa unified interface and deals with the right mono-medium sub-system depending on the userrequest. The problem is that this approach does not fully integrate the underlying systems.Another solution is to push the integration into the query processor. This second approachnecessitates to have access to the query processor which is not always possible especially ifthe multimedia system is using a commercial DBMS underneath. In this paper; we propose ameta-index that hosts different specific indexes and integrates the sub-query results to be …,12th International Conference on Distributed Multimedia Systems (DMS 2006),2006,1

Flexible Aggregate Similarity Search in High-Dimensional Data Sets,Michael E Houle; Xiguo Ma; Vincent Oria,Abstract Numerous applications in different fields; such as spatial databases; multimediadatabases; data mining and recommender systems; may benefit from efficient and effectiveaggregate similarity search; also known as aggregate nearest neighbor (AggNN) search.Given a group of query objects Q; the goal of AggNN is to retrieve the k most similar objectsfrom the database; where the underlying similarity measure is defined as an aggregation(usually sum; avg or max) of the distances between the retrieved objects and every queryobject in Q. Recently; the problem was generalized so as to retrieve the k objects which aremost similar to a fixed proportion of the elements of Q. This variant of aggregate similaritysearch is referred to as 'flexible AggNN'; or FANN. In this work; we propose twoapproximation algorithms; one for the sum and avg variants of FANN; and the other for the …,International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications,2015,*
Dimensionality and Scalability II: Hands-On Intrinsic Dimensionality,Laurent Amsaleg; Michael E Houle; Vincent Oria; Arthur Zimek,Background For many fundamental operations in the areas of search and retrieval; datamining; machine learning; multimedia; recommendation systems; and bioinformatics; theefficiency and effectiveness of implementations depends crucially on the interplay betweenmeasures of data similarity and the features by which data objects are represented. Whenthe number of features (the data dimensionality) is high; similarity values tend to concentratestrongly about their means; a phenomenon commonly referred to as the curse ofdimensionality. As the dimensionality increases; the discriminative ability of similaritymeasures diminishes to the point where methods that depend on them lose theireffectiveness. The effects of the curse of dimensionality on searching/clustering methods arewell known and well documented.,*,2015,*

2D geon based generic object recognition,Xiangqian Yu; Vincent Oria; Pierre Gouton; Geneviève Jomier,Abstract The Recognition by Components (RBC) is a theory in Psychology introduced byBiederman in the late 80s; by which humans perceive scenes through simple 3D objectswith regular shapes such as spheres; cubes; cylinders; cones; or wedges; called Geons(geometric ions). Extracting geons from 2D images is a very challenging task as it requires agood segmentation and the recognition of the 3D geons in a 2D space. In this paper; wepropose a novel approach for extracting 2D geons from 2D images. The process iscomposed of three major parts: image preprocessing which includes image backgroundremoval and segmentation; arc-geon detection; and polygon-geon detection. We alsopropose a general procedure for matching the extracted 2D geons to given models for objectrecognition. Experiment results show that our approach is competitive compared to …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Multimedia,2011,*
Indexing in-Networks Trajectorys Flows,Dominique Barth; Sandrine Vial; Iulian Sandu Popa; Karine Zeitouni; Vincent Oria,Indexing moving objects (MO) is a hot topic in the field of moving objects databases sincemany years. An impressive number of access methods have been proposed to optimize theprocessing of MO-related queries. Several methods have focused on spatio-temporal rangequeries; which represent the foundation of MO trajectory queries. Surprisingly; only a few ofthem consider that the objects movements are constrained. This is an important aspect forseveral reasons ranging from better capturing the relationship between the trajectory andthe network space to more accurate trajectory representation with lower storagerequirements. In this paper; we propose T-PARINET; an access method to efficiently retrievethe trajectories of objects moving in networks. T-PARINET is designed for continuousindexing of trajectory data flows. The cornerstone of T-PARINET is PARINET; an efficient …,The VLDB Journal,2011,*

Les objetsspatiaux sont de grande taille et on préfère souvent opérer le traitement des requêtesd'abord sur des approximations afin de réduire l'ensemble des objets avant de leurappliquer les opérateurs spatiaux. Nous avons proposé un langage intermédiaire composéde deux sous-langages complémentaires; permettant le calcul des requêtes spatialessuivant les deux étapes.

Aspublishing on the Web is becoming the leading channel; the publishing systems shouldallow the publisher to more effectively control the access to the information that is beingpresented to the readers. The current “share to all or share with friends only” model is limitedeven when the access is restricted with a password; and very far from the way people shareinformation in real life: What is said in private is not always what is said in public and what isreferred to as public can further be categorized.

Interactive Multi-Instrument Database of Solar Flares View all abstracts by submitter,Viacheslav M Sadykov; Rishabh Gupta; Alexander G Kosovichev; Vincent Oria; Gelu M Nita,Solar flares represent a complicated physical phenomenon observed in a broad range of theelectromagnetic spectrum; from radiowaves to gamma-rays. For a complete understandingof the flares it is necessary to perform a combined multi-wavelength analysis usingobservations from many satellites and ground-based observatories. For efficient datasearch; integration of different flare lists and representation of observational data; we havedeveloped the Interactive Multi-Instrument Database of Solar Flares (https://solarflare. njit.edu/). The web database if fully functional and allows the user to search for uniquely-identified flare events based on their physical descriptors and availability of observations ofa particular set of instruments. Currently the data from three primary flare lists (GOES;RHESSI and HEK) and a variety of other event catalogs (Hinode; Fermi GBM; Konus …,*,*,*
Multimedia Databases,Eric Scharff,Abstract Applications that require multimedia information tend to use extremely largequantities of data. Traditional databases; which are designed for queries over vast amountsof information; would seem to be ideal for managing multimedia resources. However;because of the radically different ways in which multimedia information must be processed;simply using standard relational systems provides insufficient support. Although Object-Oriented and Object-Relational systems are superior in their ability to handle multimediacontent; additional support will be necessary to address the unique needs of multimediaapplications. This paper discusses some of the motivating needs of Multimedia Databases;the strengths and weaknesses of current products; and why new products will need tosupport more than current object-based technologies.,*,*,*

14 DEFINING VIEWS IN AN IMAGE DATABASE SYSTEM,Vincent Oria; M Tamer Ozsu; Duane Szafron; Paul J Iglinski,Abstract: A view mechanism can help handle the complex semantics in emergingapplication areas such as image databases. This paper presents the view mechanism we dened for the DISIMA image database system. Since DISIMA is being developed on top of anobject-oriented database system; we rst propose a powerful object-oriented viewmechanism based on the separation between types (interface functions) and classes thatmanage objects of the same type. The image view mechanism uses our object-oriented viewmechanism to allow us to give di erent semantics to the same image. The solution is basedon the distinction between physical salient objects which are interesting objects in an imageand logical salient objects which are the meanings of these objects.,*,*,*

A La Carte: A Web-Based Benchmark for Spatial Database Joins,Vincent Oria,Abstract Spatial joins are join operations that involve spatial data types and operators.Spatial access methods are often used to speed up the computation of spatial joins. Thispaper addresses the issue of benchmarking spatial join operations. For this purpose; we rstpresent a WWW-based benchmark generator to produce sets of rectangles. Using a Webbrowser; experimenters can specify the number of rectangles in a sample; as well as thestatistical distributions of their sizes; shapes; and locations. Second; using the generator anda wellde ned set of statistical models we de ne several tests to compare the performance ofthree spatial join algorithms: nested loop; scan-and-index; and synchronized tree traversal.We also added a real-life data set from the Sequoia 2000 storage benchmark. Our resultsshow that the relative performance of the di erent techniques mainly depends on the …,*,*,*
DISIMA Distributed Image Database System: Experiences and Reflections£,M Tamer Ozsu; Vincent Oria; Paul J Iglinski,Abstract DISIMA (Distributed Image Database Management System) is a research projectunder development at the University of Alberta that explores:(i) the development of an object-oriented DBMS kernel that provides flexibility for user-defined classification of images;supports feature-based and spatial querying over image content; and enables reasoningover spatial relationships for query optimization;(ii) the development of query languages andprimitives for querying image databases; and (iii) the provision of scalability and openaccess to image repositories. A prototype system is implemented. This paper presents anoverview of the project and reflects on our development experiences in the context of ourrelated research.,*,*,*
