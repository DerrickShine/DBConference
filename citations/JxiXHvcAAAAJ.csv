Gene selection via discretized gene-expression profiles and greedy feature-elimination,George Potamias; Lefteris Koumakis; Vassilis Moustakis,Abstract Analysis and interpretation of gene-expression profiles; and the identification ofrespective molecular-or; gene-markers is the key towards the understanding of the geneticbasis of major diseases. The problem is challenging because of the huge number of genes(thousands to tenths of thousands!) and the small number of samples (about 50 to 100cases). In this paper we present a novel gene-selection methodology; based on thediscretization of the continuous gene-expression values. With a specially devised gene-ranking metric we measure the strength of each gene with respect to its power todiscriminate between sample categories. Then; a greedy feature-elimination algorithm isapplied on the rank-ordered genes to form the final set of selected genes. Unseen samplesare classified according to a specially devised prediction/matching metric. The …,Hellenic Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2004,47
Modeling susceptibility to periodontitis,ML Laine; V Moustakis; L Koumakis; G Potamias; BG Loos,Chronic inflammatory diseases like periodontitis have a complex pathogenesis and amultifactorial etiology; involving complex interactions between multiple genetic loci andinfectious agents. We aimed to investigate the influence of genetic polymorphisms andbacteria on chronic periodontitis risk. We determined the prevalence of 12 single-nucleotidepolymorphisms (SNPs) in immune response candidate genes and 7 bacterial species ofpotential relevance to periodontitis etiology; in chronic periodontitis patients and non-periodontitis control individuals (N= 385). Using decision tree analysis; we identified thepresence of bacterial species Tannerella forsythia; Porphyromonas gingivali s;Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; and SNPs TNF-857 and IL-1A-889 asdiscriminators between periodontitis and non-periodontitis.

A systematic review of predictive risk models for diabetes complications based on large scale clinical studies,Vincenzo Lagani; Lefteris Koumakis; Franco Chiarugi; Edin Lakasing; Ioannis Tsamardinos,Abstract This work presents a systematic review of long-term risk assessment models forevaluating the probability of developing complications in diabetes patients. Diabetesmellitus can cause many complications if not adequately controlled; risk assessment modelscan help physicians and patients in identifying the complications most likely to arise and intaking the necessary countermeasures. We identified six large medical studies related todiabetes mellitus upon which current available risk assessment models are built on; allthese studies had duration over 5years and most of them included some commondemographic and clinical data strongly related to diabetic complications. The most commonpredictions for long term diabetes complications are related to cardiovascular diseases anddiabetic retinopathy. Our analysis of the literature led us to the conclusion that …,Journal of Diabetes and its Complications,2013,33

Enhancing web based services by coupling document classification with user profile,George Potamias; Lefteris Koumakis; Vassilis S Moustakis,Current Web search engines are not able to adapt their operations to the evolving needs;interests and preferences of the users. To cope with this weakness; we developed a systemable to classify HTML (or; XML) documents into user prespecified categories of interests.The system processes the user current profile and a set of representative documents-foreach category of interest; and produces a classification schema-presented as a set ofrepresentative category vectors. The classification schema is then utilized in order to classifynew incoming Web documents to one (or; more) of the prespecified categories of interestand; furthermore; provides the basis to update user profile characteristics.

To our knowledge; this is the first microarray study in Greeceinvolving clinical samples. We identified 97 genes that are characteristic for ER status andcan well distinguish the ER+ from the ER− samples. We shrank our list to a 11-gene listcorrelating to the same patient ER status. We found a significant overlap of these genes withpublished ER status characteristic signatures like the ones of West et. al.[1] and of Van't Veeret. al.[2]. This fact is very important given the minimal overlap of such genes reported byothers [3]. In order to obtain a molecular insight into how the expression of estrogen receptoractivates cancer cells; we found associations with biological pathways.

Towards the discovery of reliable biomarkers from gene-expression profiles: an iterative constraint satisfaction learning approach,George Potamias; Lefteris Koumakis; Alexandros Kanterakis; Vassilis Moustakis,Abstract The article demonstrates the use of Multiple Iterative Constraint SatisfactionLearning (MICSL) process in inducing gene-markers from microarray gene-expressionprofiles. MICSL adopts a supervised learning from examples framework and proceeds byoptimizing an evolving zero-one optimization model with constraints. After a datadiscretization pre-processing step; each example sample is transformed into acorresponding constraint. Extra constraints are added to guarantee mutual-exclusivenessbetween gene (feature) and assigned phenotype (class) values. The objective functioncorresponds to the learning outcome and strives to minimize use of genes by following aniterative constraint-satisfaction mode that finds solutions of increasing complexity. Standard(c4. 5-like) pruning and rule-simplification processes are also incorporated. MICSL is …,Hellenic Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2010,1
Web Services Automation,L Koumakis; V Moustakis; G Potamias,Abstract Web services revolutionize use of information systems and to some extentacademic research.

The effect of CTCF transcription factor on lung cancer functional pathways,Xanthoula Atsalaki; Lefteris Koumakis; George Potamias; Manolis Tsiknakis,Abstract—High-throughput technologies; such as ChIP-seq; have made the collection ofgenome-wide data in cells; tissues and model organisms easier and cheaper. The wealth ofinformation allow one to investigate biological aspects of cell functionality and to betterunderstand previously unexplored disease etiologies but it is now more difficult than ever forbiologists to carry on data integration. Systems biology tries to formulate the molecularmechanisms in mathematical models and gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are one of themajor categories.. A GRN is a collection of DNA segments in a cell that interact with eachother (in-directly through their RNA and protein expression products) and with othersubstances in the cell; thereby governing the rates that genes in the network are transcribedinto mRNA. GRNs knowledge; as it relates to specific phenotype; necessarily implies that …,*,*,*
