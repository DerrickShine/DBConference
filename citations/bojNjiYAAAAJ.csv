Fast dynamic clustering SOAP messages based compression and aggregation model for enhanced performance of Web services,Ahmed Mohammed Abbas; Azuraliza Abu Bakar; Mohd Zakree Ahmad,Abstract The Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is a basic communication protocol inWeb services; which is based on eXtensible Markup Language (XML). SOAP could sufferfrom high latency and bottlenecks that might occur due to the high network traffic caused bythe large number of client requests and the large size of XML Web messages. Previousworks have proposed static and dynamic clustering models for SOAP messages to supportcompression based aggregation tool that could potentially reduce the overall size of SOAPmessages in order to reduce the required bandwidth between the clients and their serverand increase the performance of Web services. In this paper; dynamic clustering basedaggregation model has been implemented based on Term Frequency-Inverse DocumentFrequency (TF-IDF) and Euclidean Distance methods for estimating the high degree of …,Journal of Network and Computer Applications,2014,7

A Framework for Clustering and Dynamic Maintenance of XML Documents,Ahmed Al-Shammari; Chengfei Liu; Mehdi Naseriparsa; Bao Quoc Vo; Tarique Anwar; Rui Zhou,Abstract Web data clustering has been widely studied in the data mining communities.However; dynamic maintenance of the web data clusters is still a challenging task. In thispaper; we propose a novel framework called XClusterMaint which serves for both clusteringand maintenance of the XML documents. For clustering; we take both structure and contentinto account and propose an efficient solution for grouping the documents based on thecombination of structure and content similarity. For maintenance; we propose an incrementalapproach for maintaining the existing clusters dynamically when we receive new incomingXML documents. Since the dynamic maintenance of the clusters is computationallyexpensive; we also propose an improved approach which uses a lazy maintenance schemeto improve the performance of the clusters maintenance. The experimental results on real …,International Conference on Advanced Data Mining and Applications,2017,*
