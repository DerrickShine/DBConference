Distal substitutions drive divergent DNA specificity among paralogous transcription factors through subdivision of conformational space,William H Hudson; Bradley R Kossmann; Ian Mitchelle S de Vera; Shih-Wei Chuo; Emily R Weikum; Geeta N Eick; Joseph W Thornton; Ivaylo N Ivanov; Douglas J Kojetin; Eric A Ortlund,Abstract Many genomes contain families of paralogs—proteins with divergent function thatevolved from a common ancestral gene after a duplication event. To understand howparalogous transcription factors evolve divergent DNA specificities; we examined how theglucocorticoid receptor and its paralogs evolved to bind activating response elements [(+)GREs] and negative glucocorticoid response elements (nGREs). We show that binding tonGREs is a property of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) DNA-binding domain (DBD) notshared by other members of the steroid receptor family. Using phylogenetic; structural;biochemical; and molecular dynamics techniques; we show that the ancestral DBD fromwhich GR and its paralogs evolved was capable of binding both nGRE and (+) GREsequences because of the ancestral DBD's ability to assume multiple DNA-bound …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2016,9
Secondary interaction interfaces with PCNA control conformational switching of DNA polymerase PolB from polymerization to editing,Xiaojun Xu; Chunli Yan; Bradley R Kossmann; Ivaylo Ivanov,Replicative DNA polymerases (Pols) frequently possess two distinct DNA processingactivities: DNA synthesis (polymerization) and proofreading (3′–5′ exonuclease activity).The polymerase and exonuclease reactions are performed alternately and are spatiallyseparated in different protein domains. Thus; the growing DNA primer terminus has toundergo dynamic conformational switching between two distinct functional sites on thepolymerase. Furthermore; the transition from polymerization (pol) mode to exonuclease(exo) mode must occur in the context of a DNA Pol holoenzyme; wherein the polymerase isphysically associated with processivity factor p roliferating c ell n uclear a ntigen (PCNA) andprimer–template DNA. The mechanism of this conformational switching and the role thatPCNA plays in it have remained obscure; largely due to the dynamic nature of ternary Pol …,The Journal of Physical Chemistry B,2016,7
Discovery of selective inhibitors of tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 by targeting the enzyme DNA-binding cleft,Bradley R Kossmann; Monica Abdelmalak; Sophia Lopez; Gabrielle Tender; Chunli Yan; Yves Pommier; Christophe Marchand; Ivaylo Ivanov,Abstract Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (TDP2) processes protein/DNA adductsresulting from abortive DNA topoisomerase II (Top2) activity. TDP2 inhibition could providesynergism with the Top2 poison class of chemotherapeutics. By virtual screening of the NCIdiversity small molecule database; we identified selective TDP2 inhibitors andexperimentally verified their selective inhibitory activity. Three inhibitors exhibited low-micromolar IC 50 values. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed a common bindingmode for these inhibitors; involving association to the TDP2 DNA-binding cleft. MM-PBSAper-residue energy decomposition identified important interactions of the compounds withspecific TDP2 residues. These interactions could provide new avenues for syntheticoptimization of these scaffolds.,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters,2016,4
Unexpected Allosteric Network Contributes to LRH-1 Co-regulator Selectivity,Paul M Musille; Bradley R Kossmann; Jeffrey A Kohn; Ivaylo Ivanov; Eric A Ortlund,Abstract Phospholipids (PLs) are unusual signaling hormones sensed by the nuclearreceptor liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1); which has evolved a novel allosteric pathway tosupport appropriate interaction with co-regulators depending on ligand status. LRH-1 playsan important role in controlling lipid and cholesterol homeostasis and is a potential target forthe treatment of metabolic and neoplastic diseases. Although the prospect of modulatingLRH-1 via small molecules is exciting; the molecular mechanism linking PL structure totranscriptional co-regulator preference is unknown. Previous studies showed that binding toan activating PL ligand; such as dilauroylphosphatidylcholine; favors LRH-1's interactionwith transcriptional co-activators to up-regulate gene expression. Both crystallographic andsolution-based structural studies showed that dilauroylphosphatidylcholine binding drives …,Journal of Biological Chemistry,2016,3
Alkylpurine glycosylase D employs DNA sculpting as a strategy to extrude and excise damaged bases,Bradley Kossmann; Ivaylo Ivanov,Alkylpurine glycosylase D (AlkD) exhibits a unique base excision strategy. Instead ofinteracting directly with the lesion; the enzyme engages the non-lesion DNA strand. AlkDinduces flipping of the alkylated and opposing base accompanied by DNA stackcompression. Since this strategy leaves the alkylated base solvent exposed; the means toachieve enzymatic cleavage had remained unclear. We determined a minimum energy pathfor flipping out a 3-methyl adenine by AlkD and computed a potential of mean force alongthis path to delineate the energetics of base extrusion. We show that AlkD acts as a scaffoldto stabilize three distinct DNA conformations; including the final extruded state. These statesare almost equivalent in free energy and separated by low barriers. Thus; AlkD acts bysculpting the global DNA conformation to achieve lesion expulsion from DNA. N …,PLoS computational biology,2014,1
An Allosteric Network in LRH-1 Mediates Phospholipid-Driven Gene Regulation,Jeffrey Kohn; Paul Musille; Bradley Kossmann; Ivaylo Ivanov; Eric Ortlund,Abstract The orphan nuclear receptor (NR) liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) has beenadopted after the discovery that phospholipids (PLs) could bind to its ligand binding pocket(LBP) and drive the regulation of many genes involved in metabolism; steroidogenesis; cellcycle; and the unfolded protein response. The transcription or repression of these genes iscontingent upon the properties of the bound PL: mid-chain phosphatidylcholines such asDLPC are LRH-1 agonists and have antidiabetic effects; while long-chain saturated PCs andPLs with other head groups do not; despite binding to LRH-1. Like other NRs; LRH-1regulates genes via the recruitment of transcriptional coregulators. The PL bound to LRH-1dictates its preference for coactivators or corepressors. Using the combination of X-raycrystallography and molecular dynamics; we have identified an allosteric network that …,The FASEB Journal,2015,*
