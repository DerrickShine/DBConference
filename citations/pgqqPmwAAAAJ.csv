Neural systems responding to degrees of uncertainty in human decision-making,Ming Hsu; Meghana Bhatt; Ralph Adolphs; Daniel Tranel; Colin F Camerer,Much is known about how people make decisions under varying levels of probability (risk).Less is known about the neural basis of decision-making when probabilities are uncertainbecause of missing information (ambiguity). In decision theory; ambiguity about probabilitiesshould not affect choices. Using functional brain imaging; we show that the level ofambiguity in choices correlates positively with activation in the amygdala and orbitofrontalcortex; and negatively with a striatal system. Moreover; striatal activity correlates positivelywith expected reward. Neurological subjects with orbitofrontal lesions were insensitive to thelevel of ambiguity and risk in behavioral choices. These data suggest a general neuralcircuit responding to degrees of uncertainty; contrary to decision theory.,Science,2005,1197
The right and the good: distributive justice and neural encoding of equity and efficiency,Ming Hsu; Cédric Anen; Steven R Quartz,Distributive justice concerns how individuals and societies distribute benefits and burdens ina just or moral manner. We combined distribution choices with functional magneticresonance imaging to investigate the central problem of distributive justice: the trade-offbetween equity and efficiency. We found that the putamen responds to efficiency; whereasthe insula encodes inequity; and the caudate/septal subgenual region encodes a unifiedmeasure of efficiency and inequity (utility). Notably; individual differences in inequityaversion correlate with activity in inequity and utility regions. Against utilitarianism; ourresults support the deontological intuition that a sense of fairness is fundamental todistributive justice but; as suggested by moral sentimentalists; is rooted in emotionalprocessing. More generally; emotional responses related to norm violations may underlie …,science,2008,309
Thinking like a trader selectively reduces individuals' loss aversion,Peter Sokol-Hessner; Ming Hsu; Nina G Curley; Mauricio R Delgado; Colin F Camerer; Elizabeth A Phelps,Abstract Research on emotion regulation has focused upon observers' ability to regulatetheir emotional reaction to stimuli such as affective pictures; but many other aspects of ouraffective experience are also potentially amenable to intentional cognitive regulation. In thedomain of decision-making; recent work has demonstrated a role for emotions in choice;although such work has generally remained agnostic about the specific role of emotion.Combining psychologically-derived cognitive strategies; physiological measurements ofarousal; and an economic model of behavior; this study examined changes in choices(specifically; loss aversion) and physiological correlates of behavior as the result of anintentional cognitive regulation strategy. Participants were on average more aroused perdollar to losses relative to gains; as measured with skin conductance response; and the …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2009,280
The wick in the candle of learning: Epistemic curiosity activates reward circuitry and enhances memory,Min Jeong Kang; Ming Hsu; Ian M Krajbich; George Loewenstein; Samuel M McClure; Joseph Tao-yi Wang; Colin F Camerer,Curiosity has been described as a desire for learning and knowledge; but its underlyingmechanisms are not well understood. We scanned subjects with functional magneticresonance imaging while they read trivia questions. The level of curiosity when readingquestions was correlated with activity in caudate regions previously suggested to beinvolved in anticipated reward. This finding led to a behavioral study; which showed thatsubjects spent more scarce resources (either limited tokens or waiting time) to find outanswers when they were more curious. The functional imaging also showed that curiosityincreased activity in memory areas when subjects guessed incorrectly; which suggests thatcuriosity may enhance memory for surprising new information.

Neural response to reward anticipation under risk is nonlinear in probabilities,Ming Hsu; Ian Krajbich; Chen Zhao; Colin F Camerer,A widely observed phenomenon in decision making under risk is the apparentoverweighting of unlikely events and the underweighting of nearly certain events. Thisviolates standard assumptions in expected utility theory; which requires that expected utilitybe linear (objective) in probabilities. Models such as prospect theory have relaxed thisassumption and introduced the notion of a “probability weighting function;” which capturesthe key properties found in experimental data. This study reports functional magneticresonance imaging (fMRI) data that neural response to expected reward is nonlinear inprobabilities. Specifically; we found that activity in the striatum during valuation of monetarygambles are nonlinear in probabilities in the pattern predicted by prospect theory;suggesting that probability distortion is reflected at the level of the reward encoding …,Journal of Neuroscience,2009,216
Explicit neural signals reflecting reward uncertainty,Wolfram Schultz; Kerstin Preuschoff; Colin Camerer; Ming Hsu; Christopher D Fiorillo; Philippe N Tobler; Peter Bossaerts,The acknowledged importance of uncertainty in economic decision making has stimulatedthe search for neural signals that could influence learning and inform decision mechanisms.Current views distinguish two forms of uncertainty; namely risk and ambiguity; depending onwhether the probability distributions of outcomes are known or unknown. Behaviouralneurophysiological studies on dopamine neurons revealed a risk signal; which covariedwith the standard deviation or variance of the magnitude of juice rewards and occurredseparately from reward value coding. Human imaging studies identified similarly distinct risksignals for monetary rewards in the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC); thus fulfilling arequirement for the mean variance approach of economic decision theory. The orbitofrontalrisk signal covaried with individual risk attitudes; possibly explaining individual …,*,2008,164
Dissociable neural representations of reinforcement and belief prediction errors underlie strategic learning,Lusha Zhu; Kyle E Mathewson; Ming Hsu,Abstract Decision-making in the presence of other competitive intelligent agents isfundamental for social and economic behavior. Such decisions require agents to behavestrategically; where in addition to learning about the rewards and punishments available inthe environment; they also need to anticipate and respond to actions of others competing forthe same rewards. However; whereas we know much about strategic learning at boththeoretical and behavioral levels; we know relatively little about the underlying neuralmechanisms. Here; we show using a multi-strategy competitive learning paradigm thatstrategic choices can be characterized by extending the reinforcement learning (RL)framework to incorporate agents' beliefs about the actions of their opponents. Furthermore;using this characterization to generate putative internal values; we used model-based …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2012,68

It organizes the literature into research that focuses on alternativeutility functions and research that focuses on non-equilibrium models. Generally; behavioralmodels have seen less application to manager decisions than to consumer decisions andtherefore there are many opportunities to develop new theoretical models; new laboratoryexperiments; and new field applications.

The neurobiological foundations of valuation in human decision making under uncertainty,Peter Bossaerts; Kerstin Preuschoff; Ming Hsu,This chapter focuses on valuation in the context of choice under uncertainty. When valuationis a pursuit distinct from choice; values revealed through choice may be different from thevaluations that emerge from the (choice-independent) computations. In many humanendeavors; valuation is performed even in the absence of any immediate necessity tochoose. Again; finance is a case in point; in part because financial valuation is oftencomplex and time-consuming; while good choice opportunities are rare and short-lived. Thecost of computing values provides a normative rationale for why valuation may be done inthe absence of free choice. In fact; the neurobiological choice model predicts choices betterthan a utility-index-based model estimated from the choices themselves. This demonstratesnot only that valuation is done during imperative trials; but that the resulting values are …,*,2009,37
From “where” to “what”: distributed representations of brand associations in the human brain,Yu-Ping Chen; Leif D Nelson; Ming Hsu,Considerable attention has been given to the notion of a set of human-like characteristicsassociated with brands; referred to as “brand personality.” The authors combine newlyavailable machine learning techniques with functional neuroimaging data to characterizethe set of processes that give rise to these associations. The authors show that brandpersonality traits can be captured by the weighted activity across a widely distributed set ofbrain regions previously implicated in reasoning; imagery; and affective processing. That is;as opposed to being constructed through reflective processes; brand personality traits seemto exist a priori inside consumers' minds; such that the authors are able to predict what branda person is thinking about solely on the basis of the relationship between brand personalityassociations and brain activity. These findings represent an important advance in the …,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,26
Divergence; closed cycles and convergence in Scarf environments: Experiments in the dynamics of general equilibrium systems,Masayoshi Hirota; Ming Hsu; Charles R Plott; Brian W Rogers,Previous experimental work has demonstrated the power of the classical theory of economicdynamics. In particular; the models have proved to be accurate in predicting the principledirections of movement and orbit-like behavior in general equilibrium systems. Questions leftopen and addressed in this study are (i) do the markets necessarily converge to a uniqueinterior equilibrium or can markets exhibit the “explosive property” of instability and (ii)among the several variations of the classical model; which; if any; is most accurate inpredicting what is actually observed in experiments? Markets were created and studied inthe extreme environments identified by Scarf and Hirota. Such environments allow us tostudy features of market adjustments that are obscured by the complexity of naturallyoccurring markets. Two fundamental results are reported.

The high availability of extreme events serves resource-rational decision-making,Falk Lieder; Ming Hsu; Thomas L Griffiths,Abstract Extreme events come to mind very easily and people overestimate their probabilityand overweight them in decisionmaking. In this paper we show that rational use of limitedcognitive resources can generate these'availability biases.'We hypothesize that availabilityhelps people to quickly make good decisions in very risky situations. Our analysis showsthat agents who decide by simulating a finite number of possible outcomes (sampling)should over-sample outcomes with extreme utility. We derive a cognitive strategy withconnections to fast-and-frugal heuristics; and we experimentally confirm its prediction that anevent's extremity increases the factor by which people overestimate its frequency. Our modelalso explains three context effects in decision-making under risk: framing effects; the Allaisparadox; and preference reversals.,Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society,2014,21
Dopamine modulates egalitarian behavior in humans,Ignacio Sáez; Lusha Zhu; Eric Set; Andrew Kayser; Ming Hsu,Summary Egalitarian motives form a powerful force in promoting prosocial behavior andenabling large-scale cooperation in the human species [1]. At the neural level; there issubstantial; albeit correlational; evidence suggesting a link between dopamine and suchbehavior [2; 3]. However; important questions remain about the specific role of dopamine insetting or modulating behavioral sensitivity to prosocial concerns. Here; using a combinationof pharmacological tools and economic games; we provide critical evidence for a causalinvolvement of dopamine in human egalitarian tendencies. Specifically; using the brainpenetrant catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor tolcapone [4; 5]; we investigatedthe causal relationship between dopaminergic mechanisms and two prosocial concerns atthe core of a number of widely used economic games:(1) the extent to which individuals …,Current Biology,2015,19
Damage to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex affects tradeoffs between honesty and self-interest,Lusha Zhu; Adrianna C Jenkins; Eric Set; Donatella Scabini; Robert T Knight; Pearl H Chiu; Brooks King-Casas; Ming Hsu,Abstract Substantial correlational evidence suggests that prefrontal regions are critical tohonest and dishonest behavior; but causal evidence specifying the nature of thisinvolvement remains absent. We found that lesions of the human dorsolateral prefrontalcortex (DLPFC) decreased the effect of honesty concerns on behavior in economic gamesthat pit honesty motives against self-interest; but did not affect decisions when honestyconcerns were absent. These results point to a causal role for DLPFC in honest behavior.,Nature neuroscience,2014,18

Dopamine-system genes and cultural acquisition: the norm sensitivity hypothesis,Shinobu Kitayama; Anthony King; Ming Hsu; Israel Liberzon; Carolyn Yoon,Previous research in cultural psychology shows that cultures vary in the social orientationsof independence and interdependence. To date; however; little is known about how peoplemay acquire such global patterns of cultural behavior or cultural norms. Nor is it clear whatgenetic mechanisms may underlie the acquisition of cultural norms. Here; we draw on recentevidence for certain genetic variability in the susceptibility to environmental influences andpropose the norm sensitivity hypothesis; which holds that people acquire culture; and rulesof cultural behaviors; through reinforcement-mediated social learning processes. Onecorollary of the hypothesis is that the degree of cultural acquisition should be influenced bypolymorphic variants of genes involved in dopaminergic neural pathways; which have beenwidely implicated in reinforcement learning.

Ambiguity-aversion in the Brain,Ming Hsu; Colin F Camerer,The distinction between “ambiguity” on the one hand; the “risk” on the other; has been a longstanding one in both economics; statistics; and probability theory. The former refers tosituations where the decision-maker can assign numerical probabilities to the states at hand;the latter to situations when the various states of nature cannot be expressed in terms of“objective” probabilities. This is also the problem of multiple prior distributions in statistics;especially Bayesian and neo-Bayesian methods. Indeed; Bayesian methods have oftenbeen criticized on grounds that they does not provide an intuitively appealing method tohandle non-unique prior distributions 1. There are many; however; who think the distinctionto be more heat than light—that ambiguity doesn't matter—that is; holding beliefs constant;the amount of evidence used to form the belief is (or should be) irrelevant.

Financial errors in dementia: Testing a neuroeconomic conceptual framework,Winston Chiong; Ming Hsu; Danny Wudka; Bruce L Miller; Howard J Rosen,Financial errors by patients with dementia can have devastating personal and familyconsequences. We developed and evaluated a neuroeconomic conceptual framework forunderstanding financial errors across different dementia syndromes; using a systematic;retrospective; blinded chart review of demographically-balanced cohorts of patients withAlzheimer's disease (AD; n= 100) and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD;n= 50). Reviewers recorded specific reports of financial errors according to a conceptualframework identifying patient cognitive and affective characteristics; and contextualinfluences; conferring susceptibility to each error. Specific financial errors were reported for49% of AD and 70% of bvFTD patients (p= 0.012).

Overrepresentation of extreme events in decision making reflects rational use of cognitive resources.,Falk Lieder; Thomas L Griffiths; Ming Hsu,Abstract People's decisions and judgments are disproportionately swayed by improbablebut extreme eventualities; such as terrorism; that come to mind easily. This article exploreswhether such availability biases can be reconciled with rational information processing bytaking into account the fact that decision makers value their time and have limited cognitiveresources. Our analysis suggests that to make optimal use of their finite time decisionmakers should overrepresent the most important potential consequences relative to lessimportant; put potentially more probable; outcomes. To evaluate this account; we derive andtest a model we call utility-weighted sampling. Utility-weighted sampling estimates theexpected utility of potential actions by simulating their outcomes. Critically; outcomes withmore extreme utilities have a higher probability of being simulated. We demonstrate that …,Psychological review,2018,6
Delay discounting; genetic sensitivity; and leukocyte telomere length,Onn-Siong Yim; Xing Zhang; Idan Shalev; Mikhail Monakhov; Songfa Zhong; Ming Hsu; Soo Hong Chew; Poh San Lai; Richard P Ebstein,Abstract In a graying world; there is an increasing interest in correlates of aging; especiallythose found in early life. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is an emerging marker of aging atthe cellular level; but little is known regarding its link with poor decision making that oftenentails being overly impatient. Here we investigate the relationship between LTL and thedegree of impatience; which is measured in the laboratory using an incentivized delaydiscounting task. In a sample of 1;158 Han Chinese undergraduates; we observe thatsteeper delay discounting; indexing higher degree of impatience; is negatively associatedwith LTL. The relationship is robust after controlling for health-related variables; as well asrisk attitude—another important determinant of decision making. LTL in females is moresensitive to impatience than in males. We then asked if genes possibly modulate the …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2016,6

The impact of such deficits can be dramatic; as in cases of financial fraud; whichdisproportionately affect the elderly. Unlike memory and motor impairments; however; whichare readily recognized as symptoms of more serious underlying neurological conditions;social and decision-making deficits often do not elicit comparable concern in the elderly.Furthermore; few behavioral measures exist to quantify these deficits; due in part to ourlimited knowledge of the core cognitive components or their neurobiological substrates …,Frontiers in neuroscience,2012,5

Neuroeconomic dissociation of semantic dementia and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia,Winston Chiong; Kristie A Wood; Alexander J Beagle; Ming Hsu; Andrew S Kayser; Bruce L Miller; Joel H Kramer,Abstract Many neuropsychiatric disorders are marked by abnormal behaviour and decision-making; but prevailing diagnostic criteria for such behaviours are typically qualitative andoften ambiguous. Behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and semantic variant primaryprogressive aphasia (also called semantic dementia) are two clinical variants offrontotemporal dementia with overlapping but distinct anatomical substrates known to causeprofound changes in decision-making. We investigated whether abnormal decision-makingin these syndromes could be more precisely characterized in terms of dissociableabnormalities in patients' subjective evaluations of valence (positive versus negativeoutcome) and of time (present versus future outcome).

Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia patients do not succumb to the Allais paradox,Maxime Bertoux; Florian Cova; Mathias Pessiglione; Ming Hsu; Bruno Dubois; Sacha Bourgeois-Gironde,The Allais Paradox represents on of the earliest empirical challenges to normative models ofdecision-making; and suggests that choices in one part of a gamble may depend on thepossible outcome in another; independent; part of the gamble—a violation of the so-called“independence axiom”. To account for Allaisian behavior; one well-known class of modelspropose that individuals' choices are influenced not only by possible outcomes resultingfrom one's choices; but also the anticipation of regret for foregone options.

We tested oneimplication of out initial findings in a follow-up study in which we measured subjects' pupildilation and tested memory recall. When subjects are more curious; there is more activity incaudate regions known to be involved in anticipated reward; and their pupils dilate more justbefore receiving answers.

Neural mechanisms of updating under reducible and irreducible uncertainty,Kenji Kobayashi; Ming Hsu,Adaptive decision making depends on an agent9s ability to use environmental signals toreduce uncertainty. However; because of multiple types of uncertainty; agents must take intoaccount not only the extent to which signals violate prior expectations but also whetheruncertainty can be reduced in the first place. Here we studied how human brains of bothsexes respond to signals under conditions of reducible and irreducible uncertainty. We showbehaviorally that subjects9 value updating was sensitive to the reducibility of uncertainty;and could be quantitatively characterized by a Bayesian model where agents ignoreexpectancy violations that do not update beliefs or values. Using fMRI; we found that neuralprocesses underlying belief and value updating were separable from responses toexpectancy violation; and that reducibility of uncertainty in value modulated connections …,Journal of Neuroscience,2017,1
Dissociable Contributions of Imagination and Willpower to the Malleability of Human Patience,Adrianna C Jenkins; Ming Hsu,The ability to exercise patience is important for human functioning. Although it is known thatpatience can be promoted by using top-down control; or willpower; to override impatientimpulses; patience is also malleable—in particular; susceptible to framing effects—in waysthat are difficult to explain using willpower alone. So far; the mechanisms underlying framingeffects on patience have been elusive. We investigated the role of imagination in theseeffects. In a behavioral experiment (Experiment 1); a classic framing manipulation(sequence framing) increased self-reported and independently coded imagination duringintertemporal choice.

Learning in games: neural computations underlying strategic learning,Ming Hsu; Lusha Zhu,The past decade has witnessed an unprecedented growth in our understanding of the brainbasis of economic decision-making. In particular; research is uncovering not only thelocation of brain regions where certain processes are taking place; but also the nature of the(economically meaningful) latent variables that are represented; as well as how they relateto behavior. This transition from understanding where to how economic decisions are beingmade in the brain has been integral to relating neural processes to economic models ofbehavior. This progress; however; has been notably uneven. Neuroeconomic studies ofindividual decision-making; such as those involve risk and time preferences; have thebenefit of drawing on decades of work from neuroscientific studies of animal behavior.Critically; many of these findings are based on quantitative; computational approach that …,Recherches économiques de Louvain,2012,1

An understanding of howconsumers feel and think about brands; for example; provides valuable guidance todevelopment of marketing strategy in areas including advertising; pricing; and channelstrategies (Rust; Zeithaml; and Lemon 2004; Aaker 2009). At the same time; however;consumer researchers have noted increasing dissatisfaction on the part of practitioners dueto shortcomings in existing methods of measuring the impact of brand-building activities(Feldwick 1996; Ambler and Barwise 1998; Berthon et al. 2001). As early as the 1990s; forexample; researchers noted that advertising's share of the marketing budget had shifteddownward from more than 60% to less than one third (Shocker; Srivastava; and Ruekert …,Consumer Neuroscience,2017,*

From Laboratory to Clinic and Back: Connecting Neuroeconomic and Clinical Measures of Decision-Making Dysfunctions,Ming Hsu; Winston Chiong,Abstract Rapid progress has been made during the past decade in our understanding ofneural circuits and neuromodulatory systems that mediate economic behavior. This researchhas produced a set of experimental tools that have been successfully applied to a variety ofneuropsychiatric and focal lesion cohorts. Despite these advances; however; major gaps stillexist between this scientific understanding and future clinical applications. In particular; littlesystematic work has been done to map these behavioral and neural measures to clinicallyrelevant characteristics; in ways that can (1) organize clinical descriptions of decision-making deficits or (2) refine and quantify these descriptions.

One possibletakeaway is that the gifts failed miserably and that the couple should have consulted eachother before their purchases. But most of us focus instead on the husband and wife'sgenerous dispositions. Beginning with Heider1; how perceivers attribute dispositionalproperties; or traits; to others has been among the most enduring questions in psychology2.In recent years; there has been increasing interest in approaching this question usingcognitive neuroscience techniques.

Updating Under Ambiguity: Insights From Neuroscience,Ming Hsu; Kenji Kobayashi,Consumers face uncertainty in a wide range of choices that they encounter daily. Some ofthese reflect risks; in which people are well informed about the likelihoods of possibleoutcomes; though those outcomes are uncertain. Others involve ambiguity; in which peoplehave little; or incomplete; information about a situation with uncertain outcomes. It is wellknown that consumers find many instances of such uncertainty and/or ambiguity aversive;making these decisions difficult and frustrating. This can lead to an array of biases; or evensimply avoidance of important choices in uncertain realms. The papers in this sessionexplore the mechanisms underlying uncertain decision-making; how they change withexperience; and how they impact real (incentivized) choices. Specifically; we seek toaddress the following questions:(i) do simple measures of decisions under uncertainty …,ACR North American Advances,2015,*
The Controlled Nature of Prosociality: Pharmacological Enhancement of Prosocial Behavior,Ming Hsu; Ignacio Sáez; Andrew Kayser,Prosocial motivations and actions are pervasive in consumer contexts. For example; acorporation's perceived social responsibility alters consumer responses to its products(Bodur; Gao; & Grohmann; 2014; Torelli; Monga; & Kaikati); and prosocial motivations maylead consumers to seek out socially responsible brands or charitable giving opportunities.Markets also have social dimensions; as consumers may rely on advice from or theirimpressions of other people. Prosocial actions; however; depend upon complex underlyingpsychological processes; and no single experimental approach can encapsulate these richphenomena. Therefore; insights from multiple methods and disciplines must be combined inorder to advance understanding of prosocial behavior in consumer contexts.

BACKGROUND: The dopaminergic system is intimately involved invaluation processes. However; its influence on reward in the social domain has rarely beentested in humans; despite the fact that diseases disrupting dopaminergic neurotransmissioncan alter prefrontal activity and lead to social deficits. We hypothesized that increases inprefrontal dopamine tone would impact the assessment of value to self versus other ineconomic games addressing social valuation.

How much would you give to friends and acquaintances?Would your choice be different if no one knew you had just won? For many people; choicesdepend upon not only the material outcomes involved; but also on the beliefs andexpectations of other people. Violation of these social expectations may result in negativeemotions such as shame. Here we study behavior and neural responses to suchexpectations in the context of a simple economic game—the stochastic dictator game. In thegame; a dictator chooses to allocate money between herself and an anonymous recipientwhile the pot of money available varies across rounds.

Decision making under,K Preuschoff; PNC Mohr; M Hsu,In our everyday life we often have to make decisions with uncertain consequences; forinstance in the context of investment decisions. To successfully cope with these situations;the nervous system has to be able to estimate; represent; and eventually resolve uncertaintyat various levels. That is; not only are there different forms of uncertainty with differentconsequences for behavior and learning but research indicates that the processing ofuncertainty highly depends on situation and context. The present research topic includesboth review and original research articles that seek to shed light on the neural processesunderlying decision making under uncertainty with a particular focus on situational andcontextual influences.

The model produces thestandard social choice results such as core convergence and policy separation.Furthermore; by introducing transfers; I am able to make more precise predictions aboutcandidate locations and their dynamics than is possible under the standard spatial model.Another purpose of this paper lies in the creation of favored groups in elections. Ultimately; itis important to characterize political behavior while considering the different preferences thatmight exist in the constituents. By incorporating utility for private goods into standard utilityassumptions; this model introduces these considerations into the standard spatial model;allowing us to have a richer and more nuanced look into elections.,*,2004,*

However relatively little attention has been paid to computational tools thatcan recognize and quantify social biases at the scale necessary to address these societalchallenges. Here; we used models from social psychology relating stereotypes of specificgroups to a few core dimensions in order to investigate the extent to which wordembeddings reveal stereotypes about different social groups and their realworldconsequences. We show that word embeddings trained on Google News can be used tomake accurate predictions of stereotypes about social groups identified by occupation;geography; and race.

Online Supplemental Material for Over-representation of extreme events in decision-making reflects rational use of cognitive resources,Falk Lieder; Thomas L Griffiths; Ming Hsu,In the Main Text we found that people overweight extreme outcomes in judgment tasks andhypothetical and low-stakes decisions in the laboratory. Is this cognitive bias restricted toartificial laboratory tasks or does it also pervade the high-stakes economic decisions wemake in real life? To answer this question; we analyze the high-stakes decisions ofcontestants in a popular TV game show called “Deal or No Deal”(Post; Van den Assem;Baltussen; & Thaler; 2008). In this gameshow; the contestant is presented with up to 26briefcases that contain prizes between $0. 01 and up to $5; 000; 000.

Surveys and focus groups; the workhorses forgenerating customer insights in these areas; are fast; inexpensive; and offer tremendousvalue for marketers. For many marketers; however; acting on them can sometimes feel like amatter of faith.

Customer-based brand equity: Insights from consumer neuroscience,Ming Hsu,Abstract This review describes how insights from cognitive and behavioral neurosciencesare helping to organize and interpret the relationship between consumers and brands. Twocomponents of brand equity—consumer brand knowledge and consumer responses—arediscussed. First; it is argued that consumer brand knowledge consists of multiple forms ofmemories that are encoded in the brain; including well-established forms of semantic(attributes and associations) and episodic (experiences and feelings) memory. Next; it isargued that there exist distinct forms of consumer responses that correspond to distinctbehavioral systems—a goal-directed system that captures valence of attitudes andpreference for a brand; and a habit system that captures previously learned values but nolonger reflect ongoing preferences. Finally; a neuroscientifically-grounded …,*,*,*
Semantic and episodic components of brand knowledge: evidence from functional neuroimaging,Yuping Chen; Ming Hsu,Abstract Brand knowledge has historically been conceptualized in terms of associativemodels of memory derived from cognitive psychology. This; however; ignores the growingscientific consensus that human memory is not a monolithic faculty; but rather a collection ofrelatively independent systems underpinning by dissociable neural circuits andcharacterized by different patterns of learning; unlearning; and biases. Here we appliedmachine learning tools to functional neuroimaging data to explore the hypothesis that brandknowledge can be decomposed into a collection of distinct forms of memories. In particular;we sought to contrast memory systems that underlie brand knowledge related to traits thatconsumers project onto brands on the one hand; versus memory for experiences that resultfrom interactions with brands on the other hand. Our results suggest that distinct types of …,*,*,*
Utility-weighted sampling in decisions from experience,Falk Lieder; Thomas L Griffiths; Ming Hsu,Abstract People overweight extreme events in decision-making and overestimate theirfrequency. Previous theoretical work has shown that this apparently irrational bias couldresult from utility-weighted sampling–a decision mechanism that makes rational use oflimited computational resources (Lieder; Hsu; & Griffiths; 2014). Here; we show that utility-weighted sampling can emerge from a neurally plausible associative learning mechanism.Our model explains the over-weighting of extreme outcomes in repeated decisions fromexperience (Ludvig; Madan; & Spetch; 2014); as well as the overestimation of theirfrequency and the underlying memory biases (Madan; Ludvig; & Spetch; 2014). Our resultssupport the conclusion that utility drives probability-weighting by biasing the neuralsimulation of potential consequences towards extreme values.,*,*,*
Emergence of Brand Personality from Distributed Pattern of Brain Activity: Connecting “What” to “Where”,Yu-Ping Chen; Leif D Nelson; Ming Hsu,Abstract Considerable attention has been given to the notion that there exists a set of human-like characteristics associated with brands; referred to as brand personality. Here wecombine newly available machine learning techniques with functional neuroimaging data tocharacterize the set of processes that give rise to these associations. We show that brandpersonality traits exist a priori inside the minds of consumers. That is; as opposed to beingconstructed via reflective processes; we were able to predict what brand a person is thinkingabout in a passive viewing task; based solely on the relationship between brand personalityassociations and brain activity. In addition; we found brand personality contents weredistributed across a wide set of brain areas; in particular those previously implicated inreasoning; imagery; and affective processing.

Illustrated by the Study of Ambiguity Aversion,Colin F Camerer; Meghana Bhatt; Ming Hsu,This chapter is about the emerging field of neuroeconomics; which seeks to groundeconomic theory in details about how the brain works. This approach is a sharp turn ineconomic thought. Around the turn of the century; economists made a clear methodologicalchoice to treat the mind as a black box and ignore its details for the purpose of economictheory (Bruni and Sugden 2007). In an 1897 letter Pareto wrote:''It is an empirical fact thatthe natural sciences have progressed only when they have taken secondary principles astheir point of departure; instead of trying to discover the essence of things.... Pure politicaleconomy has therefore a great interest in relying as little as possible on the domain ofpsychology''(qtd. in Busino 1964; xxiv).

Neural Mechanisms underlying Strategic Learning,Lusha Zhu; Kyle E Mathewson; Ming Hsu,Abstract Empirical marketing studies have shown that many types of consumer purchasingbehavior can be better explained by taking into account the dynamic learning processes ofstrategic decisionmaking. Accordingly; a number of theoretical models of learning havebeen proposed to demonstrate how different learning strategies can lead to differentpurchasing behavior over time. In practice; however; it is often difficult to distinguish thesedifferent strategies based on behavioral choice data alone. Here we provide an alternativeapproach to identify the underlying strategic learning process. By taking advantage of recentbreakthroughs in understanding the neural underpinnings of decision-making; weinvestigate how the brain encodes and computes learning signals used to guide behavior ina strategic setting. Specifically; we combine functional neuroimaging of a multistrategy …,*,*,*
