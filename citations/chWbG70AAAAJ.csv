Probabilistic reverse nearest neighbor queries on uncertain data,Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Wei Wang; Wenjie Zhang; Jian Pei,Uncertain data are inherent in various important applications and reverse nearest neighbor(RNN) query is an important query type for many applications. While many different types ofqueries have been studied on uncertain data; there is no previous work on answering RNNqueries on uncertain data. In this paper; we formalize probabilistic reverse nearest neighborquery that is to retrieve the objects from the uncertain data that have higher probability thana given threshold to be the RNN of an uncertain query object. We develop an efficientalgorithm based on various novel pruning approaches that solves the probabilistic RNNqueries on multidimensional uncertain data. The experimental results demonstrate that ouralgorithm is even more efficient than a sampling-based approximate algorithm for most ofthe cases and is highly scalable.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2010,111
Influence zone: Efficiently processing reverse k nearest neighbors queries,Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang; Ying Zhang,Given a set of objects and a query q; a point p is called the reverse k nearest neighbor(RkNN) of q if q is one of the k closest objects of p. In this paper; we introduce the concept ofinfluence zone which is the area such that every point inside this area is the RkNN of q andevery point outside this area is not the RkNN. The influence zone has several applications inlocation based services; marketing and decision support systems. It can also be used toefficiently process RkNN queries. First; we present efficient algorithm to compute theinfluence zone. Then; based on the influence zone; we present efficient algorithms toprocess RkNN queries that significantly outperform existing best known techniques for boththe snapshot and continuous RkNN queries.

Continuous reverse k nearest neighbors queries in euclidean space and in spatial networks,Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang; Xuefei Li,Abstract In this paper; we study the problem of continuous monitoring of reverse k nearestneighbors queries in Euclidean space as well as in spatial networks. Existing techniques aresensitive toward objects and queries movement. For example; the results of a query are tobe recomputed whenever the query changes its location. We present a framework forcontinuous reverse k nearest neighbor (RkNN) queries by assigning each object and querywith a safe region such that the expensive recomputation is not required as long as thequery and objects remain in their respective safe regions. This significantly improves thecomputation cost. As a byproduct; our framework also reduces the communication cost inclient---server architectures because an object does not report its location to the serverunless it leaves its safe region or the server sends a location update request.

Continuous monitoring of distance-based range queries,Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Ljiljana Brankovic; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang; Wei Wang,Given a positive value r; a distance-based range query returns the objects that lie within thedistance r of the query location. In this paper; we focus on the distance-based range queriesthat continuously change their locations in a euclidean space. We present an efficient andeffective monitoring technique based on the concept of a safe zone. The safe zone of aquery is the area with a property that while the query remains inside it; the results of thequery remain unchanged. Hence; the query does not need to be reevaluated unless itleaves the safe zone. Our contributions are as follows: 1) We propose a technique based onpowerful pruning rules and a unique access order which efficiently computes the safe zoneand minimizes the I/O cost. 2) We theoretically determine and experimentally verify theexpected distance a query moves before leaving the safe zone and; for majority of …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,54
Multi-guarded safe zone: An effective technique to monitor moving circular range queries,Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Ljiljana Brankovic; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang; Wei Wang,Given a positive value r; a circular range query returns the objects that lie within the distancer of the query location. In this paper; we study the circular range queries that continuouslychange their locations. We present an efficient and effective technique to monitor suchmoving range queries by utilising the concept of a safe zone. The safe zone of a query is thearea with a property that while the query remains inside it; the results of the query remainunchanged. Hence; the query does not need to be re-evaluated unless it leaves the safezone. The shape of the safe zone is defined by the so-called guard objects. The cost ofchecking whether a query lies in the safe zone takes k distance computations; where k is thenumber of the guard objects. Our contributions are as follows. 1) We propose a techniquebased on powerful pruning rules and a unique access order which efficiently computes …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,52
Stochastic skyline operator,Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema,In many applications involving the multiple criteria optimal decision making; users may oftenwant to make a personal trade-off among all optimal solutions.

Diversified spatial keyword search on road networks,Chengyuan Zhang; Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xiaoyang Wang,ABSTRACT With the increasing pervasiveness of the geo-positioning technologies; there isan enormous amount of spatio-textual objects available in many applications such aslocation based services and social networks. Consequently; various types of spatial keywordsearches which explore both locations and textual descriptions of the objects have beenintensively studied by the research communities and commercial organizations. In manyimportant applications (eg; location based services); the closeness of two spatial objects ismeasured by the road network distance. Moreover; the result diversification is becoming acommon practice to enhance the quality of the search results. Motived by the above facts; inthis paper we study the problem of diversified spatial keyword search on road networkswhich considers both the relevance and the spatial diversity of the results.

Efficient construction of safe regions for moving knn queries over dynamic datasets,Mahady Hasan; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang,Abstract The concept of safe region has been used to reduce the computation andcommunication cost for the continuous monitoring of k nearest neighbor (k NN) queries. Asafe region is an area such that as long as a query remains in it; the set of its k NNs does notchange. In this paper; we present an efficient technique to construct the safe region by usingcheap RangeNN queries. We also extend our approach for dynamic datasets (the objectsmay appear or disappear from the dataset). Our proposed algorithm outperforms existingalgorithms and scales better with the increase in k.,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2009,23

Reverse k nearest neighbors query processing: experiments and analysis,Shiyu Yang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Wei Wang,Abstract Given a set of users; a set of facilities and a query facility q; a reverse k nearestneighbors (RkNN) query returns every user u for which the query is one of its k closestfacilities. RkNN queries have been extensively studied under a variety of settings and manysophisticated algorithms have been proposed to answer these queries. However; theexisting experimental studies suffer from a few limitations. For example; some studiesestimate the I/O cost by charging a fixed penalty per I/O and we show that this may bemisleading. Also; the existing studies either use an extremely small buffer or no buffer at allwhich puts some algorithms at serious disadvantage. We show that the performance ofthese algorithms is significantly improved even when a small buffer (containing 100 pages)is used. Finally; in each of the existing studies; the proposed algorithm is mainly …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,21
Efficiently monitoring top-k pairs over sliding windows,Zhitao Shen; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang; Haixun Wang,Top-k pairs queries have received significant attention by the research community. k-closestpairs queries; k-furthest pairs queries and their variants are among the most well studiedspecial cases of the top-k pairs queries. In this paper; we present the first approach toanswer a broad class of top-k pairs queries over sliding windows. Our framework handlesmultiple top-k pairs queries and each query is allowed to use a different scoring function; adifferent value of k and a different size of the sliding window. Although the number ofpossible pairs in the sliding window is quadratic to the number of objects N in the slidingwindow; we efficiently answer the top-k pairs query by maintaining a small subset of pairscalled K-sky band which is expected to consist of O (K log (N/K)) pairs. For all the queriesthat use the same scoring function; we need to maintain only one K-sky band. We present …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,21
A Unified Framework for Efficiently Processing Ranking Related Queries.,Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Zhitao Shen; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang,ABSTRACT The computation of k-lower envelope is a classical problem and has been verywell studied for main memory non-indexed data. In this paper; we study the problem from thedatabase perspective and present the first algorithm which utilizes the presence of the indexand achieves access optimality; ie; it accesses a node of the index only if the correctness ofthe results cannot be guaranteed without accessing this node. We also demonstrate theapplications of k-lower envelope in ranking systems. Let an object be called valuable if it isone of the top-k objects according to at least one linear scoring function. In this paper; weanswer the following important questions that may be asked by different users: 1) I am notsure what scoring function I should use; therefore; return me the set of valuable objects sothat I can select an object I like the most; 2) How can I modify the attributes (eg; price) of …,EDBT,2014,20
Multi-manifold ranking: Using multiple features for better image retrieval,Yang Wang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Qing Zhang,Abstract Manifold Ranking (MR) is one of the most popular graph-based ranking methodsand has been widely used for information retrieval. Due to its ability to capture the geometricstructure of the image set; it has been successfully used for image retrieval. The existingapproaches that use manifold ranking rely only on a single image manifold. However; suchmethods may not fully discover the geometric structure of the image set and may lead topoor precision results. Motivated by this; we propose a novel method named Multi-ManifoldRanking (MMR) which embeds multiple image manifolds each constructed using a differentimage feature. We propose a novel cost function that is minimized to obtain the rankingscores of the images. Our proposed multi-manifold ranking has a better ability to explore thegeometric structure of image set as demonstrated by our experiments.

SLICE: reviving regions-based pruning for reverse k nearest neighbors queries,Shiyu Yang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang,Given a set of facilities and a set of users; a reverse k nearest neighbors (RkNN) query qreturns every user for which the query facility is one of the k-closest facilities. Due to itsimportance; RkNN query has received significant research attention in the past few years.Almost all of the existing techniques adopt a pruning-and-verification framework. Regions-based pruning and half-space pruning are the two most notable pruning strategies. The half-space based approach prunes a larger area and is generally believed to be superior.Influenced by this perception; almost all existing RkNN algorithms utilize and improve thehalf-space pruning strategy. We observe the weaknesses and strengths of both strategiesand discover that the regions-based pruning has certain strengths that have not beenexploited in the past. Motivated by this; we present a new RkNN algorithm called SLICE …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,17
A safe zone based approach for monitoring moving skyline queries,Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang; Ying Zhang,Abstract Given a set of criterions; an object o dominates another object ó if o is morepreferable than ó according to every criterion. A skyline query returns every object that is notdominated by any other object. In this paper; we study the problem of continuouslymonitoring a moving skyline query where one of the criterions is the distance between theobjects and the moving query. We propose a safe zone based approach to address thechallenge of efficiently updating the results as the query moves. A safe zone is the area suchthat the results of a query remain unchanged as long as the query lies inside this area.Hence; the results are required to be updated only when the query leaves its safe zone.Although the main focus of this paper is to present the techniques for Euclidean distancemetric; the proposed techniques are applicable to any metric distance (eg; Manhattan …,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2013,17
A unified approach for computing top-k pairs in multidimensional space,Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Haixun Wang; Jianmin Wang; Wenjie Zhang,Top-k pairs queries have many real applications. k closest pairs queries; k furthest pairsqueries and their bichromatic variants are some of the examples of the top-k pairs queriesthat rank the pairs on distance functions. While these queries have received significantresearch attention; there does not exist a unified approach that can efficiently answer allthese queries. Moreover; there is no existing work that supports top-k pairs queries based ongeneric scoring functions. In this paper; we present a unified approach that supports a broadclass of top-k pairs queries including the queries mentioned above. Our proposed approachallows the users to define a local scoring function for each attribute involved in the query anda global scoring function that computes the final score of each pair by combining its scoreson different attributes.

Efficient algorithms to monitor continuous constrained k nearest neighbor queries,Mahady Hasan; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Wenyu Qu; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Continuous monitoring of spatial queries has received significant research attentionin the past few years. In this paper; we propose two efficient algorithms for the continuousmonitoring of the constrained k nearest neighbor (k NN) queries. In contrast to theconventional k nearest neighbors (k NN) queries; a constrained k NN query considers onlythe objects that lie within a region specified by some user defined constraints (eg; apolygon). Similar to the previous works; we also use grid-based data structure and proposetwo novel grid access methods. Our proposed algorithms are based on these accessmethods and guarantee that the number of cells that are accessed to compute theconstrained k NNs is minimal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our algorithms areseveral times faster than the previous algorithm and use considerably less memory.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,17
Quantile-based knn over multi-valued objects,Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Ying Zhang; Wei Wang,K Nearest Neighbor search has many applications including data mining; multi-media;image processing; and monitoring moving objects. In this paper; we study the problem ofKNN over multi-valued objects. We aim to provide effective and efficient techniques toidentify KNN sensitive to relative distributions of objects. We propose to use quantiles tosummarize relative-distribution-sensitive K nearest neighbors. Given a query Q and aquantile φ∈(0; 1]; we firstly study the problem of efficiently computing K nearest objectsbased on a φ-quantile distance (eg median distance) from each object to Q. The secondproblem is to retrieve the K nearest objects to Q based on overall distances in the “bestpopulation”(with a given size specified by φ-quantile) for each object. While the first problemcan be solved in polynomial time; we show that the 2nd problem is NP-hard. A set of …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,16

Compared with the existing algorithms; ouralgorithm is both space and time efficient.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,16
Trip planning queries with location privacy in spatial databases,Subarna Chowdhury Soma; Tanzima Hashem; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Samiha Samrose,Abstract Privacy has become a major concern for the users of location-based services(LBSs) and researchers have focused on protecting user privacy for different location-basedqueries. In this paper; we propose techniques to protect location privacy of users for tripplanning (TP) queries; a novel type of query in spatial databases. A TP query enables a userto plan a trip with the minimum travel distance; where the trip starts from a source location;goes through a sequence of points of interest (POIs)(eg; restaurant; shopping center); andends at a destination location. Due to privacy concerns; users may not wish to disclose theirexact locations to the location-based service provider (LSP). In this paper; we present thefirst comprehensive solution for processing TP queries without disclosing a user's actualsource and destination locations to the LSP. Our system protects the user's privacy by …,World Wide Web,2017,8
K-nearest neighbors on road networks: a journey in experimentation and in-memory implementation,Tenindra Abeywickrama; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; David Taniar,Abstract A k nearest neighbor (kNN) query on road networks retrieves the k closest points ofinterest (POIs) by their network distances from a given location. Today; in the era ofubiquitous mobile computing; this is a highly pertinent query. While Euclidean distance hasbeen used as a heuristic to search for the closest POIs by their road network distance; itsefficacy has not been thoroughly investigated. The most recent methods have shownsignificant improvement in query performance. Earlier studies; which proposed disk-basedindexes; were compared to the current state-of-the-art in main memory. However; recentstudies have shown that main memory comparisons can be challenging and require carefuladaptation. This paper presents an extensive experimental investigation in main memory tosettle these and several other issues.

Visibility color map for a fixed or moving target in spatial databases,Ishat E Rabban; Kaysar Abdullah; Mohammed Eunus Ali; Muhammad Aamir Cheema,Abstract The widespread availability of 3D city models enables us to answer a wide range ofspatial visibility queries in the presence of obstacles (eg; buildings). Example queriesinclude “what is the best position for placing a billboard in a city?” or “which hotel gives thebest view of the city skyline?”. These queries require computing and differentiating thevisibility of a target object from each viewpoint of the surrounding spe. A recent approachmodels the visibility of a fixed target object from the surrounding area with a visibility colormap (VCM); where each point in the space is assigned a color value denoting the visibilitymeasure of the target. In the proposed VCM; a viewpoint is simply discarded (ie; consideredas non-visible) if an obstacle even slightly blocks the view of the target from the viewpoint;which restricts its applicability for a wide range of applications. To alleviate this limitation …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2015,7
Finding the sites with best accessibilities to amenities,Qianlu Lin; Chuan Xiao; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Wei Wang,Abstract Finding the most accessible locations has a number of applications. For example; auser may want to find an accommodation that is close to different amenities such as schools;supermarkets; and hospitals etc. In this paper; we study the problem of finding the mostaccessible locations among a set of possible sites. The task is converted to a top-k querythat returns k points from a set of sites R with the best accessibilities. Two R-tree basedalgorithms are proposed to answer the query efficiently. Experimental results show that ourproposed algorithms are several times faster than a baseline algorithm on large-scale realdatasets under a wide range of parameter settings.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2011,7
Vip-tree: an effective index for indoor spatial queries,Zhou Shao; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; David Taniar; Hua Lu,Abstract Due to the growing popularity of indoor location-based services; indoor datamanagement has received significant research attention in the past few years. However; weobserve that the existing indexing and query processing techniques for the indoor space donot fully exploit the properties of the indoor space. Consequently; they provide below parperformance which makes them unsuitable for large indoor venues with high queryworkloads. In this paper; we propose two novel indexes called Indoor Partitioning Tree (IP-Tree) and Vivid IP-Tree (VIP-Tree) that are carefully designed by utilizing the properties ofindoor venues. The proposed indexes are lightweight; have small pre-processing cost andprovide near-optimal performance for shortest distance and shortest path queries.

$ k $ NNVWC: An Efficient $ k $-Nearest Neighbors Approach Based on Various-Widths Clustering,Abdul Mohsen Almalawi; Adil Fahad; Zahir Tari; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Ibrahim Khalil,The k-nearest neighbor approach (k-NN) has been extensively used as a powerful non-parametric technique in many scientific and engineering applications. However; thisapproach incurs a large computational cost. Hence; this issue has become an activeresearch field. In this work; a novel k-NN approach based on various-widths clustering;named kNNVWC; to efficiently find k-NNs for a query object from a given data set; ispresented. kNNVWC does clustering using various widths; where a data set is clustered witha global width first and each produced cluster that meets the predefined criteria isrecursively clustered with its own local width that suits its distribution. This reduces theclustering time; in addition to balancing the number of produced clusters and their respectivesizes. Maximum efficiency is achieved by using triangle inequality to prune unlikely …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,6
A Generic Framework for Top-${\schmi k} $ Pairs and Top-${\schmi k} $ Objects Queries over Sliding Windows,Zhitao Shen; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang; Haixun Wang,Top-k pairs and top-k objects queries have received significant attention by the researchcommunity. In this paper; we present the first approach to answer a broad class of top-k pairsand top-k objects queries over sliding windows. Our framework handles multiple top-kqueries and each query is allowed to use a different scoring function; a different value of k;and a different size of the sliding window. Furthermore; the framework allows the users todefine arbitrarily complex scoring functions and supports out-of-order data streams. For allthe queries that use the same scoring function; we need to maintain only one K-skyband. Wepresent efficient techniques for the K-skyband maintenance and query answering. Weconduct a detailed complexity analysis and show that the expected cost of our approach isreasonably close to the lower bound cost.

Loyalty-based selection: Retrieving objects that persistently satisfy criteria,Zhitao Shen; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin,Abstract A traditional query returns a set of objects that satisfy user defined criteria at thetime query was issued. The results are based on the values of objects at query time and maybe affected by outliers. Intuitively; an object better meets the user's needs if it persistentlysatisfies the criteria; ie; it satisfies the criteria for majority of the time in the past T time units.In this paper; we propose a measure named loyalty that reflects how persistently an objectsatisfies the criteria. Formally; the loyalty of an object is the total time (in past T time units) itsatisfies the query criteria. In this paper; we study top-k loyalty queries over sliding windowsthat continuously report k objects with the highest loyalties. Each object issues an updatewhen it starts satisfying the criteria or when it stops satisfying the criteria. We show that thelower bound cost of updating the results of a top-k loyalty query is O (logN); for each …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,6
Probabilistic n-of-N skyline computation over uncertain data streams,Wenjie Zhang; Aiping Li; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Ying Zhang; Lijun Chang,Abstract Skyline operator is a useful tool in multi-criteria decision making in variousapplications. Uncertainty is inherent in real applications due to various reasons. In thispaper; we consider the problem of efficiently computing probabilistic skylines against themost recent N uncertain elements in a data stream seen so far. Specifically; we study theproblem in the n-of-N model; that is; computing the probabilistic skyline for the most recent n(∀ n≤ N) elements; where an element is a probabilistic skyline element if its skylineprobability is not below a given probability threshold q. Firstly; an effective pruning techniqueto minimize the number of uncertain elements to be kept is developed. It can be shown thaton average storing only O (log d N) uncertain elements from the most recent N elements issufficient to support the precise computation of all probabilistic n-of-N skyline queries in …,World Wide Web,2015,5
Efficiently monitoring reverse k-nearest neighbors in spatial networks,Shenlu Wang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin,Given a set of clients C; a set of facilities F and a query q∈ F; a reverse k-nearest neighbor(RkNN) query retrieves every client c∈ C for which q is one of the k closest facilities. In thepast few years; RkNN queries have received significant research attention due to their widerange of applications. In this paper; we study the problem of continuous monitoring of RkNNqueries in road networks. The state-of-the-art technique is sensitive toward the movement ofclients; eg whenever a client that is inside the so-called unpruned region changes itslocation; the existing technique requires expensive verification of whether the client is anRkNN of q or not. To address this problem; we utilize the novel concept of influence zone;which is a region in the network such that a client c is the RkNN if and only if it lies inside thiszone. This significantly improves performance because the problem of continuously …,The Computer Journal,2015,5
Efficient top-k similarity join processing over multi-valued objects,Wenjie Zhang; Liming Zhan; Ying Zhang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin,Abstract The top-k similarity joins have been extensively studied and used in a widespectrum of applications such as information retrieval; decision making; spatial data analysisand data mining. Given two sets of objects \mathcalU and \mathcalV; a top-k similarity joinreturns k pairs of most similar objects from \mathcalU*\mathcalV. In the conventional modelof top-k similarity join processing; an object is usually regarded as a point in a multi-dimensional space and the similarity is measured by some simple distance metrics likeEuclidean distance. However; in many applications an object may be described by multiplevalues (instances) and the conventional model is not applicable since it does not addressthe distributions of object instances. In this paper; we study top-k similarity join over multi-valued objects. We apply two types of quantile based distance measures; ϕ-quantile …,World Wide Web,2014,5
Efficiently computing reverse k furthest neighbors,Shenlu Wang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang; Dongxi Liu,Given a set of facilities F; a set of users U and a query facility q; a reverse k furthestneighbors (RkFN) query retrieves every user u∈ U for which q is one of its k-furthestfacilities. RkFN query is the natural complement of reverse k-nearest neighbors (RkNN)query that returns every user u for which q is one of its k-nearest facilities. While RkNN queryreturns the users that are highly influenced by a query q; RkFN query aims at finding theusers that are least influenced by a query q. RkFN query has many applications in location-based services; marketing; facility location; clustering; and recommendation systems etc.While there exist several algorithms that answer RkFN query for k= 1; we are the first topropose a solution for arbitrary value of k. Based on several interesting observations; wepresent an efficient algorithm to process the RkFN queries.

Counting distinct objects over sliding windows,Wenjie Zhang; Ying Zhang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Aggregation against distinct objects has been involved in many real applicationswith the presence of duplicates; including real-time monitoring moving objects. In this paper;we investigate the problem of counting distinct objects over sliding windows with arbitrarylengths. We present novel; time and space efficient; one scan algorithms to continuouslymaintain a sketch so that the counting can be approximately conducted with a relative errorguarantee ε in the presence of object duplicates. Efficient query algorithms have also beendeveloped by effectively utilizing the skyband property. Moreover; the proposed techniquesmay be immediately applied to the range counting aggregation and heavy hitter problemagainst distinct elements.

Relaxed reverse nearest neighbors queries,Arif Hidayat; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; David Taniar,Abstract Given a set of users U; a set of facilities F; and a query facility q; a reverse nearestneighbors (RNN) query retrieves every user u for which q is its closest facility. Since q is theclosest facility of u; the user u is said to be influenced by q. In this paper; we propose arelaxed definition of influence where a user u is said to be influenced by not only its closestfacility but also every other facility that is almost as close to u as its closest facility is. Basedon this definition of influence; we propose relaxed reverse nearest neighbors (RRNN)queries. Formally; given a value of x> 1; an RRNN query q returns every user u for which dist(u; q) ≤ x * NNDist (u) where NNDist (u) denotes the distance between a user u and itsnearest facility. Based on effective pruning techniques and several non-trivial observations;we propose an efficient RRNN query processing algorithm.

Note that $ k $-closest pairs query is a special case of top-$k $ pairs queries where the scoring function is the distance between the two objects in apair. We are the first to present a unified framework to efficiently answer a broad class of top-$ k $ queries including the queries mentioned above. We present efficient algorithms andprovide a detailed theoretical analysis that demonstrates that the expected performance ofour proposed algorithms is optimal for two dimensional data sets.

Matching dominance: capture the semantics of dominance for multi-dimensional uncertain objects,Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Chengqi Zhang,Abstract The dominance operator plays an important role in a wide spectrum of multi-criteriadecision making applications. Generally speaking; a dominance operator is a partial orderon a set O of objects; and we say the dominance operator has the monotonic propertyregarding a family of ranking functions F if o 1 dominates o 2 implies f (o 1)≥ f (o 2) for anyranking function f∈ F and objects o 1; o 2∈ O. The dominance operator on the multi-dimensional points is well defined; which has the monotonic property regarding anymonotonic ranking (scoring) function. Due to the uncertain nature of data in many emergingapplications; a variety of existing works have studied the semantics of ranking query onuncertain objects. However; the problem of dominance operator against multi-dimensionaluncertain objects remains open. Although there are several attempts to propose …,Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2014,2
CircularTrip and arctrip: Effective grid access methods for continuous spatial queries,Muhammad Aamir Cheema,Abstract A k nearest neighbor query q retrieves k objects that lie closest to the query point qamong a given set of objects P. With the availability of inexpensive location aware mobiledevices; the continuous monitoring of such queries has gained lot of attention and manymethods have been proposed for continuously monitoring the kNNs in highly dynamicenvironment. Multiple continuous queries require real-time results and both the objects andqueries issue frequent location updates. Most popular spatial index; R-tree; is not suitablefor continuous monitoring of these queries due to its inefficiency in handling frequentupdates. Recently; the interest of database community has been shifting towards using grid-based index for continuous queries due to its simplicity and efficient update handling. ForkNN queries; the order in which cells of the grid are accessed is very important. In this …,*,2007,2
Reverse k nearest neighbors queries and spatial reverse top-k queries,Shiyu Yang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang,Abstract Given a set of facilities and a set of users; a reverse k nearest neighbors (R k NN)query q returns every user for which the query facility is one of the k closest facilities. Almostall of the existing techniques to answer R k NN queries adopt a pruning-and-verificationframework. Regions-based pruning and half-space pruning are the two most notablepruning strategies. The half-space-based approach prunes a larger area and is generallybelieved to be superior. Influenced by this perception; almost all existing R k NN algorithmsutilize and improve the half-space pruning strategy. We observe the weaknesses andstrengths of both strategies and discover that the regions-based pruning has certainstrengths that have not been exploited in the past. Motivated by this; we present a newregions-based pruning algorithm called Slice that utilizes the strength of regions-based …,The VLDB Journal,2017,1
Selecting representative objects considering coverage and diversity,Shenlu Wang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Ying Zhang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract We say that an object o attracts a user u if o is one of the top-k objects according tothe preference function defined by u. Given a set of objects (eg; restaurants) and a set ofusers; in this paper; we study the problem of computing a set of representative objectsconsidering two criteria: coverage and diversity. Coverage of a set S of objects is the distinctnumber of users that are attracted by the objects in S. Although a set of objects with highcoverage attracts a large number of users; it is possible that all of these users have quitesimilar preferences. Consequently; the set of objects may be attractive only for a specificclass of users with similar preference functions which may disappoint other users havingwidely different preferences. The diversity criterion addresses this issue by selecting a set Sof objects such that the set of attracted users for each object in S is as different as …,Second International ACM Workshop on Managing and Mining Enriched Geo-Spatial Data,2015,1
Optimal spatial dominance: an effective search of nearest neighbor candidates,Xiaoyang Wang; Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Muhammad Aamir Cheema,Abstract In many domains such as computational geometry and database management; anobject may be described by multiple instances (points). Then the distance (or similarity)between two objects is captured by the pair-wise distances among their instances. In thepast; numerous nearest neighbor (NN) functions have been proposed to define the distancebetween objects with multiple instances and to identify the NN object. Nevertheless;considering that a user may not have a specific NN function in mind; it is desirable to provideher with a set of NN candidates. Ideally; the set of NN candidates must include every objectthat is NN for at least one of the NN functions and must exclude every non-promising object.However; no one has studied the problem of NN candidates computation from thisperspective. Although some of the existing works aim at returning a set of candidate …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,1

A unified algorithm for continuous monitoring of spatial queries,Mahady Hasan; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang,Abstract Continuous monitoring of spatial queries has gained significant research attentionin the past few years. Although numerous algorithms have been proposed to solve specificqueries; there does not exist a unified algorithm that solves a broad class of spatial queries.In this paper; we first define a versatile top-k query and show that various important spatialqueries can be modeled to a versatile top-k query by defining a suitable scoring function.Then; we propose an efficient algorithm to continuously monitor the versatile top-k queries.To show the effectiveness of our proposed approach; we model various inherently differentspatial queries to the versatile top-k query and conduct experiments to show the efficiency ofour unified algorithm.

Reverse Approximate Nearest Neighbor Queries,Arif Hidayat; Shiyu Yang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; David Taniar,Given a set of facilities and a set of users; a reverse nearest neighbors (RNN) queryretrieves every user $ u $ for which the query facility $ q $ is its closest facility. Since $ q $ isthe closest facility to $ u $; the user $ u $ is said to be influenced by $ q $. In this paper; wepropose a relaxed definition of influence where a user $ u $ is said to be influenced by notonly its closest facility but also every other facility that is almost as close to $ u $ as its closestfacility is. Based on this definition of influence; we propose reverse approximate nearestneighbors (RANN) queries. Formally; given a value $ x> 1$; an RANN query $ q $ returnsevery user $ u $ for which $ dist (u; q)\leq x\times NNDist (u) $ where $ NNDist (u) $ denotesthe distance between a user $ u $ and its nearest facility; ie; $ q $ is an approximate nearestneighbor of $ u $.

Trip Planning Queries in Indoor Venues,Zhou Shao; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; David Taniar,Abstract In this paper; we study a new type of indoor queries; called the indoor trip planningquery (iTPQ). We have observed that the existing methods for outdoor spaces cannot beapplied directly to indoor spaces; due to the difference in the underlying networks. Outdoorspaces; which are normally represented as spatial road networks; are commonly modelledas a graph. In contrast; indoor spaces have distinct features (eg rooms; doors; hallways) thatdo not exist in road networks. So far; no specific solutions have been proposed for iTPQ.Even if outdoor techniques are revised for iTPQ; they fail to process iTPQ efficiently. In thispaper; we propose an indoor-specific technique; based on the indoor VIP-Tree; called theVIP-Tree neighbor expansion (VNE) method; that also includes new pruning techniques inboth pre-processing and query processing phases.

QUIET ZONE: Reducing The Communication Cost of Continuous Spatial Queries,Arif Hidayat; Muhammad Aamir Cheema,Abstract The client server model has been extensively used to continuously monitor theresults of spatial queries. In this paper; we introduce quiet zone that is aimed to reduce thecommunication cost in the client server model implemented for continuous spatial queries. Aquiet zone is a region such that as long as an object remains inside it; the object does notneed to report its location. We present a generic framework to reduce the communicationcost of many different variety of continuous spatial queries; such as range query; reversenearest neighbour query; window query and relaxed reverse nearest neighbour query. Weshow that the checking cost at objects is reasonably low so that our approach is feasible fordevices with limited resources. Our experimental study shows that the proposed algorithmsignificantly reduces the communication cost.,Proceedings of the 3rd ACM SIGSPATIAL Workshop on Smart Cities and Urban Analytics,2017,*

Meanwhile; spatial-textual objects that represent Point-of-interests (POIs; eg; shops; cinema; hotel or restaurant)are increasing pervasively. Consequently; how to retrieve a set of objects that best matchesthe user's submitted spatial keyword query (SKQ) has been intensively studied by theresearch communities and commercial organisations. Existing works only focus on returningthe nearest matching objects; although we observe that many real-life applications are nowusing diversification to enhance the quality of the query results. Thus; existing methods fail tosolve the problem of diversified SKQ efficiently. In this demonstration; we introduce DSKQ …,Australasian Database Conference,2017,*

The Optimal Route and Stops for a Group of Users in a Road Network,Radi Muhammad Reza; Mohammed Eunus Ali; Muhammad Aamir Cheema,Abstract: Recently; with the advancement of the GPS-enabled cellular technologies; thelocation-based services (LBS) have gained in popularity. Nowadays; an increasingly largernumber of map-based applications enable users to ask a wider variety of queries.Researchers have studied the ride-sharing; the carpooling; the vehicle routing; and thecollective travel planning problems extensively in recent years. Collective traveling has thebenefit of being environment-friendly by reducing the global travel cost; the greenhouse gasemission; and the energy consumption. In this paper; we introduce several optimizationproblems to recommend a suitable route and stops of a vehicle; in a road network; for agroup of users intending to travel collectively.

Efficient Landmark-Based Candidate Generation for kNN Queries on Road Networks,Tenindra Abeywickrama; Muhammad Aamir Cheema,Abstract The k nearest neighbor (k NN) query on road networks finds the k closest points ofinterest (POIs) by network distance from a query point. A past study showed that ak NNtechnique using a simple Euclidean distance heuristic to generate candidate POIssignificantly outperforms more complex techniques. While Euclidean distance is an effectivelower bound when network distances represent physical distance; its accuracy degradesgreatly for metrics such as travel time. Landmarks have been used to compute tighter lowerbounds in such cases; however past attempts to use them in k NN querying failed to retrievecandidates efficiently. We present two techniques to address this problem; one usingordered Object Lists for each landmark and another using a combination of landmarks andNetwork Voronoi Diagrams (NVDs) to only compute lower bounds to a small subset of …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2017,*
Continuous monitoring of range spatial keyword query over moving objects,Chaluka Salgado; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Mohammed Eunus Ali,Abstract In this paper; we propose an efficient solution for processing continuous rangespatial keyword queries over moving spatio-textual objects (namely; CRSK-mo queries).Major challenges in efficient processing of CRSK-mo queries are as follows:(i) the queryrange is determined based on both spatial proximity and textual similarity; thus astraightforward spatial proximity based pruning of the search space is not applicable as anyobject far from a query location with a high textual similarity score can still be the answer(and vice versa);(ii) frequent location updates may invalidate a query result; and thus requirefrequent re-computing of the result set for any object updates. To address these challenges;the key idea of our approach is to exploit the spatial and textual upper bounds betweenqueries and objects to form safe zones (at the client-side) and buffer regions (at the server …,World Wide Web,2017,*
Pre-computed region guardian sets based reverse kNN queries,Wei Song; Jianbin Qin; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Wei Wang,Abstract Given a set of objects and a query q; a point p is q's Reverse k Nearest Neighbour(R k NN) if q is one of p'sk-closest objects. R k NN queries have received significantresearch attention in the past few years. However; we realize that the state-of-the-artalgorithm; SLICE; accesses many objects that do not contribute to its R k NN results whenrunning the filtering phase; which deteriorates the query performance. In this paper; wepropose a novel R k NN algorithm with pre-computation by partitioning the data space intodisjoint rectangular regions and constructing the guardian set for each region R. Weguarantee that; for each q that lies in R; its R k NN results are only affected by the objects inR's guardian set. The advantage of this approach is that the results of a query q ∈ R q∈ Rcan be computed by using SLICE on only the objects in its guardian set instead of using …,Data Science and Engineering,2016,*
Outdoor-indoor space: unified modeling and shortest path search,Søren Kejser Jensen; Jens Thomas Vejlby Nielsen; Hua Lu; Muhammad Aamir Cheema,Abstract Graph models are widely used for representing the topology of outdoor space (O-Space) and indoor space (I-Space). However; existing models neglect the intersectionbetween O-Space and I-Space; only allowing for computations such as shortest path andnearest neighbor queries in either O-Space or I-Space; separately. In this paper; we presenttwo different outdoor-indoor space (OI-Space) models allowing queries to operate on a mixof both spaces. The first model keeps the distinct nature of the two spaces intact by havingexplicit connections between outdoor and indoor spaces. The second model abstracts thisdistinction away; and provides a unified model of outdoor-indoor space. For each model; wepresent an algorithm that is able to span the two types of spaces to return the real shortestpath between two arbitrary points.

Visibility Color Map for a Fixed or Moving Target in Spatial Databases,Muhammad Aamir Cheema,Abstract. The widespread availability of 3D city models enables us to answer a wide rangeof spatial visibility queries in the presence of obstacles (eg; buildings). Example queriesinclude “what is the best position for placing a billboard in a city?” or “which hotel gives thebest view of the city skyline?”. These queries require computing and differentiating thevisibility of a target object from each viewpoint of the surrounding spe. A recent approachmodels the visibility of a fixed target object from the surrounding area with a visibility colormap (VCM); where each point in the space is assigned a color value denoting the visibilitymeasure of the target. In the proposed VCM; a viewpoint is simply discarded (ie; consideredas non-visible) if an obstacle even slightly blocks the view of the target from the viewpoint;which restricts its applicability for a wide range of applications.

Impact Set: Computing Influence Using Query Logs,Shiyu Yang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin,Abstract A facility is said to influence a user if is one of the closest facilities of the user. This isbecause users usually prefer to visit/use nearby facilities. The influence set of a facility is theset of users influenced by. The computation of the influence set has gained extensiveresearch attention in the past decade. Note that the definition of influence set assumes thateach user behaves the same; ie each user prefers the closest facilities where is a constant.However; in real-world scenarios; different users may prefer different values of dependingon; for example; the density of facilities around them; the mode of transport available to themetc. Therefore; assuming a constant value of for each user may not be able to capture theessence of influence effectively.

In this paper; we study the problem of top-k spatial keywordsearch which retrieves the top k objects that are most relevant to query in terms of jointspatial and textual relevance. Existing state-of-the-art methods index data objects in IR-treewhich supports textual and spatial pruning simultaneously; and process query by traversingtree nodes and associated inverted files. However; these search methods suffer from vastnumber of times of accessing inverted files; which results in slow query time and large IOcost.
