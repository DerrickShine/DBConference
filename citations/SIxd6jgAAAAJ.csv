Data on the Web: from relations to semistructured data and XML,Serge Abiteboul; Peter Buneman; Dan Suciu,The Web is causing a revolution in how we represent; retrieve; and process information Itsgrowth has given us a universally accessible database-but in the form of a largelyunorganized collection of documents. This is changing; thanks to the simultaneousemergence of new ways of representing data: from within the Web community; XML; andfrom within the database community; semistructured data. The convergence of these twoapproaches has rendered them nearly identical. Now; there is a concerted effort to developeffective techniques for retrieving and processing both kinds of data. Data on the Web is theonly comprehensive; up-to-date examination of these rapidly evolving retrieval andprocessing strategies; which are of critical importance for almost all Web-and data-intensiveenterprises.

A query language for XML,Alin Deutsch; Mary Fernandez; Daniela Florescu; Alon Levy; Dan Suciu,Abstract An important application of XML is the interchange of electronic data (EDI) betweenmultiple data sources on the Web. As XML data proliferates on the Web; applications willneed to integrate and aggregate data from multiple source and clean and transform data tofacilitate exchange. Data extraction; conversion; transformation; and integration are all well-understood database problems; and their solutions rely on a query language. We present aquery language for XML; called XML-QL; which we argue is suitable for performing theabove tasks. XML-QL is a declarative;relational complete'query language and is simpleenough that it can be optimized. XML-QL can extract data from existing XML documents andconstruct new XML documents.,Computer networks,1999,1343
Efficient query evaluation on probabilistic databases,Nilesh Dalvi; Dan Suciu,Abstract We describe a framework for supporting arbitrarily complex SQL queries with"uncertain" predicates. The query semantics is based on a probabilistic model and the resultsare ranked; much like in Information Retrieval. Our main focus is query evaluation. Wedescribe an optimization algorithm that can compute efficiently most queries. We show;however; that the data complexity of some queries is# P-complete; which implies that thesequeries do not admit any efficient evaluation methods. For these queries we describe bothan approximation algorithm and a Monte-Carlo simulation algorithm.,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2007,1077

Index structures for path expressions,Tova Milo; Dan Suciu,Abstract In recent years there has been an increased interest in managing data that does notconform to traditional data models; like the relational or object oriented model. The reasonsfor this non-conformance are diverse. On the one hand; data may not conform to suchmodels at the physical level: it may be stored in data exchange formats; fetched from theWeb; or stored as structured files. One the other hand; it may not conform at the logical level:data may have missing attributes; some attributes may be of different types in different dataitems; there may be heterogeneous collections; or the schema may be too complex orchanges too often. The term semistructured data has been used to refer to such data. Thesemistructured data model consists of an edge-labeled graph; in which nodes correspond toobjects and edges to attributes or values.

A query language and optimization techniques for unstructured data,Peter Buneman; Susan Davidson; Gerd Hillebrand; Dan Suciu,Abstract A new kind of data model has recently emerged in which the database is notconstrained by a conventional schema. Systems like ACeDB; which has become verypopular with biologists; and the recent Tsimmis proposal for data integration organize datain tree-like structures whose components can be used equally well to represent sets andtuples. Such structures allow great flexibility y in data representation. What query languageis appropriate for such structures? Here we propose a simple language UnQL for queryingdata organized as a rooted; edge-labeled graph. In this model; relational data may berepresented as fixed-depth trees; and on such trees UnQL is equivalent to the relationalalgebra. The novelty of UnQL consists in its programming constructs for arbitrarily deep dataand for cyclic structures. While strictly more powerful than query languages with path …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1996,870
Storing semistructured data with STORED,Alin Deutsch; Mary Fernandez; Dan Suciu,Abstract Systems for managing and querying semistructured-data sources often store data inproprietary object repositories or in a tagged-text format. We describe a technique that canuse relational database management systems to store and manage semistructured data.Our technique relies on a mapping between the semistructured data model and therelational data model; expressed in a query language called STORED. When asemistructured data instance is given; a STORED mapping can be generated automaticallyusing data-mining techniques. We are interested in applying STORED to XML data; which isan instance of semistructured data. We show how a document-type-descriptor (DTD); whenpresent; can be exploited to further improve performance.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1999,833
XMill: an efficient compressor for XML data,Hartmut Liefke; Dan Suciu,Abstract We describe a tool for compressing XML data; with applications in data exchangeand archiving; which usually achieves about twice the compression ratio of gzip at roughlythe same speed. The compressor; called XMill; incorporates and combines existingcompressors in order to apply them to heterogeneous XML data: it uses zlib; the libraryfunction for gzip; a collection of datatype specific compressors for simple data types; and;possibly; user defined compressors for application specific data types.,ACM Sigmod Record,2000,752
Schema mediation in peer data management systems,Alon Y Halevy; Zachary G Ives; Dan Suciu; Igor Tatarinov,Intuitively; data management and data integration tools should be well-suited for exchanginginformation in a semantically meaningful way. Unfortunately; they suffer from two significantproblems: they typically require a comprehensive schema design before they can be used tostore or share information; and they are difficult to extend because schema evolution isheavyweight and may break backwards compatibility. As a result; many small-scale datasharing tasks are more easily facilitated by nondatabase-oriented tools that have littlesupport for semantics. The goal of the peer data management system (PDMS) is to addressthis need: we propose the use of a decentralized; easily extensible data managementarchitecture in which any user can contribute new data; schema information; or evenmappings between other peer's schemas. PDMSs represent a natural step beyond data …,Data Engineering; 2003. Proceedings. 19th International Conference on,2003,572
Adding structure to unstructured data,Peter Buneman; Susan Davidson; Mary Fernandez; Dan Suciu,Abstract We develop a new schema for unstructured data. Traditional schemas resemble thetype systems of programming languages. For unstructured data; however; the underlyingtype may be much less constrained and hence an alternative way of expressing constraintson the data is needed. Here; we propose that both data and schema be represented asedge-labeled graphs. We develop notions of conformance between a graph database and agraph schema and show that there is a natural and efficiently computable ordering on graphschemas. We then examine certain subclasses of schemas and show that schemas areclosed under query applications. Finally; we discuss how they may be used in querydecomposition and optimization.,International Conference on Database Theory,1997,508
Xml-ql: A query language for xml,Alin Deutsch; Mary Fernandez; Daniela Florescu; Alon Levy; Dan Suciu,Abstract XML is a new standard that supports data exchange on the World-Wide Web. It islikely to become as important and as widely used as HTML. The availability of large amountsof data on the Web raises several issues that the XML standard does not address. Inparticular; what techniques and tools should exist for extracting data from large XMLdocuments; for translating XML data between different ontologies (DTD's); for integratingXML data from multiple XML sources; and for transporting large amounts of XML data toclients or for sending queries to XML sources.,*,1998,498
SilkRoute: trading between relations and XML,Mary Fernández; Wang-Chiew Tan; Dan Suciu,Abstract XML is the standard format for data exchange between inter-enterprise applicationson the Internet. To facilitate data exchange; industry groups define public document typedefinitions (DTDs) that specify the format of the XML data to be exchanged between theirapplications. In this paper; we address the problem of automating the conversion ofrelational data into XML. We describe SilkRoute; a general; dynamic; and efficient tool forviewing and querying relational data in XML. SilkRoute is general; because it can expressmappings of relational data into XML that conforms to arbitrary DTDs. We call thesemappings views. Applications express the data they need as an XML-QL query over theview. SilkRoute is dynamic; because it only materializes the fragment of an XML viewneeded by an application; and it is efficient; because it fully exploits the underlying …,Computer Networks,2000,462
Catching the boat with Strudel: Experiences with a web-site management system,Mary Fernandez; Daniela Florescu; Jaewoo Kang; Alon Levy; Dan Suciu,Abstract The Strudel system applies concepts from database management systems to theprocess of building Web sites. Strudel's key idea is separating the management of the site'sdata; the creation and management of the site's structure; and the visual presentation of thesite's pages. First; the site builder creates a uniform model of all data available at the site.Second; the builder uses this model to declaratively define the Web site's structure byapplying a “site-definition query” to the underlying data. The result of evaluating this query isa “site graph”; which represents both the site's content and structure. Third; the builderspecifies the visual presentation of pages in Strudel's HTML-template language. The datamodel underlying Strudel is a semi-structured model of labeled directed graphs.

Stream processing of XPath queries with predicates,Ashish Kumar Gupta; Dan Suciu,Abstract We consider the problem of evaluating large numbers of XPath filters; each withmany predicates; on a stream of XML documents. The solution we propose is to lazilyconstruct a single deterministic pushdown automata; called the XPush Machine from thegiven XPath fllters. We describe a number of optimization techniques to make the lazyXPush machine more efficient; both in terms of space and time. The combination of theseoptimizations results in high; sustained throughput. For example; if the total number ofatomic predicates in the filters is up to 200000; then the throughput is at least 0.5 MB/sec: itincreases to 4.5 MB/sec when each fllter contains a single predicate.,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2003,425
Efficient top-k query evaluation on probabilistic data,Christopher Re; Nilesh Dalvi; Dan Suciu,Modern enterprise applications are forced to deal with unreliable; inconsistent andimprecise information. Probabilistic databases can model such data naturally; but SQL queryevaluation on probabilistic databases is difficult: previous approaches have either restrictedthe SQL queries; or computed approximate probabilities; or did not scale; and it was shownrecently that precise query evaluation is theoretically hard. In this paper we describe a novelapproach; which computes and ranks efficiently the top-k answers to a SQL query on aprobabilistic database. The restriction to top-k answers is natural; since imprecisions in thedata often lead to a large number of answers of low quality; and users are interested only inthe answers with the highest probabilities. The idea in our algorithm is to run in parallelseveral Monte-Carlo simulations; one for each candidate answer; and approximate each …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007.

Data on the Web,Serge Abiteboul; Peter Buneman; Dan Suciu,Until a few years ago the publication of electronic data was limited to a few scientific andtechnical areas. It is now becoming universal. Most people see such data as Webdocuments; but these documents rather than being manually composed are increasinglygenerated automatically from databases. The documents therefore have some regularity orsome underlying structure that may or may not be understood by the user. It is possible topublish enormous volumes of data in this way; and we are now starting to see thedevelopment of software that extracts structured data from Web pages that were generatedto be readable by humans. From a document perspective; issues such as efficient retrieval;version control; change management and sophisticated methods of querying documents;which were formerly the province of database technology; are now important.

Typechecking for XML transformers,Tova Milo; Dan Suciu; Victor Vianu,Abstract We study the typechecking problem for XML (eXtensible Markup Language)transformers: given an XML transformation program and a DTD for the input XMLdocuments; check whether every result of the program conforms to a specified output DTD.We model XML transformers using a novel device called a k-pebble transducer; that canexpress most queries without data-value joins in XML-QL; XSLT; and other XML querylanguages. Types are modeled by regular tree languages; a robust extension of DTDs. Themain result of the paper is that typechecking for k-pebble transducers is decidable.Consequently; typechecking can be performed for a broad range of XML transformationlanguages; including XML-QL and a fragment of XSLT.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2003,383
Containment and equivalence for an XPath fragment,Gerome Miklau; Dan Suciu,Abstract XPath is a simple language for navigating an XML document and selecting a set ofelement nodes.

This paper studiesthe containment and equivalence problems for a fragment of the XPath query language; withapplications in all these contexts. In particular; we study a class of XPath queries that containbranching; label wildcards and can express descendant relationships between nodes.

Optimizing regular path expressions using graph schemas,Mary Fernandez; Dan Suciu,Query languages for data with irregular structure use regular path expressions fornavigation. This feature is useful for querying data where parts of the structure is eitherunknown; unavailable to the user; or changes frequently. Naive execution of regular pathexpressions is inefficient however; because it ignores any structure in the data. We describetwo optimization techniques for queries with regular path expressions. Both rely on graphschemas for specifying partial knowledge about the data's structure. Query pruning uses thisstructure to restrict navigation to only a fragment of the data; we give an efficient algorithm forrewriting any regular path expression query into a pruned one. Query rewriting using stateextents can eliminate or reduce navigation altogether; it is reminiscent of optimizingrelational queries using indices. There may be several ways to optimize a query using …,Data Engineering; 1998. Proceedings.; 14th International Conference on,1998,369
Controlling access to published data using cryptography,Gerome Miklau; Dan Suciu,Abstract We propose a framework for enforcing access control policies on published XMLdocuments using cryptography. In this framework the owner publishes a single datainstance; which is partially encrypted; and which enforces all access control policies. Ourcontributions include a declarative language for access policies; and the resolution of thesepolicies into a logical" protection model" which protects an XML tree with keys. The dataowner enforces an access control policy by granting keys to users. The model is quitepowerful; allowing the data owner to describe complex access scenarios; and is also quiteelegant; allowing logical optimizations to be described as rewriting rules. Finally; wedescribe cryptographic techniques for enforcing the protection model on published data; andprovide a performance analysis using real datasets.,Proceedings of the 29th international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 29,2003,358

What can database do for peer-to-peer?,Steven D Gribble; Alon Y Halevy; Zachary G Ives; Maya Rodrig; Dan Suciu,Abstract The Internet community has recently been focused on peer-to-peer systems likeNapster; Gnutella; and Freenet. The grand vision—a decentralized community of machinespooling their resources to benefit everyone—is compelling for many reasons: scalability;robustness; lack of need for administration; and even anonymity and resistance tocensorship. Existing peer-to-peer (P2P) systems have focused on specific applicationdomains (eg music files) or on providing filesystem-like capabilities; these systems ignorethe semantics of data. An important question for the database community is how datamanagement can be applied to P2P; and what we can learn from and contribute to the P2Parea. We address these questions; identify a number of potential research ideas in theoverlap between data management and P2P systems; present some preliminary …,WebDB,2001,355
Probabilistic databases,Dan Suciu; Dan Olteanu; Christopher Ré; Christoph Koch,Abstract Probabilistic databases are databases where the value of some attributes or thepresence of some records are uncertain and known only with some probability. Applicationsin many areas such as information extraction; RFID and scientific data management; datacleaning; data integration; and financial risk assessment produce large volumes of uncertaindata; which are best modeled and processed by a probabilistic database. This bookpresents the state of the art in representation formalisms and query processing techniquesfor probabilistic data. It starts by discussing the basic principles for representing largeprobabilistic databases; by decomposing them into tuple-independent tables; block-independent-disjoint tables; or U-databases. Then it discusses two classes of techniques forquery evaluation on probabilistic databases. In extensional query evaluation; the entire …,Synthesis Lectures on Data Management,2011,350
Boosting the accuracy of differentially private histograms through consistency,Michael Hay; Vibhor Rastogi; Gerome Miklau; Dan Suciu,Abstract We show that it is possible to significantly improve the accuracy of a general classof histogram queries while satisfying differential privacy. Our approach carefully chooses aset of queries to evaluate; and then exploits consistency constraints that should hold overthe noisy output. In a post-processing phase; we compute the consistent input most likely tohave produced the noisy output. The final output is differentially-private and consistent; butin addition; it is often much more accurate. We show; both theoretically and experimentally;that these techniques can be used for estimating the degree sequence of a graph veryprecisely; and for computing a histogram that can support arbitrary range queries accurately.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,346

The main motivation for developing Strudel is the observation that withcurrent technology; creating and managing large sites is tedious; because a site designermust simultaneously perform (at least) three tasks:(1) choosing what information will beavailable at the site;(2) organizing that information in individual pages or in graphs of linkedpages; and (3) specifying the visual presentation of pages in HTML. Furthermore; sincethere is no separation between the physical organization of the information underlying aweb site and the logical view we have on it; changing or restructuring a site are unwieldytasks.

UnQL: a query language and algebra for semistructured data based on structural recursion,Peter Buneman; Mary Fernandez; Dan Suciu,Abstract. This paper presents structural recursion as the basis of the syntax and semantics ofquery languages for semistructured data and XML. We describe a simple and powerfulquery language based on pattern matching and show that it can be expressed usingstructural recursion; which is introduced as a top-down; recursive function; similar to the wayXSL is defined on XML trees. On cyclic data; structural recursion can be defined in twoequivalent ways: as a recursive function which evaluates the data top-down and remembersall its calls to avoid infinite loops; or as a bulk evaluation which processes the entire data inparallel using only traditional relational algebra operators. The latter makes it possible foroptimization techniques in relational queries to be applied to structural recursion. We showthat the composition of two structural recursion queries can be expressed as a single …,The VLDB Journal,2000,316
Processing XML streams with deterministic automata,Todd J Green; Gerome Miklau; Makoto Onizuka; Dan Suciu,Abstract We consider the problem of evaluating a large number of XPath expressions on anXML stream. Our main contribution consists in showing that Deterministic Finite Automata(DFA) can be used effectively for this problem: in our experiments we achieve a throughputof about 5.4 MB/s; independent of the number of XPath expressions (up to 1;000;000 in ourtests). The major problem we face is that of the size of the DFA. Since the number of statesgrows exponentially with the number of XPath expressions; it was previously believed thatDFAs cannot be used to process large sets of expressions. We make a theoretical analysisof the number of states in the DFA resulting from XPath expressions; and consider both thecase when it is constructed eagerly; and when it is constructed lazily. Our analysis indicatesthat; when the automaton is constructed lazily; and under certain assumptions about the …,International Conference on Database Theory,2003,313
Event queries on correlated probabilistic streams,Christopher Ré; Julie Letchner; Magdalena Balazinksa; Dan Suciu,Abstract A major problem in detecting events in streams of data is that the data can beimprecise (eg RFID data). However; current state-ofthe-art event detection systems such asCayuga [14]; SASE [46] or SnoopIB [1]; assume the data is precise. Noise in the data can becaptured using techniques such as hidden Markov models. Inference on these modelscreates streams of probabilistic events which cannot be directly queried by existing systems.To address this challenge we propose Lahar1; an event processing system for probabilisticevent streams. By exploiting the probabilistic nature of the data; Lahar yields a much higherrecall and precision than deterministic techniques operating over only the most probabletuples. By using a novel static analysis and novel algorithms; Lahar processes data orders ofmagnitude more efficiently than a naïve approach based on sampling.

Comprehension syntax,Peter Buneman; Leonid Libkin; Dan Suciu; Val Tannen; Limsoon Wong,Abstract The syntax of comprehensions is very close to the syntax of a number of practicaldatabase query languages and is; we believe; a better starting point than first-order logic forthe development of database languages. We give an informal account of a language basedon comprehension syntax that deals uniformly with a variety of collection types; it alsoincludes pattern matching; variant types and function definition. We show; again informally;how comprehension syntax is a natural fragment of structural recursion; a much morepowerful programming paradigm for collection types. We also show that a very small"abstract syntax language" can serve as a basis for the implementation and optimization ofcomprehension syntax.,ACM Sigmod Record,1994,288

Piazza is a peer data management system thatenables sharing heterogeneous data in a distributed and scalable way. Piazza assumes theparticipants to be interested in sharing data; and willing to define pairwise mappingsbetween their schemas. Then; users formulate queries over their preferred schema; and aquery answering system expands recursively any mappings relevant to the query; retrievingdata from other peers.

We present a novel information-theoretic standard for query-view security. This criterion can be used to provide a preciseanalysis of information disclosure for a host of data exchange scenarios; including multi-party collusion and the use of outside knowledge by an adversary trying to learn privilegedfacts about the database. We prove a number of theoretical results for deciding securityaccording to this standard. We also generalize our security criterion to account for priorknowledge a user or adversary may possess; and introduce techniques for measuring the …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2007,262
Processing XML streams with deterministic automata and stream indexes,Todd J Green; Ashish Gupta; Gerome Miklau; Makoto Onizuka; Dan Suciu,Abstract We consider the problem of evaluating a large number of XPath expressions on astream of XML packets. We contribute two novel techniques. The first is to use a singleDeterministic Finite Automaton (DFA). The contribution here is to show that the DFA can beused effectively for this problem: in our experiments we achieve a constant throughput;independently of the number of XPath expressions. The major issue is the size of the DFA;which; in theory; can be exponential in the number of XPath expressions. We provide aseries of theoretical results and experimental evaluations that show that the lazy DFA has asmall number of states; for all practical purposes. These results are of general interest inXPath processing; beyond stream processing. The second technique is the Streaming IndeX(SIX); which consists of adding a small amount of binary data to each XML packet that …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2004,259
SilkRoute: A framework for publishing relational data in XML,Mary Fernández; Yana Kadiyska; Dan Suciu; Atsuyuki Morishima; Wang-Chiew Tan,Abstract XML is the" lingua franca" for data exchange between interenterprise applications.In this work; we describe SilkRoute; a framework for publishing relational data in XML. InSilkRoute; relational data is published in three steps: the relational tables are presented tothe database administrator in a canonical XML view; the database administrator defines inthe XQuery query language a public; virtual XML view over the canonical XML view; and anapplication formulates an XQuery query over the public view. SilkRoute composes theapplication query with the public-view query; translates the result into SQL; executes this onthe relational engine; and assembles the resulting tuple streams into an XML document.This work makes some key contributions to XML query processing. First; it describes analgorithm that translates an XQuery expression into SQL. The translation depends on a …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2002,253
Query optimization in the presence of limited access patterns,Daniela Florescu; Alon Levy; Ioana Manolescu; Dan Suciu,Abstract We consider the problem of query optimization in the presence of limitations onaccess patterns to the data (ie; when one must provide values for one of the attributes of arelation in order to obtain tuples). We show that in the presence of limited access patternswe must search a space of annotated query plans; where the annotations describe theinputs that must be given to the plan. We describe a theoretical and experimental analysis ofthe resulting search space and a novel query optimization algorithm that is designed toperform well under the different conditions that may arise. The algorithm searches the set ofannotated query plans; pruning invalid and non-viable plans as early as possible in thesearch space; and it also uses a best-first search strategy in order to produce a first completeplan early in the search.

The boundary between privacy and utility in data publishing,Vibhor Rastogi; Dan Suciu; Sungho Hong,Abstract We consider the privacy problem in data publishing: given a database instancecontaining sensitive information" anonymize" it to obtain a view such that; on one handattackers cannot learn any sensitive information from the view; and on the other handlegitimate users can use it to compute useful statistics. These are conflicting goals. In thispaper we prove an almost crisp separation of the case when a useful anonymizationalgorithm is possible from when it is not; based on the attacker's prior knowledge. Ourdefinition of privacy is derived from existing literature and relates the attacker's prior belief fora given tuple t; with the posterior belief for the same tuple. Our definition of utility is based onthe error bound on the estimates of counting queries. The main result has two parts. First weshow that if the prior beliefs for some tuples are large then there exists no useful …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,229

STRUDEL: a Web site management system,Mary Fernandez; Daniela Florescu; Jaewoo Kang; Alon Levy; Dan Suciu,The growth of the World-Wide Web has created a new kind of data management problem: buildingand main- taining Web sites.

Creating andmanaging large sites is tedious; because a user often must perform these tasks simultaneouslywhen creat- ing HTML pages.

MYSTIQ: a system for finding more answers by using probabilities,Jihad Boulos; Nilesh Dalvi; Bhushan Mandhani; Shobhit Mathur; Chris Re; Dan Suciu,Abstract MystiQ is a system that uses probabilistic query semantics [3] to find answers inlarge numbers of data sources of less than perfect quality. There are many reasons why thedata originating from many different sources may be of poor quality; and therefore difficult toquery: the same data item may have different representation in different sources; the schemaalignments needed by a query system are imperfect and noisy; different sources maycontain contradictory information; and; in particular; their combined data may violate someglobal integrity constraints; fuzzy matches between objects from different sources may returnfalse positives or negatives.

This paper considers the problem of query containment for a query language oversemistructured data; STRUQLO; that contains the essential feature common to all suchlanguages; namely the ability to specify regular path expressions over the data. We showhcrc that containment of STRUQLO queries is decidable. First; we give a semantic criterionfor STRUQLO query containment: WC show that it suffices to check containment on onlyfinitely many canonical databases. Second; we give a syntactic criteria for querycontainment; based on a notion of query mappings; which extends containment mappingsfor conjunctive queries. Third; wc consider a certain fragment of STRUQLO; obtained by …,Proceedings of the seventeenth ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1998,187
Probabilistic databases: diamonds in the dirt,Nilesh Dalvi; Christopher Ré; Dan Suciu,We illustrate using an example from an information extraction system. The Purple Soxasystem at Yahoo! Research focuses on technologies to extract and manage structuredinformation from the Web related to a specific community. An example is the DbLifesystem14 that aggregates structured information about the database community from dataon the Web. The system extracts lists of database researchers together with structured;related information such as publications they authored; their coauthor relationships; talksthey have given; their current affiliations; and their professional services. Figure 1 (a)illustrates the researchers' affiliations; and Figure 1 (b) illustrates their professional activities.Although most researchers have a single affiliation; in the data in Figure 1 (a); the extractedaffiliations are not unique. This occurs because outdated/erroneous information is often …,Communications of the ACM,2009,183
Declarative specification of Web sites with S,Mary Fernández; Daniela Florescu; Alon Levy; Dan Suciu,Abstract S is a system for implementing data-intensive Web sites; which typically integrateinformation from multiple data sources and have complex structure. S's key idea isseparating the management of a Web site's data; the specification of its content andstructure; and the visual representation of its pages. S provides a declarative querylanguage for specifying a site's content and structure; and a simple template language forspecifying a site's HTML representation. This paper contains a comprehensive description ofthe S system and details the benefits of declarative site specification. We describe ourexperiences using S in a production application and describe three different; butcomplementary; systems that extend and improve upon S's original ideas.,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2000,181
Semistructured data and XML,Dan Suciu,Abstract The distinguishing feature of semistructured data is that the schema is embeddedwith the data. The main challenge is to cope with the additional flexibility without sacrificingefficiency. We introduce semistructured data by presenting a syntax and describing thedatamodel. We discuss some query languages designed for semistructured data andaddress some systems issues; such as storage and XML compression.,*,2002,177
Efficient evaluation of XML middle-ware queries,Mary Fernandez; Atsuyuki Morishima; Dan Suciu,Abstract We address the problem of efficiently constructing materialized XML views ofrelational databases. In our setting; the XML view is specified by a query in the declarativequery language of a middle-ware system; called SilkRoute. The middle-ware systemevaluates a query by sending one or more SQL queries to the target relational database;integrating the resulting tuple streams; and adding the XML tags. We focus on how to bestchoose the SQL queries; without having control over the target RDBMS.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2001,174
Domain-independent queries on databases with external functions,Dan Suciu,Abstract We study queries over databases with external functions; from a language-independent perspective. The input and output types of the external functions can be atomicvalues; flat relations; nested relations; etc. We propose a new notion of data-independencefor queries on databases with external functions; which extends naturally the notion ofgeneric queries on relational databases without external functions. In contrast to previoussuch notions; ours can also be applied to queries expressed in query languages withiterations. Next; we propose two natural notions of computability for queries over databaseswith external functions; and prove that they are equivalent; under reasonable assumptions.Thus; our definition of computability is robust. Finally; based on this equivalence result; wegive examples of complete query languages with external functions. A byproduct of the …,Theoretical Computer Science,1998,174
Method for converting relational data into a structured document,*,A method for converting relational data to XML (Extensible Markup Language) is provided.The method; sometimes referred to as SilkRoute; provides a general; dynamic and efficienttool for viewing and querying relational data in XML. SilkRoute can express mappings ofrelational data in XML that conforms to arbitrary public document type definitions. Also;SilkRoute can materialize the fragment of an XML view needed by an application and it canfully exploit the query engine of a relational database management system whenever dataitems in an XML view need to be materialized.,*,2003,173
Privacy-preserving data integration and sharing,Chris Clifton; Murat Kantarcioǧlu; AnHai Doan; Gunther Schadow; Jaideep Vaidya; Ahmed Elmagarmid; Dan Suciu,Abstract Integrating data from multiple sources has been a longstanding challenge in thedatabase community. Techniques such as privacy-preserving data mining promises privacy;but assume data has integration has been accomplished. Data integration methods areseriously hampered by inability to share the data to be integrated. This paper lays out aprivacy framework for data integration. Challenges for data integration in the context of thisframework are discussed; in the context of existing accomplishments in data integration.Many of these challenges are opportunities for the data mining community.,Proceedings of the 9th ACM SIGMOD workshop on Research issues in data mining and knowledge discovery,2004,172
Approximate lineage for probabilistic databases,Christopher Ré; Dan Suciu,Abstract In probabilistic databases; lineage is fundamental to both query processing andunderstanding the data. Current systems sa Trio or Mystiq use a complete approach inwhich the lineage for a tuple t is a Boolean formula which represents all derivations of t. Inlarge databases lineage formulas can become huge: in one public database (the GeneOntology) we often observed 10MB of lineage (provenance) data for a single tuple. In thispaper we propose to use approximate lineage; which is a much smaller formula keepingtrack of only the most important derivations; which the system can use to process queriesand provide explanations. We discuss in detail two specific kinds of approximate lineage:(1)a conservative approximation called sufficient lineage that records the most importantderivations for each tuple; and (2) polynomial lineage; which is more aggressive and can …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,163
Query caching and view selection for XML databases,Bhushan Mandhani; Dan Suciu,Abstract In this paper; we propose a method for maintaining a semantic cache ofmaterialized XPath views. The cached views include queries that have been previouslyasked; and additional selected views. The cache can be stored inside or outside thedatabase. We describe a notion of XPath query/view answerability; which allows us toreduce tree operations to string operations for matching a query/view pair. We show how tostore and maintain the cached views in relational tables; so that cache lookup is veryefficient. We also describe a technique for view selection; given a warm-up workload. Weexperimentally demonstrate the efficiency of our caching techniques; and performance gainsobtained by employing such a cache.,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,155
Large-scale deduplication with constraints using dedupalog,Arvind Arasu; Christopher Ré; Dan Suciu,We present a declarative framework for collective deduplication of entity references in thepresence of constraints. Constraints occur naturally in many data cleaning domains and canimprove the quality of deduplication. An example of a constraint is" each paper has a uniquepublication venue''; if two paper references are duplicates; then their associated conferencereferences must be duplicates as well. Our framework supports collective deduplication;meaning that we can dedupe both paper references and conference references collectivelyin the example above. Our framework is based on a simple declarative Datalog-stylelanguage with precise semantics. Most previous work on deduplication eitherignoreconstraints or use them in an ad-hoc domain-specific manner. We also presentefficient algorithms to support the framework. Our algorithms have precise theoretical …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,154
Distributed query evaluation on semistructured data,Dan Suciu,Abstract Semistructured data is modeled as a rooted; labeled graph. The simplest kinds ofqueries on such data are those which traverse paths described by regular path expressions.More complex queries combine several regular path expressions; with complex datarestructuring; and with sub-queries. This article addresses the problem of efficient queryevaluation on distributed; semistructured databases. In our setting; the nodes of thedatabase are distributed over a fixed number of sites; and the edges are classified into local(with both ends in the same site) and cross edges (with ends in two distinct sites). Efficientevaluation in this context means that the number of communication steps is fixed(independent on the data or the query); and that the total amount of data sent depends onlyon the number of cross links and of the size of the query's result. We give such algorithms …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2002,149
Materialized views in probabilistic databases: for information exchange and query optimization,Christopher Ré; Dan Suciu,Abstract Views over probabilistic data contain correlations between tuples; and the currentapproach is to capture these correlations using explicit lineage. In this paper we propose analternative approach to materializing probabilistic views; by giving conditions under which aview can be represented by a block-independent disjoint (BID) table. Not all views can berepresented as BID tables and so we propose a novel partial representation that canrepresent all views but may not define a unique probability distribution. We then giveconditions on when a query's value on a partial representation will be uniquely defined. Weapply our theory to two applications: query processing using views and informationexchange using views. In query processing on probabilistic data; we can ignore the lineageand use materialized views to more efficiently answer queries. By contrast; if the view has …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,138
Towards correcting input data errors probabilistically using integrity constraints,Nodira Khoussainova; Magdalena Balazinska; Dan Suciu,Abstract Mobile and pervasive applications frequently rely on devices such as RFIDantennas or sensors (light; temperature; motion) to provide them information about thephysical world. These devices; however; are unreliable. They produce streams ofinformation where portions of data may be missing; duplicated; or erroneous. Current stateof the art is to correct errors locally (eg; range constraints for temperature readings) or usespatial/temporal correlations (eg; smoothing temperature readings). However; errors areoften apparent only in a global setting; eg; missed readings of objects that are known to bepresent; or exit readings from a parking garage without matching entry readings. In thispaper; we present StreamClean; a system for correcting input data errors automaticallyusing application defined global integrity constraints. Because it is frequently impossible …,Proceedings of the 5th ACM international workshop on Data engineering for wireless and mobile access,2006,138
Programming constructs for unstructured data,Peter Buneman; Susan B Davidson; Dan Suciu,Abstract We investigate languages for querying and transforming unstructured data; bywhich we mean languages than can be used without knowledge of the structure (schema) ofthe database. Such data can be represented using labeled trees; as suggested by ACeDB(A C. elegans Database); a database system popular with biologists; and more recently inTsimmis; a system developed at Stanford for heterogeneous data integration. The approachwe take is to extend structural recursion to labeled trees. This poses some interestingproblems: first; it is no longer``flatТТ structural recursion; so that the usual syntactic formsand optimizations for collection types such as lists bags and sets may not be relevant.Second; we shall want to examine the possibility that the values we are manipulating maybe cyclic. It is common in ACeDB; and generally in object-oriented databases; for objects …,IRCS Technical Reports Series,1995,136
SnipSuggest: Context-aware autocompletion for SQL,Nodira Khoussainova; YongChul Kwon; Magdalena Balazinska; Dan Suciu,Abstract In this paper; we present SnipSuggest; a system that provides on-the-go; context-aware assistance in the SQL composition process. SnipSuggest aims to help the increasingpopulation of non-expert database users; who need to perform complex analysis on theirlarge-scale datasets; but have difficulty writing SQL queries. As a user types a query;SnipSuggest recommends possible additions to various clauses in the query using relevantsnippets collected from a log of past queries. SnipSuggest's current capabilities includesuggesting tables; views; and table-valued functions in the FROM clause; columns in theSELECT clause; predicates in the WHERE clause; columns in the GROUP BY clause;aggregates; and some support for sub-queries. SnipSuggest adjusts its recommendationsaccording to the context: as the user writes more of the query; it is able to provide more …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,127
The complexity of causality and responsibility for query answers and non-answers,Alexandra Meliou; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Katherine F Moore; Dan Suciu,Abstract An answer to a query has a well-defined lineage expression (alternatively calledhow-provenance) that explains how the answer was derived. Recent work has also shownhow to compute the lineage of a non-answer to a query. However; the cause of an answer ornon-answer is a more subtle notion and consists; in general; of only a fragment of thelineage. In this paper; we adapt Halpern; Pearl; and Chockler's recent definitions of causalityand responsibility to define the causes of answers and non-answers to queries; and theirdegree of responsibility. Responsibility captures the notion of degree of causality and servesto rank potentially many causes by their relative contributions to the effect. Then; we studythe complexity of computing causes and responsibilities for conjunctive queries. It is knownthat computing causes is NP-complete in general. Our first main result shows that all …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,118
Querying XML data,Alin Deutsch; Mary F.  Fernandez; Daniela Florescu; Alon Y.  Levy; David Maier; Dan Suciu,XML threatens to expand beyond its document markup origins to become the basis for datainterchange on the Internet. One highly anticipated application of XML is the interchange ofelectronic data (EDI). Unlike existing Web documents; electronic data is primarily intendedfor computer; not human; consumption. For example; businesses could publish data abouttheir products and services; and potential customers could compare and process thisinformation automatically; business partners could exchange internal operational databetween their information systems on secure channels; search robots could integrateautomatically information from related sources that publish their data in XML format; likestock quotes from financial sites; sports scores from news sites. New opportunities will arisefor third parties to add value by integrating; transforming; cleaning; and aggregating XML …,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,1999,118
Structured querying of Web text,Michael J Cafarella; Christopher Re; Dan Suciu; Oren Etzioni; Michele Banko,ABSTRACT The Web contains a huge amount of text that is currently beyond the reach ofstructured access tools. This unstructured data often contains a substantial amount of implicitstructure; much of which can be captured using information extraction (IE) algorithms. Bycombining an IE system with an appropriate data model and query language; we couldenable structured access to all of the Web's unstructured data. We propose a general-purpose query system called the extraction database; or ExDB; which supports SQL-likestructured queries over Web text. We also describe the technical challenges involved;motivated in part by our experiences with an early 90M-page prototype.,3rd Biennial Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR); Asilomar; California; USA,2007,116
XML with data values: typechecking revisited,Noga Alon; Tova Milo; Frank Neven; Dan Suciu; Victor Vianu,Abstract We investigate the typechecking problem for XML queries: statically verifying thatevery answer to a query conforms to a given output DTD; for inputs satisfying a given inputDTD. This problem had been studied by a subset of the authors in a simplified frameworkthat captured the structure of XML documents but ignored data values. We revisit here thetypechecking problem in the more realistic case when data values are present in documentsand tested by queries. In this extended framework; typechecking quickly becomesundecidable. However; it remains decidable for large classes of queries and DTDs ofpractical interest. The main contribution of the present paper is to trace a fairly tight boundaryof decidability for typechecking with data values. The complexity of typechecking in thedecidable cases is also considered.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2003,116
An overview of semistructured data,Dan Suciu,Abstract this paper. The model however has its limitations; since it ignores somecharacteristics of semistructured data; like the fact that edges in the graph can be traversedonly forwards; or that sometimes the order of the attributes matters. The purpose of paper isto give an overview of the research on semistructured data and briefly illustrate some of itstheoretical and formal aspects. We describe the semistructured data model in Sec. 2 andillustrate a few query languages in Sec. 3. We discuss schema formalisms for semistructureddata in Sec. 4 and conclude in Sec. 5. 2 Data Model,*,1998,113
Relationship privacy: output perturbation for queries with joins,Vibhor Rastogi; Michael Hay; Gerome Miklau; Dan Suciu,Abstract We study privacy-preserving query answering over data containing relationships. Asocial network is a prime example of such data; where the nodes represent individuals andedges represent relationships. Nearly all interesting queries over social networks involvejoins; and for such queries; existing output perturbation algorithms severely distort queryanswers. We propose an algorithm that significantly improves utility over competingtechniques; typically reducing the error bound from polynomial in the number of nodes topolylogarithmic. The algorithm is; to the best of our knowledge; the first to answer suchqueries with acceptable accuracy; even for worst-case inputs. The improved utility isachieved by relaxing the privacy condition. Instead of ensuring strict differential privacy; weguarantee a weaker (but still quite practical) condition based on adversarial privacy.

Topological queries in spatial databases,Christos H Papadimitriou; Dan Suciu; Victor Vianu,We studytopological queriesover two-dimensional spatial databases. First; we show that thetopological properties of semi-algebraic spatial regions can be completely specified using aclassical finite structure; essentially the embedded planar graph of the region boundaries.This provides aninvariantcharacterizing semi-algebraic regions up to homeomorphism. Alltopological queries on semi-algebraic regions can be answered by queries on the invariantwhose complexity is polynomially related to the original. Also; we show that for the purposeof answering topological queries; semi-algebraic regions can always be represented simplyas polygonal regions. We then study query languages for topological properties of two-dimensional spatial databases; starting from the topological relationships between pairs ofplanar regions introduced by Egenhofer. We show that the closure of these relationships …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,1999,110

Distributed evalulation of directory queries using a topology cache,*,A technique for performing query evaluation on distributed directories utilizes the creation ofa “topology cache” defining the hierarchical relationship between the various directoryservers (ie; identifying “subordinate” and “superior” knowledge references associated witheach directory server in the system). The created topology cache is then stored at eachdirectory server; and forwarded to a client upon submitting a query to the system. Using thetopology cache information at the client; a distributed query evaluation plan can bedeveloped for use with complex queries; such as hierarchical and aggregate queries.,*,2005,99
A formal perspective on the view selection problem,Rada Chirkova; Alon Y Halevy; Dan Suciu,Abstract The view selection problem is to choose a set of views to materialize over adatabase schema; such that the cost of evaluating a set of workload queries is minimizedand such that the views fit into a prespecified storage constraint. The two main applicationsof the view selection problem are materializing views in a database to speed up queryprocessing; and selecting views to materialize in a data warehouse to answer decisionsupport queries. We describe several fundamental results concerning the view selectionproblem. We consider the problem for views and workloads that consist of equalityselection;project and join queries; and show that the complexity of the problem depends crucially onthe quality of the estimates that a query optimizer has on the size of the views it isconsidering to materialize. When a query optimizer has good estimates of the sizes of the …,VLDB,2001,98
Answering queries from statistics and probabilistic views,Nilesh Dalvi; Dan Suciu,Abstract Systems integrating dozens of databases; in the scientific domain or in a largecorporation; need to cope with a wide variety of imprecisions; such as: differentrepresentations of the same object in different sources; imperfect and noisy schemaalignments; contradictory information across sources; constraint violations; or insufficientevidence to answer a given query.

The dichotomy of conjunctive queries on probabilistic structures,Nilesh Dalvi; Dan Suciu,Abstract We show that for every conjunctive query; the complexity of evaluating it on aprobabilistic database is either PTIME or P-complete; and we give an algorithm for decidingwhether a given conjunctive query is PTIME or P-complete. The dichotomy property is afundamental result on query evaluation on probabilistic databases and it gives a completeclassification of the complexity of conjunctive queries.,Proceedings of the twenty-sixth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2007,95
Communication steps for parallel query processing,Paul Beame; Paraschos Koutris; Dan Suciu,Abstract We study the problem of computing conjunctive queries over large databases onparallel architectures without shared storage. Using the structure of such a query q and theskew in the data; we study tradeoffs between the number of processors; the number ofrounds of communication; and the per-processor load—the number of bits each processorcan send or can receive in a single round—that are required to compute q. Since eachprocessor must store its received bits; the load is at most the number of bits of storage perprocessor. When the data are free of skew; we obtain essentially tight upper and lowerbounds for one round algorithms; and we show how the bounds degrade when there isskew in the data. In the case of skewed data; we show how to improve the algorithms whenapproximate degrees of the (necessarily small number of) heavy-hitter elements are …,Journal of the ACM (JACM),2017,93

Introducing a novel traces technique; we show that the problem isdifficult in general (NP-complete); but can be solved in PTIME for many practical cases;including; in particular; queries over XML data. Besides being interesting by itself; we showthat type inference and the related traces technique have several important applications;facilitating query formulation; optimization; and verification.,Proceedings of the eighteenth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1999,93
Publishing relational data in xml: the silkroute approach,Mary F.  Fernandez; Atsuyuki Morishima; Dan Suciu; Wang Chiew  Tan,For exchange on the Internet; relational data needs to be mapped to XML; a process that wecall XML publishing. The mapping is complex; because the two data models differsignificantly. Relational data is flat; normalized into many relations; and its schema is oftenproprietary. By contrast; XML data is nested; unnormalized; and its schema is public; usuallycreated by agreement between members of a community; after lengthy negotiations.Publishing XML data involves joining tables; selecting and projecting the data that needs tobe exported; mapping the relational table and attribute names into XML element andattribute names; creating XML hierarchies; and processing values in an application specificmanner. The XML data is a view over the relational database and; as such; can be virtual ormaterialized. In a virtual view; applications consuming XML data do so by applying XML …,IEEE Data Eng.

Schema mediation for large-scale semantic data sharing,Y Halevy; G Ives; Dan Suciu; Igor Tatarinov,Abstract Intuitively; data management and data integration tools should be well suited forexchanging information in a semantically meaningful way. Unfortunately; they suffer fromtwo significant problems: they typically require a common and comprehensive schemadesign before they can be used to store or share information; and they are difficult to extendbecause schema evolution is heavyweight and may break backward compatibility. As aresult; many large-scale data sharing tasks are more easily facilitated by non-database-oriented tools that have little support for semantics. The goal of the peer data managementsystem (PDMS) is to address this need: we propose the use of a decentralized; easilyextensible data management architecture in which any user can contribute new data;schema information; or even mappings between other peers' schemas. PDMSs represent …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2005,90
On database theory and XML,Dan Suciu,Abstract Over the years; the connection between database theory and database practice hasweakened.

Query decomposition and view maintenance for query languages for unstructured data,Dan Suciu,Abstract Recently; several query languages have been proposed for querying informationsources whose data is not constrained by a schema; or whose schema is unknown.Examples include: LOREL (for querying data combined from several heterogeneoussources); W3QS (for querying the World Wide Web); and UnQL (for querying unstructureddata). The natural data model for such languages is that of a rooted; labeled graph. Theirmain novelty is the ability to express queries which traverse arbitrarily long paths in thegraph; typically described by a regular expression. Such queries however may prove di cultto evaluate in the case when the data is distributed on several sites; with many edges goingbetween sites. A typical case is that of a collection of WWW sites; with links pointing freelyfrom one site to another (even forming cycles). A naive query shipping strategy may force …,VLDB,1996,89
The XML typechecking problem,Dan Suciu,Abstract When an XML document conforms to a given type (eg a DTD or an XML Schematype) it is called a valid document. Checking if a given XML document is valid is called thevalidation problem; and is typically performed by a parser (hence; validating parser); moreprecisely it is performed right after parsing; by the same program module. In practicehowever XML documents are often generated dynamically; by some program: checkingwhether all XML documents generated by the program are valid wrt a given type is calledthe typechecking problem. While a validation analyzes an XML document; a type checkeranalyzes a program; and the problem's difficulty is a function of the language in which thatprogram is expressed. The XML typechecking problem has been investigated recently in[MSV00; HP00; HVP00; AMN+ 01a; AMN+ 01b] and the XQuery Working Group adopted …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2002,85

Cascadia: a system for specifying; detecting; and managing RFID events,Evan Welbourne; Nodira Khoussainova; Julie Letchner; Yang Li; Magdalena Balazinska; Gaetano Borriello; Dan Suciu,Abstract Cascadia is a system that provides RFID-based pervasive computing applicationswith an infrastructure for specifying; extracting and managing meaningful high-level eventsfrom raw RFID data. Cascadia provides three important services. First; it allows applicationdevelopers and even users to specify events using either a declarative query language oran intuitive visual language based on direct manipulation. Second; it provides an API thatfacilitates the development of applications which rely on RFID-based events. Third; itautomatically detects the specified events; forwards them to registered applications andstores them for later use (eg; for historical queries). We present the design andimplementation of Cascadia along with an evaluation that includes both a user study andmeasurements on traces collected in a building-wide RFID deployment.

Deciding containment for queries with complex objects,Alon Y Levy; Dan Suciu,Abstract We address the problem of query containment and query equivalence for complexobjects. We show that for a certain conjunctive query language for complex objects; querycontainment and weak query equivalence are decidable. Our results also have twoimportant consequences. Fist; when the answers of the two queries are guaranteed not tocontain empty sets; then weak equivalence coincides with equivalence; and our resultanswers partially an open problem about the equivalence of nest; unmst queries for complexobjects [24]. Second; we show that checking the equivalence of conjunctive queries withgrouping and aggregates is NP-complete. Our results rely on a translation of thecontainment and equivalence conditions for complex objects into novel conditions onconjunctive queries; which we call simulation and strong simulation respectively.

Probabilistic event extraction from rfid data,Nodira Khoussainova; Magdalena Balazinska; Dan Suciu,Abstract-We present PEEX; a system that enables applica- tions to define and extract meaningfulprobabilistic high-level events from RFID data. PEEX effectively copes with errors in the dataand the inherent ambiguity of event extraction. I. INTRODUCTION The success of Radio FrequencyIdentification technology in industrial settings is leading many to consider pervasive deploymentsof the technology; where objects and people carry tags and RFID readers are scattered throughthe environment. RFID holds the promise of enabling many user-oriented ap- plications fromasset tracking [11] and alerting services [1]; to sophisticated elder-careapplications [9].

XMLTK: An XML toolkit for scalable XML stream processing,Iliana Avila-Campillo; Todd J Green; Ashish Gupta; Makoto Onizuka; Demian Raven; Dan Suciu,Abstract We describe a toolkit for highly scalable XML data processing; consisting of twocomponents. The first is a collection of stand-alone XML tools; sa sort-ing; aggregation;nesting; and unnesting; that can be chained to express more complex restructurings. Thesecond is a highly scalable XPath processor for XML streams that can be used to developscalable solutions for XML stream applications. In this paper we dis-cuss the tools; andsome of the techniques we used to achieve high scalability. The toolkit is freely available asan open-source project.,Database Research Group (CIS),2002,80
A case for a collaborative query management system,Nodira Khoussainova; Magda Balazinska; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; YongChul Kwon; Dan Suciu,Abstract: Over the past 40 years; database management systems (DBMSs) have evolved toprovide a sophisticated variety of data management capabilities. At the same time; tools formanaging queries over the data have remained relatively primitive. One reason for this isthat queries are typically issued through applications. They are thus debugged once and re-used repeatedly. This mode of interaction; however; is changing. As scientists (and others)store and share increasingly large volumes of data in data centers; they need the ability toanalyze the data by issuing exploratory queries. In this paper; we argue that; in these newsettings; data management systems must provide powerful query management capabilities;from query browsing to automatic query recommendations. We first discuss the requirementsfor a collaborative query management system. We outline an early system architecture …,arXiv preprint arXiv:0909.1778,2009,75
Causality in databases,Alexandra Meliou; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Joseph Y Halpern; Christoph Koch; Katherine F Moore; Dan Suciu,Abstract Provenance is often used to validate data; by verifying its origin and explaining itsderivation. When searching for “causes” of tuples in the query results or in generalobservations; the analysis of lineage becomes an essential tool for providing suchjustifications. However; lineage can quickly grow very large; limiting its immediate use forproviding intuitive explanations to the user. The formal notion of causality is a more refinedconcept that identifies causes for observations based on user-defined criteria; and thatassigns to them gradual degrees of responsibility based on their respective contributions. Inthis paper; we initiate a discussion on causality in databases; give some simple definitions;and motivate this formalism through a number of example applications.,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2010,73

Lifted inference seen from the other side: The tractable features,Abhay Jha; Vibhav Gogate; Alexandra Meliou; Dan Suciu,Abstract Lifted inference algorithms for representations that combine first-order logic andprobabilistic graphical models have been the focus of much recent research. All liftedalgorithms developed to date are based on the same underlying idea: take a standardprobabilistic inference algorithm (eg; variable elimination; belief propagation etc.) andimprove its efficiency by exploiting repeated structure in the first-order model. In this paper;we propose an approach from the other side in that we use techniques from logic forprobabilistic inference. In particular; we define a set of rules that look only at the logicalrepresentation to identify models for which exact efficient inference is possible. We show thatour rules yield several new tractable classes that cannot be solved efficiently by any of theexisting techniques.,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,2010,72
Optimization of run-time management of data intensive web-sites,Daniela Florescu; Alon Levy; Dan Suciu; Khaled Yagoub,Abstract An increasing number of web sites have their data extracted from relationaldatabases. Several commercial products and research prototypes have been moving in thedirection of declarative speciﬁcation of the sites' structure and content. Speciﬁcally; the entiresite is speciﬁed using a collection of queries describing the site's nodes (corresponding toweb pages and the data contained in them) and edges (corresponding to the hyperlinks).Given this paradigm; an important issue is when to compute the site's pages. Two extremeapproaches; with obvious drawbacks; are (1) to precompute the entire site in advance; and(2) to evaluate on demand all the queries necessary to construct a given page. We considerthe problem of automatically optimizing the run-time management of declaratively speciﬁedweb sites. In our approach; given a declarative site speciﬁcation and constraints on the …,VLDB,1999,70
A theory of pricing private data,Chao Li; Daniel Yang Li; Gerome Miklau; Dan Suciu,Abstract Personal data has value to both its owner and to institutions who would like toanalyze it. Privacy mechanisms protect the owner's data while releasing to analysts noisyversions of aggregate query results. But such strict protections of the individual's data havenot yet found wide use in practice. Instead; Internet companies; for example; commonlyprovide free services in return for valuable sensitive information from users; which theyexploit and sometimes sell to third parties. As awareness of the value of personal dataincreases; so has the drive to compensate the end-user for her private information. The ideaof monetizing private data can improve over the narrower view of hiding private data; since itempowers individuals to control their data through financial means.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2014,69
Parallel evaluation of conjunctive queries,Paraschos Koutris; Dan Suciu,Abstract The availability of large data centers with tens of thousands of servers has led to thepopular adoption of massive parallelism for data analysis on large datasets. Several querylanguages exist for running queries on massively parallel architectures; some based on theMapReduce infrastructure; others using proprietary implementations. Motivated by this trend;this paper analyzes the parallel complexity of conjunctive queries. We propose a very simplemodel of parallel computation that captures these architectures; in which the complexityparameter is the number of parallel steps requiring synchronization of all servers. We studythe complexity of conjunctive queries and give a complete characterization of the querieswhich can be computed in one parallel step. These form a strict subset of hierarchicalqueries; and include flat queries like R (x; y); S (x; z); T (x; v); U (x; w); tall queries like R (x …,Proceedings of the thirtieth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2011,69
Distributed xquery,Christopher Re; Jim Brinkley; Kevin Hinshaw; Dan Suciu,XQuery is increasingly being used for ad-hoc integration of heterogeneous data sources thatare logically mapped to XML. For example; scientists need to query multiple scientificdatabases; which are distributed over a large geographic area; and it is possible to useXQuery for that. However; the language currently supports only the data shipping queryevaluation model (through the document () function): it fetches all data sources to a singleserver; then runs the query there. This is a major limitation for many applications; especiallywhen some data sources are very large; or when a data source is only a virtual XML viewover some other logical data model. We propose here a simple extension to XQuery thatallows query shipping to be expressed in the language; in addition to data shipping.,Workshop on Information Integration on the Web,2004,69
Query-based data pricing,Paraschos Koutris; Prasang Upadhyaya; Magdalena Balazinska; Bill Howe; Dan Suciu,Abstract Data is increasingly being bought and sold online; and Web-based marketplaceservices have emerged to facilitate these activities. However; current mechanisms for pricingdata are very simple: buyers can choose only from a set of explicit views; each with aspecific price. In this article; we propose a framework for pricing data on the Internet that;given the price of a few views; allows the price of any query to be derived automatically. Wecall this capability query-based pricing. We first identify two important properties that thepricing function must satisfy; the arbitrage-free and discount-free properties. Then; we provethat there exists a unique function that satisfies these properties and extends the seller'sexplicit prices to all queries. Central to our framework is the notion of query determinacy; andin particular instance-based determinacy: we present several results regarding the …,Journal of the ACM (JACM),2015,68
The dichotomy of probabilistic inference for unions of conjunctive queries,Nilesh Dalvi; Dan Suciu,Abstract We study the complexity of computing a query on a probabilistic database. Weconsider unions of conjunctive queries; UCQ; which are equivalent to positive; existentialFirst Order Logic sentences; and also to nonrecursive datalog programs. The tuples in thedatabase are independent random events. We prove the following dichotomy theorem. Forevery UCQ query; either its probability can be computed in polynomial time in the size of thedatabase; or is &num; P-hard. Our result also has applications to the problem of computingthe probability of positive; Boolean expressions; and establishes a dichotomy for suchclasses based on their structure. For the tractable case; we give a very simple algorithm thatalternates between two steps: applying the inclusion/exclusion formula; and removing oneexistential variable. A key and novel feature of this algorithm is that it avoids computing …,Journal of the ACM (JACM),2012,65
Dynamically distributed query evaluation,Trevor Jim; Dan Suciu,Distributed query evaluation usually assumes a fixed topology; where the set of servers andthe partitioning of data on the serv ers is kno wn in advance. Given a query expression; anoptimizer will first produce a global plan; then assign a server for each operator in the plan.The query is then evaluated distributively; according to that plan. Ho w ever; in the Web;topology is discovereddynamically: by follo wing a link; we disco ver new links that werepreviously unknown. It is impossible to construct a global plan ahead of time; or to pre-assign sites to operators. The Web requires a reexamination of the distributed queryevaluation paradigm.,Proceedings of the twentieth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART Symposium on Principles of Database Systems,2001,65
Parallel skyline queries,Foto N Afrati; Paraschos Koutris; Dan Suciu; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract In this paper; we design and analyze parallel algorithms for skyline queries. Theskyline of a multidimensional set consists of the points for which no other point exists that isat least as good along every dimension. As a framework for parallel computation; we useboth the MP model proposed in Koutris and Suciu (2011); which requires that the data isperfectly load-balanced; and a variation of the model in Afrati and Ullman (2010); the GMPmodel; which demands weaker load balancing constraints. In addition to load balancing; wewant to minimize the number of blocking steps; where all processors must wait andsynchronize. We propose a 2-step algorithm in the MP model for any dimension of thedataset; as well a 1-step algorithm for the case of 2 and 3 dimensions. Finally; we present a1-step algorithm in the GMP model for any number of dimensions and a 1-step algorithm …,Theory of Computing Systems,2015,64
Verifying integrity constraints on web sites,Mary Fernandez; Daniela Florescu; Alon Levy; Dan Suciu,Abstract Data-intensive Web sites have created a new form of knowledge base; as richlystructured bodies of data. Several novel systems for creating dataintensive Web sitessupport declarative specification of a site's structure and content (ie; the pages; the dataavailable in each page; and the links between pages). Declarative systems provide aplatform on which A1 techniques can be developed that; further simplify the tasks ofconstructing and maintaining Web sites. This paper addresses the problem of specifying andverifying integrity constraints on a Web site's structure. We describe a language that cancapture many practical constraints and an accompanying sound and complete verificationalgorithm. The algorithm has the important property that if the constraints are violated; itproposes fixes to either the constraints or to the site definition. Finally; we establish tight …,IJCAI,1999,64
Skew in parallel query processing,Paul Beame; Paraschos Koutris; Dan Suciu,Abstract We study the problem of computing a conjunctive query q in parallel; using p ofservers; on a large database. We consider algorithms with one round of communication; andstudy the complexity of the communication. We are especially interested in the case wherethe data is skewed; which is a major challenge for scalable parallel query processing. Weestablish a tight connection between the fractional edge packing of the query and theamount of communication in two cases. First; in the case when the only statistics on thedatabase are the cardinalities of the input relations; and the data is skew-free; we providematching upper and lower bounds (up to a polylogarithmic factor of p) expressed in terms offractional edge packings of the query q. Second; in the case when the relations are skewedand the heavy hitters and their frequencies are known; we provide upper and lower …,Proceedings of the 33rd ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2014,60
XML: model; schemas; types; logics; and queries,Nils Klarlund; Thomas Schwentick; Dan Suciu,Abstract It is intriguing that something as bland as a syntax for trees has become one of theleading buzzwords of the Internet era. XML (eXtended Markup Language) is the name of thisnotation; which evolved from document processing needs. This mystery is deepened by theapparent antiquity of the central idea—that linear syntax can represent trees. S-expressions;invented some 40 years ago; are at least as general; but never became the universallyaccepted foundation for data interchange and programming; despite their enormousinfluence in programming language theory and artificial intelligence research. Additionally;trees have been studied intensively in computer science ever since; so we might suspectthat the reason for the excitement is simply that practitioners are catching up with methods ofabstraction and representation via trees that are well known in academia.,*,2004,60
Translating XSLT programs to Efficient SQL queries,Sushant Jain; Ratul Mahajan; Dan Suciu,Abstract We present an algorithm for translating XSLT programs into SQL. Our context is thatof virtual XML publishing; in which a single XML view is defined from a relational database;and subsequently queried with XSLT programs. Each XSLT program is translated into asingle SQL query and run entirely in the database engine. Our translation works for a largefragment of XSLT; which we define; that includes descendant/ancestor axis; recursivetemplates; modes; parameters; and aggregates. We put considerable effort in generatingcorrect and efficient SQL queries and describe several optimization techniques to achievethis efficiency. We have tested our system on all 22 SQL queries of the TPC-H databasebenchmark which we represented in XSLT and then translated back to SQL using ourtranslator.,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on World Wide Web,2002,60

Physical access control for captured RFID data,Travis Kriplean; Evan Welbourne; Nodira Khoussainova; Vibhor Rastogi; Magdalena Balazinska; Gaetano Borriello; Tadayoshi Kohno; Dan Suciu,To protect the privacy of RFID data after an authorized system captures it; this policy-basedapproach constrains the data users can access to system events that occurred when andwhere they were physically present. RFID security is a vibrant research area; with manyprotection mechanisms against unauthorized RFID cloning and reading attacks emerging.However; little work has yet addressed the complementary issue of protecting the privacy ofRFID data after an authorized system has captured and stored it. We've investigated peer-to-peer privacy for personal RFID data through an access-control policy called Physical AccessControl. PAC protects privacy by constraining the data a user can obtain from the system tothose events that occurred when and where that user was physically present.

Asymptotic conditional probabilities for conjunctive queries,Nilesh Dalvi; Gerome Miklau; Dan Suciu,Abstract We study the asymptotic probabilities of conjunctive queries on random graphs. Weconsider a probabilistic model where the expected graph size remains constantindependent of the number of vertices. While it has been known that a convergence lawholds for conjunctive queries under this model; we focus on the calculation of conditionalprobabilities. This has direct applications to database problems like query-view security; ieevaluating the probability of a sensitive query given the knowledge of a set of publishedviews. We prove that a convergence law holds for conditional probabilities of conjunctivequeries and we give a procedure for calculating the conditional probabilities.,International Conference on Database Theory,2005,56

An integrated view is createdaccording to the information definition query. A site definition query is received for defining asite view for the non-uniform information at the web-site.

Bounded fixpoints for complex objects,Dan Suciu,Abstract We investigate a query language for complex-object databases; which is designedto (1) express only tractable queries; and (2) be as expressive over flat relations as first orderlogic with fixpoints. The language is obtained by extending the nested relational algebraNRA; of [9]; with a “bounded fixpoint” operator. Extending the flat case [15; 21]; all PTimecomputable queries over ordered databases are expressible in this language. The mainresult consists in proving that this language is a conservative extension of the first order logicwith fixpoints; or of the while-queries (depending on the interpretation of the boundedfixpoint: inflationary or partial). The proof technique uses indexes; to encode complexobjects into flat relations; and is strong enough to allow for the encoding of NRA withunbounded fixpoints into flat relations. We also define a complex object logic based …,*,1994,55

An extensible compressor for XML data,Hartmut Liefke; Dan Suciu,We have implemented a compressor (XMilI) and decompressor (XDemill) for XML data; tobe used in data exchange and archiving; which can be downloaded from http://www.research. att. com/sw/tools/xmill. XMill compresses about twice as good as gzip; at about thesame speed. It does not need a DTD in order to compress; and preserves the input XML filefaithfully; including element order; attributes order; PI's; comments; the DTD; etc. A novelty inXMill is that it allows users to combine existing compressors in order to compressheterogeneous XML data: by default it uses zlib; a library function implementing gzip'sfunctionality; and includes some standard compression techniques for simple data types.Further; XMill is extensible with user-defined compressors for complex data types; such asDNA sequences or images.

Knowledge compilation meets database theory: compiling queries to decision diagrams,Abhay Jha; Dan Suciu,Abstract The goal of Knowledge Compilation is to represent a Boolean expression in aformat in which it can answer a range of “online-queries” in PTIME. The online-query of maininterest to us is model counting; because of its application to query evaluation onprobabilistic databases; but other online-queries can be supported as well such as testingfor equivalence; testing for implication; etc. In this paper we study the following problem:given a database query q; decide whether its lineage can be compiled efficiently into a giventarget language. We consider four target languages; of strictly increasing expressive power(when the size of compilation is restricted to be polynomial in the data size): read-onceBoolean formulae; OBDD; FBDD and d-DNNF. For each target; we study the class ofdatabase queries that admit polynomial size representation: these queries can also be …,Theory of Computing Systems,2013,52
Typechecking XML views of relational databases,Noga Alon; Tova Milo; Frank Neven; Dan Suciu; Victor Vianu,Abstract Motivated by the need to export relational databases as XML data in the context ofthe Web; we investigate the typechecking problem for transformations of relational data intotree data (XML). The problem consists of statically verifying that the output of everytransformation belongs to a given output tree language (specified for XML by a DTD); forinput databases satisfying given integrity constraints. The typechecking problem isparameterized by the class of formulas defining the transformation; the class of output treelanguages; and the class of integrity constraints. While undecidable in its most generalformulation; the typechecking problem has many special cases of practical interest that turnout to be decidable. The main contribution of this article is to trace a fairly tight boundary ofdecidability for typechecking in this framework. In the decidable cases we examine the …,ACM Transactions on Computational Logic (TOCL),2003,52
Typechecking for semistructured data,Dan Suciu,Abstract Semistructured data is used in data exchange applications; like B2B and EAI; andrepresents data in a flexible format. Every data item has a unique tag (also called label); anddata items can be nested. Formally; a semistructured data instance is a tree whose nodesare labeled with tags and leaves are labeled with data values. XML [Con98] is a standardsyntax for describing such trees; Fig. 1 shows a tree representing a semistructured datainstance and its XML syntax. We will refer interchangeably to semistructured data instancesas trees or XML trees.,International workshop on database programming languages,2001,52
A formal approach to finding explanations for database queries,Sudeepa Roy; Dan Suciu,Abstract As a consequence of the popularity of big data; many users with a variety ofbackgrounds seek to extract high level information from datasets collected from varioussources and combined using data integration techniques. A major challenge for research indata management is to develop tools to assist users in explaining observed query outputs. Inthis paper we introduce a principled approach to provide explanations for answers to SQLqueries based on intervention: removal of tuples from the database that significantly affectthe query answers. We provide a formal definition of intervention in the presence of multiplerelations which can interact with each other through foreign keys. First we give a set ofrecursive rules to compute the intervention for any given explanation in polynomial time(data complexity). Then we give simple and efficient algorithms based on SQL queries …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,51
From theory to practice: Efficient join query evaluation in a parallel database system,Shumo Chu; Magdalena Balazinska; Dan Suciu,Abstract Big data analytics often requires processing complex queries using massiveparallelism; where the main performance metrics is the communication cost incurred duringdata reshuffling. In this paper; we describe a system that can compute efficiently complexjoin queries; including queries with cyclic joins; on a massively parallel architecture. Webuild on two independent lines of work for multi-join query evaluation: a communication-optimal algorithm for distributed evaluation; and a worst-case optimal algorithm forsequential evaluation. We evaluate these algorithms together; then describe novel; practicaloptimizations for both algorithms.,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,50
A framework for using reference ontologies as a foundation for the semantic web,James F Brinkley; Dan Suciu; Landon T Detwiler; John H Gennari; Cornelius Rosse; Structural Informatics Group,Abstract The semantic web is envisioned as an evolving set of local ontologies that aregradually linked together into a global knowledge network. Many such local “application”ontologies are being built; but it is difficult to link them together because of incompatibilitiesand lack of adherence to ontology standards.“Reference” ontologies are an emergingontology type that attempt to represent deep knowledge of basic science in a principled waythat allows them to be re-used in multiple ways; just as the basic sciences are re-used inclinical applications. As such they have the potential to be a foundation for the semantic webif methods can be developed for deriving application ontologies from them.

Computing query probability with incidence algebras,Nilesh Dalvi; Karl Schnaitter; Dan Suciu,Abstract We describe an algorithm that evaluates queries over probabilistic databases usingMobius' inversion formula in incidence algebras. The queries we consider are unions ofconjunctive queries (equivalently: existential; positive First Order sentences); and theprobabilistic databases are tuple-independent structures. Our algorithm runs in PTIME on asubset of queries called" safe" queries; and is complete; in the sense that every unsafequery is hard for the class FP# P. The algorithm is very simple and easy to implement inpractice; yet it is non-obvious. Mobius' inversion formula; which is in essence inclusion-exclusion; plays a key role for completeness; by allowing the algorithm to compute theprobability of some safe queries even when they have some subqueries that are unsafe.

A structure of the databaseis constructed into a schema which only includes those structures of the database that areknown. Desired information to be extracted from the database is specified using pathexpressions and an automaton models the path expression. A composite automaton isgenerated based on the automaton and the schema. The composite automaton is prunedand portions of the database corresponding to the pruned automaton is searched to obtainthe desired information. Points within the database may be identified to begin searching forthe desired information. These points correspond to states of the composite automaton. Ahybrid automaton may be formed for each set of possible starting states to determinecompleteness by simulating the hybrid automaton against the composite automaton.,*,2000,43

As thecommunity accumulates knowledge and the database content evolves over time; it maycontain conflicting information and members can disagree on the information it should store.For example; Alice may believe that a tuple should be in the database; whereas Bobdisagrees. He may also insert the reason why he thinks Alice believes the tuple should be inthe database; and explain what he thinks the correct tuple should be instead.

Many of the constructs of OWL have a basis in the field ofdescription logics. While the formal underpinnings of description logics have lead to a highlycomputable language; it has come at a cognitive cost. OWL ontologies are often unintuitiveto readers lacking a strong logic background.,AMIA Annual Symposium Proceedings,2008,41
Probabilistic databases with MarkoViews,Abhay Jha; Dan Suciu,Abstract Most of the work on query evaluation in probabilistic databases has focused on thesimple tuple-independent data model; where tuples are independent random events.Several efficient query evaluation techniques exists in this setting; such as safe plans;algorithms based on OBDDs; tree-decomposition and a variety of approximation algorithms.However; complex data analytics tasks often require complex correlations; and queryevaluation then is significantly more expensive; or more restrictive. In this paper; we proposeMVDB as a framework both for representing complex correlations and for efficient queryevaluation. An MVDB specifies correlations by views; called MarkoViews; on theprobabilistic relations and declaring the weights of the view's outputs. An MVDB is a (verylarge) Markov Logic Network. We make two sets of contributions. First; we show that …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,40
Efficient evaluation of having queries on a probabilistic database,Christopher Ré; Dan Suciu,Abstract We study the evaluation of positive conjunctive queries with Boolean aggregatetests (similar to HAVING queries in SQL) on probabilistic databases. Our motivation is tohandle aggregate queries over imprecise data resulting from information integration orinformation extraction. More precisely; we study conjunctive queries with predicateaggregates using MIN; MAX; COUNT; SUM; AVG or COUNT (DISTINCT) on probabilisticdatabases. Computing the precise output probabilities for positive conjunctive queries(without HAVING) is# P-hard; but is in P for a restricted class of queries called safe queries.Further; for queries without self-joins either a query is safe or its data complexity is# P-Hard;which shows that safe queries exactly capture tractable queries without self-joins. In thispaper; for each aggregate above; we find a class of queries that exactly capture efficient …,International Symposium on Database Programming Languages,2007,40
Why so? or why no? functional causality for explaining query answers,Alexandra Meliou; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Katherine F Moore; Dan Suciu,Abstract: In this paper; we propose causality as a unified framework to explain queryanswers and non-answers; thus generalizing and extending several previously proposedapproaches of provenance and missing query result explanations. We develop ourframework starting from the well-studied definition of actual causes by Halpern and Pearl.After identifying some undesirable characteristics of the original definition; we proposefunctional causes as a refined definition of causality with several desirable properties. Theseproperties allow us to apply our notion of causality in a database context and apply ituniformly to define the causes of query results and their individual contributions in severalways:(i) we can model both provenance as well as non-answers;(ii) we can defineexplanations as either data in the input relations or relational operations in a query plan …,arXiv preprint arXiv:0912.5340,2009,39
Tracing data errors with view-conditioned causality,Alexandra Meliou; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Suman Nath; Dan Suciu,Abstract A surprising query result is often an indication of errors in the query or theunderlying data. Recent work suggests using causal reasoning to find explanations for thesurprising result. In practice; however; one often has multiple queries and/or multipleanswers; some of which may be considered correct and others unexpected. In this paper; wefocus on determining the causes of a set of unexpected results; possibly conditioned onsome prior knowledge of the correctness of another set of results. We call this problem View-Conditioned Causality. We adapt the definitions of causality and responsibility for the case ofmultiple answers/views and provide a non-trivial algorithm that reduces the problem offinding causes and their responsibility to a satisfiability problem that can be solved withexisting tools. We evaluate both the accuracy and effectiveness of our approach on a real …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,38
Probabilistic rfid data management,Nodira Khoussainova; Magdalena Balazinska; Dan Suciu,Abstract Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology is increasingly being used toimprove various industrial processes; such as supply-chain management. Successes of thistechnology in industrial settings are leading many to consider other uses of RFID; includinguser-oriented public deployments. However; the noisy; low-level data produced by RFIDreaders is almost impossible to use or comprehend in most but the simplest settings. Wepresent PEEX (Probabilistic Event EXtractor); a system that manages probabilistic high-levelevents from imprecise and erroneous RFID data. PEEX allows users to define probabilisticevents from lower-level events. By using probabilities; the system copes with the noise in thedata and the inherent ambiguity in the event extraction. We have built PEEX as a layer ontop of a traditional RDBMS. We demonstrate; through experiments with real RFID traces …,Technical Reprot TR2007-03-01; University of Washington; Seattle; Washington,2007,38
Method and apparatus for restructuring data in semi-structured databases,*,An apparatus and method for restructuring a database modeled by an edge-labeled tree.Portions of an output tree is generated by matching patterns of tree elements of a startingtree. Portions of the output tree are combined to form a complete output tree which may berestructured again until a final output tree presents a desired" view" of the starting database.If the pattern matches used in restructuring the starting tree is restricted to attributes of treeelements that only includes preceding edge information; successive tree restructuring maybe composed into a single restructuring process that optimizes the restructuring by takingadvantage of restructuring results of each of the original restructuring processes.,*,1999,37
Computing probabilistic answers to queries,*,A system that supports arbitrarily complex SQL queries with “uncertain” predicates. Thequery semantics are based on a probabilistic model and the results are ranked; much like inInformation Retrieval; based upon their probability. An optimization algorithm is employedthat can efficiently compute most queries. The algorithm attempts to determine whether aproposed plan is a safe plan that can be used for correctly evaluating the query. Operatorssuch as the project operator in the proposed plan are evaluated to determine if they are safe.If so; the proposed plan is safe and will produce correct answers in a result. Due to the datacomplexity of some queries; a safe plan may not exist for a query. For these queries; either a“least unsafe plan;” or a Monte-Carlo simulation algorithm can be employed to produce aresult with answers that have an acceptable error.,*,2008,36
View maintenance for unstructured databases,*,A method and apparatus provides for efficient view maintenance of query of a database. Thedatabase is represented by an edge-labeled tree which is decomposed into a plurality ofportions based on an automaton modeling an original query. When an addition to thedatabase occurs; it is first determined which portion of the database the addition is made.Then an update query is performed on the added portion. The update query is determinedby selecting a state corresponding to a portion as a root state and ignoring all previousstates and transitions. The update query is applied to the portion of the database that theaddition is made. The result of the update query is incorporated with the results of the queryto produce an updated view.,*,1999,36
How to price shared optimizations in the cloud,Prasang Upadhyaya; Magdalena Balazinska; Dan Suciu,Abstract Data-management-as-a-service systems are increasingly being used incollaborative settings; where multiple users access common datasets. Cloud providers havethe choice to implement various optimizations; such as indexing or materialized views; toaccelerate queries over these datasets. Each optimization carries a cost and may benefitmultiple users. This creates a major challenge: how to select which optimizations to performand how to share their cost among users. The problem is especially challenging when usersare selfish and will only report their true values for different optimizations if doing somaximizes their utility. In this paper; we present a new approach for selecting and pricingshared optimizations by using Mechanism Design. We first show how to apply the ShapleyValue Mechanism to the simple case of selecting and pricing additive optimizations …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,35
The trichotomy of HAVING queries on a probabilistic database,Christopher Ré; Dan Suciu,Abstract We study the evaluation of positive conjunctive queries with Boolean aggregatetests (similar to HAVING in SQL) on probabilistic databases. More precisely; we studyconjunctive queries with predicate aggregates on probabilistic databases where theaggregation function is one of MIN; MAX; EXISTS; COUNT; SUM; AVG; or COUNT(DISTINCT) and the comparison function is one of=;≠;≥;>;≤; or<. The complexity ofevaluating a HAVING query depends on the aggregation function; α; and the comparisonfunction; θ. In this paper; we establish a set of trichotomy results for conjunctive queries withHAVING predicates parametrized by (α; θ). For such queries (without self-joins); one of thefollowing three statements is true:(1) the exact evaluation problem has\mathcal P-time datacomplexity. In this case; we call the query safe.(2) The exact evaluation problem is ♯ …,The VLDB Journal,2009,35
Navigating Extracted Data with Schema Discovery.,Michael J Cafarella; Dan Suciu; Oren Etzioni,ABSTRACT Open Information Extraction (OIE) is a recently-introduced type of informationextraction that extracts small individual pieces of data from input text without anydomainspecific guidance such as special training data or extraction rules. For example; anOIE system might discover the triple Frenzy; year; 1972 from a set of documents aboutmovies. Because OIE is domain-independent; it promises to help users when they have acorpus of structured data; but that structure is unknown; such as when browsing a noveldomain or formulating a query. We can describe the structure to the user by displaying arelational schema that fits the extracted data. Unfortunately; the extractions do not carry fullschema information: we have extracted values; but not the correct relations; their rows; ortheir columns. In response we propose TGen; an algorithm for schema discovery; which …,WebDB,2007,35
Queries and materialized views on probabilistic databases,Nilesh Dalvi; Christopher Re; Dan Suciu,Abstract We review in this paper some recent yet fundamental results on evaluating queriesover probabilistic databases. While one can see this problem as a special instance ofgeneral purpose probabilistic inference; we describe in this paper two key database specifictechniques that significantly reduce the complexity of query evaluation on probabilisticdatabases. The first is the separation of the query and the data: we show here that by doingso; one can identify queries whose data complexity is# P-hard; and queries whose datacomplexity is in PTIME. The second is the aggressive use of previously computed queryresults (materialized views): in particular; by rewriting a query in terms of views; one canreduce its complexity from# P-complete to PTIME. We describe a notion of a partialrepresentation for views; and show that; once computed and stored; this partial …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2011,34
Declarative specification of data-intensive web sites,Mary Fernández; Dan Suciu; Igor Tatarinov,Abstract Integrated information systems are often realized as data-intensive Web sites;which integrate data from multiple data sources. We present a system; called STRUDEL; forspecifying and generating data-intensive Web sites. STRUDEL separates the tasks ofaccessing and integrating a site's data sources; building its structure; and generating itsHTML representation. STRUDEL's declarative query language; called StruQL; supports thefirst two tasks. Unlike ad-hoc database queries; a StruQL query is a software artifact thatmust be extensible and reusable To support more modular and reusable site definitionqueries; we extend StruQL with functions and describe how the new language; FunStruQL;better supports common site-engineering tasks; such as choosing a strategy for generatingthe site's pages dynamically and/or statically To substantiate STRUDEL's benefits; we …,ACM SIGPLAN Notices,1999,34
On two forms of structural recursion,Dan Suciu; Limsoon Wong,Abstract We investigate and compare two forms of recursion on sets for querying nestedcollections. The first one is called sri and it corresponds to sequential processing of data.The second one is called sru and it corresponds to data-parallel processing. A uniform first-order translation from sru into sri was known from previous work. The converse translation isby necessity more difficult and we have obtained three main results concerning it. First; weexhibit a uniform translation of sri queries into sru queries over the nested relational algebra.We observe that this translation maps PTIME algorithms into exponential-space queries. Thesecond result proves that any uniform translation of sri queries into sru queries over thenested relational algebra must map some PTIME queries into exponential-space ones. Infact; in the presence of certain external functions; we provide a PTIME sri query for which …,International Conference on Database Theory,1995,34
Any algorithm in the complex object algebra with powerset needs exponential space to compute transitive closure,Dan Suciu; Jan Paredaens,Abstract The Abiteboul and Beeri algebra for complex objects can express a query whosemeaning is transitive closure; but the algorithm is naturally associated to this query needsexponential space. We show that any other query in the algebra which expresses transitiveclosure needs exponential space. This proves that in general the powerset is an intractableoperator for implementing fixpoint queries.,Proceedings of the thirteenth ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1994,34

Wepresent a general solution for RDF information set reuse inspired by database views. Ourview definition language; vSPARQL; allows applications to specify the exact content thatthey are interested in and how that content should be restructured or modified. Applicationscan access relevant content by querying against these view definitions. We evaluate theexpressivity of our approach by defining views for practical use cases and comparing ourview definition language to existing query languages.,Journal of Biomedical Informatics,2011,33

Query evaluation on distributed semi-structured data,*,The invention provides a system and method for evaluating a query on a distributeddatabase across multiple sites. Database portion contained within each site is processed bya respective terminal. A client terminal is a terminal that distributes and collects informationfor evaluating the query. Each of the terminals receives the query and performs evaluation ofthe query on the respective distributed portion of the database. The terminals generate anaccessibility graph based on the query evaluation of the respective distributive portion of thedatabase and transmit the accessibility graphs to the client terminal. The client terminalreceives all the accessibility graphs from each of the terminals and constructs anaccessibility graph for the complete distributed database. The client terminal then tracesthrough the accessibility graph for the distributed database and determines which parts of …,*,2000,32

Toward practical query pricing with QueryMarket,Paraschos Koutris; Prasang Upadhyaya; Magdalena Balazinska; Bill Howe; Dan Suciu,Abstract We develop a new pricing system; QueryMarket; for flexible query pricing in a datamarket based on an earlier theoretical framework (Koutris et al.; PODS 2012). To build sucha system; we show how to use an Integer Linear Programming formulation of the pricingproblem for a large class of queries; even when pricing is computationally hard. Further; weleverage query history to avoid double charging when queries purchased over time haveoverlapping information; or when the database is updated. We then present a technique thatfairly shares revenue when multiple sellers are involved. Finally; we implement ourapproach in a prototype and evaluate its performance on several query workloads.,proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD international conference on management of data,2013,29
Reverse data management,Alexandra Meliou; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Dan Suciu,ABSTRACT Database research mainly focuses on forward-moving data flows: source data issubjected to transformations and evolves through queries; aggregations; and viewdefinitions to form a new target instance; possibly with a different schema. This ForwardParadigm underpins most data management tasks today; such as querying; data integration;data mining; etc. We contrast this forward processing with Reverse Data Management(RDM); where the action needs to be performed on the input data; on behalf of desiredoutcomes in the output data. Some data management tasks already fall under this paradigm;for example updates through views; data generation; data cleaning and repair. RDM is; bynecessity; conceptually more difficult to define; and computationally harder to achieve.Today; however; as increasingly more of the available data is derived from other data …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,29
Incorporating uncertainty metrics into a general-purpose data integration system,Brenton Louie; Landon Detwiler; Nilesh Dalvi; Ron Shaker; Peter Tarczy-Hornoch; Dan Suciu,There is a significant need for data integration capabilities in the scientific domain; whichhas manifested itself as products in the commercial world as well as academia. However; inour experiences in dealing with biological data it has become apparent to us that existingdata integration products do not handle uncertainties in the data very well. This leads tosystems that often produce an explosion of less relevant answers which subsequently leadsto a loss of more relevant answers by overloading the user. How to incorporate functionalityinto data integration systems to properly handle uncertainties and make results more usefulhas become an important research question. In this paper we describe an enhancedgeneral-purpose data integration system which incorporates uncertainty metrics within aformal probabilistic framework.

Management of semistructured data,Dan Suciu,Abstract A huge amount of data is available today on the Internet; or on the private Intranetsof many companies. This data is structured in a multitude of ways. At an extreme we finddata coming from traditional relational or object-oriented databases; with a completelyknown structure. At another extreme we have data which is fully unstructured; such asimages; sounds; and raw text. But most of the data falls somewhere in between these twoextremes; for a variety of reasons: the data may be structured; but the structure is not know tothe user; the user may know the structure; but chooses to ignore it; for browsing purposes;the structure may be implicit; such as in formatted text; and is not as rigid and regular as intraditional databases; the data may be in non-traditional formats; such as the ASN. 1exchange format; the schema of the data is huge and changes often; so that we may …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1997,29
Bridging the gap between intensional and extensional query evaluation in probabilistic databases,Abhay Jha; Dan Olteanu; Dan Suciu,Abstract There are two broad approaches to query evaluation over probabilisticdatabases:(1) Intensional Methods proceed by manipulating expressions over symbolicevents associated with uncertain tuples. This approach is very general and can be appliedto any query; but requires an expensive postprocessing phase; which involves somegeneral-purpose probabilistic inference.(2) Extensional Methods; on the other hand;evaluate the query by translating operations over symbolic events to a query plan;extensional methods scale well; but they are restricted to safe queries. In this paper; webridge this gap by proposing an approach that can translate the evaluation of any query intoextensional operators; followed by some post-processing that requires probabilisticinference. Our approach uses characteristics of the data to adapt smoothly between the …,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2010,27
Managing probabilistic data with mystiq: The can-do; the could-do; and the can’t-do,Christopher Re; Dan Suciu,Abstract MystiQ is a system that allows users to define a probabilistic database; then toevaluate SQL queries over this database. MystiQ is a middleware: the data itself is stored ina standard relational database system; and MystiQ is providing the probabilistic semantics.The advantage of a middleware over a re-implementation from scratch is that it can leveragethe infrastructure of an existing database engine; eg indexes; query evaluation; queryoptimization; etc. Furthermore; MystiQ attempts to perform most of the probabilistic inferenceinside the relational database engine. MystiQ is currently available from mystiq. cs.washington. edu.,International Conference on Scalable Uncertainty Management,2008,26
The view selection problem for XML content based routing,Ashish Kumar Gupta; Dan Suciu; Alon Y Halevy,Abstract We consider the view selection problem for XML content based routing: given anetwork; in which a stream of XML documents is routed and the routing decisions are takenbased on results of evaluating XPath predicates on these documents; select a set of viewsthat maximize the throughput of the network. While in view selection for relational queriesthe speedup comes from eliminating joins; here the speedup is obtained from gaining directaccess to data values in an XML packet; without parsing that packet. The views in ourcontext can be seen as a binary representation of the XML document; tailored for thenetwork's workload. In this paper we define formally the view selection problem in thecontext of XML content based routing; and provide a practical solution for it.

Parsing XML documents and interpreting XPathexpressions is the main bottleneck in such systems. We propose a novel solution tospeedup the evaluation of XPath predicates based on precomputing views for the XMLdocuments. There are both similarities and differences from the” view selection problem” inrelational databases. We describe an architecture for using these views; discuss severaldesign choices and make a brief theoretical analysis for one special case.

Data conflict resolution using trust mappings,Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Dan Suciu,Abstract In massively collaborative projects such as scientific or community databases; usersoften need to agree or disagree on the content of individual data items. On the other hand;trust relationships often exist between users; allowing them to accept or reject other users'beliefs by default. As those trust relationships become complex; however; it becomes difficultto define and compute a consistent snapshot of the conflicting information. Previoussolutions to a related problem; the update reconciliation problem; are dependent on theorder in which the updates are processed and; therefore; do not guarantee a globallyconsistent snapshot. This paper proposes the first principled solution to the automaticconflict resolution problem in a community database. Our semantics is based on the certaintuples of all stable models of a logic program. While evaluating stable models in general …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,25

NSCis based on while-loops as opposed to general recursion. A formal; machine independentdefinition of the parallel time complexity and the work complexity of programs in NSC isgiven. Our main results are:(1) We give a translation method for a particular form ofrecursion; called map-recursion; into NSC; that preserves the time complexity and adds anarbitrarily small overhead to the work complexity; and (2) We give a compilation method forNSC into a very simple vector parallel machine; which preserves the time complexity andagain adds an arbitrarily small overhead to the work complexity.,Proceedings of the sixth annual ACM symposium on Parallel algorithms and architectures,1994,25
Overview of Strudel - A Web-Site Management System,Mary F.  Fernandez; Daniela Florescu; Jaewoo Kang; Alon Y.  Levy; Dan Suciu,ABSTRACT. The Strudel system applies concepts from database management systems tothe process of building Web sites. Strudel's key idea is separating the management of thesite's data; the creation and management of the site's structure; and the visual presentationof the site's pages. First; the site builder creates a uniform model of all data available at thesite. Second; the builder uses this model to declaratively define the Web site's structure byapplying a “sitedefinition query” to the underlying data. Third; the builder specifies the visualpresentation of pages in Strudel's HTML-template language. The data model underlyingStrudel is a semistructured model of labeled directed graphs.,Networking and Information Systems,1998,24

Such queries are useful for emerging applications like thedirectory enabled networks initiative. Our techniques follow the LDAP approach ofdistributed query evaluation by referrals; where each relevant server computes answerslocally; and the LDAP client coordinates between directory servers. We make a conceptualseparation between the identification of relevant servers and the distributed computation ofanswers.

Cryptographically Enforced Conditional Access for XML.,Gerome Miklau; Dan Suciu,Abstract Access control for databases is typically enforced by a trusted server responsible forpermitting or denying users access to the database. This server-based protection model isincreasingly becoming inconvenient for web based applications. We propose encryptiontechniques that allow¥¦ § documents to be distributed over the web to clients for localprocessing while maintaining certain access controls. In particular; we focus on conditionalaccess controls; where a user is granted access to certain data elements conditioned on theuser's existing knowledge of another part of the data. We believe such access controls areimportant in practice; and that enforcing them cryptographically on remote instances allowsfor more flexible data dissemination and processing.,WebDB,2002,23

Integrating and ranking uncertain scientific data,Landon Detwiler; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Brent Louie; Dan Suciu; Peter Tarczy-Hornoch,Mediator-based data integration systems resolve exploratory queries by joining dataelements across sources. In the presence of uncertainties; such multiple expansions canquickly lead to spurious connections and incorrect results. The BioRank project investigatesformalisms for modeling uncertainty during scientific data integration and for rankinguncertain query results. Our motivating application is protein function prediction. In thispaper we show that:(i) explicit modeling of uncertainties as probabilities increases our abilityto predict less-known or previously unknown functions (though it does not improvepredicting the well-known). This suggests that probabilistic uncertainty models offer utility forscientific knowledge discovery;(ii) small perturbations in the input probabilities tend toproduce only minor changes in the quality of our result rankings. This suggests that our …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,22

The goal of this paper is to allow a user to leverage a small amount oftrusted client-side computation to achieve guarantees of integrity when interacting with avulnerable or untrusted database server. To achieve this goal we describe a novel relationalhash tree; designed for efficient database processing; and evaluate the performance penaltyfor integrity guarantees. We show that strong cryptographic guarantees of integrity can beprovided in a relational database with modest overhead.,Annual Asian Computing Science Conference,2005,22
Querymarket demonstration: Pricing for online data markets,Paraschos Koutris; Prasang Upadhyaya; Magdalena Balazinska; Bill Howe; Dan Suciu,Abstract Increasingly data is being bought and sold online. To facilitate such transactions;online data market-places have emerged to provide a service for sellers to price views ontheir data; and buyers to buy such views. These marketplaces neither support the sale of ad-hoc queries (that are not one of the specified views); nor do they support queries that joindatasets. We present QueryMarket; a prototype data marketplace that automaticallyextrapolates prices to ad-hoc queries; including those with joins; from the manually pricedviews. We call this capability" query-based pricing" and describe how it is superior toexisting pricing methods; and how it provides more flexible pricing for the sellers. We thenshow how QueryMarket implements query-based pricing and how it generates explanationsfor the prices it computes.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,21

Management of data with uncertainties,Christopher Re; Dan Suciu,Since their invention in the early 70s; relational databases have been deterministic. Theywere designed to support applications sa accounting; inventory; customer care; andmanufacturing; and these applications require a precise semantics. Thus; database systemsare deterministic. A row is either in the database or is not; a tuple is either in the queryanswer or is not. The foundations of query processing and the tools that exists today formanaging data rely fundamentally on the assumption that the data is deterministic.Increasingly; today we need to manage data that is uncertain. The uncertainty can be in thedata itself; in the schema; in the mapping between different data instances; or in the userquery.

On the tractability of query compilation and bounded treewidth,Abhay Jha; Dan Suciu,Abstract We consider the problem of computing the probability of a Boolean function; whichgeneralizes the model counting problem. Given an OBDD for such a function; its probabilitycan be computed in linear time in the size of the OBDD. In this paper we investigate theconnection between treewidth and the size of the OBDD. Bounded treewidth has proven tobe applicable to many graph problems; which are NP-hard in general but become tractableon graphs with bounded treewidth. However; it is less well understood how boundedtreewidth can be used for the probability computation problem of a Boolean function. Weintroduce a new notion of treewidth of a Boolean function; called the expression treewidth;as the smallest treewidth of any DAG-expression representing the function. Our new notionof bounded treewidth includes some previously known tractable cases: all read-once …,Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Database Theory,2012,20
Session-based browsing for more effective query reuse,Nodira Khoussainova; YongChul Kwon; Wei-Ting Liao; Magdalena Balazinska; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Dan Suciu,Scientists today are able to generate and collect data at an unprecedented scale [1]. Af-terwards; scientists analyze and explore these datasets. Composing SQL queries; how-ever; is a significant challenge for scientists because most are not database experts. In thiswork; we leverage the collaborative environment that many scientists work in; which often includesa shared database with many scientists asking queries over it. As such; we utilize the collectiveknowledge of all the users by providing new users with access to a log of past queries; whichcan be used as starting points for writing new queries. However; navigating a large log of queriescan be difficult and overwhelming. In this paper; we introduce the Smart Query Browser(SQB) system. SQB supports efficient retrieval of relevant queries using what we callsession-based browsing. We also show results from a user study where we investigated …,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2011,20
A framework for XML-based integration of data; visualization and analysis in a biomedical domain,Nathan Bales; James Brinkley; E Sally Lee; Shobhit Mathur; Christopher Re; Dan Suciu,Abstract Biomedical data are becoming increasingly complex and heterogeneous in nature.The data are stored in distributed information systems; using a variety of data models; andare processed by increasingly more complex tools that analyze and visualize them. Wepresent in this paper our framework for integrating biomedical research data and tools into aunique Web front end. Our framework is applied to the University of Washington's HumanBrain Project. Specifically; we present solutions to four integration tasks: definition ofcomplex mappings from relational sources to XML; distributed XQuery processing;generation of heterogeneous output formats; and the integration of heterogeneous datavisualization and analysis tools.,International XML Database Symposium,2005,20
Symmetric weighted first-order model counting,Paul Beame; Guy Van den Broeck; Eric Gribkoff; Dan Suciu,Abstract The FO Model Counting problem (FOMC) is the following: given a sentence Φ in FOand a number n; compute the number of models of Φ over a domain of size n; the Weightedvariant (WFOMC) generalizes the problem by associating a weight to each tuple anddefining the weight of a model to be the product of weights of its tuples. In this paper westudy the complexity of the symmetric WFOMC; where all tuples of a given relation have thesame weight. Our motivation comes from an important application; inference in KnowledgeBases with soft constraints; like Markov Logic Networks; but the problem is also ofindependent theoretical interest. We study both the data complexity; and the combinedcomplexity of FOMC and WFOMC. For the data complexity we prove the existence of an FO3 formula for which FOMC is# P 1-complete; and the existence of a Conjunctive Query for …,Proceedings of the 34th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems,2015,19

Efficient top-K query evaluation on probabilistic data,*,A novel approach that computes and efficiently ranks the top-k answers to a query on aprobabilistic database. The approach identifies the top-k answers; since imprecisions in thedata often lead to a large number of answers of low quality. The algorithm is used to runseveral Monte Carlo simulations in parallel; one for each candidate answer; andapproximates the probability of each only to the extent needed to correctly determine the top-k answers. The algorithm is provably optimal and scales to large databases. A more generalapplication can identify a number of top-rated entities of a group that satisfy a condition;based on a criteria or score computed for the entities. Also disclosed are severaloptimization techniques. One option is to rank the top-rated results; another option providesfor interrupting the iteration to return the number of top-rated entities that have thus far …,*,2010,19

Worst-case optimal algorithms for parallel query processing,Paraschos Koutris; Paul Beame; Dan Suciu,Abstract In this paper; we study the communication complexity for the problem of computinga conjunctive query on a large database in a parallel setting with p servers. In contrast toprevious work; where upper and lower bounds on the communication were specified forparticular structures of data (either data without skew; or data with specific types of skew); inthis work we focus on worst-case analysis of the communication cost. The goal is to findworst-case optimal parallel algorithms; similar to the work of (Ngo et al. 2012) for sequentialalgorithms. We first show that for a single round we can obtain an optimal worst-casealgorithm.

A dichotomy on the complexity of consistent query answering for atoms with simple keys,Paraschos Koutris; Dan Suciu,Abstract: We study the problem of consistent query answering under primary key violations.In this setting; the relations in a database violate the key constraints and we are interested inmaximal subsets of the database that satisfy the constraints; which we call repairs. For aboolean query Q; the problem CERTAINTY (Q) asks whether every such repair satisfies thequery or not; the problem is known to be always in coNP for conjunctive queries. However;there are queries for which it can be solved in polynomial time. It has been conjectured thatthere exists a dichotomy on the complexity of CERTAINTY (Q) for conjunctive queries: it iseither in PTIME or coNP-complete. In this paper; we prove that the conjecture is indeed truefor the case of conjunctive queries without self-joins; where each atom has as a key either asingle attribute (simple key) or all attributes of the atom.

Causality and explanations in databases,Alexandra Meliou; Sudeepa Roy; Dan Suciu,Abstract With the surge in the availability of information; there is a great demand for tools thatassist users in understanding their data. While today's exploration tools rely mostly on datavisualization; users often want to go deeper and understand the underlying causes of aparticular observation. This tutorial surveys research on causality and explanation for data-oriented applications. We will review and summarize the research thus far into causality andexplanation in the database and AI communities; giving researchers a snapshot of thecurrent state of the art on this topic; and propose a unified framework as well as directions forfuture research. We will cover both the theory of causality/explanation and someapplications; we also discuss the connections with other topics in database research likeprovenance; deletion propagation; why-not queries; and OLAP techniques.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,17
Lower bounds for exact model counting and applications in probabilistic databases,Paul Beame; Jerry Li; Sudeepa Roy; Dan Suciu,Abstract: The best current methods for exactly computing the number of satisfyingassignments; or the satisfying probability; of Boolean formulas can be seen; either directly orindirectly; as building'decision-DNNF'(decision decomposable negation normal form)representations of the input Boolean formulas. Decision-DNNFs are a special case of'd-DNNF's where'd'stands for'deterministic'. We show that any decision-DNNF can beconverted into an equivalent'FBDD'(free binary decision diagram)--also known as a'read-once branching program'(ROBP or 1-BP)--with only a quasipolynomial increase inrepresentation size in general; and with only a polynomial increase in size in the specialcase of monotone k-DNF formulas. Leveraging known exponential lower bounds for FBDDs;we then obtain similar exponential lower bounds for decision-DNNFs which provide lower …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1309.6815,2013,17
Understanding cardinality estimation using entropy maximization,Christopher Ré; Dan Suciu,Abstract Cardinality estimation is the problem of estimating the number of tuples returned bya query; it is a fundamentally important task in data management; used in queryoptimization; progress estimation; and resource provisioning. We study cardinalityestimation in a principled framework: given a set of statistical assertions about the number oftuples returned by a fixed set of queries; predict the number of tuples returned by a newquery. We model this problem using the probability space; over possible worlds; thatsatisfies all provided statistical assertions and maximizes entropy. We call this the EntropyMaximization model for statistics (MaxEnt). In this article we develop the mathematicaltechniques needed to use the MaxEnt model for predicting the cardinality of conjunctivequeries.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2012,17
Dissociation and Propagation for Efficient Query Evaluation over Probabilistic Databases.,Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Abhay Kumar Jha; Dan Suciu,Abstract Probabilistic inference over large data sets is a challenging data managementproblem as exact inference is generally# P-hard and requires sampling-based methods.This paper proposes an alternative approach for approximate evaluation of queries withprobabilistic databases: In our approach; every query is evaluated entirely in the databaseengine by evaluating a fixed number of query plans; each providing an upper bound on thetrue probability; then taking their minimum. We provide an algorithm that takes into accountimportant schema information to enumerate only the minimal necessary plans among allpossible plans. Importantly; this algorithm is a strict generalization of all known PTIME self-join-free conjunctive queries: A query is in PTIME if and only if our algorithm returns onesingle plan. Furthermore; our approach is a generalization of a family of efficient ranking …,MUD,2010,17
Database access system with optimizable expressions,*,A database access system responds a user database access request by restructuring arequested database based on two sets of expressions. Expressions are instructions forgenerating a new database from a starting database modeled as a starting edge-labeledtree by using pattern matches. Expressions always generate an edge-labeled tree allowinga sequence of expressions to be processed to restructure the starting tree. The databaseaccess system divides the database restructuring process into two sets of expressions. A firstset of expressions is constructed based on subscriber requirements and a second set ofexpressions is constructed based on particular user requests. The first and secondexpressions are optimized by composition and the requested database is restructuredbased on the composed expression.,*,1999,17

Understanding the Complexity of Lifted Inference and Asymmetric Weighted Model Counting.,Eric Gribkoff; Guy Van den Broeck; Dan Suciu,Abstract We highlight our work on lifted inference for the asymmetric Weighted First-OrderModel Counting problem (WFOMC); which counts the assignments that satisfy a givensentence in first-order logic. This work is at the intersection of probabilistic databases andstatistical relational learning. First; we discuss how adding negation can lower the querycomplexity; and describe the essential element (resolution) necessary to extend a previousalgorithm for positive queries to handle queries with negation. Second; we describe ournovel dichotomy result for a non-trivial fragment of first-order CNF sentences with negation.Finally; we discuss directions for future work.,AAAI Workshop: Statistical Relational Artificial Intelligence,2014,16
Query evaluation with soft-key constraints,Abhay Jha; Vibhor Rastogi; Dan Suciu,Abstract Key Violations often occur in real-life datasets; especially in those integrated fromdifferent sources. Enforcing constraints strictly on these datasets is not feasible. In this paperwe formalize the notion of soft-key constraints on probabilistic databases; which allow forviolation of key constraint by penalizing every violating world by a quantity proportional tothe violation. To represent our probabilistic database with constraints; we define a class ofmarkov networks; where we can do query evaluation in PTIME. We also study the evaluationof conjunctive queries on relations with soft keys and present a dichotomy that separates thisset into those in PTIME and the rest which are# P-Hard.,Proceedings of the twenty-seventh ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2008,16
Structured Queries Over Web Text.,Michael J Cafarella; Oren Etzioni; Dan Suciu,Abstract The Web contains a vast amount of text that can only be queried using simplekeywords-in; documentsout search queries. But Web text often contains structured elements;such as hotel location and price pairs embedded in a set of hotel reviews. Queries thatprocess these structural text elements would be much more powerful than our currentdocument-centric queries. Of course; text does not contain metadata or a schema; making itunclear what a structured text query means precisely. In this paper we describe threepossible models for structured queries over text; each of which implies different querysemantics and user interaction.,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2006,16

Cellular automata,Todd J Green; Xyleme Sa; Gerome Miklau; Makoto Onizuka; Dan Suciu,Abstract. We consider the problem of evaluating a large number of XPath expressions on anXML stream. Our main contribution consists in showing that Deterministic Finite Automata(DFA) can be used effectively for this problem: in our experiments we achieve a throughputof about 5.4 MB/s; independent of the number of XPath expressions (up to 1;000;000 in ourtests). The major problem we face is that of the size of the DFA. Since the number of statesgrows exponentially with the number of XPath expressions; it was previously believed thatDFAs cannot be used to process large sets of expressions. We make a theoretical analysisof the number of states in the DFA resulting from XPath expressions; and consider both thecase when it is constructed eagerly; and when it is constructed lazily. Our analysis indicatesthat; when the automaton is constructed lazily; and under certain assumptions about the …,*,1993,15
A discussion on pricing relational data,Magdalena Balazinska; Bill Howe; Paraschos Koutris; Dan Suciu; Prasang Upadhyaya,Abstract There exists a growing market for structured data on the Internet today; and thismotivates a theoretical study of how relational data should be priced. We advocate for aframework where the seller defines a pricing scheme; by essentially stipulating the price ofsome queries; and the buyer is allowed to purchase data expressed by any query they wish:the system will derive the price automatically from the pricing scheme. We show that; inorder to understand pricing; one needs to understand determinacy first. We also discusssome other open problems in pricing relational data.,*,2013,14
A structure-based approach to querying semi-structured data,Mary Fernandez; Lucian Popa; Dan Suciu,Abstract Several researchers have considered integrating multiple unstructured; semi-structured; and structured data sources by modeling all sources as edge labeled graphs.Data in this model is self-describing and dynamically typed; and captures both schema anddata information. The labels are arbitrary atomic values; such as strings; integers; reals; etc.;and the integrated data graph is stored in a unique data repository; as a relation of edges.The relation is dynamically typed; ie each edge label is tagged with its type. Although theunique; labeled graph repository is flexible; it looses all static type information; and results insevere efficiency penalties compared to querying structured databases; such as relational orobject-oriented databases. In this paper we propose an alternative method of storing andquerying semi-structured data; using storage schemas; which are closely related to …,International Workshop on Database Programming Languages,1997,14
Domain-independent queries on databases with external functions,Dan Suciu,Abstract We investigate queries in the presence of external functions with arbitrary inputsand outputs (atomic values; sets; nested sets etc). We propose a new notion of domainindependence for queries with external functions which; in contrast to previous work; canalso be applied to query languages with fixpoints or other kinds of iterators. Next; we definetwo new notions of computable queries with external functions; and prove that they areequivalent; under the assumption that the external functions are total. Thus; our definition ofcomputable queries with external functions is robust. Finally; based on the equivalenceresult; we give examples of complete query languages with external functions. A byproductof the equivalence result is the fact that Relational Machines are complete for complexobjects: it was known that they are not complete over flat relations.,International Conference on Database Theory,1995,14
HoTTSQL: Proving query rewrites with univalent SQL semantics,Shumo Chu; Konstantin Weitz; Alvin Cheung; Dan Suciu,Abstract Every database system contains a query optimizer that performs query rewrites.Unfortunately; developing query optimizers remains a highly challenging task. Part of thechallenges comes from the intricacies and rich features of query languages; which makesreasoning about rewrite rules difficult. In this paper; we propose a machine-checkabledenotational semantics for SQL; the de facto language for relational database; for rigorouslyvalidating rewrite rules. Unlike previously proposed semantics that are either non-mechanized or only cover a small amount of SQL language features; our semantics coversall major features of SQL; including bags; correlated subqueries; aggregation; and indexes.Our mechanized semantics; called HoTT SQL; is based on K-Relations and homotopy typetheory; where we denote relations as mathematical functions from tuples to univalent …,Proceedings of the 38th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation,2017,13
Bringing Provenance to Its Full Potential Using Causal Reasoning.,Alexandra Meliou; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Dan Suciu,Abstract Provenance information is often used to explain query results and outcomes; exploitresults of prior reasoning; and establish trust in data. The generality of the notion makes itapplicable in a variety of domains; including data warehousing [7]; curated databases [4];and various scientific applications. The recent introduction of causal reasoning in adatabase setting exploits provenance in ways that expand its applicability to more complexproblems; and establish new directions; making a step towards achieving provenance's fullpotential. In this paper we explore through a variety of examples how causality improves onprovenance information; discuss the challenges of building causality able systems; andpropose some new directions.,TaPP,2011,13
Access control over uncertain data,Vibhor Rastogi; Dan Suciu; Evan Welbourne,Abstract Access control is the problem of regulating access to secret information based oncertain context information. In traditional applications; context information is known exactly;permitting a simple allow/deny semantics. In this paper; we look at access control when thecontext is itself uncertain. Our motivating application is RFID data management; in which thelocation of objects and people; and the associations between them is often uncertain to thesystem; yet access to private data is strictly defined in terms of these locations andassociations. We formalize a natural semantics for access control that allows the release ofpartial information in the presence of uncertainty and describe an algorithm that uses aprovably optimal perturbation function to enforce these semantics.

General database statistics using entropy maximization,Raghav Kaushik; Christopher Ré; Dan Suciu,Abstract We propose a framework in which query sizes can be estimated from arbitrarystatistical assertions on the data. In its most general form; a statistical assertion states thatthe size of the output of a conjunctive query over the data is a given number. A very simpleexample is a histogram; which makes assertions about the sizes of the output of severalrange queries. Our model also allows much more complex assertions that include joins andprojections. To model such complex statistical assertions we propose to use the Entropy-Maximization (EM) probability distribution. In this model any set of statistics that is consistenthas a precise semantics; and every query has an precise size estimate. We show thatseveral classes of statistics can be solved in closed form.,International Symposium on Database Programming Languages,2009,12
Consistent histograms in the presence of distinct value counts,Raghav Kaushik; Dan Suciu,Abstract Self-tuning histograms have been proposed in the past as an attempt to leveragefeedback from query execution. However; the focus thus far has been on histograms thatonly store cardinalities. In this paper; we study consistent histogram construction from queryfeedback that also takes distinct value counts into account. We first show how the entropymaximization (EM) principle can be leveraged to identify a distribution that approximates thedata given the execution feedback making the least additional assumptions. This EM modelthat takes both distinct value counts and cardinalities into account. However; we find that it iscomputationally prohibitively expensive.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,12

Although various nationalefforts facilitate large-scale data sharing; these approaches are generally too “heavyweight”for individual or small groups of investigators; with the result that most data sharing amongcollaborators continues to be ad hoc. Our approach to this problem is to create a“lightweight” distributed query architecture; in which data sources are accessible via webservices that accept arbitrary query languages but return XML results.

We start from the physical access control (PAC)rule (Kriplean et al.; IEEE Pervasive Computing 2007) that provides a default level of privacybut constrains the possible set of applications. We extend it by using principled ways ofdefining other access control rules that retain the simplicity of PAC and yet provideincreased flexibility for users and applications. We then propose authorization views as adatabase technique to implent rule-based privacy policies and demonstrate the use ofauthorization views over the privacy policy designed for the RFID Ecosystem.,Proceedings of 9th international conference on ubiquitous computing (workshop on privacy).

Model counting of query expressions: Limitations of propositional methods,Paul Beame; Jerry Li; Sudeepa Roy; Dan Suciu,Abstract: Query evaluation in tuple-independent probabilistic databases is the problem ofcomputing the probability of an answer to a query given independent probabilities of theindividual tuples in a database instance. There are two main approaches to this problem:(1)ingrounded inference'one first obtains the lineage for the query and database instance as aBoolean formula; then performs weighted model counting on the lineage (ie; computes theprobability of the lineage given probabilities of its independent Boolean variables);(2) inmethods known aslifted inference'orextensional query evaluation'; one exploits the high-level structure of the query as a first-order formula. Although it is widely believed that liftedinference is strictly more powerful than grounded inference on the lineage alone; no formalseparation has previously been shown for query evaluation.

From searching text to querying XML streams,Dan Suciu,Abstract XML data is queried with a limited form of regular expressions; in a language calledXPath. New XML stream processing applications; such as content-based routing or selectivedissemination of information; require thousands or millions of XPath expressions to beevaluated simultaneously on the incoming XML stream at a high; sustained rate. In itssimplest approximation; the XPath evaluation problem is analogous to the text searchproblem; in which one or several regular expressions need to be matched to a given text. Ata finer level; it is related to the tree pattern matching problem. However; unlike the traditionalsetting; the number of regular expressions here is much larger; while the “text” is muchshorter; since it corresponds to the depth of the XML stream.

Queries on distributed unstructured databases,*,A method and apparatus for applying a query to a database that is distributed into firstportions. The query is first partially performed by terminals each containing one of the firstportions. The results of the partial queries are recombined in such a way as to minimize thetraffic among the terminals connected across networks. Paths of an edge-labeled treerepresenting the database connecting the first portions are expanded into subpathscorresponding to all the states of an automaton modeling the query. The database isdistributed into second portions based on the automaton. Non-existing subpaths are ignoredbased on the automaton and which of the second portions the paths exit. Thus; the datatransferred among first portions are minimized and the query process is optimized.,*,1999,11
Run-time management of data intensive Web-sites,Daniela Florescu; Alon Levy; Dan Suciu; Khaled Yagoub,An increasing number of web sites have their data extracted from relational databases.Several commercial products and research prototypes have been moving in the direction ofdeclarative specification of the structure and content of sites. Specifically; the entire site isspecified using a collection of queries describing the site's nodes (corresponding to webpages and the data contained in them) and edges (corresponding to the hyperlinks). Giventhis paradigm; an important issue is when to compute the site's pages. In one extremeapproach; the site is precomputed in advance; while in the other extreme; the queriesnecessary to construct a given page are computed on demand. Both approaches have theirobvious drawbacks: large space and maintenance overhead in the first approach; and poorrun-time performance and unnecessary repeated computations in the second.

Fixpoints and bounded fixpoints for complex objects,Dan Suciu,Abstract We investigate a query language for complex-object databases; which is designedto (1) express only tractable queries; and (2) be as expressive over flat relations as first orderlogic with fixpoints. The language is obtained by extending the nested relational algebraNRA with a" bounded fixpoint" operator. As in the flat case; all PTime computable queriesover ordered databases are expressible in this language. The main result consists inproving that this language is a conservative extension of the first order logic with fixpoints; orof the while-queries (depending on the interpretation of the bounded fixpoint: inflationary orpartial). The proof technique uses indexes; to encode complex objects into flat relations; andis strong enough to allow for the encoding of NRA with unbounded fixpoints into flatrelations. We also define a logic based language with fixpoints; the" nested relational …,*,1993,11

To manage the uncertainty in the data; these KBs rely on probabilistic enginesbased on Markov Logic Networks (MLN); for which probabilistic inference remains a majorchallenge. Today's state of the art systems use variants of MCMC; which have no theoreticalerror guarantees; and; as we show; suffer from poor performance in practice.

Oblivious bounds on the probability of Boolean functions,Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Dan Suciu,Abstract This article develops upper and lower bounds for the probability of Booleanfunctions by treating multiple occurrences of variables as independent and assigning themnew individual probabilities. We call this approach dissociation and give an exactcharacterization of optimal oblivious bounds; that is; when the new probabilities are chosenindependently of the probabilities of all other variables. Our motivation comes from theweighted model counting problem (or; equivalently; the problem of computing the probabilityof a Boolean function); which is &num; P-hard in general. By performing severaldissociations; one can transform a Boolean formula whose probability is difficult to computeinto one whose probability is easy to compute; and which is guaranteed to provide an upperor lower bound on the probability of the original formula by choosing appropriate …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2014,10
Special issue on uncertain and probabilistic databases,Peter J Haas; Dan Suciu,A diverse class of applications needs to manage large volumes of uncertain data. Examplesof such data include incompletely cleaned data; data from acquisition systems such assensor nets or RFID deployments; data generated by information extraction systems; datainferred from a synopsis or statistical summary; data obtained as a result of imprecise datamappings; data that has been blurred or anonymized to protect privacy; and missing datathat has been interpolated or extrapolated. The ability to manage uncertain data is crucial forevaluating the quality of query results; assessing and managing risks arising from datauncertainty; and; more broadly; making sound scientific; engineering; and businessdecisions in an uncertain world. Data uncertainty is naturally represented by means of aprobabilistic data model. Virtually every model of this type considers all possible …,The VLDB Journal,2009,10

A worst-case optimal multi-round algorithm for parallel computation of conjunctive queries,Bas Ketsman; Dan Suciu,Abstract We study the optimal communication cost for computing a full conjunctive query Qover p distributed servers. Two prior results were known. First; for one-round algorithms overskew-free data the optimal communication cost per server is m/p^(1/tau*); where m is thesize of the largest input relation; and tau* is the fractional vertex covering number of thequery hypergraph. Second; for multi-round algorithms and unrestricted database instances;it was shown that any algorithm requires at least m/p^(1/rho*) communication cost perserver; where rho* is the fractional edge covering number of the query hypergraph; but nomatching algorithms were known for this case (except for two restricted queries: chains andcycles). In this paper we describe a multi-round algorithm that computes any query with loadm/p^(1/rho*) per server; in the case when all input relations are binary. Thus; we prove …,Proceedings of the 36th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems,2017,9

Computing join queries with functional dependencies,Mahmoud Abo Khamis; Hung Q Ngo; Dan Suciu,Abstract Recently; Gottlob; Lee; Valiant; and Valiant (GLVV) presented an output size boundfor join queries with functional dependencies (FD); based on a linear program onpolymatroids. GLVV bound strictly generalizes the bound of Atserias; Grohe and Marx (AGM)for queries with no FD; in which case there are known algorithms running within the AGM-bound and thus are worst-case optimal. A main result of this paper is an algorithm forcomputing join queries with FDs; running within GLVV bound up to a poly-log factor. Inparticular; our algorithm is worst-case optimal for any query where the GLVV bound is tight.As an unexpected by-product; our algorithm manages to solve a harder problem; where(some) input relations may have prescribed maximum degree bounds; of which bothfunctional dependencies and cardinality bounds are special cases.

Automatic enforcement of data use policies with datalawyer,Prasang Upadhyaya; Magdalena Balazinska; Dan Suciu,Abstract Data has value and is increasingly being exchanged for commercial and researchpurposes. Data; however; is typically accompanied by terms of use; which limit how it can beused. To date; there are only a few; ad-hoc methods to enforce these terms. We proposeDataLawyer; a new system to formally specify usage policies and check them automaticallyat query runtime in a relational database management system (DBMS). We develop a newmodel to specify policies compactly and precisely. We introduce novel algorithms toefficiently evaluate policies that can cut policy-checking overheads to only a few percent ofthe total query runtime. We implement DataLawyer and evaluate it on a real database fromthe health-care domain.,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,8
Lifted probabilistic inference: A guide for the database researcher,Eric Gribkoff; Dan Suciu; Guy Van den Broeck,Modern knowledge bases such as Yago [14]; DeepDive [19]; and Google's Knowledge Vault[6] are constructed from large corpora of text by using some form of supervised informationextraction. The extracted data usually starts as a large probabilistic database; then itsaccuracy is improved by adding domain knowledge expressed as hard or soft constraints.Finally; the knowledge base can be queried using some general-purpose query language(SQL; or Sparql). A key technical challenge during the construction; refinement; andquerying of knowledge bases is probabilistic reasoning. Because of the size of the datainvolved; probabilistic reasoning in knowledge bases becomes a central data managementproblem. The number of random variables is very large; typically one for each fact in theknowledge base.

Peex: Extracting probabilistic events from RFID data,Nodira Khoussainova; Magdalena Balazinska; Dan Suciu,Abstract Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology is increasingly being used tosupport various industrial and ubiquitous computing applications. Although this technologyholds the promise to facilitate many of our every day activities; the noisy and low-level dataproduced by RFID readers today is extremely difficult to use or comprehend in most but thesimplest settings. In this paper; we present PEEX; a system that enables applications toeasily define; extract; and manage meaningful probabilistic highlevel events from low-levelRFID data. By using a declarative query language; the system simplifies definitions of newevents. By using probabilities; the system copes with the noise and errors in the data and theinherent ambiguity in the event extraction. We have built PEEX as a layer on top of atraditional RDBMS; thus enabling applications not only to detect events but also manage …,Technical Report 2007–11–02; Department of Computer Science and Engineering,2007,8

A scalable algorithm for query minimization,Isaac K Kunen; Dan Suciu,Abstract Minimizing a query means finding an equivalent one with the least number of joins.Although this problem was conceived over 25 years ago; no scalable algorithm exists todayfor several reasons. First; the problem is NP-hard even for conjunctive queries; which seemsto preclude a universally fast algorithm. More importantly; there was little need: historicallymost queries were handwritten and already minimal. Today view expansion has become acentral theme of many systems. This tends to result in queries that are highly redundant andin need of minimization. In addition; recent theoretical work on tree-decomposition hasprovided a new approach to query containment; the major sub-problem in queryminimization. We describe a query...,*,2002,8

Equivalence and normal forms for the restricted and bounded fixpoint in the nested algebra,Marc Gyssens; Dan Suciu; Dirk Van Gucht,Abstract The nested model is an extension of the traditional;“flat” relational model in whichrelations can also have relation-valued entries. Its “default” query language; the nestedalgebra; is rather weak; unfortunately; since it is only a conservative extension of thetraditional; flat relational algebra; and thus can express only a small fraction of thepolynomial-time queries. Therefore; it was proposed to extend the nested algebra with afixpoint construct; but the resulting language turned out to be too powerful: many inherentlyexponential queries could also be expressed. Two polynomial-time restrictions of the fixpointclosure of the nested algebra were proposed: the restricted fixpoint closure (by Gyssens andVan Gucht) and the bounded fixpoint closure (by Suciu). Here; we prove two results. First weshow that both restrictions are equivalent in expressive power. The proof technique relies …,Information and Computation,2001,7

We show that any other query in the algebra which expresses transitiveclosure needs exponential space; under a “call by value” evaluation strategy. This provesthat in general the powerset is an intractable operator for implementing fixpoint queries.,journal of computer and system sciences,1997,7

The most probable database problem,Eric Gribkoff; Guy Van den Broeck; Dan Suciu,Abstract: This paper proposes a novel inference task for probabilistic databases: the mostprobable database (MPD) problem. The MPD is the most probable deterministic databasewhere a given query or constraint is true. We highlight two distinctive applications; indatabase repair of key and dependency constraints; and in finding most probableexplanations in statistical relational learning. The MPD problem raises new theoreticalquestions; such as the possibility of a dichotomy theorem for MPD; classifying queries asbeing either PTIME or NP-hard. We show that such a dichotomy would diverge fromdichotomies for other inference tasks. We then prove a dichotomy for queries that representunary functional dependency constraints. Finally; we discuss symmetric probabilities and theopportunities for lifted inference.,Proceedings of the First international workshop on Big Uncertain Data (BUDA),2014,6
Big data begets big database theory,Dan Suciu,Introduction Industry analysts describe Big Data in terms of three V's: volume; velocity;variety. The data is too big to process with current tools; it arrives too fast for optimal storageand indexing; and it is too heterogeneous to fit into a rigid schema. There is a huge pressureon database researchers to study; explain; and solve the technical challenges in big data;but we find no inspiration in the three Vs. Volume is surely nothing new for us; streamingdatabases have been extensively studied over a decade; while data integration andsemistructured has studied heterogeneity from all possible angles.,British National Conference on Databases,2013,6
Boosting the accuracy of differentially-private queries through consistency,Michael Hay; Vibhor Rastogi; Gerome Miklau; Dan Suciu,ABSTRACT Recent differentially private query mechanisms offer strong privacy guaranteesby adding noise to the query answer. For a single counting query; the technique is simple;accurate; and provides optimal utility. However; analysts typically wish to ask multiplequeries. In this case; the optimal strategy is not apparent; and alternative query strategiescan involve difficult trade-offs in accuracy; and may produce inconsistent answers. In thiswork we show that it is possible to significantly improve accuracy for a general class ofhistogram queries. Our approach carefully chooses a set of queries to evaluate; and thenexploits consistency constraints that should hold over the noisy output. In a post-processingphase; we compute the consistent input most likely to have produced the noisy output. Thefinal output is both private and consistent; but in addition; it is often much more accurate …,CoRR; abs/0904.0942; April,2009,6
Method for prevention of recursive loops between network elements,*,The occurrence of recursive loops between network elements are detected and prevented.One or more queries are generated that are sent between the network elements. One ormore of the network elements detect the imminent occurrence of a recursive loop betweenthe network elements; and prevent the recursive loop by generating an intensional answerin response to the query. The intensional answer contains rules.,*,2007,6
Implementation and analysis of a parallel collection query language,Dan Suciu,Abstract We study implementation techniques for a parallel query language for nestedcollections. The language handles collections of three kinds (sets; bags; and sequences);and its expressive power is essentially that of OQL (ODMG93). From the perspective ofparallel evaluation; the novelty of such a query language is that it can express nestedparallelism; which is naturally associated to nested collections. The rst implementation stepis a translation into a specially designed algebra for at sequences; having only atparallelism: the translation\attens" the nested parallelism; and we prove that it preserves theasymptotic parallel complexity. The second step consists in an implementation of thesequence algebra on a shared nothing architecture.

There issome risk in trusting the cloud providers with sensitive data. A curious administrator maypeek inside the data for amusement or for financial profit; a hacker may break into the cloudserver and steal the entire data. So far; cloud service companies have been spared a majordisaster and their users still trust them with data; but these companies are only one headlinestory away from a trust crisis.

A dataflow graph transformation language and query rewriting system for RDF ontologies,Marianne Shaw; Landon T Detwiler; James F Brinkley; Dan Suciu,Abstract Users interested in biological and biomedical information sets on the semantic webare frequently not computer scientists. These researchers often find it difficult to usedeclarative query and view definition languages to manipulate these RDF data sets. Wedefine a language IML consisting of a small number of graph transformations that can becomposed in a dataflow style to transform RDF ontologies. The language's operationsclosely map to the high-level manipulations users undertake when transforming ontologiesusing a visual editor. To reduce the potentially high cost of evaluating queries over thesetransformations on demand; we describe a query rewriting engine for evaluating queries onIML views. The rewriter leverages IML's dataflow style and optimizations to eliminateunnecessary transformations in answering a query over an IML view.

LaraDB: A minimalist kernel for linear and relational algebra computation,Dylan Hutchison; Bill Howe; Dan Suciu,Abstract Analytics tasks manipulate structured data with variants of relational algebra (RA)and quantitative data with variants of linear algebra (LA).

At the logical level we propose LARA; a leanalgebra of three operators; that expresses RA and LA as well as relevant optimization rules.We show a series of proofs that position LARA at just the right level of expressiveness for amiddleware algebra: more explicit than MapReduce but more general than RA or LA. At thephysical level we find that the LARA operators afford efficient implementations using a singleprimitive that is available in a variety of backend engines: range scans over partitionedsorted maps.

Communication cost in parallel query processing,Paul Beame; Paraschos Koutris; Dan Suciu,Abstract: We study the problem of computing conjunctive queries over large databases onparallel architectures without shared storage. Using the structure of such a query $ q $ andthe skew in the data; we study tradeoffs between the number of processors; the number ofrounds of communication; and the per-processor load--the number of bits each processorcan send or can receive in a single round--that are required to compute $ q $. When the datais free of skew; we obtain essentially tight upper and lower bounds for one round algorithmsand we show how the bounds degrade when there is skew in the data. In the case ofskewed data; we show how to improve the algorithms when approximate degrees of theheavy-hitter elements are available; obtaining essentially optimal algorithms for queriessuch as simple joins and triangle join queries.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1602.06236,2016,4

Managing Structured Collections of Community Data.,Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Dan Suciu,ABSTRACT Data management is becoming increasingly social. We observe a new form ofinformation in such collaborative scenarios; where users contribute and reuse information;which resides neither in the base data nor in the schema information. This “superimposedstructure” derives partly from interaction within the community; and partly from therecombination of existing data. We argue that this triad of data; schema; and higher-orderstructure requires new data abstractions that–at the same time–must efficiently scale to verylarge community databases. In addition; data generated by the community exposes fourcharacteristics that make scalability especially difficult:(i) inconsistency; as different users orapplications have or require partially overlapping and contradicting views;(ii) non-monotonicity; as new information may be able to revoke previous information already built …,CIDR,2011,4

We develop ourframework starting from the well-studied definition of actual causes by Halpern and Pearl[13]. After identifying some undesirable characteristics of the original definition; we proposefunctional causes as a refined definition of causality with several desirable properties.

Warehousing and incremental evaluation for Web Site management.,Mary F Fernández; Daniela Florescu; Alon Y Levy; Dan Suciu,Abstract Recently; several systems have been proposed for building Web sites fromdeclarative speci cations. The salient feature of these systems is that they model both thestructure and the content of a Web site as a view over some existing raw data. In this\Website as view" paradigm; a critical issue is when to compute the site. One approach is tomaterialize the site completely before the users browse it: the disadvantages of thisapproach are high maintenance costs and stale data. Moreover; this approach is notapplicable if the Web site has forms; because then the queries de ning the Web sitedepends on user input. The other extreme approach is to precompute only the root (s) of theWeb site; and then compute dynamically (at\click time") the queries that retrieves theinformation required to display the next page.

What do Shannon-type Inequalities; Submodular Width; and Disjunctive Datalog have to do with one another?,Mahmoud Abo Khamis; Hung Q Ngo; Dan Suciu,Abstract Recent works on bounding the output size of a conjunctive query with functionaldependencies and degree bounds have shown a deep connection between fundamentalquestions in information theory and database theory. We prove analogous output bounds fordisjunctive datalog rules; and answer several open questions regarding the tightness andlooseness of these bounds along the way. The bounds are intimately related to Shannon-type information inequalities. We devise the notion of a" proof sequence" of a specific classof Shannon-type information inequalities called" Shannon flow inequalities". We then showhow a proof sequence can be used as symbolic instructions to guide an algorithm calledPANDA; which answers disjunctive datalog rules within the size bound predicted. We showthat PANDA can be used as a black-box to devise algorithms matching precisely the …,Proceedings of the 36th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems,2017,3
Dissociation and propagation for approximate lifted inference with standard relational database management systems,Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Dan Suciu,Abstract Probabilistic inference over large data sets is a challenging data managementproblem since exact inference is generally# P-hard and is most often solved approximatelywith sampling-based methods today. This paper proposes an alternative approach forapproximate evaluation of conjunctive queries with standard relational databases: In ourapproach; every query is evaluated entirely in the database engine by evaluating a fixednumber of query plans; each providing an upper bound on the true probability; then takingtheir minimum. We provide an algorithm that takes into account important schemainformation to enumerate only the minimal necessary plans among all possible plans.Importantly; this algorithm is a strict generalization of all known PTIME self-join-freeconjunctive queries: A query is in PTIME if and only if our algorithm returns one single …,The VLDB Journal,2017,3

Default-all is dangerous!,Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Alexandra Meliou; Dan Suciu,Abstract We show that the default-all propagation scheme for database annotations isdangerous. Dangerous here means that it can propagate annotations to the query outputwhich are semantically irrelevant to the query the user asked. This is the result ofconsidering all relationally equivalent queries and returning the union of their where-provenance in an attempt to define a propagation scheme that is insensitive to queryrewriting. We propose an alternative query-rewrite-insensitive (QRI) where-provenancecalled minimal propagation. It is analogous to the minimal witness basis for whyprovenance;straight-forward to evaluate; and returns all relevant and only relevant annotations.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1105.4395,2011,3
Optimal upper and lower bounds for boolean expressions by dissociation,Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Dan Suciu,Abstract: This paper develops upper and lower bounds for the probability of Booleanexpressions by treating multiple occurrences of variables as independent and assigningthem new individual probabilities. Our technique generalizes and extends the underlyingidea of a number of recent approaches which are varyingly called node splitting; variablerenaming; variable splitting; or dissociation for probabilistic databases. We prove that theprobabilities we assign to new variables are the best possible in some sense.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1105.2813,2011,3
Distributed XQuery-based integration and visualization of multimodality data: Application to brain mapping.,Landon T Detwiler; Dan Suciu; Joshua D Franklin; Eider B Moore; Andrew W Poliakov; E Sally Lee; David P Corina; George A Ojemann; James F Brinkley,Abstract This paper addresses the need for relatively small groups of collaboratinginvestigators to integrate distributed and heterogeneous data about the brain. Althoughvarious national efforts facilitate large-scale data sharing; these approaches are generallytoo “heavyweight” for individual or small groups of investigators; with the result that mostdata sharing among collaborators continues to be ad hoc. Our approach to this problem is tocreate a “lightweight” distributed query architecture; in which data sources are accessible viaweb services that accept arbitrary query languages but return XML results. A DistributedXQuery Processor (DXQP) accepts distributed XQueries in which subqueries are shipped tothe remote data sources to be executed; with the resulting XML integrated by DXQP.

A Peformant XQuery to SQL Translator,Christopher Ré; James Brinkley; Dan Suciu,Abstract We describe a largely complete and efficient XQuery to SQL translation for XMLpublishing. Our translation supports the entire XQuery language; except for functions; ifstatements and upwards navigation axes. The system has three important properties. First; itpreserves the correct XQuery semantics. This is accomplished by first translating XQueryinto core-XQuery; using a complete XQuery implementation; Galax. Second; we optimize theresulting SQL queries. We develop a comprehensive framework for optimizing the XQuery toSQL translation; which is effective for a wide range of XQuery workloads. Third; ourtranslation is platform independent. Our system achieves high degree of efficiency on a widerange of relational systems.

Modeling integrity in data exchange,Gerome Miklau; Dan Suciu,Abstract We provide a formal model of security guarantees offered by digital signatureschemes when they are applied to structured data. This model is an important step towardsmanaging the integrity of data that is shared; integrated; transformed; and exchanged on theWorld Wide Web. We express signature semantics using well-known database constraints;which can help authors decide what to sign; help recipients evaluate the integrity of signeddata; and clarify the capabilities of different signature technologies.,Workshop on Secure Data Management,2004,3
Enabling Secure Data Exchange.,Gerome Miklau; Dan Suciu,The emergence of diverse networked data sources has created new opportunities for thesharing and exchange of data. In support of this; a fruitful line of research has resulted indistributed data processing and integration systems [19; 17; 29; 30; 3]. However in practice;fear of unauthorized disclosure or malicious tampering requires that data stay safely behindfirewalls or remain protected by secure servers. Our goal is to overcome these limitationsand enable secure data exchange and sharing in distributed integration scenarios. Suchscenarios are characterized by many interacting data sources and many data consumers.Primary sources create and publish data; intermediate sources combine; extract; and modifythe data for further dissemination; data consumers query it. This paper describes issues insecure data exchange; and illustrates some solutions proposed in the authors' own work …,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2004,3

XBrain is a JSPweb application that dynamically publishes data from a relational database containinglanguage map data acquired during neurosurgery. 1 XBrain takes XQueries as input; handsit to a middleware application called SilkRoute; and returns XML results back to the user.Although XML is good for data exchange between applications; it is often not chosen forvisualization of the data because it is not very human readable (sample output in Figure 1).Therefore; we focused on the users (neuroscientists) and developed more intuitive ways tovisualize the XML output in XBrain.

Reuse Anomaly in Object-Oriented Concurrent Programming,Dan Mircea Suciu,Abstract. The integration of the concurrent mechanisms in object-oriented programming is withoutdoubt; an attractive idea. Unfortunately; the design of some efficient programming languagesthat can achieve this thing is extremely difficult. The primitives of communication and synchronizationbetween concurrent activities interfere with features of the object-oriented programming causingthe deterioration of some properties of some concepts that form the basis of those two programmingtechniques. The inheritance anomalies represent the most intensively studied in the literatureconflicts generated by such interference. A systematically analysis of these conflicts was notbeen done until now. Moreover; we want to prove that any of the classifications of these anomaliesachieved until now are not complete. We will show as well; that conflicts between concurrencyand delegation or between concurrency and association are of the same type as the …,Studia Universitatis “Babes-Bolyai”; Informatica,1997,3
Exact model counting of query expressions: limitations of propositional methods,Paul Beame; Jerry Li; Sudeepa Roy; Dan Suciu,Abstract We prove exponential lower bounds on the running time of the state-of-the-art exactmodel counting algorithms—algorithms for exactly computing the number of satisfyingassignments; or the satisfying probability; of Boolean formulas. These algorithms can beseen; either directly or indirectly; as building Decision-Decomposable Negation NormalForm (decision-DNNF) representations of the input Boolean formulas. Decision-DNNFs area special case of d-DNNFs where d stands for deterministic. We show that any knowledgecompilation representations from a class (called DLDDs in this article) that contain decision-DNNFs can be converted into equivalent Free Binary Decision Diagrams (FBDDs); alsoknown as Read-Once Branching Programs; with only a quasi-polynomial increase inrepresentation size.

Price-optimal querying with data apis,Prasang Upadhyaya; Magdalena Balazinska; Dan Suciu,Abstract Data is increasingly being purchased online in data markets and REST APIs haveemerged as a favored method to acquire such data. Typically; sellers charge buyers basedon how much data they purchase. In many scenarios; buyers need to make repeated calls tothe seller's API. The challenge is then for buyers to keep track of the data they purchase andavoid purchasing the same data twice. In this paper; we propose lightweight modifications todata APIs to achieve optimal history-aware pricing so that buyers are only charged once fordata that they have purchased and that has not been updated. The key idea behind ourapproach is the notion of refunds: buyers buy data as needed but have the ability to ask forrefunds of data that they had already purchased before. We show that our techniques canprovide significant data cost savings while reducing overheads by two orders of …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,2
Lara: A Key-Value Algebra underlying Arrays and Relations,Dylan Hutchison; Bill Howe; Dan Suciu,Abstract: Data processing systems roughly group into families such as relational; array;graph; and key-value. Many data processing tasks exceed the capabilities of any one family;require data stored across families; or run faster when partitioned onto multiple families.Discovering ways to execute computation among multiple available systems; let alonediscovering an optimal execution plan; is challenging given semantic differences betweendisparate families of systems. In this paper we introduce a new algebra; Lara; whichunderlies and unifies algebras representing the families above in order to facilitatetranslation between systems. We describe the operations and objects of Lara---union; join;and ext on associative tables---and show her properties and equivalences to other algebras.Multi-system optimization has a bright future; in which we proffer Lara for the role of …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1604.03607,2016,2
Non-intrusive tongue tracking and its applicability in post-stroke rehabilitation,Dan Mircea Suciu; Bogdan Andrei Pop; Rares Urdea; Bogdan Mursa,Abstract sMilestone is a medical software solution which achieves the goal of helpingpeople who have lost their ability to speak as a result of neurological injuries such as strokesor brain tumors. It aids patients in the recovery process; improving the speed at which theyrecover while also alleviating the psychological implications associated with such acondition. All this is achieved by using a device called Kinect for capturing facial muscle andtongue movement. These captured movements are then used as input for games andactivities that make use of occupational therapy and hasten the recovery process. This papergoes through the details of how the tongue movement tracking algorithm was developed inorder to be used in speech recovery sessions.,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2014,2

Semi-Structured Data Model,Dan Suciu,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}. A query Q is called domain independent if the value of Qwhen applied to any database is the same for any two domains containing the databasevalues or; equivalently; if the value of Q when applied to a database contains only values …,*,2009,2
Query Containment of Tier-2 Queries over a Probabilistic Database.,Katherine F Moore; Vibhor Rastogi; Christopher Ré; Dan Suciu,Abstract. We study the containment problem for a query language over probabilisticrelational databases that allows queries like “is the probability that q1 holds greater than 0.2and the probability that q2 holds greater than 0.6?” where q1 and q2 are Booleanconjunctive queries. In addition to being a fundamental problem in its own right; thecontainment problem is the key problem that an optimizer must solve for many standardoptimizations (such as picking up an index or using a materialized view). Our main technicalresult is that the containment problem is decidable; and we give an EXPSPACE-algorithmbased on linear programming for it. We believe that we are the first to study the containmentproblem for any such probabilistic languages.,MUD,2009,2

In particular; binary tree relations such as theextended XPath axes can be either decided for a given pair of node IDs; or reconstructed fora single node ID; without access to secondary storage. Several ID schemes have beenproposed so far; which differ with respect to (1) expressiveness; ie which relations can bedecided or reconstructed from IDs;(2) the runtime performance and asymptotic behaviour ofdecision and reconstruction operations;(3) the storage overhead for the IDs; and (4)robustness; ie behaviour in the presence of updates.

Data on the Web: From Relational to Semistructured Data and XML,Serge Abiteboul; Peter Buneman; Dan Suciu,Since Ancient Days; human beings have exchanged money for goods; or even some goodsfor other kind of goods. The goods that were exchanged characterized the different agesthrough History. Today; we are in the so-called Information Age and; therefore; a core part ofcurrent interactions take place around data exchanges. Serge Abiteboul et al.'s “Data on theWeb” aims at laying the foundations for data exchange in those applications which deal withsemistructured data. A few years ago; software developers used to tame complexity insoftware systems through the design and implementation of structured data models. Theybuilt their applications over well-structured data. The advent of web and object technologieshas shown some of the limitations of structured models. The identification of such limitationshas led to the development of new approaches to deal with not-so-well structured data.,SIGMOD Record,2003,2

Web Data and the Resurrection of Database Theory.,Dan Suciu,Since the seventies; database theory has contributed a number of landmark results thathave helped databases become a multi-billion dollar industry; and the database field amature research area. But as the area matured; theory has had fewer opportunities tocontribute to a more and more static field. In PODS 1995; a famous paper by ChristosPapadimitriou analyzed the health of database theory and stopped short of saying that thearea was in a crisis. Today; the proliferation of data management applications on the Internetbrings about a revolution that asks for new foundational work. Data on the Web is differentthan traditional data.

Answering conjunctive queries with inequalities,Paraschos Koutris; Tova Milo; Sudeepa Roy; Dan Suciu,Abstract In this paper; we study the complexity of answering conjunctive queries (CQ) withinequalities (≠). In particular; we are interested in comparing the complexity of the querywith and without inequalities. The main contribution of our work is a novel combinatorialtechnique that enables us to use any Select-Project-Join query plan for a given CQ withoutinequalities in answering the CQ with inequalities; with an additional factor in running timethat only depends on the query. The key idea is to define a new projection operator; whichkeeps a small representation (independent of the size of the database) of the set of inputtuples that map to each tuple in the output of the projection; this representation is used toevaluate all the inequalities in the query. Second; we generalize a result by Papadimitriouand Yannakakis (1997) and give an alternative algorithm based on the color-coding …,Theory of Computing Systems,2017,1

We develop the theoreticalframework and formulation of our probabilistic representation and show how to use it toanswer queries. We then present solving techniques and give three critical optimizations toimprove preprocessing time and query accuracy.

A Guide to Formal Analysis of Join Processing in Massively Parallel Systems,Paraschos Koutris; Dan Suciu,Over the last decade; there has been an enormous increase in the volume of data that isbeing stored; processed and analyzed. In order to improve the performance of queryprocessing on such amounts of data; many modern data management systems (eg Spark[23; 28]; Hadoop [13; 9; 24]; and others [19; 14]) have resorted to the power of parallelism tospeed up computation. Parallelism enables the distribution of computation for data-intensivetasks into hundreds; or even thousands of machines; and thus significantly reduces thecompletion time for several crucial data processing tasks. In this paper; we present a surveyon recent results [18; 4; 5; 17] that study the computational complexity of mulitway joinprocessing in such massively parallel systems. Our goal is twofold. First; we introduce asimple theoretical model; called the MPC (Massively Parallel Computation) model; that …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2017,1

Despite theoretical limitations; COSETTEleverages recent advances in both automated constraint solving and interactive theoremproving to decide the equivalences of a wide range of real world queries; including complexrewrite rules from the database literature. COSETTE can also validate the inequality ofqueries by finding counter examples; ie; database instances which; when executed on thetwo queries; will return different results. COSETTE can find counter examples of many realworld inequivalent queries including a number of real-world optimizer bugs.

What do Shannon information inequalities; submodular width; and disjunctive datalog have to do with one another?,Mahmoud Abo Khamis; Hung Q Ngo; Dan Suciu,Abstract: Recent works on bounding the output size of a conjunctive query with functionaldependencies and degree bounds have shown a deep connection between fundamentalquestions in information theory and database theory. We prove analogous output bounds fordisjunctive datalog queries; and answer several open questions regarding the tightness andlooseness of these bounds along the way. The bounds are intimately related to Shannon-type information inequalities. We devise the notion of a" proof sequence" of a specific classof Shannon-type information inequalities called" Shannon flow inequalities". We then showhow the proof sequence can be used as symbolic instructions to guide an algorithm called"PANDA"; which answers disjunctive datalog queries within the size bound predicted.

Lifted Inference in Probabilistic Databases.,Dan Suciu,Abstract. Probabilistic Databases (PDBs) extend traditional relational databases byannotating each record with a weight; or a probability. Although PDBs define a very simpleprobability space; by simply adding constraints one can model much richer probabilityspaces; such as those represented by Markov Logic Networks or other Statistical RelationalModels. While in traditional databases query evaluation corresponds to model checking andis always tractable; in probabilistic databases it becomes model counting; a notoriouslycomputationally hard problem.“Lifted inference” is a new class of weighted model countingmethods that exploit the First Order sentence in which the query is specified; rather thanprocessing the Boolean formula directly. By analyzing the First Order sentence; it is oftenpossible to classify the data complexity of weighted model counting problem into …,Description Logics,2016,1
SQB: Session-based Query Browsing for More Effective Query Reuse,Nodira Khoussainova; Y Kwon; Wei-Ting Liao; Magdalena Balazinska; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Dan Suciu,Abstract. Scientists are generating more data than ever before and are increasingly puttingthat data (or corresponding metadata) inside a relational database accessible through SQL.Composing non-trivial SQL queries; however; is difficult. Just like code reuse; query reusecan facilitate and accelerate the task of composing new queries. A key challenge is how bestto facilitate this reuse. In this paper; we introduce Smart Query Browser (SQB); a tool forsearching and browsing through a repository of SQL queries. SQB applies the idea of aquery session to improve query browsing and reuse. Informally; a query session is a set ofqueries authored by a single user to achieve a specific information goal. To evaluate SQB;we conduct a user study with 16 users and find that SQB reduces the query composition timeby 57% compared with a traditional; unassisted query composition setting.,*,2011,1
Detecting anomalies in data streams using statecharts.,Vasile-Marian Scuturici; Dan-Mircea Suciu; Romain Vuillemot; Aris M Ouksel; Lionel Brunie,Abstract. The environment around us is progressively equipped with various sensors;producing data continuously. The applications using these data face many challenges; suchas data stream integration over an attribute (such as time) and knowledge extraction fromraw data. In this paper we propose one approach to face those two challenges. First; datastreams integration is performed using statecharts which represents a resume of dataproduced by the corresponding data producer. Second; we detect anomalous events overtemporal relations among statecharts. We describe our approach in a demonstrationscenario; that is using a visual tool called Patternator.,EGC,2010,1

A model of multimodal fusion for medical applications,S Yang; I Atmosukarto; J Franklin; JF Brinkley; D Suciu; LG Shapiro,Content-based image retrieval has been applied to many different biomedical applications1. In almost all cases; retrievals involve a single query image of a particular modality andretrieved images are from this same modality. For example; one system may retrieve colorimages from eye exams; while another retrieves fMRI images of the brain. Yet real patientsoften have had tests from multiple different modalities; and retrievals based on more thanone modality could provide information that single modality searches fail to see. In thispaper; we show medical image retrieval for two different single modalities and propose amodel for multimodal fusion that will lead to improved capabilities for physicians andbiomedical researchers. We describe a graphical user interface for multimodal retrieval thatis being tested by real biomedical researchers in several different fields.,Multimedia Content Access: Algorithms and Systems III,2009,1
Believe it or not,Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Magdalena Balazinska; Nodira Khoussainova; Dan Suciu,Abstract We propose a database model that allows users to annotate data with beliefstatements. Our motivation comes from scientic database applications where a community ofusers is working together to assemble; revise; and curate a shared data repository. As thecommunity accumulates knowledge and the database content evolves over time; it maycontain conflicting information and members can disagree on the information it should store.For example; Alice may believe that a tuple should be in the database; whereas Bobdisagrees. He may also insert the reason why he thinks Alice believes the tuple should be inthe database; and explain what he thinks the correct tuple should be instead. We propose aformal model for Belief Databases that interprets users' annotations as belief statements.These annotations can refer both to the base data and to other annotations. We give a …,*,2009,1
Probabilistic databases: Diamonds in the dirt (extended version),Nilesh Dalvi; Christopher Ré; Dan Suciu,A wide range of applications have recently emerged that need to manage large; imprecisedata sets. The reasons for imprecision in data are as diverse as the applications themselves:in sensor and RFID data; imprecision is due to measurement errors [28; 66]; in informationextraction; imprecision comes from the inherent ambiguity in natural-language text [32; 40];and in business intelligence; imprecision is used to reduce the cost of data cleaning [12]. Insome applications; such as privacy; it is a requirement that the data be less precise. Forexample; imprecision is purposely inserted to hide sensitive attributes of individuals so thatthe data may be published [29; 55; 62]. Imprecise data has no place in traditional; precisedatabase applications like payroll and inventory; and so; current database managementsystems are not prepared to deal with it.

05061 Summary--Foundations of Semi-structured Data,Frank Neven; Thomas Schwentick; Dan Suciu,Abstract As in the first seminar on this topic; the aim o the workshop was to bring togetherpeople from the areas related to semi-structured data. However; besides the presentation ofrecent work; this time the main goal was to identify the main lines of a common framework forfuture foundational work on semi-structured data. These lines of research are summarizedbelow. The workshop was of a very interdisciplinary nature with invitees from databases;structured documents; programming languages; information retrieval and formal languagetheory. Several of the lectures were presented by PhD students. We had four invitedspeakers and a panel on research evaluation. Due to strong connections between topicstreated at this workshop; many of the participants initiated new cooperations and researchprojects.,Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings,2005,1
Indexing Heterogeneous Data,Nilesh Dalvi; Dan Suciu,Abstract We consider the indexing problem for heterogeneous data; where objects are setsof attribute-value pairs; and the queries specify values for an arbitrary subset of theattributes. This problem occurs in a variety of applications; such as searching individualdatabases; searching entire collections of heterogeneous data sources; locating sources indistributed systems; and indexing large XML documents. To date no efficient data structureis known for such queries. In its most simplified form the problem we address becomes thepartial match problem; which has been studied extensively and is know to becomputationally hard. We describe here the first practical technique for building such anindex. Our basic idea is to precumpute certain queries and store their results. User queriesare then answered by retrieving the “closest” stored query and removing from its answers …,*,2003,1

Starting from aworkload of XQueries; the tool extracts the set of all XPath expressions; and displays themtogether with some relationships. XViz is intended to be used by an XML databaseadministrator in order to assist her in performing routine tasks such as database tuning;performance debugging; comparison between versions; etc. Two kinds of semanticrelationships are computed and displayed by XViz; ancestor/descendant and containment.We describe an efficient; optimized algorithm to compute them.,International XML Database Symposium,2003,1

Foundations of Semistructured Data,Alberto Mendelzon; Thomas Schwentick; Dan Suciu,Traditional database systems rely on an old model: the relational data model. When it wasproposed in the early 1970's by Codd; a logician; the relational model generated a truerevolution in data management. In this simple model data is represented as relations in firstorder structures and queries as first order logic formulas. It enabled researchers andimplementors to separate the logical aspect of the data from its physical implementation.Thirty years of research and development followed; and they led to today's mature andhighly performant relational database systems. The age of the Internet brought new datamanagement applications and challenges. Data is now accessed over the Web; and isavailable in a variety of formats; including HTML; XML; as well as several applicationspecific data formats. Often data is mixed with free text; and the boundary between data …,Schloss Dagstuhl Seminar,2001,1

Silkroute: Trading between relations and xml,Mary Fern; Dan Suciu,Abstract Keywords. Data exchange; XML; Relational databases; XML Queries. XML is the standardformat for data exchange between inter-enterprise applications on the Internet. To facilitate dataexchange; industry groups define public document type definitions (DTDs) that specify the formatof the XML data to be exchanged between their applications. In this paper; we address the problemof automating the conversion of relational data into XML. We describe SilkRoute; a general;dynamic; and e cient tool for viewing and querying relational data in XML. SilkRoute isgeneral; because it can express mappings of relational data into XML that conforms to arbitraryDTDs; not just a canonical mapping of the relational schema. We call these mappings views.Applications express the data they need as an XML-QL query over the view.

Queries on databases with user-defined functions,Dan Suciu,Abstract The notion of a database query is generalized for databases with user-definedfunctions. Then; we can prove that the computable queries coincide with those expressibleby an extension of the relational machine; with oracles ([4]). This implies that any completequery language; extended with user-defined function symbols in a" reasonable" way; is stillcomplete. We give an example of a complete query language with user-defined functions;and discuss its connections with object inventions.,Technical Reports (CIS),1993,1
Mixed XML/relational data processing,Yana Kadiyska; Dan Suciu,ABSTRACT Today XML is processed either with an XQuery engine; or is shred into relationsand processed with a SQL engine. We argue that none of these strategies is satisfactory;give today's state of the art in relational databases and XML query engines. This paperproposes a mixed processing model; where XML native data coexists with relational data;and two different query engines; a SQL engine and an XQuery engine; are integrated. Wediscuss several alternatives for shredding XML data into a mixed storage; and show that themain challenge in any such approach is query performance. We introduce severaloptimization methods that improve the query performance dramatically; by essentiallypushing more work from the XQuery to the SQL query engine. Finally; we describe a systemimplementing a mixed XML/relational storage; and evaluate it on the XMark benchmark.,Informal Proc. of the workshop on programming language technologies for XML (PLAN-X 2004),*,1
Specification; Detection; and Notification of RFID Events with Cascadia,Evan Welbourne; Garret Cole; Nodira Khoussainova; Julie Letchner; Yang Li; Magdalena Balazinska; Gaetano Borriello; Dan Suciu,The Cascadia system [5] greatly simplifies the development of pervasive RFID applicationsin spite of the inherent uncertainty in RFID data. It provides applications with aninfrastructure for specifying; extracting and managing meaningful high-level events from rawRFID data. Cascadia allows end users to specify events using a web-based tool with anintuitive visual language based on direct manipulation. It also extracts specified events fromthe data in spite of the unreliability of RFID technology and the inherent ambiguity in eventextraction. We demonstrate Cascadia's workings with a map-based interface that displaysstreams of RFID events and with a digital diary application that automatically populates acalendar with events in which the user participated. We use RFID traces collected in ourbuilding-wide RFID deployment; the RFID Ecosystem [1].,*,*,1
Algorithmic Aspects of Parallel Data Processing,Paraschos Koutris; Semih Salihoglu; Dan Suciu,Abstract In the last decade or so we have witnessed a growing interest in processing largedata sets on large distributed clusters. The idea was pioneered by the MapReduceframework; and has been widely adopted by several other systems; including PigLatin; Hive;Scope; U-SQL; Dremmel; Spark and Myria. A large part of the complex data analysisperformed by these systems consists of a sequence of relatively simple query operations;such as joining two or more tables. This survey discusses recent algorithmic developmentsfor distributed data processing. It uses a theoretical model of parallel processing called theMassively Parallel Computation (MPC) model; which is a simplification of the BSP modelwhere the only cost is given by the amount of communication and the number ofcommunication rounds. The survey studies several algorithms for multi-join queries; for …,Foundations and Trends® in Databases,2018,*
Axiomatic Foundations and Algorithms for Deciding Semantic Equivalences of SQL Queries,Shumo Chu; Alvin Cheung; Dan Suciu,Abstract: Deciding the equivalence of SQL queries is a fundamental problem in datamanagement. As prior work has mainly focused on studying the theoretical limitations of theproblem; very few implementations for checking such equivalences exist. In this paper; wepresent a new formalism and implementation for reasoning about the equivalences of SQLqueries. Our formalism; U-semiring; extends SQL's semiring semantics with unboundedsummation and duplicate elimination. U-semiring is defined using only very few axioms andcan thus be easily implemented using proof assistants such as Coq for automated queryreasoning. Yet; they are sufficient enough to enable us reason about sophisticated SQLqueries that are evaluated over bags and sets; along with various integrity constraints. Toevaluate the effectiveness of U-semiring; we have used it to formally verify 39 query …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.02229,2018,*
Boolean Tensor Decomposition for Conjunctive Queries with Negation,Mahmoud Abo Khamis; Hung Q Ngo; Dan Olteanu; Dan Suciu,Abstract: We propose an algorithm for answering conjunctive queries with negation; wherethe negated relations are sparse. Its data complexity matches that of the best knownalgorithms for the positive subquery of the input query and is expressed in terms of thefractional hypertree width and the submodular width. The query complexity depends on thestructure of the negated subquery; in general it is exponential in the number of join variablesoccurring in negated relations yet it becomes polynomial for several classes of queries. Thisalgorithm relies on several contributions. We show how to rewrite queries with negation onsparse relations into equivalent conjunctive queries with not-all-equal (NAE) predicates;which are a multi-dimensional analog of disequality. We then generalize the known color-coding technique to conjunctions of NAE predicates and explain it via a Boolean tensor …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1712.07445,2017,*

Communication Cost in Parallel Query Evaluation: A Tutorial,Dan Suciu,Abstract We consider the following problem: what is the amount of communication requiredto compute a query in parallel on p servers; over a large input database? To study thisproblem we define a variant of Valiant's BSP model [10]; called the Massively ParallelCommunication (MPC) model; where servers are in finitely powerful and where the cost ismeasured in terms of the maximum communication per server; and the number of rounds.Query evaluation in this model has been studied for full conjunctive queries in [6; 7; 9]. Themodel is similar to the MapReduce model of computation; where full conjunctive querieswere studied in [1–4].,Proceedings of the 36th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems,2017,*

Many toolkits have been developed for thispurpose that depends on statistical software. However; these toolkits do not scale to largedatasets. In this paper we describe a suite of techniques for expressing causal inferencetasks from observational data in SQL. This suite supports the state-of-the-art methods forcausal inference and run at scale within a database engine. In addition; we introduceseveral optimization techniques that significantly speedup causal inference; both in theonline and offline setting. We evaluate the quality and performance of our techniques byexperiments of real datasets. Subjects: Databases (cs. DB); Artificial Intelligence (cs. AI);Learning (cs. LG); Performance (cs.

Worst-Case Optimal Algorithms for Parallel Query Processing,Paul Beame; Paraschos Koutris; Dan Suciu,Abstract: In this paper; we study the communication complexity for the problem of computinga conjunctive query on a large database in a parallel setting with $ p $ servers. In contrast toprevious work; where upper and lower bounds on the communication were specified forparticular structures of data (either data without skew; or data with specific types of skew); inthis work we focus on worst-case analysis of the communication cost. The goal is to findworst-case optimal parallel algorithms; similar to the work of [18] for sequential algorithms.We first show that for a single round we can obtain an optimal worst-case algorithm. Theoptimal load for a conjunctive query $ q $ when all relations have size equal to $ M $ is $ O(M/p^{1/\psi^*}) $; where $\psi^* $ is a new query-related quantity called the edge quasi-packing number; which is different from both the edge packing number and edge cover …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1604.01848,2016,*
SlimShot: Probabilistic Inference for Web-Scale Knowledge Bases.,Eric Gribkoff; Dan Suciu,Abstract Increasingly large Knowledge Bases are being created; by crawling the Web orother corpora of documents; and by extracting facts and relations using machine learningtechniques. To manage the uncertainty in the data; these KBs rely on probabilistic enginesbased on Markov Logic Networks (MLN); for which probabilistic inference remains a majorchallenge. Today's state of the art systems reduce the task of inference to weighted modelcounting and use an MCMC algorithm wrapped around SampleSAT to generateapproximately uniform samples.

Causes take the form of databasetuples; and can be ranked according to their causal responsibility; a numerical measure oftheir relevance as a cause for the query answer. In this work we revisit this notion;introducing and making a case for an alternative measure of causal contribution; that ofcausal effect. In doing so; we generalize the notion of actual cause; in particular; goingbeyond monotone queries. We show that causal effect provides intuitive and intendedresults.,*,2016,*

Tractability in probabilistic databases,Dan Suciu,Abstract Probabilistic databases are motivated by a large and diverse set of applications thatneed to query and process uncertain data. Uncertain and probabilistic data arises in RFIDsystems [22]; information extraction [12]; data cleaning [1]; scientific data management [17];biomedical data integration [9]; business intelligence [14]; approximate schema mappings[10]; data deduplication [13]. All these applications have large collections of data; wheresome; or most individual data items are uncertain.,Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Database Theory,2011,*
Snipsuggest,Nodira Khoussainova; YongChul Kwon; Magdalena Balazinska; Dan Suciu,Abstract In this paper; we present SnipSuggest; a system that provides onthe-go; context-aware assistance in the SQL composition process. SnipSuggest aims to help the increasingpopulation of non-expert database users; who need to perform complex analysis on theirlarge-scale datasets; but have difficulty writing SQL queries. As a user types a query;SnipSuggest recommends possible additions to various clauses in the query using relevantsnippets collected from a log of past queries. SnipSuggest's current capabilities includesuggesting tables; views; and table-valued functions in the FROM clause; columns in theSELECT clause; predicates in the WHERE clause; columns in the GROUP BY clause;aggregates; and some support for sub-queries.

A FRAMEWORK FOR ACTIVE OBJECTS IN. NET.,Dan Mircea Suciu; Alina Cut,Abstract Nowadays; the concern of computer science is to find new methodologies that helpdecomposing large programs and run them efficiently onto new parallel machines. Thus; thepopularity of concurrent object-oriented programming has increased proportionally with themarket requirements of concurrent and distributed systems that meet simplicity; modularityand code reusability. The purpose of this paper is to define a class library based on ActiveObject pattern introduced in [3]; which has a high level of extensibility. Class library's mainobjective is to help in building concurrent object-oriented applications with a minimum effortand using a significant amount of already existing code. This approach addresses theproblem of integrating concurrency with object-oriented programming and respects theprinciples imposed by them.

Computing Query Probability with Incidence Algebras Technical Report UW-CSE-10-03-02 University of Washington,Nilesh Dalvi; Karl Schnaitter; Dan Suciu,Abstract We describe an algorithm that evaluates queries over probabilistic databases usingMobius' inversion formula in incidence algebras. The queries we consider are unions ofconjunctive queries (equivalently: existential; positive First Order sentences); and theprobabilistic databases are tuple-independent structures. Our algorithm runs in PTIME on asubset of queries called” safe” queries; and is complete; in the sense that every unsafequery is hard for the class FP# P. The algorithm is very simple and easy to implement inpractice; yet it is non-obvious. Mobius' inversion formula; which is in essence inclusion-exclusion; plays a key role for completeness; by allowing the algorithm to compute theprobability of some safe queries even when they have some subqueries that are unsafe. Wealso apply the same lattice-theoretic techniques to analyze an algorithm based on lifted …,*,2010,*

Lifted inference seen from the other side,Abhay Jha; Vibhav Gogate; Alexandra Meliou; Dan Suciu,Abstract Lifted Inference algorithms for representations that combine first-order logic andgraphical models have been the focus of much recent research. All lifted algorithmsdeveloped to date are based on the same underlying idea: take a standard probabilisticinference algorithm (eg; variable elimination; belief propagation etc.) and improve itsefficiency by exploiting repeated structure in the first-order model. In this paper; we proposean approach from the other side in that we use techniques from logic for probabilisticinference. In particular; we define a set of rules that look only at the logical representation toidentify models for which exact efficient inference is possible. Our rules yield new tractableclasses that could not be solved efficiently by any of the existing techniques.,24th Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems 2010; NIPS 2010,2010,*

Semi-Structured Query Languages,Dan Suciu,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}. A query Q is called domain independent if the value of Qwhen applied to any database is the same for any two domains containing the databasevalues or; equivalently; if the value of Q when applied to a database contains only values …,*,2009,*

Using Probabilistic Views for Large-Scale Statistical Inference.,Dan Suciu,Probabilistic databases extend statistical inference from limited; hand-crafted statisticalmodels to an entire database. Data analysts can discover trends; test hypothesis; and runwhat-if scenarios by simply running SQL queries. The technical challenge in a probabilisticdatabase is the query processor; which needs to perform a probabilistic inference for everyrow output by a SQL query: the general-purpose probabilistic inference algorithms used inthis step do not scale beyond small or medium-sized databases. Overcoming this limitationwill require major advances in the optimization of probabilistic inference in databases. In thistalk; I will describe one line of research in this direction; which relies on a combination ofprobabilistic views and safe queries. Like a traditional view; a probabilistic view is defined bya SQL query; and like a probabilistic database; its rows are random variables; their …,SBBD,2009,*

Materialized Views in Probabilistic Databases,Christopher Ré; Dan Suciu,ABSTRACT Views over probabilistic data contain correlations between tuples; and thecurrent approach is to capture these correlations using explicit lineage. In this paper wepropose an alternative approach to materializing probabilistic views; by giving conditionsunder which a view can be represented by a block-independent disjoint (BID) table. Not allviews can be represented as BID tables and so we propose a novel partial representationthat can represent all views but may not define a unique probability distribution. We thengive conditions on when a query's value on a partial representation will be uniquely defined.We apply our theory to two applications: query processing using views and informationexchange using views. In query processing on probabilistic data; we can ignore the lineageand use materialized views to more efficiently answer queries. By contrast; if the view has …,*,2007,*
The Boundary Between Privacy and Utility in Data Anonymization,Vibhor Rastogi; Dan Suciu; Sungho Hong,Abstract: We consider the privacy problem in data publishing: given a relation I containingsensitive information'anonymize'it to obtain a view V such that; on one hand attackers cannotlearn any sensitive information from V; and on the other hand legitimate users can use V tocompute useful statistics on I. These are conflicting goals. We use a definition of privacy thatis derived from existing ones in the literature; which relates the a priori probability of a giventuple t; Pr (t); with the a posteriori probability; Pr (t| V); and propose a novel and quitepractical definition for utility. Our main result is the following. Denoting n the size of I and mthe size of the domain from which I was drawn (ie n< m) then: when the a priori probability isPr (t)= Omega (n/sqrt (m)) for some t; there exists no useful anonymization algorithm; whilewhen Pr (t)= O (n/m) for all tuples t; then we give a concrete anonymization algorithm that …,arXiv preprint cs/0612103,2006,*

Data on the Web</title,Serge Abiteboul; Peter Buneman; Dan Suciu,Abstract. One of the virtues of XML is that it allows complex structures to be easilyexpressed. This allows XML to be used as an intermediate; neutral; and standard form forrepresenting many types of structured or semistructured documents that arise in a greatvariety of applications. To support for efficient queries against XML data; many querylanguages have been designed. The query languages require the users to know thestructure of the XML documents and specify path-based search conditions on the structure.This path-based query against XML documents is a natural consequence of the hierarchicalstructure of XML. However; it is also desirable to allow the users to formulate no path queriesagainst XML documents; to complement the current path-based queries. In this paper; wehave developed a query expression and processing technique supporting non …,Foundations of intelligent systems: 15th international symposium; ISMIS 2005; Saratoga Springs; NY; USA; May 25-28; 2005: proceedings,2005,*

Exploiting Structural Similarity For Effective Web Information Extraction,Elio Masciari; Sergio Flesca; Giuseppe Manco; Luigi Pontieri; Andrea Pugliese,Abstract In this paper we propose an architecture that exploit web pages stucturalinformation for the extraction of relevant information from them. In this architecture; a primaryrole played by a distance-based classification methodology is devised. Such a methodologyis based on an efficient and effective technique for detecting structural similarities amongsemistructured documents; which significantly differs from standard methods based ongraph-matching algorithms. The technique is based on the idea of representing the structureof a document as a time series in which each occurrence of a tag corresponds to a givenimpulse. By analyzing the frequencies of the corresponding Fourier transform; we can hencestate the degree of similarity between documents. Experiments on real data show theeffectiveness of the proposed technique.,Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings,2005,*

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING 1 The Piazza Peer Data Management System,Alon Y Halevy; Zachary G Ives; Jayant Madhavan; Peter Mork; Dan Suciu; Igor Tatarinov,Abstract Intuitively; data management and data integration tools should be well-suited forexchanging information in a semantically meaningful way. Unfortunately; they suffer fromtwo significant problems: they typically require a comprehensive schema design before theycan be used to store or share information; and they are difficult to extend because schemaevolution is heavyweight and may break backward compatibility. As a result; many small-scale data sharing tasks are more easily facilitated by nondatabase-oriented tools that havelittle support for semantics. The goal of the peer data management system (PDMS) is toaddress this need: we propose the use of a decentralized; easily extensible datamanagement architecture in which any user can contribute new data; schema information; oreven mappings between other peers' schemas.

Query Optimization for XML</Title,Jason McHugh; Jennifer Widom; Serge Abiteboul; Mary F Fernandez; Dan Suciu,Abstract. As XML is increasingly being used in Web applications; new technologies need tobe investigated for processing XML documents with high performance. Parallelism is apromising solution for structured document processing and data placement is a major factorfor system performance improvement in parallel processing. This paper describes aneffective XML document data placement strategy. The new strategy is based on a multilevelgraph partitioning algorithm with the consideration of the unique features of XML documentsand query distributions. A new algorithm; which is based on XML query schemas to derivethe weighted graph from the labelled directed graph presentation of XML documents; is alsoproposed. Performance analysis on the algorithm presented in the paper shows that the newdata placement strategy exhibits low workload skew and a high degree of parallelism.,Advances in Databases: 18th British National Conference on Databases; BNCOD 18 Chilton; UK; July 9-11; 2001.

Typechecking XML Views of Relational Databases',Noga Alon Tova Milo; Dan Suciu; Victor Vianu,Abstract Motivated by the need to export relational databases as XML data in the context ofthe Web; we investigate the typechecking problem for transformations of relational data intotree data (XML). The problem consists of statically verifying that the output of everytransformation belongs to a given output tree language (specified for XML by a DTD); forinput databases satisfying given integrity constraints. The typechecking problem isparameterized by the class of formulas defining the transformation; the class of output treelanguages; and the class of integrity constraints. While undecidable in its most generalformulation; the typechecking problem has many special cases of practical interest that turnout to be decidable. The main contribution of this paper is to trace a fairly tight boundary ofdecidability for typechecking in this framework.

In this paper; we address the problem of automating the conversion ofrelational data into XML. We describe SilkRoute; a general; dynamic; and efficient tool forviewing and querying relational data in XML. SilkRoute is general; because it can expressmappings of relational data into XML that conforms to arbitrary DTDs. We call thesemappings views.

Our ability to analyze; summarize and extract informationfrom these databases has lagged far behind our ability to collect and store data.

A Data Model and Algebra for XML Query,Dan Suciu; Philip Wadler,This note presents a possible data model and algebra for an XML query language. It shouldbe compared with the alternative proposal 3]. The algebra is derived from the nestedrelational algebra; which is a widely-used algebra for semistructured and object-orienteddatabases. For instance; similar techniques are used in the implementation of OQL 2]. We dier from other presentations of nested relational algebra in that we make heavy use of listcomprehensions; a standard notation in the functional programming community 1]. We ndlist comprehensions slighly easier to manipulate than the more traditional algebraicoperators; but it is not hard to translate comprehensions into these operators (or vice versa).One important aspect of XML is not covered by traditional nested relational algebras;namely; the structure imposed by a DTD or Schema.(So far as we can see; the proposal 3 …,*,1999,*
Verifying Integrity Constraints on Web Sites,Daniela Florescu; Alon Levy; Dan Suciu,Abstract Data-intensive Web sites have created a new form of knowledge base; as richlystructured bodies of data. Several novel systems for creating dataintensive Web sitessupport declarative speci cation of a site's structure and content (ie; the pages; the dataavailable in each page; and the links between pages). Declarative systems provide aplatform on which AI techniques can be developed that further simplify the tasks ofconstructing and maintaining Web sites. This paper addresses the problem of specifying andverifying integrity constraints on a Web site's structure. We describe a language that cancapture many practical constraints and an accompanying sound and complete veri cationalgorithm. The algorithm has the important property that if the constraints are violated; itproposes xes to either the constraints or to the site de nition. Finally; we establish tight …,In IJCAI,1999,*

One of the areas that has emerged from these discussions as acandidate for impact of the database community is that of of Web site construction andmanagement. In parallel; several research projects have been started with the goal ofaddressing this problem (eg; Strudel (AT&T Research); Araneus (University of Rome); YAT(INRIA; France) and WebOQL (University of Toronto)). The common theme of these projectsis the declarative management of the content and structure of web sites.

Warehousing and Incremental Evaluation for Web Site Management,Daniela Florescu; Alon Levy; Dan Suciu,Abstract Recently; several systems have been proposed for building Web sites fromdeclarative speci cations. The salient feature of these systems is that they model both thestructure and the content of a Web site as a view over some existing raw data. In this\Website as view" paradigm; a critical issue is when to compute the site. One approach is tomaterialize the site completely before the users browse it: the disadvantages of thisapproach are high maintenance costs and stale data. Moreover; this approach is notapplicable if the Web site has forms; because then the queries de ning the Web sitedepends on user input. The other extreme approach is to precompute only the root (s) of theWeb site; and then compute dynamically (at\click time") the queries that retrieves theinformation required to display the next page.

CoPa: a Parallel Programming Language for Collections,Dan Suciu; Val Tanneny,Abstract In this paper we propose a new framework for parallel processing of collections. Wede ne a high-level language called CoPa for processing nested sets; bags; and sequences(a generalization of arrays and lists). CoPa includes most features found in query languagesfor object-oriented or object-relational databases; and has; in addition; a powerful form ofrecursion not found in query languages. CoPa has a formal declarative de nition of parallelcomplexity; as part of its speci cation. We prove the existence of a complexity-preservingcompilation for CoPa; ie one which o ers upper-bound guarantees for the parallel complexityof the compiled code. The majority of the compilation process is architecture-independent;using a parallel vector machine model (BVRAM). The BVRAM instructions form a sequence-algebra which is of independent interest; and have been carefully chosen to reconcile two …,University of Pennsylvania; Institute for,1998,*
Specifying Representations...,Norman Ramsey; Mary Fernandez,The World-Wide Web (WWW) has become a prime vehicle for disseminating information. Asa result; the number of large Web sites with complex structure and that serve informationderived from multiple data sources is increasing. Managing the content and the structure ofsuch Web sites presents a novel data management problem; which has not been previouslyconsidered by the database community. To understand the problem; consider a Web-sitebuilder's tasks:(1) choosing and accessing the data that will be displayed at the site;(2)designing the site's structure; ie; specifying the data contained within each page and thelinks between pages; and (3) designing the visual presentation of pages. In existing Web-site management tools; these tasks are; for the most part; interdependent.

A Shared-Memory Multiprocessor Implementation of Data-Parallel Operators for ML,Dan Suciu; Lorenz Huelsbergen,Abstract We have designed and implemented an asynchronous data-parallel scheduler forthe SML/NJ ML compiler. Using this general scheduler we built a data-parallel module thatprovides new operators to manipulate sequences (ie; arrays; vectors) in parallel.Parallelization concerns such as thread creation and synchronization are hidden from theapplication programmer by ML's module abstraction. We find that languages with modules;higher-order functions and automatic parallel storage management can; in this manner;seamlessly support data-parallel operators. An implementation of applications using thenew sequence module on an eight-processor shared-memory machine indicates that insome cases useful speedup is possible with our approach.,*,1994,*

Even though this approach allows us to mix operations over multiple collectiontypes in a safe way. it does not support userdefined collection types. ln this paper wefollowed a novel approach: we created two new type constructors that capture thecommutativity and idempotence properties of many user-deﬁned collection types.

This paper presents abidirectional interpretation of XQuery to address the problem of updating XML data throughmaterialized XQuery views. We first design an expressive bidirectional transformationlanguage; and then translate XQuery into this language. The programs of this bidirectionallanguage can be executed in two directions: in the forward direction; they generatematerialized views from XML source data; while in the backward direction; they update thesource data by reflecting back the updates on views. Hence; with such an interpretation;XQuery can not only query; but also update XML source data through views by beingexecuted forward or backward. We prove that this language satisfy two well-behavedcriteria; the stability property and the extended round-tripping property. The stability …,ACM TODS,1982,*

page 1,P Buneman; SB Davidson; D Suciu,We investigate languages for querying and transforming unstructured data by which wemean languages than can be used without knowledge of the structure (schema) of thedatabase. There are two reasons for wanting to do this. First; some data models haveemerged in which the schema is either completely absent or only provides weak constraintson the data. Second; it is sometimes convenient; for the purposes of browsing; to query thedatabase without reference to the schema. For example one may want to grep" all characterstrings in the database; or one might want to find the information associated with a certainfield name no matter where it occurs in the database.The idea of using labeled trees for thispurpose has been suggested by two data models.

Efficient Evaluation of HAVING Queries on a Probabilistic Database University of Washington TR:# 2007-06-01,Christopher Ré; Dan Suciu,Abstract. We study the evaluation of positive conjunctive queries with Boolean aggregatetests (similar to HAVING queries in SQL) on probabilistic databases. Our motivation is tohandle aggregate queries over imprecise data resulting from information integration orinformation extraction. More precisely; we study conjunctive queries with predicateaggregates using MIN; MAX; COUNT; SUM; AVG or COUNT (DISTINCT) on probabilisticdatabases. Computing the precise output probabilities for positive conjunctive queries(without HAVING) is♯ P-hard; but is in P for a restricted class of queries called safe queries.Further; for queries without self-joins either a query is safe or its data complexity is♯ P-Hard;which shows that safe queries exactly capture tractable queries without self-joins. In thispaper; for each aggregate above; we find a class of queries that exactly capture efficient …,*,*,*

Computer Science Colloquium Querying Probabilistic Data,Dan Suciu,Abstract: A major challenge in data management to date is how to manage uncertainty in thedata; uncertainty may exist because the data was extracted automatically from text; or wasderived from the physical world such as RFID data; or was obtained by integrating severaldata sets using fuzzy matches; or may be the result of complex stochastic models. This hasmotivated research on probabilistic databases; where uncertainty is modeled usingprobabilities; and whose goal is to deliver predictable performance for queries on largeprobabilistic databases. Probabilistic inference is known to be intractable in general; butonce we fix a query and considers only the database as variable input; it becomes aspecialized problem; which requires a specialized analysis. I will show that Unions ofConjunctive Queries (also known as non-recursive datalog rules) admit a dichotomy …,*,*,*

When theywrote their revolutionary 2004 VLDB paper “Efficient Query Evaluation on ProbabilisticDatabases”; I'm not sure whether or not Nilesh Dalvi and Dan Suciu realized how deeplyconnected their ideas were with the probabilistic structures that underlie much of modernML; but those connections are becoming clear today. Fittingly; this issue opens with anarticle written by Eric Gribkoff; Dan Suciu; and Guy Van den Broeck that explains andexplores some of these connections. They consider how the idea of lifted inference onprobabilistic graphical models is nothing more than the evaluation of an SQL aggregatequery in a probabilistic database; and how inference for ML can be performed using a …,*,*,*
Probabilistic Data Integration Systems,Dan Suciu,Current data integration techniques are successful at managing well-defined andwellunderstood data integration tasks; but do not cope well with uncertainty. However; theamount of uncertain data is growing with the number and variety of data sources beingintegrated; both in traditional data integration tasks sa enterprise data integration; and innext generation integration problems; sa combining structured data with informationextracted automatically from text. We argue that uncertainty in data integration is best copedwith by using a probabilistic data model; and propose here probabilistic data integrationsystems; PDIS. Our justification comes from the fact that probabilities can be used to model arich variety of imprecisions arising in information integration. For example:,*,*,*

The XML TÝpechecking Problem,Dan Suciu,When an XML document conforms to a given type (eg a DTD or an XML Schema type) it iscalled a valid document. Checking if a given XML document is valid is called the validationproblem; and is typically performed by a parser (hence; validating parser); more precisely itis performed right after parsing; by the same program module. In practice however XMLdocuments are often generated dynamically; by some program: checking whether all XMLdocuments generated by the program are valid wrt a given type is called the typecheckingproblem. While a validation analyzes an XML document; a type checker analyzes aprogram; and the problem's diÆculty is a function of the language in which that program isexpressed.

A key technical challenge during the construction; refinement; andquerying of knowledge bases is probabilistic reasoning. Because of the size of the datainvolved; probabilistic reasoning in knowledge bases becomes a central data managementproblem.

GenDGen: A Generic Framework for Synthetic Data Generation,Ashish Kumar Gupta; Dan Suciu,Abstract Hundreds of database papers are published in various journals; conferences andworkshops every year. Most of these papers undertake a performance evaluation thatrequires synthetic data generation. Synthetic data is also required for studying propertiessuch as scalability; memory consumption; etc. of applications/programs in a controlledenvironment. Testing and debugging of almost all software products also requires syntheticdata. Typically; in all the above cases; everyone writes their own data generator. In thispaper; we propose a framework for generating synthetic data; which will significantly reducethe effort that goes into reinventing the wheel each time such a data set is needed. Wepropose a language using which a user can express constraints that need to be satisfied bythe data. Further; we present an algorithm that produces data sets satisfying these …,*,*,*

Technical Report UW-CSE-11-03-01,Paraschos Koutris; Dan Suciu,Abstract The availability of large data centers with tens of thousands of servers has led to thepopular adoption of massive parallelism for data analysis on large datasets. Several querylanguages exist for running queries on massively parallel architectures; some based on theMapReduce infrastructure; others using proprietary implementations. Motivated by this trend;this paper analyzes the parallel complexity of conjunctive queries. We propose a very simplemodel of parallel computation that captures these architectures; in which the complexityparameter is the number of parallel steps requiring synchronization of all servers. We studythe complexity of conjunctive queries and give a complete characterization of the querieswhich can be computed in one parallel step. These form a strict subset of hierarchicalqueries; and include flat queries like R (x; y); S (x; z); T (x; v); U (x; w); tall queries like R (x …,*,*,*
Declarative Specification of Data-intensive Web sites,Dan Suciu; Igor Tatarinov,Abstract Integrated information systems are often realized as data-intensive Web sites;which integrate data from multiple data sources. We present a system; called Strudel; forspecifying and generating data-intensive Web sites. Strudelseparates the tasks of accessingand integrating a site's data sources; building its structure; and generating its HTMLrepresentation. Strudel's declarative query language; called StruQL; supports the rst twotasks. Unlike ad-hoc database queries; a StruQL query is a software artifact that must beextensible and reusable. To support more modular and reusable site-de nition queries; weextend StruQL with functions and describe how the new language; FunStruQL; bettersupports common site-engineering tasks; such as choosing a strategy for generating thesite's pages dynamically and/or statically. To substantiate Strudel's bene ts; we describe …,*,*,*

XML: Model; Schemas; Types; Logics and Queries DRAFT,Nils Klarlund; Thomas Schwentick; Dan Suciu,It is intriguing that something as bland as a syntax for trees has become one of the leadingbuzzwords of the Internet era. XML (eXtended Markup Language) is the name of thisnotation; which evolved from document processing needs. This mystery is deepened by theapparent antiquity of the central idea—that linear syntax can represent trees. S-expressions;invented 40 years ago; are at least as general; but never became the universally acceptedfoundation for data interchange and programming; despite their enormous influence inprogramming language theory and artificial intelligence research. Additionally; trees havebeen studied intensively in computer science ever since; so we might suspect that thereason for the excitement is simply that practitioners are catching up with methods ofabstraction and representation via trees that are well known in academia.

Database Programming Languages (DBPL-5),Marc Gyssens; Dan Suciu; Dirk Van Gucht,Abstract The nested model is an extension of the traditional;\flat" relational model in whichrelations can also have relation-valued entries. Its\default" query language; the nestedalgebra; is rather weak; unfortunately; since it is only a conservative extension of thetraditional;\flat" relational algebra; and thus can only express a small fraction of thepolynomial-time queries. Therefore; it was proposed to extend the nested algebra with aleast-fixpoint construct; but the resulting language turned out to be too powerful: manyinherently exponential queries could also be expressed. Two polynomial-time restrictions ofthe leastfixpoint closure of the nested algebra were proposed: the restricted least-xpointclosure (by Gyssens and Van Gucht) and the bounded xpoint closure (by Suciu). Here; weprove that both restrictions are equivalent in expressive power. We also exhibit a proof …,*,*,*
Materialized Views in Probabilistic Databases For Information Exchange and Query Optimization (Full Version) University of Washington Technical Report# TR2007-...,Christopher Ré; Dan Suciu,Abstract Views over probabilistic data contain correlations between tuples; and the currentapproach is to capture these correlations using explicit lineage. In this paper we propose analternative approach to materializing probabilistic views; by giving conditions under which aview can be represented by a block-independent disjoint (BID) table. Not all views can berepresented as BID tables and so we propose a novel partial representation that canrepresent all views but may not define a unique probability distribution. We then giveconditions on when a query's value on a partial representation will be uniquely defined. Weapply our theory to two applications: query processing using views and informationexchange using views. In query processing on probabilistic data; we can ignore the lineageand use materialized views to more efficiently answer queries. By contrast; if the view has …,*,*,*

Probabilistic Query Answering Using Views,Nilesh Dalvi; Dan Suciu,Abstract The paper studies two probabilistic query evaluation problems. The general settingis that we are given a probability distribution on all possible database instances and have tocompute the probability of a tuple belonging to the query's answer. In the deterministic viewproblem; we are given a set of view instances and are asked to determine the probability ofa tuple belonging to a query's answer in presence of data statistics and common worldknowledge. This is related to the open world assumption in query answering using views.We show that the data complexity is NP-complete and identify important cases when itbecomes PTIME; and when the query can be answered by a datalog program. In the secondproblem we consider; the views themselves are probabilistic: with uncertainties associatedwith the tuples in the views. It is unclear a priori what probability distribution on instances …,*,*,*

Overview of Strudel-A Web-Site Management System,Mary Fernandez—Daniela Florescu—Jaewoo Kang; Alon Levy; Dan Suciu,ABSTRACT. The Strudel system applies concepts from database management systems tothe process of building Web sites. Strudel's key idea is separating the management of thesite's data; the creation and management of the site's structure; and the visual presentationof the site's pages. First; the site builder creates a uniform model of all data available at thesite. Second; the builder uses this model to declaratively define the Web site's structure byapplying a “sitedefinition query” to the underlying data. Third; the builder specifies the visualpresentation of pages in Strudel's HTML-template language. The data model underlyingStrudel is a semistructured model of labeled directed graphs.,*,*,*

Distributed Evaluation of Network Directory Queries,Sihem Amer-Yahia Divesh Srivastava; Dan Suciu,Abstract This paper describes novel efficient techniques for the distributed evaluation ofhierarchical aggregate selection queries over LDAP directory data; distributed acrossmultiple autonomous directory servers. Such queries are useful for emerging applicationslike the Directory Enabled Networks initiative. Our techniques follow the LDAP approach ofdistributed query evaluation by referrals; where each relevant server computes answerslocally; and the LDAP client coordinates between directory servers. We make a conceptualseparation between the identification of relevant servers and the distributed computation ofanswers. We focus on the challenging task of generating an efficient plan for evaluatinghierarchical aggregate selection queries; which involves correlating directory entries acrossmultiple servers. The key features of our plan are:(i) the network traffic consists of query …,*,*,*

Database Programming Languages (DBPL-5),Peter Buneman; Susan Davidson; Dan Suciu,Abstract We investigate languages for querying and transforming unstructured data by whichwe mean languages than can be used without knowledge of the structure (schema) of thedatabase. There are two reasons for wanting to do this. First; some data models haveemerged in which the schema is either completely absent or only provides weak constraintson the data. Second; it is sometimes convenient; for the purposes of browsing; to query thedatabase without reference to the schema. For example one may want to\grep" all characterstrings in the database; or one might want to find the information associated with a certainfield name no matter where it occurs in the database. This paper introduces a labelled treemodel of data and investigates various programming structures for querying andtransforming such data. In particular; it considers various restrictions of structural …,*,*,*
Database Theory Column1,Dan Suciu,1 Introduction Research on semistructured data started from the observation that much oftoday's electronic data does not conform to traditional relational; or object oriented datamodels. Several applications store their data in non-standard data formats; legacy systems;structured documents; like HTML or SGML etc. Another instance is the integration ofheterogeneous data sources: often these sources belong to external organizations; orpartners; not under the application's control; and their structure is only partially known; andmay change without notice. Data in these applications could be modeled as an object-oriented data; but it's structure is irregular: some objects may have missing attributes; othersmay have multiple occurrences of the same attribute; the same attribute may have differenttypes in different objects; semantically related information may be represented differently …,*,*,*
UW TR:# TR2008-03-02,Christopher Ré; Dan Suciu,Abstract In probabilistic databases; lineage is fundamental to both query processing andunderstanding the data. Current systems sa Trio or Mystiq use a complete approach inwhich the lineage for a tuple t is a Boolean formula which represents all derivations of t. Inlarge databases lineage formulas can become huge: in one public database (the GeneOntology) we often observed 10MB of lineage (provenance) data for a single tuple. In thispaper we propose to use approximate lineage; which is a much smaller formula keepingtrack of only the most important derivations; which the system can use to process queriesand provide explanations. We discuss in detail two specific kinds of approximate lineage:(1)a conservative approximation called sufficient lineage that records the most importantderivations for each tuple; and (2) polynomial lineage; which is more aggressive and can …,*,*,*

General Database Statistics Using Entropy Maximization TR: 2009-05-01,Raghav Kaushik; Christopher Ré; Dan Suciu,Abstract We propose a framework in which query sizes can be estimated from arbitrarystatistical assertions on the data. In its most general form; a statistical assertion states thatthe size of the output of a conjunctive query over the data is a given number. A very simpleexample is a histogram; which makes assertions about the sizes of the output of severalrange queries. Our model also allows much more complex assertions that include joins andprojections. To model such complex statistical assertions we propose to use the Entropy-Maximization (EM) probability distribution. In this model any set of statistics that is consistenthas a precise semantics; and every query has an precise size estimate. We show thatseveral classes of statistics can be solved in closed form.,*,*,*
