G-store: a scalable data store for transactional multi key access in the cloud,Sudipto Das; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Cloud computing has emerged as a preferred platform for deploying scalable web-applications. With the growing scale of these applications and the data associated withthem; scalable data management systems form a crucial part of the cloud infrastructure. Key-Value stores--such as Bigtable; PNUTS; Dynamo; and their open source analogues--havebeen the preferred data stores for applications in the cloud. In these systems; data isrepresented as Key-Value pairs; and atomic access is provided only at the granularity ofsingle keys. While these properties work well for current applications; they are insufficient forthe next generation web applications--such as online gaming; social networks; collaborativeediting; and many more--which emphasize collaboration. Since collaboration by definitionrequires consistent access to groups of keys; scalable and consistent multi key access is …,Proceedings of the 1st ACM symposium on Cloud computing,2010,263
Zephyr: live migration in shared nothing databases for elastic cloud platforms,Aaron J Elmore; Sudipto Das; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Multitenant data infrastructures for large cloud platforms hosting hundreds ofthousands of applications face the challenge of serving applications characterized by smalldata footprint and unpredictable load patterns. When such a platform is built on an elasticpay-per-use infrastructure; an added challenge is to minimize the system's operating costwhile guaranteeing the tenants' service level agreements (SLA). Elastic load balancing istherefore an important feature to enable scale-up during high load while scaling down whenthe load is low. Live migration; a technique to migrate tenants with minimal serviceinterruption and no downtime; is critical to allow lightweight elastic scaling. We focus on theproblem of live migration in the database layer. We propose Zephyr; a technique toefficiently migrate a live database in a shared nothing transactional database architecture …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,222
ElasTraS: An Elastic Transactional Data Store in the Cloud.,Sudipto Das; Amr El Abbadi; Divyakant Agrawal,Abstract Over the last couple of years;“Cloud Computing” or “Elastic Computing” hasemerged as a compelling and successful paradigm for internet scale computing. One of themajor contributing factors to this success is the elasticity of resources. In spite of the elasticityprovided by the infrastructure and the scalable design of the applications; the elephant (orthe underlying database); which drives most of these web-based applications; is not veryelastic and scalable; and hence limits scalability. In this paper; we propose ElasTraS whichaddresses this issue of scalability and elasticity of the data store in a cloud computingenvironment to leverage from the elastic nature of the underlying infrastructure; whileproviding scalable transactional data access. This paper aims at providing the design of asystem in progress; highlighting the major design choices; analyzing the different …,HotCloud,2009,222
Ricardo: integrating R and Hadoop,Sudipto Das; Yannis Sismanis; Kevin S Beyer; Rainer Gemulla; Peter J Haas; John McPherson,Abstract Many modern enterprises are collecting data at the most detailed level possible;creating data repositories ranging from terabytes to petabytes in size. The ability to applysophisticated statistical analysis methods to this data is becoming essential for marketplacecompetitiveness. This need to perform deep analysis over huge data repositories poses asignificant challenge to existing statistical software and data management systems. On theone hand; statistical software provides rich functionality for data analysis and modeling; butcan handle only limited amounts of data; eg; popular packages like R and SPSS operateentirely in main memory. On the other hand; data management systems-such asMapReduce-based systems-can scale to petabytes of data; but provide insufficient analyticalfunctionality.

Data management challenges in cloud computing infrastructures,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Shyam Antony; Sudipto Das,Abstract The challenge of building consistent; available; and scalable data managementsystems capable of serving petabytes of data for millions of users has confronted the datamanagement research community as well as large internet enterprises. Current proposedsolutions to scalable data management; driven primarily by prevalent applicationrequirements; limit consistent access to only the granularity of single objects; rows; or keys;thereby trading off consistency for high scalability and availability. But the growing popularityof “cloud computing”; the resulting shift of a large number of internet applications to thecloud; and the quest towards providing data management services in the cloud; has openedup the challenge for designing data management systems that provide consistencyguarantees at a granularity larger than single rows and keys.

Quorum—quality of service in wireless mesh networks,Vinod Kone; Sudipto Das; Ben Y Zhao; Haitao Zheng,Abstract Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) can provide seamless broadband connectivity tonetwork users with low setup and maintenance costs. To support next-generationapplications with real-time requirements; however; these networks must provide improvedquality of service guarantees. Current mesh protocols use techniques that fail to accuratelypredict the performance of end-to-end paths; and do not optimize performance based onknowledge of mesh network structures. In this paper; we propose QUORUM; a routingprotocol optimized for WMNs that provides accurate QoS properties by correctly predictingdelay and loss characteristics of data traffic. QUORUM integrates a novel end-to-end packetdelay estimation mechanism with stability-aware routing policies; allowing it to moreaccurately follow QoS requirements while minimizing misbehavior of selfish nodes.,Mobile Networks and Applications,2007,56

SQLVM: Performance Isolation in Multi-Tenant Relational Database-as-a-Service,Vivek Narasayya; Sudipto Das; Manoj Syamala; Badrish Chandramouli; Surajit Chaudhuri,Abstract A relational Database-as-a-Service provider; such as Microsoft SQL Azure; canshare resources of a single database server among multiple tenants. This multi-tenancyenables cost reduction for the cloud service provider which it can pass on as savings to thetenants. However; resource sharing can adversely affect a tenant's performance due toresource demands of other tenants' workloads. Service providers today do not provide anyassurances to a tenant in terms of isolating its performance from other co-located tenants.We present SQLVM; an abstraction for performance isolation which is built on a promise ofreservation of key database server resources; such as CPU; I/O and memory; for eachtenant. The key challenge is in supporting this abstraction within a DBMS without staticallyallocating resources to tenants; while ensuring low overheads and scaling to large …,Conference on Innovative Data systems Research (CIDR),2013,47
Characterizing tenant behavior for placement and crisis mitigation in multitenant DBMSs,Aaron J Elmore; Sudipto Das; Alexander Pucher; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Xifeng Yan,Abstract A multitenant database management system (DBMS) in the cloud mustcontinuously monitor the trade-off between efficient resource sharing among multipleapplication databases (tenants) and their performance. Considering the scale of\attn{hundreds to} thousands of tenants in such multitenant DBMSs; manual approaches forcontinuous monitoring are not tenable. A self-managing controller of a multitenant DBMSfaces several challenges.

Thread cooperation in multicore architectures for frequency counting over multiple data streams,Sudipto Das; Shyam Antony; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Many real-world data stream analysis applications such as network monitoring;click stream analysis; and others require combining multiple streams of data arriving frommultiple sources. This is referred to as multi-stream analysis. To deal with high stream arrivalrates; it is desirable that such systems be capable of supporting very high processingthroughput. The advent of multicore processors and powerful servers driven by theseprocessors calls for efficient parallel designs that can effectively utilize the parallelism of themulticores; since performance improvement is possible only through effective parallelism. Inthis paper; we address the problem of parallelizing multi-stream analysis in the context ofmulticore processors. Specifically; we concentrate on parallelizing frequent elements; top-k;and frequency counting over multiple streams.

Generalizing PIR for practical private retrieval of public data,Shiyuan Wang; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Private retrieval of public data is useful when a client wants to query a public dataservice without revealing the query to the server. Computational Private InformationRetrieval (c PIR) achieves complete privacy for clients; but is deemed impractical since itinvolves expensive computation on all the data on the server. Besides; it is inflexible if theserver wants to charge the client based on the service data that is exposed. k-Anonymity; onthe other hand; is flexible and cheap for anonymizing the querying process; but is vulnerableto privacy and security threats. We propose a practical and flexible approach for the privateretrieval of public data called Bounding-Box PIR (bb PIR). Using bb PIR; a client specifiesboth privacy requirements and a service charge budget. The server satisfies the client'srequirements; and achieves overall good performance in computation and …,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2010,34
CPU sharing techniques for performance isolation in multi-tenant relational database-as-a-service,Sudipto Das; Vivek R Narasayya; Feng Li; Manoj Syamala,Abstract Multi-tenancy and resource sharing are essential to make a Database-as-a-Service(DaaS) cost-effective. However; one major consequence of resource sharing is that theperformance of one tenant's workload can be significantly affected by the resource demandsof co-located tenants. The lack of performance isolation in a shared environment can makeDaaS less attractive to performance-sensitive tenants. Our approach to performanceisolation in a DaaS is to isolate the key resources needed by the tenants' workload. In thispaper; we focus on the problem of effectively sharing and isolating CPU among co-locatedtenants in a multi-tenant DaaS. We show that traditional CPU sharing abstractions andalgorithms are inadequate to support several key new requirements that arise in DaaS:(a)absolute and fine-grained CPU reservations without static allocation;(b) support elasticity …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,25

Optimizing optimistic concurrency control for tree-structured; log-structured databases,Philip A Bernstein; Sudipto Das; Bailu Ding; Markus Pilman,Abstract Scaling-out a database system typically requires partitioning the database acrossmultiple servers. If applications do not partition perfectly; then transactions accessingmultiple partitions end up being distributed; which has well-known scalability challenges. Toaddress them; we describe a high-performance transaction mechanism that uses optimisticconcurrency control on a multi-versioned tree-structured database stored in a shared log.The system scales out by adding servers; without partitioning the database. Our solution ismodeled on the Hyder architecture; published by Bernstein; Reid; and Das at CIDR 2011.We present the design and evaluation of the first full implementation of that architecture. Thecore of the system is a log roll-forward algorithm; called meld; that does optimisticconcurrency control.

Scalable and Elastic Transactional Data Stores for Cloud Computing Platforms,Sudipto Das,Abstract Cloud computing has emerged as a multi-billion dollar industry and as a successfulparadigm for web application deployment. Economies-of-scale; elasticity; and pay-per-usepricing are the biggest promises of cloud. Database management systems (DBMSs) servingthese web applications form a critical component of the cloud software stack. In order toserve thousands of applications and their huge amounts of data; these DBMSs must scale-out to clusters of commodity servers. Moreover; to minimize their operating costs; suchDBMSs must also be elastic; ie; possess the ability to increase and decrease the cluster sizein a live system. This is in addition to serving a variety of applications (ie; supportingmultitenancy) while being self-managing; fault-tolerant; and highly available.,*,2011,18
Modified TCP congestion control algorithm for throughput enhancement in wired-cum-wireless networks,Rajesh Roy; Sudipto Das; A Ghosh; Amitava Mukherjee,Abstract-The key idea proposed in this paper is to determine the Optimal CongestionWindow for a TCP Sender in a particular network scenario (that corresponds to the fair shareof that connection) and keep this congestion window a constant to a point where the fairshare in the network has changed considerably from the instance of the calculation of thesize of the last window. At this point; the TCP Congestion Window is recalculated accordingto the nature of new scenario. The proposed mechanism is particularly effective overwireless links; which have an inherently loss-prone nature; as Modified TCP's congestionwindow being independent of packet losses (be it corruption losses or it congestion losses);keeps transmitting at the same rate as before.,Proceeding of SNCNW,2006,12
Accelerating relational databases by leveraging remote memory and rdma,Feng Li; Sudipto Das; Manoj Syamala; Vivek R Narasayya,Abstract Memory is a crucial resource in relational databases (RDBMSs). When there isinsufficient memory; RDBMSs are forced to use slower media such as SSDs or HDDs; whichcan significantly degrade workload performance. Cloud database services are deployed indata centers where network adapters supporting remote direct memory access (RDMA) atlow latency and high bandwidth are becoming prevalent. We study the novel problem of howa Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) RDBMS; whose memory demands exceed locally-available memory; can leverage available remote memory in the cluster accessed via RDMAto improve query performance. We expose available memory on remote servers using alightweight file API that allows an SMP RDBMS to leverage the benefits of remote memorywith modest changes.

Automated demand-driven resource scaling in relational database-as-a-service,Sudipto Das; Feng Li; Vivek R Narasayya; Arnd Christian König,Abstract Relational Database-as-a-Service (DaaS) platforms today support the abstraction ofa resource container that guarantees a fixed amount of resources. Tenants are responsiblefor selecting a container size suitable for their workloads; which they can change to leveragethe cloud's elasticity. However; automating this task is daunting for most tenants sinceestimating resource demands for arbitrary SQL workloads in an RDBMS is complex andchallenging. In addition; workloads and resource requirements can vary significantly withinminutes to hours; and container sizes vary by orders of magnitude both in the amount ofresources as well as monetary cost. We present a solution to enable a DaaS to auto-scalecontainer sizes on behalf of its tenants. Approaches to auto-scale stateless services; such asweb servers; that rely on historical resource utilization as the primary signal; often perform …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,5
Scaling Optimistic Concurrency Control by Approximately Partitioning the Certifier and Log.,Philip A Bernstein; Sudipto Das,Abstract In optimistic concurrency control; a certifier algorithm processes a log of transactionoperations to determine whether each transaction satisfies a given isolation level andtherefore should commit or abort. This logging and certification of transactions is oftensequential and can become a bottleneck. To improve transaction throughput; it is beneficialto parallelize or scale out the certifier and the log. One common technique for suchparallelization is to partition the database. If the database is perfectly partitioned such thattransactions only access data from a single partition; then both the log and the certifier canbe parallelized such that each partition has its own independent log and certifier. However;for many applications; partitioning is only approximate; ie; a transaction can access multiplepartitions. Parallelization using such approximate partitioning requires synchronization …,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2015,5
A demonstration of sqlvm: Performance isolation in multi-tenant relational database-as-a-service,Vivek Narasayya; Sudipto Das; Manoj Syamala; Surajit Chaudhuri; Feng Li; Hyunjung Park,Abstract Sharing resources of a single database server among multiple tenants is commonin multi-tenant Database-as-a-Service providers; such as Microsoft SQL Azure. Multi-tenancy enables cost reduction for the cloud service provider which it can pass on assavings to the tenants. However; resource sharing can adversely affect a tenant'sperformance due to other tenants' workloads contending for shared resources. Serviceproviders today do not provide any assurances to a tenant in terms of isolating itsperformance from other co-located tenants. SQLVM; a project at Microsoft Research; is anabstraction for performance isolation which is built on a promise of reserving key databaseserver resources; such as CPU; I/O and memory; for each tenant. The key challenge is insupporting this abstraction within a RDBMS without statically allocating resources to …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,4
Optimizations To Multipath Routing Protocols In Mobile Ad hoc Networks,Sudipto Das; Rajesh Roy; Pradip K Das,Abstract–Mobile Ad hoc Networks are typically characterized by high mobility and frequentlink failures. As a result; routing algorithms selecting a single path during route creation haveto make frequent route discoveries resulting in decreased throughput and high endto-enddelay. Multipath routing approaches like AOMDV make use of pre-computed routesdetermined during route discovery. This solution; however; suffers during high mobilitybecause the alternate paths are not actively maintained. Hence; precisely when needed; theroutes are often broken. In this paper; the information gathered by a node about its neighbor;in addition to those proposed in [1]; is used to dynamically determine the node to which aparticular data packet has to be forwarded. Using this approach a better load balancing canbe obtained in addition to utilization of the additional routes; if feasible; and in the process …,Proceedings of International Conference on Emerging Applications ofiT (EAIT 2006),2006,4

Isolating resources and performance in a database management system,*,Techniques for tenant performance isolation in a multiple-tenant database managementsystem are described. These techniques may include providing a reservation of serverresources. The server resources reservation may include a reservation of a centralprocessing unit (CPU); a reservation of Input/Output throughput; and/or a reservation ofbuffer pool memory or working memory. The techniques may also include a meteringmechanism that determines whether the resource reservation is satisfied. The meteringmechanism may be independent of an actual resource allocation mechanism associatedwith the server resource reservation.,*,2016,2
InfoPuzzle: exploring group decision making in mobile peer-to-peer databases,Aaron J Elmore; Sudipto Das; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract As Internet-based services and mobile computing devices; such as smartphonesand tablets; become ubiquitous; society's reliance on them to accomplish critical and time-sensitive tasks; such as information dissemination and collaborative decision making; alsoincreases. Dependence on these media magnifies the damage caused by their disruption;whether malicious or natural. For instance; a natural disaster disrupting cellular and Internetinfrastructures impedes information spread; which in turn leads to chaos; both among thevictims as well as the aid providers. Decentralized and ad-hoc mechanisms for informationdissemination and decision making are paramount to help restore order.

From a virtualized computing nucleus to a cloud computing universe: a case for dynamic clouds,Divyakant Agrawal; Sudipto Das; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract The current model of the cloud consists of a static set of data centers (or cloudcores) which drive the computation and storage needs of large numbers of applications. Weenvision a new paradigm where the cloud will be comprised of a large dynamic collection ofcloud cores along with a static set of cores; the nucleus; to create a cloud computinguniverse with a capacity much larger than the nucleus and a cost much smaller than owningthe entire infrastructure. This model is rooted by the observation that a tremendous amountof computation exists outside the core that can potentially augment the nucleus' capacity. Anexample of this surplus capacity are enterprizes with diurnal trends in usage behavior thatjoin the cloud during predicted periods of usage troughs. We propose to leverage this elasticand dynamic infrastructure to create a unified cloud service. A number of challenges; at …,*,2011,2

A Pragmatic Approach towards the Improvement of Performance of Ad Hoc Routing Protocols,Rajesh Roy; Sudipto Das; Pradip K Das,Abstract Mobile ad hoc networks are typically characterized by high mobility and frequentlink failures that result in low throughput and high end-to-end delay. In order to facilitatecommunication within the network; a routing protocol is used to discover routes betweennodes. The primary goal of such an ad hoc network routing protocol is correct and efficientroute establishment between a pair of nodes so that messages may be delivered in a timelymanner. Though a large number of routing protocols have been developed for this kind ofnetworks; most of them suffer from implementation difficulties and some inherentincapabilities to cope with highly dynamic scenarios as well as support for Quality ofServices (QoS). In this paper we propose to introduce a new layer in between network layerand IEEE 802.11 MAC sub layer. This layer will interact with the underlying MAC layer …,Proceedings of the 4th Asian International Mobile Computing Conference,2006,2

Memory sharing for working data using rdma,*,A server system may include a cluster of multiple computers that are networked for high-speed data communications. Each of the computers has a remote direct memory access(RDMA) network interface to allow high-speed memory sharing between computers. Arelational database engine of each computer is configured to utilize a hierarchy of memoryfor temporary storage of working data; including in order of decreasing access speed (a)local main memory;(b) remote memory accessed via RDMS; and (c) mass storage. Thedatabase engine uses the local main memory for working data; and additionally uses theRDMA accessible memory for working data when the local main memory becomes depleted.The server system may include a memory broker to which individual computers report theiravailable or unused memory; and which leases shared memory to requesting computers.,*,2017,*

Automatic demand-driven resource scaling for relational database-as-a-service,*,Architecture that enables a Database-as-a-Service (DaaS) to auto-scale container sizes onbehalf of tenants. An abstraction is provided that enables tenants to reason about monetarybudget and query latency; rather than resource provisioning. An auto-scaling moduleautomatically determines a container size for a subsequent billing interval based ontelemetry that comprises latencies (eg; waits); resource utilizations; and available budget; forexample. A set of robust signals are derived from database engine telemetry and combinedto significantly improve accuracy of resource demand estimation for database workloads. Ina more specific implementation; resource demands can be estimated for arbitrary SQL(structured query language) workloads in a relational database management system(RDBMS).,*,2016,*
Rethinking eventual consistency: can we do better?,Sudipto Das,Abstract Today's data-driven internet-facing applications pose unprecedented challenges tothe database systems that back these application. In addition to the immense scale of data;thousands of concurrent requests; and low latency response; these applications also strivefor 24X7 availability. The big data serving systems empowering these applications musttherefore have low request latencies; be highly-available; and be geo-replicated. As a result;there has been a resurgence of work on replicated; distributed database systems to meet thedemands of intermittently-connected clients and of disaster-tolerant databases that spandata centers spanning the globe. Many of these data serving systems weaken the criteria forreplica-consistency or isolation; and in some cases add new mechanisms; to improvepartition-tolerance; availability; and performance.

QoS Routing in Wireless Mesh Networks,Vinod Kone; Sudipto Das,ABSTRACT Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) have been attracting both academia and theindustry off late due to their inherent advantages of providing seamless broadbandconnectivity to community users. Though there has been some recent research on routing inthese networks; a preliminary survery of literature tells that not much has been doneregarding providing Quality of Service. This paper studies the performance of AQOR; a QoSaware routing protocol proposed primarily for MANETs and adopted to; but not adapted to;WMNs. We also propose a new protocol WMESH which addresses these drawbacks and isoptimized for WMNs. Preliminary Qualnet simulation results show the performanceadvantages of WMESH over other routing protocols.,*,*,*

To improvenetwork performance and user experience; network administrators should be able todiagnose and troubleshoot the faults in real time. In this paper; we present a tool; ReTiMon;that does real time network monitoring and is aimed to help the network administratorsanalyze the network's performance. ReTiMon provides statistics for the entire network ingeneral–and each node in specific–and helps find the “pain points” in the network andascertain various causes for such dismal performance of the network. We explain in detailthe architecture and various features of this tool and the tests performed to validate thecorrectness of the tool.,*,*,*
