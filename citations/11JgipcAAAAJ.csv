Similarity search in high dimensions via hashing,Aristides Gionis; Piotr Indyk; Rajeev Motwani,Abstract The nearest-or near-neighbor query problems arise in a large variety of databaseapplications; usually in the context of similarity searching. Of late; there has been increasinginterest in building search index structures for performing similarity search over high-dimensional data; eg; image databases; document collections; time-series databases; andgenome databases. Unfortunately; all known techniques for solving this problem fall prey tothe curse of dimensionality." That is; the data structures scale poorly with datadimensionality; in fact; if the number of dimensions exceeds 10 to 20; searching in kd treesand related structures involves the inspection of a large fraction of the database; therebydoing no better than brute-force linear search. It has been suggested that since the selectionof features and the choice of a distance metric in typical applications is rather heuristic …,Vldb,1999,2831
Finding high-quality content in social media,Eugene Agichtein; Carlos Castillo; Debora Donato; Aristides Gionis; Gilad Mishne,Abstract The quality of user-generated content varies drastically from excellent to abuse andspam. As the availability of such content increases; the task of identifying high-qualitycontent sites based on user contributions--social media sites--becomes increasinglyimportant. Social media in general exhibit a rich variety of information sources: in addition tothe content itself; there is a wide array of non-content information available; such as linksbetween items and explicit quality ratings from members of the community. In this paper weinvestigate methods for exploiting such community feedback to automatically identify highquality content. As a test case; we focus on Yahoo! Answers; a large communityquestion/answering portal that is particularly rich in the amount and types of content andsocial interactions available in it. We introduce a general classification framework for …,Proceedings of the 2008 international conference on web search and data mining,2008,1249
Maintaining stream statistics over sliding windows,Mayur Datar; Aristides Gionis; Piotr Indyk; Rajeev Motwani,We consider the problem of maintaining aggregates and statistics over data streams; withrespect to the last N data elements seen so far. We refer to this model as the sliding windowmodel. We consider the following basic problem: Given a stream of bits; maintain a count ofthe number of 1's in the last N elements seen from the stream. We show that; usingO(1ϵ\log^2N) bits of memory; we can estimate the number of 1's to within a factor of 1+ϵ.We also give a matching lower bound of Ω(1ϵ\log^2N) memory bits for any deterministic orrandomized algorithms. We extend our scheme to maintain the sum of the last N positiveintegers and provide matching upper and lower bounds for this more general problem aswell. We also show how to efficiently compute the Lp norms (p∈1;2) of vectors in the slidingwindow model using our techniques. Using our algorithm; one can adapt many other …,SIAM journal on computing,2002,887
Clustering aggregation,Aristides Gionis; Heikki Mannila; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract We consider the following problem: given a set of clusterings; find a singleclustering that agrees as much as possible with the input clusterings. This problem;clustering aggregation; appears naturally in various contexts. For example; clusteringcategorical data is an instance of the clustering aggregation problem; each categoricalattribute can be viewed as a clustering of the input rows where rows are grouped together ifthey take the same value on that attribute. Clustering aggregation can also be used as ametaclustering method to improve the robustness of clustering by combining the output ofmultiple algorithms. Furthermore; the problem formulation does not require a prioriinformation about the number of clusters; it is naturally determined by the optimizationfunction. In this article; we give a formal statement of the clustering aggregation problem …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2007,606
Finding interesting associations without support pruning,Edith Cohen; Mayur Datar; Shinji Fujiwara; Aristides Gionis; Piotr Indyk; Rajeev Motwani; Jeffrey D Ullman; Cheng Yang,Association-rule mining has heretofore relied on the condition of high support to do its workefficiently. In particular; the well-known a priori algorithm is only effective when the only rulesof interest are relationships that occur very frequently. However; there are a number ofapplications; such as data mining; identification of similar Web documents; clustering; andcollaborative filtering; where the rules of interest have comparatively few instances in thedata. In these cases; we must look for highly correlated items; or possibly even causalrelationships between infrequent items. We develop a family of algorithms for solving thisproblem; employing a combination of random sampling and hashing techniques. Weprovide analysis of the algorithms developed and conduct experiments on real and syntheticdata to obtain a comparative performance analysis.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2001,523
Know your neighbors: Web spam detection using the web topology,Carlos Castillo; Debora Donato; Aristides Gionis; Vanessa Murdock; Fabrizio Silvestri,Abstract Web spam can significantly deteriorate the quality of search engine results. Thusthere is a large incentive for commercial search engines to detect spam pages efficiently andaccurately. In this paper we present a spam detection system that combines link-based andcontent-based features; and uses the topology of the Web graph by exploiting the linkdependencies among the Web pages. We find that linked hosts tend to belong to the sameclass: either both are spam or both are non-spam. We demonstrate three methods ofincorporating the Web graph topology into the predictions obtained by our base classifier:(i)clustering the host graph; and assigning the label of all hosts in the cluster by majorityvote;(ii) propagating the predicted labels to neighboring hosts; and (iii) using the predictedlabels of neighboring hosts as new features and retraining the classifier. The result is an …,Proceedings of the 30th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2007,366
The query-flow graph: model and applications,Paolo Boldi; Francesco Bonchi; Carlos Castillo; Debora Donato; Aristides Gionis; Sebastiano Vigna,Abstract Query logs record the queries and the actions of the users of search engines; andas such they contain valuable information about the interests; the preferences; and thebehavior of the users; as well as their implicit feedback to search engine results. Mining thewealth of information available in the query logs has many important applications includingquery-log analysis; user profiling and personalization; advertising; query recommendation;and more. In this paper we introduce the query-flow graph; a graph representation of theinteresting knowledge about latent querying behavior. Intuitively; in the query-flow graph adirected edge from query qi to query qj means that the two queries are likely to be part of thesame" search mission". Any path over the query-flow graph may be seen as a searchingbehavior; whose likelihood is given by the strength of the edges along the path.,Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2008,334
XTRACT: a system for extracting document type descriptors from XML documents,Minos Garofalakis; Aristides Gionis; Rajeev Rastogi; Sridhar Seshadri; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract XML is rapidly emerging as the new standard for data representation and exchangeon the Web. An XML document can be accompanied by a Document Type Descriptor (DTD)which plays the role of a schema for an XML data collection. DTDs contain valuableinformation on the structure of documents and thus have a crucial role in the efficient storageof XML data; as well as the effective formulation and optimization of XML queries. In thispaper; we propose XTRACT; a novel system for inferring a DTD schema for a database ofXML documents. Since the DTD syntax incorporates the full expressive power of regularexpressions; naive approaches typically fail to produce concise and intuitive DTDs. Instead;the XTRACT inference algorithms employ a sequence of sophisticated steps that involve:(1)finding patterns in the input sequences and replacing them with regular expressions to …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2000,321
The community-search problem and how to plan a successful cocktail party,Mauro Sozio; Aristides Gionis,Abstract A lot of research in graph mining has been devoted in the discovery of communities.Most of the work has focused in the scenario where communities need to be discovered withonly reference to the input graph. However; for many interesting applications one isinterested in finding the community formed by a given set of nodes. In this paper we study aquery-dependent variant of the community-detection problem; which we call the community-search problem: given a graph G; and a set of query nodes in the graph; we seek to find asubgraph of G that contains the query nodes and it is densely connected. We motivate ameasure of density based on minimum degree and distance constraints; and we develop anoptimum greedy algorithm for this measure. We proceed by characterizing a class ofmonotone constraints and we generalize our algorithm to compute optimum solutions …,Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2010,262
Evaluating strategies for similarity search on the web,Taher H Haveliwala; Aristides Gionis; Dan Klein; Piotr Indyk,Abstract Finding pages on the Web that are similar to a query page (Related Pages) is animportant component of modern search engines. A variety of strategies have been proposedfor answering Related Pages queries; but comparative evaluation by user studies isexpensive; especially when large strategy spaces must be searched (eg; when tuningparameters). We present a technique for automatically evaluating strategies using Webhierarchies; such as Open Directory; in place of user feedback. We apply this evaluationmethodology to a mix of document representation strategies; including the use of text;anchor-text; and links. We discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of the variousapproaches examined. Finally; we describe how to efficiently construct a similarity index outof our chosen strategies; and provide sample results from our index.,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on World Wide Web,2002,254
Assessing data mining results via swap randomization,Aristides Gionis; Heikki Mannila; Taneli Mielikäinen; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract The problem of assessing the significance of data mining results on high-dimensional 0--1 datasets has been studied extensively in the literature. For problems suchas mining frequent sets and finding correlations; significance testing can be done bystandard statistical tests such as chi-square; or other methods. However; the results of suchtests depend only on the specific attributes and not on the dataset as a whole. Moreover; thetests are difficult to apply to sets of patterns or other complex results of data miningalgorithms. In this article; we consider a simple randomization technique that deals with thisshortcoming. The approach consists of producing random datasets that have the same rowand column margins as the given dataset; computing the results of interest on therandomized instances and comparing them to the results on the actual data. This …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2007,245
Social network analysis and mining for business applications,Francesco Bonchi; Carlos Castillo; Aristides Gionis; Alejandro Jaimes,Abstract Social network analysis has gained significant attention in recent years; largely dueto the success of online social networking and media-sharing sites; and the consequentavailability of a wealth of social network data. In spite of the growing interest; however; thereis little understanding of the potential business applications of mining social networks. Whilethere is a large body of research on different problems and methods for social networkmining; there is a gap between the techniques developed by the research community andtheir deployment in real-world applications. Therefore the potential business impact of thesetechniques is still largely unexplored. In this article we use a business process classificationframework to put the research topics in a business context and provide an overview of whatwe consider key problems and techniques in social network analysis and mining from the …,ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST),2011,240
Correlating financial time series with micro-blogging activity,Eduardo J Ruiz; Vagelis Hristidis; Carlos Castillo; Aristides Gionis; Alejandro Jaimes,Abstract We study the problem of correlating micro-blogging activity with stock-marketevents; defined as changes in the price and traded volume of stocks. Specifically; we collectmessages related to a number of companies; and we search for correlations between stock-market events for those companies and features extracted from the micro-bloggingmessages. The features we extract can be categorized in two groups. Features in the firstgroup measure the overall activity in the micro-blogging platform; such as number of posts;number of re-posts; and so on. Features in the second group measure properties of aninduced interaction graph; for instance; the number of connected components; statistics onthe degree distribution; and other graph-based properties. We present detailed experimentalresults measuring the correlation of the stock market events with these features; using …,Proceedings of the fifth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2012,229
Estimating aggregates on a peer-to-peer network,Mayank Bawa; Hector Garcia-Molina; Aristides Gionis; Rajeev Motwani,As Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks become popular; there is an emerging need to collect avariety of statistical summary information about the participating nodes. The P2P networks oftoday lack mechanisms to compute even such basic aggregates as min; max; sum; count oravg. In this paper; we define and study the NodeAggregation problem that is concerned withaggregating data stored at nodes in the network. We present generic schemes that can beused to compute any of the basic aggregation functions accurately and robustly. Ourschemes can be used as building blocks for tools to collect statistics on network topology;user behavior and other node characteristics.,*,2003,229
Fast shortest path distance estimation in large networks,Michalis Potamias; Francesco Bonchi; Carlos Castillo; Aristides Gionis,Abstract In this paper we study approximate landmark-based methods for point-to-pointdistance estimation in very large networks. These methods involve selecting a subset ofnodes as landmarks and computing offline the distances from each node in the graph tothose landmarks. At runtime; when the distance between a pair of nodes is needed; it can beestimated quickly by combining the precomputed distances. We prove that selecting theoptimal set of landmarks is an NP-hard problem; and thus heuristic solutions need to beemployed. We therefore explore theoretical insights to devise a variety of simple methodsthat scale well in very large networks. The efficiency of the suggested techniques is testedexperimentally using five real-world graphs having millions of edges. While theoreticalbounds support the claim that random landmarks work well in practice; our extensive …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,226
The impact of caching on search engines,Ricardo Baeza-Yates; Aristides Gionis; Flavio Junqueira; Vanessa Murdock; Vassilis Plachouras; Fabrizio Silvestri,Abstract In this paper we study the trade-offs in designing efficient caching systems for Websearch engines. We explore the impact of different approaches; such as static vs. dynamiccaching; and caching query results vs. caching posting lists. Using a query log spanning awhole year we explore the limitations of caching and we demonstrate that caching postinglists can achieve higher hit rates than caching query answers. We propose a new algorithmfor static caching of posting lists; which outperforms previous methods. We also study theproblem of finding the optimal way to split the static cache between answers and postinglists. Finally; we measure how the changes in the query log affect the effectiveness of staticcaching; given our observation that the distribution of the queries changes slowly over time.Our results and observations are applicable to different levels of the data-access …,Proceedings of the 30th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2007,222
Scalable techniques for clustering the web,Taher Haveliwala; Aristides Gionis; Piotr Indyk,Clustering is one of the most crucial techniques for dealing with the massive amount ofinformation present on the web. Clustering can either be performed once offline;independent of search queries; or performed online on the results of search queries. Ouroffline approach aims to efficiently cluster similar pages on the web; using the technique ofLocality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH); in which web pages are hashed in such a way that similarpages have a much higher probability of collision than dissimilar pages. Our preliminaryexperiments on the Stanford WebBase have shown that the hash-based scheme can bescaled to millions of urls.,*,2000,215
Efficient semi-streaming algorithms for local triangle counting in massive graphs,Luca Becchetti; Paolo Boldi; Carlos Castillo; Aristides Gionis,Abstract In this paper we study the problem of local triangle counting in large graphs.Namely; given a large graph G=(V; E) we want to estimate as accurately as possible thenumber of triangles incident to every node υ∈ V in the graph. The problem of computing theglobal number of triangles in a graph has been considered before; but to our knowledge thisis the first paper that addresses the problem of local triangle counting with a focus on theefficiency issues arising in massive graphs. The distribution of the local number of trianglesand the related local clustering coefficient can be used in many interesting applications. Forexample; we show that the measures we compute can help to detect the presence ofspamming activity in large-scale Web graphs; as well as to provide useful features to assesscontent quality in social networks. For computing the local number of triangles we …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2008,209
Approximating a collection of frequent sets,Foto Afrati; Aristides Gionis; Heikki Mannila,Abstract One of the most well-studied problems in data mining is computing the collection offrequent item sets in large transactional databases. One obstacle for the applicability offrequent-set mining is that the size of the output collection can be far too large to be carefullyexamined and understood by the users. Even restricting the output to the border of thefrequent item-set collection does not help much in alleviating the problem. In this paper weaddress the issue of overwhelmingly large output size by introducing and studying thefollowing problem: What are the k sets that best approximate a collection of frequent itemsets? Our measure of approximating a collection of sets by k sets is defined to be the size ofthe collection covered by the the k sets; ie; the part of the collection that is included in one ofthe k sets. We also specify a bound on the number of extra sets that are allowed to be …,Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2004,179
Online team formation in social networks,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Luca Becchetti; Carlos Castillo; Aristides Gionis; Stefano Leonardi,Abstract We study the problem of online team formation. We consider a setting in whichpeople possess different skills and compatibility among potential team members is modeledby a social network. A sequence of tasks arrives in an online fashion; and each task requiresa specific set of skills. The goal is to form a new team upon arrival of each task; so that (i)each team possesses all skills required by the task;(ii) each team has small communicationoverhead; and (iii) the workload of performing the tasks is balanced among people in thefairest possible way. We propose efficient algorithms that address all these requirements:our algorithms form teams that always satisfy the required skills; provide approximationguarantees with respect to team communication overhead; and they are online-competitivewith respect to load balancing. Experiments performed on collaboration networks among …,Proceedings of the 21st international conference on World Wide Web,2012,177
Mining graph evolution rules,Michele Berlingerio; Francesco Bonchi; Björn Bringmann; Aristides Gionis,Abstract In this paper we introduce graph-evolution rules; a novel type of frequency-basedpattern that describe the evolution of large networks over time; at a local level. Given asequence of snapshots of an evolving graph; we aim at discovering rules describing thelocal changes occurring in it. Adopting a definition of support based on minimum image westudy the problem of extracting patterns whose frequency is larger than a minimum supportthreshold. Then; similar to the classical association rules framework; we derive graph-evolution rules from frequent patterns that satisfy a given minimum confidence constraint.We discuss merits and limits of alternative definitions of support and confidence; justifyingthe chosen framework. To evaluate our approach we devise GERM (Graph Evolution RuleMiner); an algorithm to mine all graph-evolution rules whose support and confidence are …,joint European conference on machine learning and knowledge discovery in databases,2009,169
The discrete basis problem,Pauli Miettinen; Taneli Mielikäinen; Aristides Gionis; Gautam Das; Heikki Mannila,Matrix decomposition methods represent a data matrix as a product of two factor matrices:one containing basis vectors that represent meaningful concepts in the data; and anotherdescribing how the observed data can be expressed as combinations of the basis vectors.Decomposition methods have been studied extensively; but many methods return real-valued matrices. Interpreting real-valued factor matrices is hard if the original data isBoolean. In this paper; we describe a matrix decomposition formulation for Boolean data; theDiscrete Basis Problem. The problem seeks for a Boolean decomposition of a binary matrix;thus allowing the user to easily interpret the basis vectors. We also describe a variation ofthe problem; the Discrete Basis Partitioning Problem. We show that both problems are NP-hard. For the Discrete Basis Problem; we give a simple greedy algorithm for solving it; for …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2008,145
The price of validity in dynamic networks,Mayank Bawa; Aristides Gionis; Hector Garcia-Molina; Rajeev Motwani,Abstract Massive-scale self-administered networks like Peer-to-Peer and Sensor Networkshave data distributed across thousands of participant hosts. These networks are highlydynamic with short-lived hosts being the norm rather than an exception. In recent years;researchers have investigated best-effort algorithms to efficiently process aggregate queries(eg; sum; count; average; minimum and maximum) on these networks. Unfortunately; querysemantics for best-effort algorithms are ill-defined; making it hard to reason aboutguarantees associated with the result returned. In this paper; we specify a correctnesscondition; Single-Site Validity; with respect to which the above algorithms are best-effort. Wepresent a class of algorithms that guarantee validity in dynamic networks. Experiments onreal-life and synthetic network topologies validate performance of our algorithms …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2007,145
Sparsification of influence networks,Michael Mathioudakis; Francesco Bonchi; Carlos Castillo; Aristides Gionis; Antti Ukkonen,Abstract We present Spine; an efficient algorithm for finding the" backbone" of an influencenetwork. Given a social graph and a log of past propagations; we build an instance of theindependent-cascade model that describes the propagations. We aim at reducing thecomplexity of that model; while preserving most of its accuracy in describing the data. Weshow that the problem is inapproximable and we present an optimal; dynamic-programmingalgorithm; whose search space; albeit exponential; is typically much smaller than that of thebrute force; exhaustive-search approach. Seeking a practical; scalable approach tosparsification; we devise Spine; a greedy; efficient algorithm with practically littlecompromise in quality.,Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2011,134
K-nearest neighbors in uncertain graphs,Michalis Potamias; Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis; George Kollios,Abstract Complex networks; such as biological; social; and communication networks; oftenentail uncertainty; and thus; can be modeled as probabilistic graphs. Similar to the problemof similarity search in standard graphs; a fundamental problem for probabilistic graphs is toefficiently answer k-nearest neighbor queries (k-NN); which is the problem of computing thek closest nodes to some specific node. In this paper we introduce a framework forprocessing k-NN queries in probabilistic graphs. We propose novel distance functions thatextend well-known graph concepts; such as shortest paths. In order to compute them inprobabilistic graphs; we design algorithms based on sampling. During k-NN queryprocessing we efficiently prune the search space using novel techniques.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,132
Denser than the densest subgraph: extracting optimal quasi-cliques with quality guarantees,Charalampos Tsourakakis; Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis; Francesco Gullo; Maria Tsiarli,Abstract Finding dense subgraphs is an important graph-mining task with many applications.Given that the direct optimization of edge density is not meaningful; as even a single edgeachieves maximum density; research has focused on optimizing alternative densityfunctions. A very popular among such functions is the average degree; whose maximizationleads to the well-known densest-subgraph notion. Surprisingly enough; however; densestsubgraphs are typically large graphs; with small edge density and large diameter. In thispaper; we define a novel density function; which gives subgraphs of much higher qualitythan densest subgraphs: the graphs found by our method are compact; dense; and withsmaller diameter. We show that the proposed function can be derived from a generalframework; which includes other important density functions as subcases and for which …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2013,121
Learning and predicting the evolution of social networks,Björn Bringmann; Michele Berlingerio; Francesco Bonchi; Arisitdes Gionis,With the increasing availability of large social network data; there is also an increasinginterest in analyzing how those networks evolve over time. Traditionally; the analysis ofsocial networks has focused only on a single snapshot of a network. Researchers havealready verified that social networks follow power-law degree distribution; have a smalldiameter; and exhibit small-world structure and community structure. Attempts to explain theproperties of social networks have led to dynamic models inspired by the preferentialattachment models which assumes that new network nodes have a higher probability offorming links with high-degree nodes; creating a rich-get-richer effect. Although some efforthas been devoted to analyzing global properties of social network evolution; not much hasbeen done to study graph evolution at a microscopic level. A first step in this direction …,IEEE Intelligent Systems,2010,119
From chatter to headlines: harnessing the real-time web for personalized news recommendation,Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis; Claudio Lucchese,Abstract We propose a new methodology for recommending interesting news to users byexploiting the information in their twitter persona. We model relevance between users andnews articles using a mix of signals drawn from the news stream and from twitter: the profileof the social neighborhood of the users; the content of their own tweet stream; and topicpopularity in the news and in the whole twitter-land. We validate our approach on a real-world dataset of approximately 40k articles coming from Yahoo! News and one month ofcrawled twitter data. We train our model using a learning-to-rank approach and support-vector machines. The train and test set are drawn from Yahoo! toolbar log data. Weheuristically identify 3214 users of twitter in the log and use their clicks on news articles totrain our system.,Proceedings of the fifth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2012,105

Power in unity: forming teams in large-scale community systems,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Luca Becchetti; Carlos Castillo; Aristides Gionis; Stefano Leonardi,Abstract The internet has enabled the collaboration of groups at a scale that was unseenbefore. A key problem for large collaboration groups is to be able to allocate taskseffectively. An effective task assignment method should consider both how fit teams are foreach job as well as how fair the assignment is to team members; in terms that no one shouldbe overloaded or unfairly singled out. The assignment has to be done automatically or semi-automatically given that it is difficult and time-consuming to keep track of the skills and theworkload of each person. Obviously the method to do this assignment must also becomputationally efficient. In this paper we present a general framework for task assignmentproblems. We provide a formal treatment on how to represent teams and tasks.

Improving recommendation for long-tail queries via templates,Idan Szpektor; Aristides Gionis; Yoelle Maarek,Abstract The ability to aggregate huge volumes of queries over a large population of usersallows search engines to build precise models for a variety of query-assistance featuressuch as query recommendation; correction; etc. Yet; no matter how much data isaggregated; the long-tail distribution implies that a large fraction of queries are rare. As aresult; most query assistance services perform poorly or are not even triggered on long-tailqueries. We propose a method to extend the reach of query assistance techniques (and inparticular query recommendation) to long-tail queries by reasoning about rules betweenquery templates rather than individual query transitions; as currently done in query-flowgraph models. As a simple example; if we recognize that'Montezuma'is a city in the rarequery" Montezuma surf" and if the rule'city surf→ beach has been observed; we are able …,Proceedings of the 20th international conference on World wide web,2011,88
An optimization framework for query recommendation,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Luca Becchetti; Carlos Castillo; Aristides Gionis,Abstract Query recommendation is an integral part of modern search engines. The goal ofquery recommendation is to facilitate users while searching for information. Queryrecommendation also allows users to explore concepts related to their information needs. Inthis paper; we present a formal treatment of the problem of query recommendation. In ourframework we model the querying behavior of users by a probabilistic reformula-tion graph;or query-flow graph [Boldi et al. CIKM 2008]. A sequence of queries submitted by a user canbe seen as a path on this graph. Assigning score values to queries allows us to definesuitable utility functions and to consider the expected utility achieved by a reformulation pathon the query-flow graph. Providing recommendations can be seen as adding shortcuts in thequery-flow graph that" nudge" the reformulation paths of users; in such a way that users …,Proceedings of the third ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2010,84
Identity obfuscation in graphs through the information theoretic lens,Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis; Tamir Tassa,Abstract Analyzing the structure of social networks is of interest in a wide range ofdisciplines. Unfortunately; sharing social-network datasets is often restrained by privacyconsiderations. One way to address the privacy concern is to anonymize the data beforepublishing. Randomly adding or deleting edges from the social graph is one of theanonymization approaches that have been proposed in the literature. Recent studies havequantified the level of anonymity that is obtained by random perturbation by means of aposteriori belief probabilities and; by conducting experiments on small datasets; arrived atthe conclusion that random perturbation cannot achieve meaningful levels of anonymitywithout deteriorating the graph properties. We offer a new information-theoretic perspectiveon the question of anonymizing a social network by means of random edge additions and …,Information Sciences,2014,78
XTRACT: Learning document type descriptors from XML document collections,Minos Garofalakis; Aristides Gionis; Rajeev Rastogi; Sridhar Seshadri; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract XML is rapidly emerging as the new standard for data representation and exchangeon the Web. Unlike HTML; tags in XML documents describe the semantics of the data andnot how it is to be displayed. In addition; an XML document can be accompanied by aDocument Type Descriptor (DTD) which plays the role of a schema for an XML datacollection. DTDs contain valuable information on the structure of documents and thus have acrucial role in the efficient storage of XML data; as well as the effective formulation andoptimization of XML queries. Despite their importance; however; DTDs are not mandatory;and it is frequently possible that documents in XML databases will not have accompanyingDTDs. In this paper; we propose XTRACT; a novel system for inferring a DTD schema for adatabase of XML documents. Since the DTD syntax incorporates the full expressive …,Data mining and knowledge discovery,2003,78
k-means–: A unified approach to clustering and outlier detection,Sanjay Chawla; Aristides Gionis,Abstract We present a unified approach for simultaneously clustering and discoveringoutliers in data. Our approach is formalized as a generalization of the k-MEANS problem.We prove that the problem is NP-hard and then present a practical polynomial timealgorithm; which is guaranteed to converge to a local optimum. Furthermore we extend ourapproach to all distance measures that can be expressed in the form of a Bregmandivergence. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ourapproach and the utility of carrying out both clustering and outlier detection in a concurrentmanner. In particular on the famous KDD cup network-intrusion dataset; we were able toincrease the precision of the outlier detection task by nearly 100% compared to the classicalnearest-neighbor approach.,*,2013,75
Finding recurrent sources in sequences,Aristides Gionis; Heikki Mannila,Abstract Many genomic sequences and; more generally;(multivariate) time series displaytremendous variability. However; often it is reasonable to assume that the sequence isactually generated by or assembled from a small number of sources; each of which mightcontribute several segments to the sequence. That is; there are h hidden sources such thatthe sequence can be written as a concatenation of k> h pieces; each of which stems fromone of the h sources. We define this (k; h)-segmentation problem and show that it is NP-hardin the general case. We give approximation algorithms achieving approximation ratios of 3for the L 1 error measure and√ 5 for the L 2 error measure; and generalize the results tohigher dimensions. We give empirical results on real (chromosome 22) and artificial datashowing that the methods work well in practice.,Proceedings of the seventh annual international conference on Research in computational molecular biology,2003,73
Quantifying Controversy on Social Media,Kiran Garimella; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis; Michael Mathioudakis,Abstract Which topics spark the most heated debates on social media? Identifying thosetopics is not only interesting from a societal point of view but also allows the filtering andaggregation of social media content for disseminating news stories. In this article; weperform a systematic methodological study of controversy detection by using the content andthe network structure of social media. Unlike previous work; rather than studying controversyin a single hand-picked topic and using domain-specific knowledge; we take a generalapproach to study topics in any domain. Our approach to quantifying controversy is basedon a graph-based three-stage pipeline; which involves (i) building a conversation graphabout a topic;(ii) partitioning the conversation graph to identify potential sides of thecontroversy; and (iii) measuring the amount of controversy from characteristics of the …,ACM Transactions on Social Computing,2018,69
Query similarity by projecting the query-flow graph,Ilaria Bordino; Carlos Castillo; Debora Donato; Aristides Gionis,Abstract Defining a measure of similarity between queries is an interesting and difficultproblem. A reliable query-similarity measure can be used in a variety of applications such asquery recommendation; query expansion; and advertising. In this paper; we exploit theinformation present in query logs in order to develop a measure of semantic similaritybetween queries. Our approach relies on the concept of the query-flow graph. The query-flow graph aggregates query reformulations from many users: nodes in the graph representqueries; and two queries are connected if they are likely to appear as part of the samesearch goal. Our query similarity measure is obtained by projecting the graph (orappropriate subgraphs of it) on a low-dimensional Euclidean space. Our experiments showthat the measure we obtain captures a notion of semantic similarity between queries and …,Proceedings of the 33rd international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2010,68
k-Anonymization with minimal loss of information,Aristides Gionis; Tamir Tassa,The technique of k-anonymization allows the releasing of databases that contain personalinformation while ensuring some degree of individual privacy. Anonymization is usuallyperformed by generalizing database entries. We formally study the concept ofgeneralization; and propose three information-theoretic measures for capturing the amountof information that is lost during the anonymization process. The proposed measures aremore general and more accurate than those that were proposed by Meyerson and Williamsand Aggarwal et al. We study the problem of achieving k-anonymity with minimal loss ofinformation. We prove that it is NP-hard and study polynomial approximations for the optimalsolution. Our first algorithm gives an approximation guarantee of O (ln k) for two of ourmeasures as well as for the previously studied measures. This improves the best-known …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2009,68
Mining large networks with subgraph counting,Ilaria Bordino; Debora Donato; Aristides Gionis; Stefano Leonardi,The problem of mining frequent patterns in networks has many applications; includinganalysis of complex networks; clustering of graphs; finding communities in social networks;and indexing of graphical and biological databases. Despite this wealth of applications; thecurrent state of the art lacks algorithmic tools for counting the number of subgraphscontained in a large network. In this paper we develop data-stream algorithms thatapproximate the number of all subgraphs of three and four vertices in directed andundirected networks. We use the frequency of occurrence of all subgraphs to prove theirsignificance in order to characterize different kinds of networks: we achieve very goodprecision in clustering networks with similar structure. The significance of our method issupported by the fact that such high precision cannot be achieved when performing …,Data Mining; 2008. ICDM'08. Eighth IEEE International Conference on,2008,62
The discrete basis problem,Pauli Miettinen; Taneli Mielikäinen; Aristides Gionis; Gautam Das; Heikki Mannila,Abstract Matrix decomposition methods represent a data matrix as a product of two smallermatrices: one containing basis vectors that represent meaningful concepts in the data; andanother describing how the observed data can be expressed as combinations of the basisvectors. Decomposition methods have been studied extensively; but many methods returnreal-valued matrices. If the original data is binary; the interpretation of the basis vectors ishard. We describe a matrix decomposition formulation; the Discrete Basis Problem. Theproblem seeks for a Boolean decomposition of a binary matrix; thus allowing the user toeasily interpret the basis vectors. We show that the problem is computationally difficult andgive a simple greedy algorithm for solving it. We present experimental results for thealgorithm. The method gives intuitively appealing basis vectors. On the other hand; the …,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2006,59
Efficient and tumble similar set retrieval,Aristides Gionis; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Nick Koudas,Abstract Set value attributes are a concise and natural way to model complex data sets.Modern Object Relational systems support set value attributes and allow various querycapabilities on them. In this paper we initiate a formal study of indexing techniques for setvalue attributes based on similarity; for suitably defined notions of similarity between sets.Such techniques are necessary in modern applications such as recommendations throughcollaborative filtering and automated advertising. Our techniques are probabilistic andapproximate in nature. As a design principle we create structures that make use of wellknown and widely used data structuring techniques; as a means to ease integration withexisting infrastructure. We show how the problem of indexing a collection of sets based onsimilarity can be reduced to the problem of indexing suitably encoded (in a way that …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2001,59
Injecting uncertainty in graphs for identity obfuscation,Paolo Boldi; Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis; Tamir Tassa,Abstract Data collected nowadays by social-networking applications create fascinatingopportunities for building novel services; as well as expanding our understanding aboutsocial structures and their dynamics. Unfortunately; publishing social-network graphs isconsidered an ill-advised practice due to privacy concerns. To alleviate this problem; severalanonymization methods have been proposed; aiming at reducing the risk of a privacybreach on the published data; while still allowing to analyze them and draw relevantconclusions. In this paper we introduce a new anonymization approach that is based oninjecting uncertainty in social graphs and publishing the resulting uncertain graphs. Whileexisting approaches obfuscate graph data by adding or removing edges entirely; wepropose using a finer-grained perturbation that adds or removes edges partially: this way …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,58
Geometric and combinatorial tiles in 0–1 data,Aristides Gionis; Heikki Mannila; Jouni K Seppänen,Abstract In this paper we introduce a simple probabilistic model; hierarchical tiles; for 0–1data. A basic tile (X; Y; p) specifies a subset X of the rows and a subset Y of the columns ofthe data; ie; a rectangle; and gives a probability p for the occurrence of 1s in the cells of X×Y. A hierarchical tile has additionally a set of exception tiles that specify the probabilities forsubrectangles of the original rectangle. If the rows and columns are ordered and X and Yconsist of consecutive elements in those orderings; then the tile is geometric; otherwise it iscombinatorial. We give a simple randomized algorithm for finding good geometric tiles. Ourmain result shows that using spectral ordering techniques one can find good orderings thatturn combinatorial tiles into geometric tiles. We give empirical results on the performance ofthe methods.,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2004,57
k-Anonymization revisited,Aristides Gionis; Arnon Mazza; Tamir Tassa,In this paper we introduce new notions of k-type anonymizations. Those notions achievesimilar privacy goals as those aimed by Sweenie and Samarati when proposing the conceptof k-anonymization: an adversary who knows the public data of an individual cannot link thatindividual to less than k records in the anonymized table. Every anonymized table thatsatisfies k-anonymity complies also with the anonymity constraints dictated by the newnotions; but the converse is not necessarily true. Thus; those new notions allow generalizedtables that may offer higher utility than k-anonymized tables; while still preserving therequired privacy constraints. We discuss and compare the new anonymization concepts;which we call (1; k)-;(k; k)-and global (1; k)-anonymizations; according to several utilitymeasures. We propose a collection of agglomerative algorithms for the problem of finding …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,55
Estimating number of citations using author reputation,Carlos Castillo; Debora Donato; Aristides Gionis,Abstract We study the problem of predicting the popularity of items in a dynamic environmentin which authors post continuously new items and provide feedback on existing items. Thisproblem can be applied to predict popularity of blog posts; rank photographs in a photo-sharing system; or predict the citations of a scientific article using author information andmonitoring the items of interest for a short period of time after their creation. As a case study;we show how to estimate the number of citations for an academic paper using informationabout past articles written by the same author (s) of the paper. If we use only the citationinformation over a short period of time; we obtain a predicted value that has a correlation ofr= 0.57 with the actual value. This is our baseline prediction. Our best-performing system canimprove that prediction by adding features extracted from the past publishing history of its …,International Symposium on String Processing and Information Retrieval,2007,54
Dimension induced clustering,Aristides Gionis; Alexander Hinneburg; Spiros Papadimitriou; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract It is commonly assumed that high-dimensional datasets contain points most ofwhich are located in low-dimensional manifolds. Detection of low-dimensional clusters is anextremely useful task for performing operations such as clustering and classification;however; it is a challenging computational problem. In this paper we study the problem offinding subsets of points with low intrinsic dimensionality. Our main contribution is to extendthe definition of fractal correlation dimension; which measures average volume growth rate;in order to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of the data in local neighborhoods. Weprovide a careful analysis of several key examples in order to demonstrate the properties ofour measure. Based on our proposed measure; we introduce a novel approach to discoverclusters with low dimensionality. The resulting algorithms extend previous density based …,Proceedings of the eleventh ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery in data mining,2005,53
Opinion maximization in social networks,Aristides Gionis; Evimaria Terzi; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract The process of opinion formation through synthesis and contrast of differentviewpoints has been the subject of many studies in economics and social sciences. Today;this process manifests itself also in online social networks and social media. The keycharacteristic of successful promotion campaigns is that they take into consideration suchopinion-formation dynamics in order to create a overall favorable opinion about a specificinformation item; such as a person; a product; or an idea. In this paper; we adopt a well-established model for social-opinion dynamics and formalize the campaigndesign problemas the problem of identifying a set of target individuals whose positive opinion about aninformation item will maximize the overall positive opinion for the item in the social network.We call this problem CAMPAIGN. We study the complexity of the CAMPAIGN problem …,*,2013,52
Machine learned job recommendation,Ioannis Paparrizos; B Barla Cambazoglu; Aristides Gionis,Abstract We address the problem of recommending suitable jobs to people who are seekinga new job. We formulate this recommendation problem as a supervised machine learningproblem. Our technique exploits all past job transitions as well as the data associated withemployees and institutions to predict an employee's next job transition. We train a machinelearning model using a large number of job transitions extracted from the publicly availableemployee profiles in the Web. Experiments show that job transitions can be accuratelypredicted; significantly improving over a baseline that always predicts the most frequentinstitution in the data.,Proceedings of the fifth ACM Conference on Recommender Systems,2011,52
Overlapping correlation clustering,Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis; Antti Ukkonen,We introduce a new approach to the problem of overlapping clustering. The main idea is toformulate overlapping clustering as an optimization problem in which each data point ismapped to a small set of labels; representing membership to different clusters. The objectiveis to find a mapping so that the distances between data points agree as much as possiblewith distances taken over their label sets. To define distances between label sets; weconsider two measures: a set-intersection indicator function and the Jaccard coefficient. Tosolve the main optimization problem we propose a local-search algorithm. The iterative stepof our algorithm requires solving non-trivial optimization sub problems; which; for themeasures of set-intersection and Jaccard; we solve using a greedy method and non-negative least squares; respectively. Since our frameworks uses pair wise similarities of …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on,2011,51
Social content matching in mapreduce,Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis; Mauro Sozio,Abstract Matching problems are ubiquitous. They occur in economic markets; labor markets;internet advertising; and elsewhere. In this paper we focus on an application of matching forsocial media. Our goal is to distribute content from information suppliers to informationconsumers. We seek to maximize the overall relevance of the matched content fromsuppliers to consumers while regulating the overall activity; eg; ensuring that no consumer isoverwhelmed with data and that all suppliers have chances to deliver their content. Wepropose two matching algorithms; GreedyMR and StackMR; geared for the MapReduceparadigm. Both algorithms have provable approximation guarantees; and in practice theyproduce high-quality solutions. While both algorithms scale extremely well; we can showthat Stack-MR requires only a poly-logarithmic number of MapReduce steps; making it an …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,48
On the feasibility of multi-site web search engines,Ricardo Baeza-Yates; Aristides Gionis; Flavio Junqueira; Vassilis Plachouras; Luca Telloli,Abstract Web search engines are often implemented as centralized systems. Designing andimplementing a Web search engine in a distributed environment is a challengingengineering task that encompasses many interesting research questions. However;distributing a search engine across multiple sites has several advantages; such as utilizingless compute resources and exploiting data locality. In this paper we investigate the cost-effectiveness of building a distributed Web search engine. We propose a model forassessing the total cost of a distributed Web search engine that includes the computationalcosts and the communication cost among all distributed sites. We then present a query-processing algorithm that maximizes the amount of queries answered locally; withoutsacrificing the quality of the results compared to a centralized search engine.

Event detection in activity networks,Polina Rozenshtein; Aris Anagnostopoulos; Aristides Gionis; Nikolaj Tatti,Abstract With the fast growth of smart devices and social networks; a lot of computingsystems collect data that record different types of activities. An important computationalchallenge is to analyze these data; extract patterns; and understand activity trends. Weconsider the problem of mining activity networks to identify interesting events; such as a bigconcert or a demonstration in a city; or a trending keyword in a user community in a socialnetwork. We define an event to be a subset of nodes in the network that are close to eachother and have high activity levels. We formalize the problem of event detection using twograph-theoretic formulations. The first one captures the compactness of an event using thesum of distances among all pairs of the event nodes. We show that this formulation can bemapped to the maxcut problem; and thus; it can be solved by applying standard …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2014,46
Spectral ordering and biochronology of European fossil mammals,Mikael Fortelius; Aristides Gionis; Jukka Jernvall; Heikki Mannila,Abstract Spectral algorithms have been shown to work well in a wide range of situations thatinvolve the task of ordering. When applied to the localities of a set of European Neogeneland mammal taxa; spectral ordering relies almost entirely on the most common genera;depends on connectivity more than on length of taxon lists; and is robust to noise from rarerand less connected taxa. The spectral coefficients for localities are highly correlated withknown geochronological ages. Although elementary compared with more sophisticatedbiochronological tools; spectral ordering allows a fast and standardized way to generatebiochronological ordering of localities when other information than faunal lists is lacking.Compared with the conventional mammal Neogene (MN) units; spectral ordering oflocalities appears to lack distinct temporal boundaries in taxon content and render a …,Paleobiology,2006,45
k-Concealment: An Alternative Model of k-Type Anonymity.,Tamir Tassa; Arnon Mazza; Aristides Gionis,Abstract. We introduce a new model of k-type anonymity; called k-concealment; as analternative to the well-known model of k-anonymity. This new model achieves similar privacygoals as kanonymity: While in k-anonymity one generalizes the table records so that eachone of them becomes equal to at least k− 1 other records; when projected on the subset ofquasi-identifiers; k-concealment proposes to generalize the table records so that each oneof them becomes computationally-indistinguishable from at least k− 1 others. As the newmodel extends that of k-anonymity; it offers higher utility. To motivate the new model and tolay the ground for its introduction; we first present three other models; called (1; k)-;(k; 1)-and(k; k)-anonymity which also extend k-anonymity. We characterize the interrelation betweenthe four models and propose algorithms for anonymizing data according to them. Since k …,Trans. Data Privacy,2012,44
What is the dimension of your binary data?,Nikolaj Tatti; Taneli Mielikainen; Aristides Gionis; Heikki Mannila,Many 0/1 datasets have a very large number of variables; however; they are sparse and thedependency structure of the variables is simpler than the number of variables wouldsuggest. Defining the effective dimensionality of such a dataset is a nontrivial problem. Weconsider the problem of defining a robust measure of dimension for 0/1 datasets; and showthat the basic idea of fractal dimension can be adapted for binary data. However; as such thefractal dimension is difficult to interpret. Hence we introduce the concept of normalizedfractal dimension. For a dataset D; its normalized fractal dimension counts the number ofindependent columns needed to achieve the unnormalized fractal dimension of D. Thenormalized fractal dimension measures the degree of dependency structure of the data. Westudy the properties of the normalized fractal dimension and discuss its computation.

Chromatic correlation clustering,Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis; Francesco Gullo; Charalampos E Tsourakakis; Antti Ukkonen,Abstract We study a novel clustering problem in which the pairwise relations betweenobjects are categorical. This problem can be viewed as clustering the vertices of a graphwhose edges are of different types (colors). We introduce an objective function that ensuresthe edges within each cluster have; as much as possible; the same color. We show that theproblem is NP-hard and propose a randomized algorithm with approximation guaranteeproportional to the maximum degree of the input graph. The algorithm iteratively picks arandom edge as a pivot; builds a cluster around it; and removes the cluster from the graph.Although being fast; easy to implement; and parameter-free; this algorithm tends to producea relatively large number of clusters. To overcome this issue we introduce a variantalgorithm; which modifies how the pivot is chosen and how the cluster is built around the …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2015,42
Efficient algorithms for large-scale local triangle counting,Luca Becchetti; Paolo Boldi; Carlos Castillo; Aristides Gionis,Abstract In this article; we study the problem of approximate local triangle counting in largegraphs. Namely; given a large graph G&equals;(V; E) we want to estimate as accurately aspossible the number of triangles incident to every node v∈ V in the graph. We consider thequestion both for undirected and directed graphs. The problem of computing the globalnumber of triangles in a graph has been considered before; but to our knowledge this is thefirst contribution that addresses the problem of approximate local triangle counting with afocus on the efficiency issues arising in massive graphs and that also considers the directedcase. The distribution of the local number of triangles and the related local clusteringcoefficient can be used in many interesting applications. For example; we show that themeasures we compute can help detect the presence of spamming activity in large-scale …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2010,41
Segmentation and dimensionality reduction,Ella Bingham; Aristides Gionis; Niina Haiminen; Heli Hiisilä; Heikki Mannila; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Sequence segmentation and dimensionality reduction have been used as methodsfor studying high-dimensional sequences—they both reduce the complexity of therepresentation of the original data. In this paper we study the interplay of these twotechniques. We formulate the problem of segmenting a sequence while modeling it with abasis of small size; thus essentially reducing the dimension of the input sequence. We givethree different algorithms for this problem: all combine existing methods for sequencesegmentation and dimensionality reduction. For two of the proposed algorithms we proveguarantees for the quality of the solutions obtained. We describe experimental results onsynthetic and real datasets; including data on exchange rates and genomic sequences.

Customized tour recommendations in urban areas,Aristides Gionis; Theodoros Lappas; Konstantinos Pelechrinis; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract The ever-increasing urbanization coupled with the unprecedented capacity tocollect and process large amounts of data have helped to create the vision of intelligenturban environments. One key aspect of such environments is that they allow people toeffectively navigate through their city. While GPS technology and route-planning serviceshave undoubtedly helped towards this direction; there is room for improvement in intelligenturban navigation. This vision can be fostered by the proliferation of location-based socialnetworks; such as Foursquare or Path; which record the physical presence of users indifferent venues through check-ins. This information can then be used to enhance intelligenturban navigation; by generating customized path recommendations for users. In this paper;we focus on the problem of recommending customized tours in urban settings. These …,Proceedings of the 7th ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2014,39

Learning the latent variables of such process; ie; the influence strength alongeach link; is a central question towards understanding the structure and function of complexnetworks; modeling information cascades; and developing applications such as viralmarketing. Motivated by modern microblogging platforms; such as twitter; in this paper westudy the problem of learning influence probabilities in a data-stream scenario; in which thenetwork topology is relatively stable and the challenge of a learning algorithm is to keep upwith a continuous stream of tweets using a small amount of time and memory.

Fast Reliability Search in Uncertain Graphs.,Arijit Khan; Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis; Francesco Gullo,ABSTRACT Uncertain; or probabilistic; graphs have been increasingly used to representnoisy linked data in many emerging application scenarios; and have recently attracted theattention of the database research community. A fundamental problem on uncertain graphsis reliability; which deals with the probability of nodes being reachable one from another.Existing literature has exclusively focused on reliability detection; which asks to compute theprobability that two given nodes are connected. In this paper we study reliability search onuncertain graphs; which we define as the problem of computing all nodes reachable from aset of query nodes with probability no less than a given threshold. Existing reliability-detection approaches are not well-suited to efficiently handle the reliability-search problem.We propose RQ-tree; a novel index which is based on a hierarchical clustering of the …,EDBT,2014,33
Topical query decomposition,Francesco Bonchi; Carlos Castillo; Debora Donato; Aristides Gionis,Abstract We introduce the problem of query decomposition; where we are given a query anda document retrieval system; and we want to produce a small set of queries whose union ofresulting documents corresponds approximately to that of the original query. Ideally; thesequeries should represent coherent; conceptually well-separated topics. We provide anabstract formulation of the query decomposition problem; and we tackle it from two differentperspectives. We first show how the problem can be instantiated as a specific variant of a setcover problem; for which we provide an efficient greedy algorithm. Next; we show how thesame problem can be seen as a constrained clustering problem; with a very particular kindof constraint; ie; clustering with predefined clusters.

Reducing controversy by connecting opposing views,Kiran Garimella; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis; Michael Mathioudakis,Abstract Society is often polarized by controversial issues that split the population intogroups with opposing views. When such issues emerge on social media; we often observethe creation ofecho chambers'; ie; situations where like-minded people reinforce eachother's opinion; but do not get exposed to the views of the opposing side. In this paper westudy algorithmic techniques for bridging these chambers; and thus reduce controversy.Specifically; we represent the discussion on a controversial issue with an endorsementgraph; and cast our problem as an edge-recommendation problem on this graph. The goalof the recommendation is to reduce the controversy score of the graph; which is measuredby a recently-developed metric based on random walks. At the same time; we take intoaccount the acceptance probability of the recommended edge; which represents how …,Proceedings of the Tenth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2017,28
Algorithms for discovering bucket orders from data,Aristides Gionis; Heikki Mannila; Kai Puolamäki; Antti Ukkonen,Abstract Ordering and ranking items of different types are important tasks in variousapplications; such as query processing and scientific data mining. A total order for the itemscan be misleading; since there are groups of items that have practically equal ranks. Weconsider bucket orders; ie; total orders with ties. They can be used to capture the essentialorder information without overfitting the data: they form a useful concept class between totalorders and arbitrary partial orders. We address the question of finding a bucket order for aset of items; given pairwise precedence information between the items. We also discussmethods for computing the pairwise precedence data. We describe simple and efficientalgorithms for finding good bucket orders. Several of the algorithms have a provableapproximation guarantee; and they scale well to large datasets.

In this paper; we consider the problem of adding a small number ofghost edges in the network in order to minimize the average shortest-path distance betweennodes; towards a smaller-world network. We formalize the problem of suggesting ghostedges and we propose a novel method for quickly evaluating the importance of ghost edgesin sparse graphs. Through experiments on real and synthetic data sets; we demonstrate thatour approach performs very well; for a varying range of conditions; and it outperformssensible baselines.,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,27
Searching the wikipedia with contextual information,Antti Ukkonen; Carlos Castillo; Debora Donato; Aristides Gionis,Abstract We propose a framework for searching the Wikipedia with contextual information.Our framework extends the typical keyword search; by considering queries of the type (q; p);where q is a set of terms (as in classical Web search); and p is a source Wikipediadocument. The query terms q represent the information that the user is interested in finding;and the document p provides the context of the query. The task is to rank other documents inWikipedia with respect to their relevance to the query terms q given the context document p.By associating a context to the query terms; the search results of a search initiated in aparticular page can be made more relevant. We suggest a number of features that extendthe classical query-search model so that the context document p is considered. We then useRankSVM (Joachims 2002) to learn weights for the individual features given suitably …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2008,27
Overlapping community detection in labeled graphs,Esther Galbrun; Aristides Gionis; Nikolaj Tatti,Abstract We present a new approach for the problem of finding overlapping communities ingraphs and social networks. Our approach consists of a novel problem definition and threeaccompanying algorithms. We are particularly interested in graphs that have labels on theirvertices; although our methods are also applicable to graphs with no labels. Our goal is tofind k communities so that the total edge density over all k communities is maximized. In thecase of labeled graphs; we require that each community is succinctly described by a set oflabels. This requirement provides a better understanding for the discovered communities.The proposed problem formulation leads to the discovery of vertex-overlapping and densecommunities that cover as many graph edges as possible. We capture these properties witha simple objective function; which we solve by adapting efficient approximation …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2014,26

Where Is the Soho of Rome? Measures and Algorithms for Finding Similar Neighborhoods in Cities.,Géraud Le Falher; Aristides Gionis; Michael Mathioudakis,Abstract Data generated on location-aware social media provide rich information about theplaces (shopping malls; restaurants; cafés; etc) where citizens spend their time. Thatinformation can; in turn; be used to describe city neighborhoods in terms of the activity thattakes place therein. For example; the data might reveal that citizens visit one neighborhoodmainly for shopping; while another for its dining venues. In this paper; we present amethodology to analyze such data; describe neighborhoods in terms of the activity they host;and discover similar neighborhoods across cities. Using millions of Foursquare check-insfrom cities in Europe and the US; we conduct an extensive study on features and measuresthat can be used to quantify similarity of city neighborhoods.

Optimal segmentation using tree models,Robert Gwadera; Aristides Gionis; Heikki Mannila,Sequence data are abundant in application areas such as computational biology;environmental sciences; and telecommunication. Many real-life sequences have a strongsegmental structure; with segments of different complexities. In this paper we study thedescription of sequence segments using variable length Markov chains (VLMCs); alsoknown as tree models. We discover the segment boundaries of a sequence and at the sametime we obtain a VLMC for each segment. Such a context tree contains the probabilitydistribution vectors that capture the essential features of the corresponding segment. We usethe Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and the Krichevsky-Trofimov probability (KT) toselect the number of segments of a sequence. On DNA data the method selects segmentsthat closely correspond to the annotated regions of the genes.,Data Mining; 2006. ICDM'06. Sixth International Conference on,2006,24

Examples ofvariables for which such orders exist include terms in documents; courses in enrollmentdata; and paleontological sites in fossil data collections. The observations in suchapplications are flat; unordered sets; however; the data sets respect the underlying orderingof the variables. By this we mean that if A &pr; B &pr; C are three variables respecting theunderlying ordering &pr;; and both of variables A and C appear in an observation; then; upto noise levels; variable B also appears in this observation. Similarly; if A 1 &pr; A 2 &pr;…&pr; A l-1 &pr; A i is a longer sequence of variables; we do not expect to see many …,Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2003,23
Models and algorithms for network immunization,George Giakkoupis; Aristides Gionis; Evimaria Terzi; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Recently; there has been significant research activity in the algorithmic analysis ofcomplex networks; such as social networks; or information networks. A problem of greatpractical importance is that of network immunization against virus spread. Given a network; avirus-propagation model; and an immunization cost function; we are interested in containingthe spread of the virus while minimizing the immunization cost. In this paper; we considertwo viruspropagation models and we propose immunization algorithms for each model. Theexperimental evaluation shows that our algorithms perform well on both synthetic and realgraphs. Furthermore; it reveals the following interesting facts (a) the simple heuristic ofimmunizing the nodes with the highest degree is not optimal; and (b) our algorithms performsignificantly better in small-world networks.,Technical Report; Technical Report C-2005-75,2005,22
Diverse query recommendations using clustering-based methodology,*,A computer-implemented method provides suggested search queries based on an inputsearch query. The input search query is received. A first list of documents is determined thatcorrespond to processing the query by a search engine determining the list of result queries;including processing the first list of documents to determine clusters of documents anddetermining potential queries that correspond to the determined clusters by comparingresults of the potential queries with documents in the determined clusters. A list of resultqueries is determined; wherein executing the list of result queries would correspond to asecond list of documents; that result from presenting the result queries to the search engine;and the documents of the second list of documents cover the documents of the first list ofdocuments.

Document descriptor extraction method,*,The present invention discloses a document descriptor extraction method and system. Thedocument descriptor extraction method and system creates a document descriptor bygeneralizing input sequences within a document; factoring the input sequences andgeneralized input sequences; and selecting a document descriptor from the inputsequences; generalized sequences; and factored sequences; preferably using minimumdescriptor length (MDL) principles. Novel algorithms are employed to perform thegeneralizing; factoring; and selecting.,*,2006,20
Parameter-free spatial data mining using MDL,Spiros Papadimitriou; Aristides Gionis; Panayiotis Tsaparas; Risto A Vaisanen; Heikki Mannila; Christos Faloutsos,Consider spatial data consisting of a set of binary features taking values over a collection ofspatial extents (grid cells). We propose a method that simultaneously finds spatialcorrelation and feature co-occurrence patterns; without any parameters. In particular; weemploy the minimum description length (MDL) principle coupled with a natural way ofcompressing regions. This defines what" good" means: a feature co-occurrence pattern isgood; if it helps us better compress the set of locations for these features. Conversely; aspatial correlation is good; if it helps us better compress the set of features in thecorresponding region. Our approach is scalable for large datasets (both number of locationsand of features). We evaluate our method on both real and synthetic datasets.,Data Mining; Fifth IEEE International Conference on,2005,20
Learning to question: leveraging user preferences for shopping advice,Mahashweta Das; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis; Ingmar Weber,Abstract We present ShoppingAdvisor; a novel recommender system that helps users inshopping for technical products. ShoppingAdvisor leverages both user preferences andtechnical product attributes in order to generate its suggestions. The system elicits userpreferences via a tree-shaped flowchart; where each node is a question to the user. At eachnode; ShoppingAdvisor suggests a ranking of products matching the preferences of theuser; and that gets progressively refined along the path from the tree's root to one of its leafs.In this paper we show (i) how to learn the structure of the tree; ie; which questions to ask ateach node; and (ii) how to produce a suitable ranking at each node. First; we adapt theclassical top-down strategy for building decision trees in order to find the best user attributeto ask at each node. Differently from decision trees; ShoppingAdvisor partitions the user …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2013,19

Dr. searcher and mr. browser: a unified hyperlink-click graph,Barbara Poblete; Carlos Castillo; Aristides Gionis,Abstract We introduce a unified graph representation of the Web; which includes bothstructural and usage information. We model this graph using a simple union of the Web'shyperlink and click graphs. The hyperlink graph expresses link structure among Web pages;while the click graph is a bipartite graph of queries and documents denoting users'searching behavior extracted from a search engine's query log. Our most importantmotivation is to model in a unified way the two main activities of users on the Web: searchingand browsing; and at the same time to analyze the effects of random walks on this newgraph. The intuition behind this task is to measure how the combination of link structure andusage data provide additional information to that contained in these structuresindependently.,Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2008,18
Unimodal segmentation of sequences,Niina Haiminen; Aristides Gionis,We study the problem of segmenting a sequence into k pieces so that the resultingsegmentation satisfies monotonicity or unimodality constraints. Unimodal functions can beused to model phenomena in which a measured variable first increases to a certain leveland then decreases. We combine a well-known unimodal regression algorithm with a simpledynamic-programming approach to obtain an optimal quadratic-time algorithm for theproblem of unimodal k-segmentation. In addition; we describe a more efficient greedy-merging heuristic that is experimentally shown to give solutions very close to the optimal. Asa concrete application of our algorithms; we describe two methods for testing if a sequencebehaves unimodally or not. Our experimental evaluation shows that our algorithms and theproposed unimodality tests give very intuitive results.,Data Mining; 2004. ICDM'04. Fourth IEEE International Conference on,2004,18
Method of detecting spam hosts based on clustering the host graph,*,Systems and methods for identifying spam hosts are disclosed in which hosts are known tothe system and initially classified as spam or non-spam. Then the hosts are partitioned intoclusters based on how each host is linked to other hosts. Each cluster is then analyzed and;depending on the number of spam and non-spam hosts it contains; the cluster may beclassified as a spam cluster or a non-spam cluster. The hosts within the cluster may then bereclassified based on the cluster's classification. The results may then be used in manydifferent ways including to filter search results based on host classifications so that spamhosts are not displayed or displayed last in a results set.,*,2009,17
Discovering dynamic communities in interaction networks,Polina Rozenshtein; Nikolaj Tatti; Aristides Gionis,Abstract Online social networks are often defined by considering interactions over large timeintervals; eg; consider pairs of individuals who have called each other at least once in amobilie-operator network; or users who have made a conversation in a social-media site.Although such a definition can be valuable in many graph-mining tasks; it suffers from asevere limitation: it neglects the precise time that the interaction between network nodesoccurs. In this paper we study interaction networks; where one considers not only the social-network topology; but also the exact time that nodes interact. In an interaction network anedge is associated with a time stamp; and multiple edges may occur for the same pair ofnodes. Consequently; interaction networks offer a more fine-grained representation that canbe used to reveal otherwise hidden dynamic phenomena in the network. We consider the …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2014,16
Piggybacking on social networks,Aristides Gionis; Flavio Junqueira; Vincent Leroy; Marco Serafini; Ingmar Weber,Abstract The popularity of social-networking sites has increased rapidly over the lastdecade. A basic functionalities of social-networking sites is to present users with streams ofevents shared by their friends. At a systems level; materialized per-user views are a commonway to assemble and deliver such event streams on-line and with low latency. Access to thedata stores; which keep the user views; is a major bottleneck of social-networking systems.We propose to improve the throughput of these systems by using social piggybacking; whichconsists of processing the requests of two friends by querying and updating the view of athird common friend. By using one such hub view; the system can serve requests of the firstfriend without querying or updating the view of the second. We show that; given a socialgraph; social piggybacking can minimize the overall number of requests; but computing …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,15
Distance oracles in edge-labeled graphs.,Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis; Francesco Gullo; Antti Ukkonen,ABSTRACT A fundamental operation over edge-labeled graphs is the computation ofshortest-path distances subject to a constraint on the set of permissible edge labels.Applying exact algorithms for such an operation is not a viable option; especially for massivegraphs; or in scenarios where the distance computation is used as a primitive for morecomplex computations. In this paper we study the problem of efficient approximation ofshortest-path queries with edge-label constraints; for which we devise two indexes based onthe idea of landmarks: distances from all vertices of the graph to a selected subset oflandmark vertices are pre-computed and then used at query time to efficiently approximatedistance queries. The major challenge to face is that; in principle; an exponential number ofconstraint label sets needs to be stored for each vertex-landmark pair; which makes the …,EDBT,2014,14

System and method for caching posting lists,*,A method of caching posting lists to a search engine cache calculates the ratios between thefrequencies of the query terms in a past query log and the sizes of the posting lists for eachterm; and uses these ratios to determine which posting lists should be cached by sorting theratios in decreasing order and storing to the cache those posting lists corresponding to thehighest ratio values. Further; a method of finding an optimal allocation between two parts ofa search engine cache evaluates a past query stream based on a relationship betweenvarious properties of the stream and the total size of the cache; and uses this information todetermine the respective sizes of both parts of the cache.,*,2011,13

Dtd inference from xml documents: The xtract approach,Minos Garofalakis; Aristides Gionis; Rajeev Rastogi; S Seshadri; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract XML is rapidly emerging as the new standard for data representation and exchangeon the Web. Document Type Descriptors (DTDs) contain valuable information on thestructure of XML documents and thus have a crucial role in the efficient storage andquerying of XML data. Despite their importance; however; DTDs are not mandatory; and it isquite possible for documents in XML databases to not have accompanying DTDs. In thispaper; we present an overview of XTRACT; a novel system for inferring a DTD schema for adatabase of XML documents. Since the DTD syntax incorporates the full expressive power ofregular expressions; naive approaches typically fail to produce concise and intuitive DTDs.Instead; the XTRACT inference algorithms employ a sequence of sophisticated steps thatinvolve:(1) finding patterns in the input sequences and replacing them with regular …,IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin,2003,13
Dopelearning: A computational approach to rap lyrics generation,Eric Malmi; Pyry Takala; Hannu Toivonen; Tapani Raiko; Aristides Gionis,Abstract Writing rap lyrics requires both creativity to construct a meaningful; interesting storyand lyrical skills to produce complex rhyme patterns; which form the cornerstone of goodflow. We present a rap lyrics generation method that captures both of these aspects. First; wedevelop a prediction model to identify the next line of existing lyrics from a set of candidatenext lines. This model is based on two machine-learning techniques: the RankSVMalgorithm and a deep neural network model with a novel structure. Results show that theprediction model can identify the true next line among 299 randomly selected lines with anaccuracy of 17%; ie; over 50 times more likely than by random. Second; we employ theprediction model to combine lines from existing songs; producing lyrics with rhyme and ameaning.

Activity preserving graph simplification,Francesco Bonchi; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis; Antti Ukkonen,Abstract We study the problem of simplifying a given directed graph by keeping a smallsubset of its arcs. Our goal is to maintain the connectivity required to explain a set ofobserved traces of information propagation across the graph. Unlike previous work; we donot make any assumption about an underlying model of information propagation. Instead;we approach the task as a combinatorial problem. We prove that the resulting optimizationproblem is NP NP-hard. We show that a standard greedy algorithm performs very well inpractice; even though it does not have theoretical guarantees. Additionally; if the activitytraces have a tree structure; we show that the objective function is supermodular; andexperimentally verify that the approach for size-constrained submodular minimizationrecently proposed by Nagano et al.(28th International Conference on Machine Learning …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2013,12
The early-adopter graph and its application to web-page recommendation,Ida Mele; Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis,Abstract In this paper we present a novel graph-based data abstraction for modeling thebrowsing behavior of web users. The objective is to identify users who discover interestingpages before others. We call these users early adopters. By tracking the browsing activity ofearly adopters we can identify new interesting pages early; and recommend these pages tosimilar users. We focus on news and blog pages; which are more dynamic in nature andmore appropriate for recommendation. Our proposed model is called early-adopter graph. Inthis graph; nodes represent users and a directed arc between users u and v expresses thefact that u and v visit similar pages and; in particular; that user u tends to visit those pagesbefore user v. The weight of the edge is the degree to which the temporal rule" v visits apage before v" holds.,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,12
System and methodology for a multi-site search engine,*,Techniques for query processing in a multi-site search engine are described.

During a propagation phase; all sitesexchange their site-specific upper bound ranking scores with each other. In response to asite receiving a query; the site determines the set of locally matching resources andcompares the ranking score of a locally matching resource with the site-specific upperbound ranking scores for the terms of the query that were received during the propagationphase and determines whether to communicate the query to other sites.

A shapley value approach for influence attribution,Panagiotis Papapetrou; Aristides Gionis; Heikki Mannila,Abstract Finding who and what is “important” is an ever-occurring question. Many methodsthat aim at characterizing important items or influential individuals have been developed inareas such as; bibliometrics; social-network analysis; link analysis; and web search. In thispaper we study the problem of attributing influence scores to individuals who accomplishtasks in a collaborative manner. We assume that individuals build small teams; in differentand diverse ways; in order to accomplish atomic tasks. For each task we are given anassessment of success or importance score; and the goal is to attribute those team-wisescores to the individuals. The challenge we face is that individuals in strong coalitions arefavored against individuals in weaker coalitions; so the objective is to find fair attributionsthat account for such biasing.

Evaluating query result significance in databases via randomizations,Markus Ojala; Gemma C Garriga; Aristides Gionis; Heikki Mannila,Abstract Many sorts of structured data are commonly stored in a multi-relational format ofinterrelated tables. Under this relational model; exploratory data analysis can be done byusing relational queries. As an example; in the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) a query canbe used to check whether the average rank of action movies is higher than the average rankof drama movies. We consider the problem of assessing whether the results returned bysuch a query are statistically significant or just a random artifact of the structure in the data.Our approach is based on randomizing the tables occurring in the queries and repeating theoriginal query on the randomized tables. It turns out that there is no unique way ofrandomizing in multi-relational data.

Taxonomy-driven lumping for sequence mining,Francesco Bonchi; Carlos Castillo; Debora Donato; Aristides Gionis,Abstract Given a taxonomy of events and a dataset of sequences of these events; we studythe problem of finding efficient and effective ways to produce a compact representation ofthe sequences. We model sequences with Markov models whose states correspond tonodes in the provided taxonomy; and each state represents the events in the subtree underthe corresponding node. By lumping observed events to states that correspond to internalnodes in the taxonomy; we allow more compact models that are easier to understand andvisualize; at the expense of a decrease in the data likelihood. We formally define andcharacterize our problem; and we propose a scalable search method for finding a goodtrade-off between two conflicting goals: maximizing the data likelihood; and minimizing themodel complexity.

Mining chains of relations,Foto Aftrati; Gautam Das; Aristides Gionis; Heikki Mannila; Taneli Mielikäinen; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Traditional data mining methods consider the problem of mining a single relationthat relates two different attributes. For example; in a scientific bibliography database;authors are related to papers; and we may be interested in discovering association rulesbetween authors based on the papers that they have co-authored. However; in real life it isoften the case that we have multiple attributes related through chains of relations. Forexample; authors write papers; and papers belong to one or more topics; defining a three-level chain of relations. In this paper we consider the problem of mining such relationalchains. We formulate a generic problem of finding selector sets (subsets of objects from oneof the attributes) such that the projected dataset—the part of the dataset determined by theselector set—satisfies a specific property.

Query-log mining for detecting polysemy and spam,Carlos Castillo; Claudio Corsi; Debora Donato; Paolo Ferragina; Aristides Gionis,Abstract. Through their interaction with search engines; users provide implicit feedback thatcan be used to extract useful knowledge and improve the quality of the search process. Thisfeedback is encoded in the form of a query log that consists of a sequence of search actions;which contain information about submitted queries; documents viewed; and documentsclicked by the users. In this paper; we propose characterizing documents and queries via theinformation available within a query log; with the goal of detecting either query polysemy orspam-hosts and spam-queries; ie; queries that shown the undesirable property of showing ahigher rate of spam pages in their list of results than other queries.

Bump hunting in the dark: Local discrepancy maximization on graphs,Aristides Gionis; Michael Mathioudakis; Antti Ukkonen,We study the problem of discrepancy maximization on graphs: given a set of nodes Q of anunderlying graph G; we aim to identify a connected subgraph of G that contains many morenodes from Q than other nodes. This variant of the discrepancy maximization problemextends the well-known notion of “bump hunting” in the Euclidean space [1]. We considerthe problem under two access models. In the unrestricted-access model; the whole graph Gis given as input; while in the local-access model we can only retrieve the neighbors of agiven node in G using a possibly slow and costly interface. We prove that the basic problemof discrepancy maximization on graphs is NP-hard; and empirically evaluate theperformance of four heuristics for solving it. For the local-access model; we consider threedifferent algorithms that aim to recover a part of G large enough to contain an optimal …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2017,9
Streaming similarity self-join,Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis,Abstract We introduce and study the problem of computing the similarity self-join in astreaming context (SSSJ); where the input is an unbounded stream of items arrivingcontinuously. The goal is to find all pairs of items in the stream whose similarity is greaterthan a given threshold. The simplest formulation of the problem requires unboundedmemory; and thus; it is intractable. To make the problem feasible; we introduce the notion oftime-dependent similarity: the similarity of two items decreases with the difference in theirarrival time. By leveraging the properties of this time-dependent similarity function; wedesign two algorithmic frameworks to solve the SSSJ problem. The first one; MiniBatch (MB);uses existing index-based filtering techniques for the static version of the problem; andcombines them in a pipeline.

Density-friendly graph decomposition,Nikolaj Tatti; Aristides Gionis,Abstract Decomposing a graph into a hierarchical structure via k-core analysis is a standardoperation in any modern graph-mining toolkit. k-core decomposition is a simple and efficientmethod that allows to analyze a graph beyond its mere degree distribution. Morespecifically; it is used to identify areas in the graph of increasing centrality andconnectedness; and it allows to reveal the structural organization of the graph. Despite thefact that k-core analysis relies on vertex degrees; k-cores do not satisfy a certain; rathernatural; density property. Simply put; the most central k-core is not necessarily the densestsubgraph. This inconsistency between k-cores and graph density provides the basis of ourstudy.,Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web,2015,9
Discovering nested communities,Nikolaj Tatti; Aristides Gionis,Abstract Finding communities in graphs is one of the most well-studied problems in datamining and social-network analysis. In many real applications; the underlying graph doesnot have a clear community structure. In those cases; selecting a single community turns outto be a fairly ill-posed problem; as the optimization criterion has to make a difficult choicebetween selecting a tight but small community or a more inclusive but sparser community. Inorder to avoid the problem of selecting only a single community we propose discovering asequence of nested communities. More formally; given a graph and a starting set; our goal isto discover a sequence of communities all containing the starting set; and each communityforming a denser subgraph than the next. Discovering an optimal sequence of communitiesis a complex optimization problem; and hence we divide it into two subproblems: 1) …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2013,9
Active learning to rank using pairwise supervision,Buyue Qian; Hongfei Li; Jun Wang; Xiang Wang; Ian Davidson,Abstract This paper investigates learning a ranking function using pairwise constraints in thecontext of human-machine interaction. As the performance of a learnt ranking model ispredominantly determined by the quality and quantity of training data; in this work weexplore an active learning to rank approach. Furthermore; since humans may not be able toconfidently provide an order for a pair of similar instances we explore two types of pairwisesupervision:(i) a set of “strongly” ordered pairs which contains confidently ranked instances;and (ii) a set of “weakly” ordered pairs which consists of similar or closely ranked instances.Our active knowledge injection is performed by querying domain experts on pairwiseorderings; where informative pairs are located by considering both local and globaluncertainties.

Estimating entity importance via counting set covers,Aristides Gionis; Theodoros Lappas; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract The data-mining literature is rich in problems asking to assess the importance ofentities in a given dataset. At a high level; existing work identifies important entities either byranking or by selection. Ranking methods assign a score to every entity in the population;and then use the assigned scores to create a ranked list. The major shortcoming of suchapproaches is that they ignore the redundancy between high-ranked entities; which may infact be very similar or even identical. Therefore; in scenarios where diversity is desirable;such methods perform poorly. Selection methods overcome this drawback by evaluating theimportance of a group of entities collectively. To achieve this; they typically adopt a set-coverformulation; which identifies the entities in the minimum set cover as the important ones.However; this dichotomy of entities conceals the fact that; even though an entity may not …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2012,9
System and method for identifying spam hosts using stacked graphical learning,*,Systems and methods for identifying spam hosts are disclosed in which hosts known to thesystem and initially classified as spam or non-spam by a baseline classifier. Then for eachnode u in the host graph a new feature is computed. This feature is an aggregate function ofthe initial classifications produced by the baseline classifier for the neighbors of the node u.The set of neighbors can be defined in many different ways: in-link neighbors; out-linkneighbors; bi-directional neighbors; k-hops neighbors; etc. The new feature computedabove then is added to the existing set of features; and the baseline classifier is trainedagain; producing new predictions for each node.

In many ofthese areas the sequences involved are multidimensional; and the goal of the segmentationis to discover sequence segments with small variability. One of the characteristics of existingtechniques is that they force all dimensions to share the same segment boundaries; yet; it isoften reasonable to assume that different dimensions are more correlated than others; andthat concrete and meaningful states are associated only with a subset of dimensions. In thispaper we study the problem of segmenting a multidimensional sequence when thedimensions of the sequence are allowed to form clusters and be segmented separately …,3rd Workshop on Mining Temporal and Sequential Data (TDM),2004,9
Reconstructing an epidemic over time,Polina Rozenshtein; Aristides Gionis; B Aditya Prakash; Jilles Vreeken,Abstract We consider the problem of reconstructing an epidemic over time; or; more general;reconstructing the propagation of an activity in a network. Our input consists of a temporalnetwork; which contains information about when two nodes interacted; and a sample ofnodes that have been reported as infected. The goal is to recover the flow of the spread;including discovering the starting nodes; and identifying other likely-infected nodes that arenot reported. The problem we consider has multiple applications; from public health to socialmedia and viral marketing purposes. Previous work explicitly factor-in many unrealisticassumptions: it is assumed that (a) the underlying network does not change;(b) we haveaccess to perfect noise-free data; or (c) we know the exact propagation model. In contrast;we avoid these simplifications: we take into account the temporal network; we require …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2016,8
Absorbing random-walk centrality: Theory and algorithms,Charalampos Mavroforakis; Michael Mathioudakis; Aristides Gionis,We study a new notion of graph centrality based on absorbing random walks. Given a graphG=(V; E) and a set of query nodes Q⊆ V; we aim to identify the k most central nodes in Gwith respect to Q. Specifically; we consider central nodes to be absorbing for random walksthat start at the query nodes Q. The goal is to find the set of k central nodes that minimizesthe expected length of a random walk until absorption. The proposed measure; which wecall k absorbing random-walk centrality; favors diverse sets; as it is beneficial to place the kabsorbing nodes in different parts of the graph so as to “intercept” random walks that startfrom different query nodes. Although similar problem definitions have been considered inthe literature; eg; in information-retrieval settings where the goal is to diversify web-searchresults; in this paper we study the problem formally and prove some of its properties. We …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,8
Scalable facility location for massive graphs on pregel-like systems,Kiran Garimella; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis; Mauro Sozio,Abstract We propose a new scalable algorithm for the facility-location problem. We study thegraph setting; where the cost of serving a client from a facility is represented by the shortest-path distance on a graph. This setting is applicable to various problems arising in the Weband social media; and allows to leverage the inherent sparsity of such graphs.,Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2015,8
Taxonomy-driven lumping for sequence mining,*,Methods and apparatus are described for modeling sequences of events with Markovmodels whose states correspond to nodes in a provided taxonomy. Each state representsthe events in the subtree under the corresponding node. By lumping observed events intostates that correspond to internal nodes in the taxonomy; more compact models areachieved that are easier to understand and visualize; at the expense of a decrease in thedata likelihood. The decision for selecting the best model is taken on the basis of twocompeting goals: maximizing the data likelihood; while minimizing the model complexity (ie;the number of states).,*,2013,8
Algorithms for unimodal segmentation with applications to unimodality detection,Niina Haiminen; Aristides Gionis; Kari Laasonen,Abstract We study the problem of segmenting a sequence into k pieces so that the resultingsegmentation satisfies monotonicity or unimodality constraints. Unimodal functions can beused to model phenomena in which a measured variable first increases to a certain leveland then decreases. We combine a well-known unimodal regression algorithm with a simpledynamic-programming approach to obtain an optimal quadratic-time algorithm for theproblem of unimodal k-segmentation. In addition; we describe a more efficient greedy-merging heuristic that is experimentally shown to give solutions very close to the optimal. Asa concrete application of our algorithms; we describe methods for testing if a sequencebehaves unimodally or not. The methods include segmentation error comparisons;permutation testing; and a BIC-based scoring scheme. Our experimental evaluation …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2008,8
k-Anonymization with minimal loss of information,Aristides Gionis; Tamir Tassa,Abstract The technique of k-anonymization allows the releasing of databases that containpersonal information while ensuring some degree of individual privacy. Anonymization isusually performed by generalizing database entries. We formally study the concept ofgeneralization; and propose two information-theoretic measures for capturing the amount ofinformation that is lost during the anonymization process. Those measures are more generaland more accurate than those proposed in [19] and [1]. We study the problem of achieving k-anonymity with minimal loss of information. We prove that it is NP-hard and study polynomialapproximations for the optimal solution. Our first algorithm gives an approximationguarantee of O (ln k)–an improvement over the best-known O (k)-approximation of [1]. As therunning time of the algorithm is O (n 2 k); we also show how to adapt the algorithm of [1] in …,European Symposium on Algorithms,2007,8
Recurrent predictive models for sequence segmentation,Saara Hyvönen; Aristides Gionis; Heikki Mannila,Abstract Many sequential data sets have a segmental structure; and similar types ofsegments occur repeatedly. We consider sequences where the underlying phenomenon ofinterest is governed by a small set of models that change over time. Potential examples ofsuch data are environmental; genomic; and economic sequences. Given a target sequenceand a (possibly multivariate) sequence of observation values; we consider the problem offinding a small collection of models that can be used to explain the target phenomenon in apiecewise fashion using the observation values. We assume the same model will be usedfor multiple segments. We give an algorithm for this task based on first segmenting thesequence using dynamic programming; and then using k-median or facility locationtechniques to find the optimal set of models. We report on some experimental results.,International Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis,2007,8

A kernel-learning approach to semi-supervised clustering with relative distance comparisons,Ehsan Amid; Aristides Gionis; Antti Ukkonen,Abstract We consider the problem of clustering a given dataset into k clusters subject to anadditional set of constraints on relative distance comparisons between the data items. Theadditional constraints are meant to reflect side-information that is not expressed in thefeature vectors; directly. Relative comparisons can express structures at finer level of detailthan must-link (ML) and cannot-link (CL) constraints that are commonly used for semi-supervised clustering. Relative comparisons are particularly useful in settings where givingan ML or a CL constraint is difficult because the granularity of the true clustering is unknown.Our main contribution is an efficient algorithm for learning a kernel matrix using the logdeterminant divergence (a variant of the Bregman divergence) subject to a set of relativedistance constraints. Given the learned kernel matrix; a clustering can be obtained by any …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2015,7

Top-k overlapping densest subgraphs,Esther Galbrun; Aristides Gionis; Nikolaj Tatti,Abstract Finding dense subgraphs is an important problem in graph mining and has manypractical applications. At the same time; while large real-world networks are known to havemany communities that are not well-separated; the majority of the existing work focuses onthe problem of finding a single densest subgraph. Hence; it is natural to consider thequestion of finding the top-k densest subgraphs. One major challenge in addressing thisquestion is how to handle overlaps: eliminating overlaps completely is one option; but thismay lead to extracting subgraphs not as dense as it would be possible by allowing a limitedamount of overlap. Furthermore; overlaps are desirable as in most real-world graphs thereare vertices that belong to more than one community; and thus; to more than one densestsubgraph. In this paper we study the problem of finding top-k overlapping densest …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2016,6
Exploring controversy in twitter,Kiran Garimella; Michael Mathioudakis; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis,Abstract Among the topics discussed on social media; some spark more heated debate thanothers. For example; experience suggests that major political events; such as a vote forhealthcare law in the US; would spark more debate be-tween opposing sides than otherevents; such as a concert of a popular music band. Exploring the topics of discussion onTwitter and understanding which ones are controver-sial is extremely useful for a variety ofpurposes; such as for journalists to understand what issues divide the public; or for socialscientists to understand how controversy is manifested in social interactions.,Proceedings of the 19th ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing Companion,2016,6
Maintaining sliding-window neighborhood profiles in interaction networks,Rohit Kumar; Toon Calders; Aristides Gionis; Nikolaj Tatti,Abstract Large networks are being generated by applications that keep track of relationshipsbetween different data entities. Examples include online social networks recordinginteractions between individuals; sensor networks logging information exchanges betweensensors; and more. There is a large body of literature on computing exact or approximateproperties on large networks; although most methods assume static networks. On the otherhand; in most modern real-world applications; networks are highly dynamic and continuousinteractions along existing connections are generated. Furthermore; it is desirable toconsider that old edges become less important; and their contribution to the current view ofthe network diminishes over time. We study the problem of maintaining the neighborhoodprofile of each node in an interaction network. Maintaining such a profile has applications …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2015,6

The ebb and flow of controversial debates on social media,Kiran Garimella; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis; Michael Mathioudakis,Abstract: We explore how the polarization around controversial topics evolves on Twitter-over a long period of time (2011 to 2016); and also as a response to major external eventsthat lead to increased related activity. We find that increased activity is typically associatedwith increased polarization; however; we find no consistent long-term trend in polarizationover time among the topics we study.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.05994,2017,5
Subsequence search in event-interval sequences,Orestis Kostakis Kostakis; Aristides Gionis Gionis,Abstract We study the problem of subsequence search in databases of event-intervalsequences; or e-sequences. In contrast to sequences of instantaneous events; e-sequencescontain events that have a duration. In Information Retrieval applications; e-sequences areused for American Sign Language. We show that the subsequence-search problem is NP-hard and provide an exact (worst-case exponential) algorithm. We extend our algorithm tohandle different cases of subsequence matching with errors. We then propose the RelationIndex; a scheme for speeding up exact retrieval; which we benchmark against severalindexing schemes.,Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,2015,5
Confidence bands for time series data,Jussi Korpela; Kai Puolamäki; Aristides Gionis,Abstract Simultaneous confidence intervals; or confidence bands; provide an intuitivedescription of the variability of a time series. Given a set of NN time series of length MM; weconsider the problem of finding a confidence band that contains a (1-α)(1-α)-fraction of theobservations. We construct such confidence bands by finding the set of N\!\!-\!\! K NK timeseries whose envelope is minimized. We refer to this problem as the minimum widthenvelope problem. We show that the minimum width envelope problem is NP NP-hard; andwe develop a greedy heuristic algorithm; which we compare to quantile-and distance-basedconfidence band methods. We also describe a method to find an effective confidence level α_ eff α eff and an effective number of observations to remove K_ eff K eff; such that theresulting confidence bands will keep the family-wise error rate below α α.

Network graph evolution rule generation,*,A network's evolution is characterized by graph evolution rules. A graph; formed by mergingmultiple graphs representing the multiple snapshots of the network; that represents anevolutionary network is mined to identify evolutional patterns of the network. A pattern isselected from the identified patterns. Graph evolution rules are generated using identifiedevolutional patterns. The generated graph evolution rules represent the evolutional patternsof the network; the rules indicating that any occurrence of a child pattern of the selectedpattern implies a corresponding occurrence of the selected pattern.,*,2012,5

Structured prediction of network response,Hongyu Su; Aristides Gionis; Juho Rousu,Abstract We introduce the following network response problem: given a complex networkand an action; predict the subnetwork that responds to action; that is; which nodes performthe action and which directed edges relay the action to the adjacent nodes. We approachthe problem through max-margin structured learning; in which a compatibility score islearned between the actions and their activated subnetworks. Thus; unlike the most popularinfluence network approaches; our method; called SPIN; is context-sensitive; namely; thepresence; the direction and the dynamics of influences depend on the properties of theactions. The inference problems of finding the highest scoring as well as the worst marginviolating networks; are proven to be NP-hard. To solve the problems; we present anapproximate inference method through a semi-definite programming relaxation (SDP); as …,International Conference on Machine Learning,2014,4
Factors in recommending contrarian content on social media,Kiran Garimella; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis; Michael Mathioudakis,Abstract Polarization is a troubling phenomenon that can lead to societal divisions and hurtthe democratic process. It is therefore important to develop methods to reduce it. Wepropose an algorithmic solution to the problem of reducing polarization. The core idea is toexpose users to content that challenges their point of view; with the hope broadening theirperspective; and thus reduce their polarity. Our method takes into account several aspects ofthe problem; such as the estimated polarity of the user; the probability of accepting therecommendation; the polarity of the content; and popularity of the content beingrecommended.,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Web Science Conference,2017,3
A motif-based approach for identifying controversy,Mauro Coletto; Kiran Garimella; Aristides Gionis; Claudio Lucchese,Abstract: Among the topics discussed in Social Media; some lead to controversy. A numberof recent studies have focused on the problem of identifying controversy in social mediamostly based on the analysis of textual content or rely on global network structure. Suchapproaches have strong limitations due to the difficulty of understanding natural language;and of investigating the global network structure. In this work we show that it is possible todetect controversy in social media by exploiting network motifs; ie; local patterns of userinteraction. The proposed approach allows for a language-independent and fine-grainedand efficient-to-compute analysis of user discussions and their evolution over time. Thesupervised model exploiting motif patterns can achieve 85% accuracy; with an improvementof 7% compared to baseline structural; propagation-based and temporal network features …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.05053,2017,3
System and method of matching content items and consumers,*,A matching between content items and consumers is discloses. More particularly; items andconsumers are matched using a matching approach that uses capacity constraintsassociated with each consumer; capacity constraints associated with each item; andrelationship weights; each relationship weight representing a similarity between a consumerand an item. Edges representing the relationships between consumers and items can beselected using an iterative selection that includes a matching approach that permits capacityconstraints. Alternatively; edges can be selected using an iterative approach that allows asolution to be identified prior to completion of the selection processing.,*,2014,3

Segmentations with rearrangements,Aristides Gionis; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Sequence segmentation is a central problem in the analysis of sequential and time-series data. In this paper we introduce and we study a novel variation to the segmentationproblem: in addition to partitioning the sequence we also seek to apply a limited amount ofreordering; so that the overall representation error is minimized. Our problem formulationhas applications in segmenting data collected from a sensor network where some of thesensors might be slightly out of sync; or in the analysis of newsfeed data where news reportson a few different topics are arriving in an interleaved manner. We formulate the problem ofsegmentation with rearrangements and we show that it is an NP-hard problem to solve oreven approximate. We then proceed to devise effective algorithms for the proposed problem;combining ideas from linear programming; dynamic programming; and outlier-detection …,*,2007,3
Active network alignment: a matching-based approach,Eric Malmi; Aristides Gionis; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Network alignment is the problem of matching the nodes of two graphs; maximizingthe similarity of the matched nodes and the edges between them. This problem isencountered in a wide array of applications---from biological networks to social networks toontologies---where multiple networked data sources need to be integrated. Due to thedifficulty of the task; an accurate alignment can rarely be found without human assistance.Thus; it is of great practical importance to develop network alignment algorithms that canoptimally leverage experts who are able to provide the correct alignment for a small numberof nodes. Yet; only a handful of existing works address this active network alignment setting.The majority of the existing active methods focus on absolute queries (" are nodes a and bthe same or not?"); whereas we argue that it is generally easier for a human expert to …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2017,2
Temporal pagerank,Polina Rozenshtein; Aristides Gionis,Abstract PageRank is one of the most popular measures for ranking the nodes of a networkaccording to their importance. However; PageRank is defined as a steady state of a randomwalk; which implies that the underlying network needs to be fixed and static. Thus; to extendPageRank to networks with a temporal dimension; the available temporal information has tobe judiciously incorporated into the model. Although numerous recent works study theproblem of computing PageRank on dynamic graphs; most of them consider the case ofupdating static PageRank under node/edge insertions/deletions. In other words; PageRankis always defined as the static PageRank of the current instance of the graph. In this paperwe introduce temporal PageRank; a generalization of PageRank for temporal networks;where activity is represented as a sequence of time-stamped edges.

While thetopology of a typical road network has been available for a long time (eg; through maps); it isonly recently that fine-granularity functional (activity and usage) information about thenetwork (like source-destination traffic information) is being collected and is readilyavailable. The combination of functional and structural information provides an efficient wayto explore and understand usage patterns of networks and aid in design and decisionmaking.

Covering the Egonet: A Crowdsourcing Approach to Social Circle Discovery on Twitter.,Karmen Lata Dykstra; Jefrey Lijffijt; Aristides Gionis,Abstract Twitter and other social media provide the functionality of manually grouping usersinto lists. The goal is to enable selective viewing of content and easier informationacquisition. However; creating lists manually requires significant time and effort. To mitigatethis effort; a number of recent methods attempt to create lists automatically using contentand/or network structure; but results are far from perfect. In this work; we study the power ofthe millions of lists that are already created by other twitter users in order to “crowdsource”the task of list creation. We find that in a large dataset; collected specifically for this study; anoptimal matching of existing lists from other twitter users to the ground-truth lists in egonetsgives an F1 score of 0.43; while the best existing method achieves only 0.21.

Political Discourse on Social Media: Echo Chambers; Gatekeepers; and the Price of Bipartisanship,Kiran Garimella; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis; Michael Mathioudakis,Abstract: Echo chambers; ie; situations where one is exposed only to opinions that agreewith their own; are an increasing concern for the political discourse in many democraticcountries. This paper studies the phenomenon of political echo chambers on social media.We identify the two components in the phenomenon: the opinion that is shared ('echo'); andthe place that allows its exposure ('chamber'---the social network); and examine closely athow these two components interact. We define a production and consumption measure forsocial-media users; which captures the political leaning of the content shared and receivedby them. By comparing the two; we find that Twitter users are; to a large degree; exposed topolitical opinions that agree with their own. We also find that users who try to bridge the echochambers; by sharing content with diverse leaning; have to pay a'price of bipartisanship'in …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.01665,2018,1

What are the temporal patterns exhibited by theseinteractions? Which entities interact frequently with each other before; during; or after othershave stopped or started? Such dynamic-network datasets are becoming prevailing; asmodern data-gathering capabilities allow to record not only a static view of the networkstructure; but also detailed activity of the network entities and interactions along the networkedges. Analysis of dynamic networks has applications in telecommunication networks;social network analysis; computational biology; and more. We study the problem of mininginteractions in dynamic graphs. We assume that these interactions are not instantaneous;but more naturally; each interaction has a duration.

Discovering recurring activity in temporal networks,Orestis Kostakis; Nikolaj Tatti; Aristides Gionis,Abstract Recent advances in data-acquisition technologies have equipped team coachesand sports analysts with the capability of collecting and analyzing detailed data of teamactivity in the field. It is now possible to monitor a sports event and record informationregarding the position of the players in the field; passing the ball; coordinated moves; and soon. In this paper we propose a new method to analyze such team activity data. Our goal is tosegment the overall activity stream into a sequence of potentially recurrent modes; whichreflect different strategies adopted by a team; and thus; help to analyze and understandteam tactics. We model team activity data as a temporal network; that is; a sequence of time-stamped edges that capture interactions between players.

Lagrangian relaxations for multiple network alignment,Eric Malmi; Sanjay Chawla; Aristides Gionis,Abstract We propose a principled approach for the problem of aligning multiple partiallyoverlapping networks. The objective is to map multiple graphs into a single graph whilepreserving vertex and edge similarities. The problem is inspired by the task of integratingpartial views of a family tree (genealogical network) into one unified network; but it also hasapplications; for example; in social and biological networks. Our approach; called Flan;introduces the idea of generalizing the facility location problem by adding a non-linear termto capture edge similarities and to infer the underlying entity network. The problem is solvedusing an alternating optimization procedure with a Lagrangian relaxation. Flan has theadvantage of being able to leverage prior information on the number of entities; so that whenthis information is available; Flan is shown to work robustly without the need to use any …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2017,1
Community-aware network sparsification,Aristides Gionis; Polina Rozenshtein; Nikolaj Tatti; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Network sparsification aims to reduce the number of edges of a network whilemaintaining its structural properties; such properties include shortest paths; cuts; spectralmeasures; or network modularity. Sparsification has multiple applications; such as; speedingup graph-mining algorithms; graph visualization; as well as identifying the important networkedges. In this paper we consider a novel formulation of the network-sparsification problem.In addition to the network; we also consider as input a set of communities. The goal is tosparsify the network so as to preserve the network structure with respect to the givencommunities. We introduce two variants of the community-aware sparsification problem;leading to sparsifiers that satisfy different connectedness community properties.

Finding low-tension communities,Esther Galbrun; Behzad Golshan; Aristides Gionis; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Motivated by applications that arise in online social media and collaborationnetworks; there has been a lot of work on community-search. In this class of problems; thegoal is to find a subgraph that satisfies a certain connectivity requirement and contains agiven collection of seed nodes. In this paper; we extend the community-search problem byassociating each individual with a profile. The profile is a numeric score that quantifies theposition of an individual with respect to a topic. We adopt a model where each individualstarts with a latent profile and arrives to a conformed profile through a dynamic conformationprocess; which takes into account the individual's social interaction and the tendency toconform with one's social environment. In this framework; social tension arises from thedifferences between the conformed profiles of neighboring individuals as well as from the …,*,2017,1

Specifically; we explore how the structure of interactions and content ofdiscussion varies with the level of collective attention; as evidenced by the number of usersdiscussing a topic. Spikes in the volume of users typically correspond to external events thatincrease the public attention on the topic-as; for instance; discussions about'guncontrol'often erupt after a mass shooting. This work is the first to study the dynamic evolutionof polarized online debates at such scale. By employing a wide array of network and contentanalysis measures; we find consistent evidence that increased collective attention isassociated with increased network polarization and network concentration within each sideof the debate; and overall more uniform lexicon usage across all users.,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Web Science Conference,2017,1
AncestryAI: A Tool for Exploring Computationally Inferred Family Trees,Eric Malmi; Marko Rasa; Aristides Gionis,Abstract Many people are excited to discover their ancestors and thus decide to take upgenealogy. However; the process of finding the ancestors is often very laborious since itinvolves comparing a large number of historical birth records and trying to manually matchthe people mentioned in them. We have developed AncestryAI; an open-source tool forautomatically linking historical records and exploring the resulting family trees. We introducea record-linkage method for computing the probabilities of the candidate matches; whichallows the users to either directly identify the next ancestor or narrow down the search. Wealso propose an efficient layout algorithm for drawing and navigating genealogical graphs.The tool is additionally used to crowdsource training and evaluation data so as to improvethe matching algorithm. Our objective is to build a large genealogical graph; which could …,Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web Companion,2017,1

Finding dynamic dense subgraphs,Polina Rozenshtein; Nikolaj Tatti; Aristides Gionis,Abstract Online social networks are often defined by considering interactions of entities at anaggregate level. For example; a call graph is formed among individuals who have calledeach other at least once; or at least k times. Similarly; in social-media platforms; we considerimplicit social networks among users who have interacted in some way; eg; have made aconversation; have commented to the content of each other; and so on. Such definitionshave been used widely in the literature and they have offered significant insights regardingthe structure of social networks. However; it is obvious that they suffer from a severelimitation: They neglect the precise time that interactions among the network entities occur.In this article; we consider interaction networks; where the data description contains not onlyinformation about the underlying topology of the social network; but also the exact time …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2017,1
Balancing information exposure in social networks,Kiran Garimella; Aristides Gionis; Nikos Parotsidis; Nikolaj Tatti,Abstract Social media has brought a revolution on how people are consuming news.Beyond the undoubtedly large number of advantages brought by social-media platforms; apoint of criticism has been the creation of echo chambers and filter bubbles; caused bysocial homophily and algorithmic personalization. In this paper we address the problem ofbalancing the information exposure} in a social network. We assume that two opposingcampaigns (or viewpoints) are present in the network; and that network nodes have differentpreferences towards these campaigns. Our goal is to find two sets of nodes to employ in therespective campaigns; so that the overall information exposure for the two campaigns isbalanced. We formally define the problem; characterize its hardness; develop approximationalgorithms; and present experimental evaluation results. Our model is inspired by the …,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,2017,1
Semi-supervised Kernel Metric Learning Using Relative Comparisons,Ehsan Amid; Aristides Gionis; Antti Ukkonen,Abstract: We consider the problem of metric learning subject to a set of constraints onrelative-distance comparisons between the data items. Such constraints are meant to reflectside-information that is not expressed directly in the feature vectors of the data items. Therelative-distance constraints used in this work are particularly effective in expressingstructures at finer level of detail than must-link (ML) and cannot-link (CL) constraints; whichare most commonly used for semi-supervised clustering. Relative-distance constraints arethus useful in settings where providing an ML or a CL constraint is difficult because thegranularity of the true clustering is unknown. Our main contribution is an efficient algorithmfor learning a kernel matrix using the log determinant divergence---a variant of the Bregmandivergence---subject to a set of relative-distance constraints.

Backbone discovery in traffic networks,Sanjay Chawla; Kiran Garimella; Aristides Gionis; Dominic Tsang,Abstract We introduce a new computational problem; the BackboneDiscovery problem;which encapsulates both functional and structural aspects of network analysis. While thetopology of a typical road network has been available for a long time (eg; through maps); it isonly recently that fine–granularity functional (activity and usage) information about thenetwork (such as source–destination traffic information) is being collected and is readilyavailable. The combination of functional and structural information provides an efficient wayto explore and understand usage patterns of networks and aid in design and decisionmaking. We propose efficient algorithms for the BackboneDiscovery problem including anovel use of edge centrality. We observe that for many real-world networks; our algorithmproduces a backbone with a small subset of the edges that support a large percentage of …,International Journal of Data Science and Analytics,2016,1
Extracting skill endorsements from personal communication data,Darshan M Shankaralingappa; Gianmarco De Fransicsi Morales; Aristides Gionis,Abstract People are increasingly communicating and collaborating via digital platforms; suchas email and messaging applications. Data exchanged on these digital communicationplatforms can be a treasure trove of information on people who participate in thediscussions: who they are collaborating with; what they are working on; what their expertiseis; and so on. Yet; personal communication data is very rarely analyzed due to the sensitivityof the information it contains. In this paper; we mine personal communication data with thegoal of generating skill endorsements of the type" person A endorses person B on skill X."To address privacy concerns; we consider that each person has access only to their owndata (ie; conversations with their peers). By using our method; they can generateendorsements for their peers; which they can inspect and opt to publish.

Top-k densest subgraphs in sliding-window graph streams,Muhammad Anis Uddin Nasir; Aristides Gionis; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Sarunas Girdzijauskas,Abstract: Given a large graph; the densest-subgraph problem asks to find a subgraph withmaximum average degree. When considering the top-k version of this problem; a naivesolution is to iteratively find the densest subgraph and remove it in each iteration. However;such a solution is impractical due to high processing cost. The problem is furthercomplicated when dealing with dynamic graphs; since adding or removing an edge requiresre-running the algorithm. In this paper; we study the top-k densest subgraph problem in thesliding-window model and propose an efficient fully-dynamic algorithm. The input of ouralgorithm consists of an edge stream; and the goal is to find the node-disjoint subgraphs thatmaximize the sum of their densities. In contrast to existing state-of-the-art solutions thatrequire iterating over the entire graph upon any update; our algorithm profits from the …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1610.05897,2016,1

We design a market of private data that are gatheredtowards building a classifier. Each data owner has a private cost that quantifies hisdiscomfort for providing data to the learner. Also; at each stage of the learning process; eachdata owner is characterized by a utility score; which expresses the utility of his data for thelearner. The learner initiates a call for buying data; and interested owners respond bydeclaring their costs. The learner computes the utility score of each data owner. It thenselects one owner to buy data from and associated payment.

The blind leading the blind: Network-based location estimation under uncertainty,Eric Malmi; Arno Solin; Aristides Gionis,Abstract We propose a probabilistic method for inferring the geographical locations of linkedobjects; such as users in a social network. Unlike existing methods; our model does notassume that the exact locations of any subset of the linked objects; like neighbors in a socialnetwork; are known. The method efficiently leverages prior knowledge on the locations;resulting in high geolocation accuracies even if none of the locations are initially known.Experiments are conducted for three scenarios: geolocating users of a location-based socialnetwork; geotagging historical church records; and geotagging Flickr photos. In eachexperiment; the proposed method outperforms two state-of-the-art network-based methods.Furthermore; the last experiment shows that the method can be employed not only tonetwork-based but also to content-based location estimation.,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2015,1
Beyond rankings: comparing directed acyclic graphs,Eric Malmi; Nikolaj Tatti; Aristides Gionis,Abstract Defining appropriate distance measures among rankings is a classic area of studywhich has led to many useful applications. In this paper; we propose a more generalabstraction of preference data; namely directed acyclic graphs (DAGs); and introduce ameasure for comparing DAGs; given that a vertex correspondence between the DAGs isknown. We study the properties of this measure and use it to aggregate and cluster a set ofDAGs. We show that these problems are NP NP-hard and present efficient methods toobtain solutions with approximation guarantees. In addition to preference data; thesemethods turn out to have other interesting applications; such as the analysis of a collectionof information cascades in a network.

Diverse dimension decomposition for itemset spaces,Mikalai Tsytsarau; Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis; Themis Palpanas,Abstract We introduce the problem of diverse dimension decomposition in transactionaldatabases; where a dimension is a set of mutually exclusive itemsets. The problem weconsider requires to find a decomposition of the itemset space into dimensions; which areorthogonal to each other and which provide high coverage of the input database. Themining framework we propose can be interpreted as a dimensionality-reducingtransformation from the space of all items to the space of orthogonal dimensions. Relying oninformation-theoretic concepts; we formulate the diverse dimension decomposition problemwith a single objective function that simultaneously captures constraints on coverage;exclusivity; and orthogonality. We show that our problem is NP-hard; and we propose agreedy algorithm exploiting the well-known FP-tree data structure. Our algorithm is …,Knowledge and information systems,2012,1

Surface reflectance recovery under point light illumination,Robert B Fisher; Aristides P Gionis,Abstract In this paper; a novel algorithm for colour recovery is presented. It assumes that the3-D geometry of the scene is known. The spectral power distribution of a point illuminationsource; and the response function of the sensor are calibrated jointly. This algorithm hasbeen used for the colour recovery part of an integrated system; developed in our laboratory;for environmental modelling. The geometry of the scene is recovered using a laser striperange-nder and this information is exploited by the colour recovery algorithm. A point lightsource; attached to the whole system; has been used for the illumination of the scene; inorder to con ne undesirable side-e ects of the ambient light.

Computationally Inferred Genealogical Networks Uncover Long-Term Trends in Assortative Mating,Eric Malmi; Aristides Gionis; Arno Solin,Abstract: Genealogical networks; also known as family trees or population pedigrees; arecommonly studied by genealogists wanting to know about their ancestry; but they alsoprovide a valuable resource for disciplines such as digital demography; genetics; andcomputational social science. These networks are typically constructed by hand through avery time-consuming process; which requires comparing large numbers of historical recordsmanually. We develop computational methods for automatically inferring large-scalegenealogical networks. A comparison with human-constructed networks attests to theaccuracy of the proposed methods. To demonstrate the applicability of the inferred large-scale genealogical networks; we present a longitudinal analysis on the mating patternsobserved in a network.

From acquaintance to best friend forever: robust and fine-grained inference of social tie strengths,Florian Adriaens; Tijl De Bie; Aristides Gionis; Jefrey Lijffijt; Polina Rozenshtein,Abstract: Social networks often provide only a binary perspective on social ties: twoindividuals are either connected or not. While sometimes external information can be usedto infer the\emph {strength} of social ties; access to such information may be restricted orimpractical. Sintos and Tsaparas (KDD 2014) first suggested to infer the strength of socialties from the topology of the network alone; by leveraging the\emph {Strong Triadic Closure(STC)} property.%---postulated to hold in social networks~\cite {sim: 08}. The STC propertystates that if person $ A $ has strong social ties with persons $ B $ and $ C $; $ B $ and $ C$ must be connected to each other as well (whether with a weak or strong tie). Sintos andTsaparas exploited this to formulate the inference of the strength of social ties as NP-hardoptimization problem; and proposed two approximation algorithms.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.03549,2018,*
Joint Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Learning Ideological Leaning on Twitter,Preethi Lahoti; Kiran Garimella; Aristides Gionis,Abstract People are shifting from traditional news sources to online news at an incrediblyfast rate. However; the technology behind online news consumption promotes content thatconfirms the users» existing point of view. This phenomenon has led to polarization ofopinions and intolerance towards opposing views. Thus; a key problem is to modelinformation filter bubbles on social media and design methods to eliminate them. In thispaper; we use a machine-learning approach to learn a liberal-conservative ideology spaceon Twitter; and show how we can use the learned latent space to tackle the filter bubbleproblem. We model the problem of learning the liberal-conservative ideology space of socialmedia users and media sources as a constrained non-negative matrix-factorization problem.Our model incorporates the social-network structure and content-consumption information …,Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2018,*
Reconstructing a cascade from temporal observations,Han Xiao; Polina Rozenshtein; Nikolaj Tatti; Aristides Gionis,Abstract: Given a subset of active nodes in a network can we re-construct the cascade thathas generated these observa-tions? This is a problem that has been studied in the literature;but here we focus in the case that tempo-ral information is available about the active nodes.In particular; we assume that in addition to the subset of active nodes we also know theiractivation time. We formulate this cascade-reconstruction problem as a variant of a Steiner-tree problem: we ask to find a tree that spans all reported active nodes while satisfyingtemporal-consistency constraints. We present three approximation algorithms. The bestalgorithm in terms of quality achieves a O (\sqrt {k})-approximation guarantee; where k is thenumber of active nodes; while the most efficient algorithm has linearithmic running time;making it scalable to very large graphs.

Mining Frequent Patterns in Evolving Graphs,M Anis U Nasir; Cigdem Aslay; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis,Given a labeled graph; the frequent-subgraph mining (FSM) problem asks to find all the k-vertex subgraphs that appear with frequency greater than a given threshold. FSM hasnumerous appli-cations ranging from biology to network science; as it provides a compactsummary of the characteristics of the graph. However; the task is challenging; even more sofor evolving graphs due to the streaming nature of the input and the exponential timecomplexity of the problem.

For each streaming setting; we propose algorithms that canextract a high-quality approximation of the frequent k-vertex subgraphs for a given threshold;at any given time instance; with high probability.

The network-untangling problem: From interactions to activity timelines,Polina Rozenshtein; Nikolaj Tatti; Aristides Gionis,Abstract In this paper we study a problem of determining when entities are active based ontheir interactions with each other. More formally; we consider a set of entities V and asequence of time-stamped edges E among the entities. Each edge (u; v; t) ∈ E denotes aninteraction between entities u and v that takes place at time t. We view this input as atemporal network. We then assume a simple activity model in which each entity is activeduring a short time interval. An interaction (u; v; t) can be explained if at least one of u or vare active at time t. Our goal is to reconstruct the activity intervals; for all entities in thenetwork; so as to explain the observed interactions. This problem; which we refer to as thenetwork-untangling problem; can be applied to discover timelines of events from complexinteractions among entities.

Inferring the Strength of Social Ties: A Community-Driven Approach,Polina Rozenshtein; Nikolaj Tatti; Aristides Gionis,Abstract Online social networks are growing and becoming denser. The social connectionsof a given person may have very high variability: from close friends and relatives toacquaintances to people who hardly know. Inferring the strength of social ties is an importantingredient for modeling the interaction of users in a network and understanding theirbehavior. Furthermore; the problem has applications in computational social science; viralmarketing; and people recommendation. In this paper we study the problem of inferring thestrength of social ties in a given network.

Finding topical experts in Twitter via query-dependent personalized PageRank,Preethi Lahoti; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis,Abstract Finding topical experts on micro-blogging sites; such as Twitter; is an essentialinformation-seeking task. In this paper; we introduce an expert-finding algorithm for Twitter;which can be generalized to find topical experts in any social network with endorsementfeatures. Our approach combines traditional link analysis with text mining. It relies on crowd-sourced data from Twitter lists to build a labeled directed graph called the endorsementgraph; which captures topical expertise as perceived by users. Given a text query; ouralgorithm uses a dynamic topic-sensitive weighting scheme; which sets the weights on theedges of the graph. Then; it uses an improved version of query-dependent PageRank to findimportant nodes in the graph; which correspond to topical experts.

A combinatorial approach to role discovery,Albert Arockiasamy; Aristides Gionis; Nikolaj Tatti,We provide a new formulation for the problem of role discovery in graphs. Our definition isstructural: two vertices should be assigned to the same role if the roles of their neighbors;when viewed as multi-sets; are similar enough. An attractive characteristic of our approach isthat it is based on optimizing a well-defined objective function; and thus; contrary to previousapproaches; the role-discovery task can be studied with the tools of combinatorialoptimization. We demonstrate that; when fixing the number of roles to be used; the proposedrole-discovery problem is np-hard; while another (seemingly easier) version of the problemis np-hard to approximate. On the positive side; despite the recursive nature of our objectivefunction; we can show that finding a perfect (zero-cost) role assignment with the minimumnumber of roles can be solved in polynomial time.

Even things that are posted privately to a group of friends may leak to alarger audience when the post is spread further by one of the friends. According to onestudy; 41% of Twitter users regret placing certain tweets. When such a tweet is posted; only11% realizes immediately after posting that it was a mistake. This may cause harm to theircareers or relationships. Therefore it is reasonable to say that social network users coulduse a little help with determining what to show on the social network.

Social piggybacking: leveraging common friends to generate event streams,Aristides Gionis; Flavio Junqueira; Vincent Leroy; Marco Serafini; Ingmar Weber,Abstract Social networking systems present users with online event streams that includerecent activities of their friends. Materialized per-user views are a common way to generatesuch event streams on-line and with low latency. We propose improving throughput by usingsocial piggybacking: process the requests of two friends by just querying and updating theview of a third common friend. By using one such hub view; the system can serve requests ofthe first friend without querying nor updating the view of the second. This reduces the overallload on views; and can be implemented with minimal adaptations by existing socialnetworking architectures. We show that; given a social graph; there exist hub-basedschedules that minimize the overall number of view requests; but computing them is NP-hard. We propose a heuristic to solve the problem and evaluate it using samples from the …,Proceedings of the Fifth Workshop on Social Network Systems,2012,*

On the high density of leadership nuclei in endorsement social networks,Guillermo Garrido; Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis,Abstract In this paper we study the community structure of endorsement networks; ie; socialnetworks in which a directed edge u→ v is asserting an action of support from user u to userv. Examples include scenarios in which a user u is favoring a photo; liking a post; orfollowing the microblog of user v. Starting from the hypothesis that the footprint of acommunity in an endorsement network is a bipartite directed clique from a set of followers toa set of leaders; we apply frequent itemset mining techniques to discover such bicliques. Ouranalysis of real networks discovers that an interesting phenomenon is taking place: theleaders of a community are endorsing each other forming a very dense nucleus.,Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web,2010,*
Query Significance in Databases via Randomizations,Markus Ojala; Gemma C Garriga; Aristides Gionis; Heikki Mannila,Abstract: Many sorts of structured data are commonly stored in a multi-relational format ofinterrelated tables. Under this relational model; exploratory data analysis can be done byusing relational queries. As an example; in the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) a query canbe used to check whether the average rank of action movies is higher than the average rankof drama movies. We consider the problem of assessing whether the results returned bysuch a query are statistically significant or just a random artifact of the structure in the data.Our approach is based on randomizing the tables occurring in the queries and repeating theoriginal query on the randomized tables. It turns out that there is no unique way ofrandomizing in multi-relational data. We propose several randomization techniques; studytheir properties; and show how to find out which queries or hypotheses about our data …,arXiv preprint arXiv:0906.5485,2009,*

Algorithms for similarity search and clustering in large data sets,Aristides Gionis,Abstract In this thesis we present algorithms for performing similarity search and clustering inlarge datasets. Similarity search is necessary in order to locate relevant information in adatabase; and it can be used for prediction and classification. Clustering; a form of datasummarization; can facilitate visualization; understanding; and knowledge extraction. Thecore of our algorithms for similarity search rely on an hashing-based algorithmic technique.The idea is to create signatures for data objects so that similar objects are likely to haveidentical signatures. Then; similar objects in the database can be located by indexing theirsignatures.,*,2003,*
Automating the Synthesis of Functional Programs in Constructive Type Theory,Alan Smaill; Ian Green,Abstract: The task of constructing programs can be treated as a task of finding proofs in anappropriate logic. For recursive programs; the corresponding logic includes appropriateinduction principles. We describe a system that automates program synthesis via theoremproving in this way; building on control strategies developed for verification proofs usingproof plans. This involves some extensions to the planning system. The resultant systemautomates an approach to programming where program development and correctness proofproceed hand in hand; as advocated by Gries.,DAI RESEARCH PAPER,1995,*

Efficient and Tunable Similar Set Retrieval Aristides Gionis* Stanford University gionis@ cs. stanford. edu,Aristides Gionis,Abstract Set value attributes are a concise and natural way to model complex data sets.Modern Object Relational systems support set value attributes and allow various querycapabilities on them. In this paper we initiate a formal study of indexing techniques for setvalue attributes based on similarity; for suitably defined notions of similarity between sets.Such techniques are necessary in modern applications such as recommendations throughcollaborative filtering and automated advertising. Our techniques are probabilistic andapproximate in nature. As a design principle we create structures that make use of wellknown and widely used data structuring techniques; as a means to ease integration withexisting infrastructure. We show how the problem of indexing a collection of sets based onsimilarity can be reduced to the problem of indexing suitably encoded (in a way that …,*,*,*

Structured Prediction of Network Response Supplementary Material,Hongyu Su; Aristides Gionis; Juho Rousu,Proof (Sketch) The inference problem of SPIN can be stated as searching for an optimalconfiguration of node labels. The node labels 1yv∈ 1p; nllv∈ V induce edge labels 1ye∈1nn; pn; pplle∈ E. For each edge e and its label ye in the graph; a score sye (e) is defined.The goal is to find a set of node labels that maximizes the sum of scores∑ e∈ E sye (e).This inference problem can be seen as a generalization of the MAX-CUT problem (Garey &Johnson; 1979); where the objective is to partition the nodes of a given undirected graphinto two parts so that the number of edges cut is maximized. The MAX-CUT problem isknown to be NP-hard.,*,*,*
