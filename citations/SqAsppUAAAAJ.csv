On supporting containment queries in relational database management systems,Chun Zhang; Jeffrey Naughton; David DeWitt; Qiong Luo; Guy Lohman,Abstract Virtually all proposals for querying XML include a class of query we term“containment queries”. It is also clear that in the foreseeable future; a substantial amount ofXML data will be stored in relational database systems. This raises the question of how tosupport these containment queries. The inverted list technology that underlies much ofInformation Retrieval is well-suited to these queries; but should we implement thistechnology (a) in a separate loosely-coupled IR engine; or (b) using the native tables andquery execution machinery of the RDBMS? With option (b); more than twenty years of workon RDBMS query optimization; query execution; scalability; and concurrency control andrecovery immediately extend to the queries and structures that implement these newoperations. But all this will be irrelevant if the performance of option (b) lags that of (a) by …,Acm Sigmod Record,2001,1175
Mars: a MapReduce framework on graphics processors,Bingsheng He; Wenbin Fang; Qiong Luo; Naga K Govindaraju; Tuyong Wang,Abstract We design and implement Mars; a MapReduce framework; on graphics processors(GPUs). MapReduce is a distributed programming framework originally proposed by Googlefor the ease of development of web search applications on a large number of commodityCPUs. Compared with CPUs; GPUs have an order of magnitude higher computation powerand memory bandwidth; but are harder to program since their architectures are designed asa special-purpose co-processor and their programming interfaces are typically for graphicsapplications. As the first attempt to harness GPU's power for MapReduce; we developedMars on an NVIDIA G80 GPU; which contains over one hundred processors; and evaluatedit in comparison with Phoenix; the state-of-the-art MapReduce framework on multi-coreCPUs. Mars hides the programming complexity of the GPU behind the simple and familiar …,Proceedings of the 17th international conference on Parallel architectures and compilation techniques,2008,815
RiMOM: A dynamic multistrategy ontology alignment framework,Juanzi Li; Jie Tang; Yi Li; Qiong Luo,Ontology alignment identifies semantically matching entities in different ontologies. Variousontology alignment strategies have been proposed; however; few systems have exploredhow to automatically combine multiple strategies to improve the matching effectiveness. Thispaper presents a dynamic multistrategy ontology alignment framework; named RiMOM. Thekey insight in this framework is that similarity characteristics between ontologies may varywidely. We propose a systematic approach to quantitatively estimate the similaritycharacteristics for each alignment task and propose a strategy selection method toautomatically combine the matching strategies based on two estimated factors. In theapproach; we consider both textual and structural characteristics of ontologies. With RiMOM;we participated in the 2006 and 2007 campaigns of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2009,403
Relational joins on graphics processors,Bingsheng He; Ke Yang; Rui Fang; Mian Lu; Naga Govindaraju; Qiong Luo; Pedro Sander,Abstract We present a novel design and implementation of relational join algorithms for new-generation graphics processing units (GPUs). The most recent GPU features include supportfor writing to random memory locations; efficient inter-processor communication; and aprogramming model for general-purpose computing. Taking advantage of these newfeatures; we design a set of data-parallel primitives such as split and sort; and use theseprimitives to implement indexed or non-indexed nested-loop; sort-merge and hash joins. Ouralgorithms utilize the high parallelism as well as the high memory bandwidth of the GPU;and use parallel computation and memory optimizations to effectively reduce memory stalls.We have implemented our algorithms on a PC with an NVIDIA G80 GPU and an Intel quad-core CPU. Our GPU-based join algorithms are able to achieve a performance …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,345
Relational query coprocessing on graphics processors,Bingsheng He; Mian Lu; Ke Yang; Rui Fang; Naga K Govindaraju; Qiong Luo; Pedro V Sander,Abstract Graphics processors (GPUs) have recently emerged as powerful coprocessors forgeneral purpose computation. Compared with commodity CPUs; GPUs have an order ofmagnitude higher computation power as well as memory bandwidth. Moreover; new-generation GPUs allow writes to random memory locations; provide efficient interprocessorcommunication through on-chip local memory; and support a general purpose parallelprogramming model. Nevertheless; many of the GPU features are specialized for graphicsprocessing; including the massively multithreaded architecture; the Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data processing style; and the execution model of a single application at a time.Additionally; GPUs rely on a bus of limited bandwidth to transfer data to and from the CPU;do not allow dynamic memory allocation from GPU kernels; and have little hardware …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2009,264
The Niagara internet query system,Jeffrey F.  Naughton; David J.

However; merely being anXML query-processing engine does not render a system suitable for querying the Internet. Auseful system must provide mechanisms to (a) find the XML files that are relevant to a givenquery; and (b) deal with remote data sources that either provide unpredictable data accessand transfer rates; or are infinite streams; or both. The Niagara Internet Query System wasdesigned from the bottom-up to provide these mechanisms. In this article we describe theoverall Niagara architecture; and how Niagara finds relevant XML documents by using acollaboration between the Niagara XML-QL query processor and the Niagara “text-in-context” XML search engine. The Niagara Internet Query System is public domain …,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2001,256
Contour map matching for event detection in sensor networks,Wenwei Xue; Qiong Luo; Lei Chen; Yunhao Liu,Abstract Many sensor network applications; such as object tracking and disaster monitoring;require effective techniques for event detection. In this paper; we propose a novel eventdetection mechanism based on matching the contour maps of in-network sensory datadistribution. Our key observation is that events in sensor networks can be abstracted intospatio-temporal patterns of sensory data and that pattern matching can be done efficientlythrough contour map matching. Therefore; we propose simple SQL extensions to allowusers to specify common types of events as patterns in contour maps and study energy-efficient techniques of contour map construction and maintenance for our pattern-basedevent detection. Our experiments with synthetic workloads derived from a real-world coalmine surveillance application validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,244
Middle-tier database caching for e-business,Qiong Luo; Sailesh Krishnamurthy; C Mohan; Hamid Pirahesh; Honguk Woo; Bruce G Lindsay; Jeffrey F Naughton,Abstract While scaling up to the enormous and growing Internet population withunpredictable usage patterns; E-commerce applications face severe challenges in cost andmanageability; especially for database servers that are deployed as those applications'backends in a multi-tier configuration. Middle-tier database caching is one solution to thisproblem. In this paper; we present a simple extension to the existing federated features inDB2 UDB; which enables a regular DB2 instance to become a DBCache without anyapplication modification. On deployment of a DBCache at an application server; arbitrarySQL statements generated from the unchanged application that are intended for a backenddatabase server; can be answered: at the cache; at the backend database server; or at bothlocations in a distributed manner. The factors that determine the distribution of workload …,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2002,240
Enabling dynamic content caching for database-driven web sites,K Selçuk Candan; Wen-Syan Li; Qiong Luo; Wang-Pin Hsiung; Divyakant Agrawal,Abstract Web performance is a key differentiation among content providers. Snafus andslowdowns at major web sites demonstrate the difficulty that companies face trying to scaleto a large amount of web traffic. One solution to this problem is to store web content at server-side and edge-caches for fast delivery to the end users. However; for many e-commercesites; web pages are created dynamically based on the current state of business processes;represented in application servers and databases. Since application servers; databases;web servers; and caches are independent components; there is no efficient mechanism tomake changes in the database content reflected to the cached web pages. As a result; mostapplication servers have to mark dynamically generated web pages as non-cacheable. Inthis paper; we describe the architectural framework of the CachePortal system for …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2001,222
Finding similar users using category-based location history,Xiangye Xiao; Yu Zheng; Qiong Luo; Xing Xie,Abstract In this paper; we aim to estimate the similarity between users according to their GPStrajectories. Our approach first models a user's GPS trajectories with a semantic locationhistory (SLH); eg; shopping malls→ restaurants→ cinemas. Then; we measure the similaritybetween different users' SLHs by using our maximal travel match (MTM) algorithm. Theadvantage of our approach lies in two aspects. First; SLH carries more semantic meaningsof a user's interests beyond low-level geographic positions. Second; our approach canestimate the similarity between two users without overlaps in the geographic spaces; eg;people living in different cities. We evaluate our method based on a real-world GPS datasetcollected by 109 users in a period of 1 year. As a result; SLH-MTM outperforms the relatedworks [4].,Proceedings of the 18th SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2010,167
Efficient gather and scatter operations on graphics processors,Bingsheng He; Naga K Govindaraju; Qiong Luo; Burton Smith,Abstract Gather and scatter are two fundamental data-parallel operations; where a largenumber of data items are read (gathered) from or are written (scattered) to given locations. Inthis paper; we study these two operations on graphics processing units (GPUs). Withsuperior computing power and high memory bandwidth; GPUs have become a commoditymultiprocessor platform for general-purpose high-performance computing. However; due tothe random access nature of gather and scatter; a naive implementation of the twooperations suffers from a low utilization of the memory bandwidth and consequently a long;unhidden memory latency. Additionally; the architectural details of the GPUs; in particular;the memory hierarchy design; are unclear to the programmers. Therefore; we design multi-pass gather and scatter operations to improve their data access locality; and develop a …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM/IEEE conference on Supercomputing,2007,149
Mars: Accelerating mapreduce with graphics processors,Wenbin Fang; Bingsheng He; Qiong Luo; Naga K Govindaraju,We design and implement Mars; a MapReduce runtime system accelerated with graphicsprocessing units (GPUs). MapReduce is a simple and flexible parallel programmingparadigm originally proposed by Google; for the ease of large-scale data processing onthousands of CPUs. Compared with CPUs; GPUs have an order of magnitude highercomputation power and memory bandwidth. However; GPUs are designed as special-purpose coprocessors and their programming interfaces are less familiar than those on theCPUs to MapReduce programmers.

Tree indexing on solid state drives,Yinan Li; Bingsheng He; Robin Jun Yang; Qiong Luo; Ke Yi,Abstract Large flash disks; or solid state drives (SSDs); have become an attractivealternative to magnetic hard disks; due to their high random read performance; low energyconsumption and other features. However; writes; especially small random writes; on flashdisks are inherently much slower than reads because of the erase-before-write mechanism.To address this asymmetry of read-write speeds in tree indexing on the flash disk; wepropose FD-tree; a tree index designed with the logarithmic method and fractionalcascading techniques. With the logarithmic method; an FD-tree consists of the head tree--asmall B+-tree on the top; and a few levels of sorted runs of increasing sizes at the bottom.This design is write-optimized for the flash disk; in particular; an index search will potentiallygo through more levels or visit more nodes; but random writes are limited to a small area …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,132
Form-based proxy caching for database-backed web sites,Qiong Luo; Jeffrey F Naughton,Abstract We explore a new proxy-caching framework that exploits the query semantics ofHTML forms. We identify a common class of form-based queries; and study tworepresentative caching schemes for them within this framework:(i) traditional passive querycaching; and (ii) active query caching; in which the proxy cache can service a request byevaluating a query over the contents of the cache. Results from our experimentalimplementation show that our form-based proxy is a general and flexible approach thatefficiently enables active caching schemes for database-backed web sites. Furthermore;handling query containment at the proxy yields significant performance advantages overpassive query caching; but extending the power of the active cache to do full semanticcaching appears to be less generally effective.,VLDB,2001,128
Database compression on graphics processors,Wenbin Fang; Bingsheng He; Qiong Luo,Abstract Query co-processing on graphics processors (GPUs) has become an effectivemeans to improve the performance of main memory databases. However; this co-processingrequires the data transfer between the main memory and the GPU memory via a low-bandwidth PCI-E bus. The overhead of such data transfer becomes an important factor; evena bottleneck; for query co-processing performance on the GPU. In this paper; we propose touse compression to alleviate this performance problem. Specifically; we implement ninelightweight compression schemes on the GPU and further study the combinations of theseschemes for a better compression ratio. We design a compression planner to find theoptimal combination. Our experiments demonstrate that the GPU-based compression anddecompression achieved a processing speed up to 45 and 56 GB/s respectively. Using …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,124

Frequent itemset mining on graphics processors,Wenbin Fang; Mian Lu; Xiangye Xiao; Bingsheng He; Qiong Luo,Abstract We present two efficient Apriori implementations of Frequent Itemset Mining (FIM)that utilize new-generation graphics processing units (GPUs). Our implementations takeadvantage of the GPU's massively multi-threaded SIMD (Single Instruction; Multiple Data)architecture. Both implementations employ a bitmap data structure to exploit the GPU's SIMDparallelism and to accelerate the frequency counting operation. One implementation runsentirely on the GPU and eliminates intermediate data transfer between the GPU memoryand the CPU memory. The other implementation employs both the GPU and the CPU forprocessing. It represents itemsets in a trie; and uses the CPU for trie traversing andincremental maintenance. Our preliminary results show that both implementations achieve aspeedup of up to two orders of magnitude over optimized CPU Apriori implementations …,Proceedings of the fifth international workshop on data management on new hardware,2009,109
Active query caching for database web servers,Qiong Luo; Jeffrey F Naughton; Rajasekar Krishnamurthy; Pei Cao; Yunrui Li,Abstract A substantial portion of web traffic consists of queries to database web servers.Unfortunately; a common technique to improve web scalability; proxy caching; is ineffectivefor database web servers because existing web proxy servers cannot cache queries. Toaddress this problem; we modify a recently proposed enhanced proxy server; called anactive proxy; to enable Active Query Caching. Our approach works by having the serversend the proxy a query applet; which can process simple queries at the proxy. This enablesthe proxy server to share the database server workload as well as to reduce the networktraffic. We show both opportunities and limitations of this approach through a performancestudy.,International Workshop on the World Wide Web and Databases,2000,100
Density based co-location pattern discovery,Xiangye Xiao; Xing Xie; Qiong Luo; Wei-Ying Ma,Abstract Co-location pattern discovery is to find classes of spatial objects that are frequentlylocated together. For example; if two categories of businesses often locate together; theymight be identified as a co-location pattern; if several biologic species frequently live innearby places; they might be a co-location pattern. Most existing co-location patterndiscovery methods are generate-and-test methods; that is; generate candidates; and testeach candidate to determine whether it is a co-location pattern. In the test step; we identifyinstances of a candidate to obtain its prevalence. In general; instance identification is verycostly. In order to reduce the computational cost of identifying instances; we propose adensity based approach. We divide objects into partitions and identifying instances in densepartitions first. A dynamic upper bound of the prevalence for a candidate is maintained. If …,Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGSPATIAL international conference on Advances in geographic information systems,2008,89
Inferring social ties between users with human location history,Xiangye Xiao; Yu Zheng; Qiong Luo; Xing Xie,Abstract The location-based social networks have been becoming flourishing in recentyears. In this paper; we aim to estimate the similarity between users according to theirphysical location histories (represented by GPS trajectories). This similarity can be regardedas a potential social tie between users; thereby enabling friend and locationrecommendations. Different from previous work using social structures or directly matchingusers' physical locations; this approach model a user's GPS trajectories with a semanticlocation history (SLH); eg; shopping malls→ restaurants→ cinemas.

Towards Ontology Learning from Folksonomies.,Jie Tang; Ho-fung Leung; Qiong Luo; Dewei Chen; Jibin Gong,Abstract A folksonomy refers to a collection of user-defined tags with which users describecontents published on the Web. With the flourish of Web 2.0; folksonomies have become animportant mean to develop the Semantic Web. Because tags in folksonomies are authoredfreely; there is a need to understand the structure and semantics of these tags in variousapplications. In this paper; we propose a learning approach to create an ontology thatcaptures the hierarchical semantic structure of folksonomies. Our experimental results ontwo different genres of real world data sets show that our method can effectively learn theontology structure from the folksonomies.,IJCAI,2009,78

GPUQP: query co-processing using graphics processors,Rui Fang; Bingsheng He; Mian Lu; Ke Yang; Naga K Govindaraju; Qiong Luo; Pedro V Sander,Abstract We present GPUQP; a relational query engine that employs both CPUs and GPUs(Graphics Processing Units) for in-memory query co-processing. GPUs are commodityprocessors traditionally designed for graphics applications. Recent research has shown thatthey can accelerate some database operations orders of magnitude over CPUs. So far; therehas been little work on how GPUs can be programmed for heavy-duty database constructs;such as tree indexes and joins; and how well a full-fledged GPU query co-processorperforms in comparison with their CPU counterparts. In this work; we explore the designdecisions in using GPUs for query co-processing using both a graphics API and a generalpurpose programming model. We then demonstrate the processing flows as well as theperformance results of our methods.,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,63

Semantic sensor net: An extensible framework,Lionel M Ni; Yanmin Zhu; Jian Ma; Minglu Li; Qiong Luo; Yunhao Liu; SC Cheung; Qiang Yang,Abstract Existing approaches for sensor networks suffer from a number of critical drawbacks.First; homogeneous deployments have been commonly assumed; but in practice multipledeployments of sensor nets and heterogeneity of sensor networks are a serious problem.Second; existing approaches are very application-dependent and engineering-oriented.Third; there has been little standard available for WSNs. These drawbacks have significantlylimited the further development of sensor networks. To overcome these critical drawbacks;we propose an extensive framework: Semantic Sensor Net (SSN). In brief; a semanticsensor net is a heterogeneous sensor network which enables dynamic tagging of semanticinformation to sensory data to allow more efficient and systematic monitoring and handlingof the environmental dynamics to provide demanded services.,*,2005,49
Distributed cross-layer scheduling for in-network sensor query processing,Hejun Wu; Qiong Luo; Wenwei Xue,In-network sensor query processing is a cross-layer design paradigm in which networkedsensor nodes process data acquisitional queries in collaboration with one another. Aspower efficiency is still one of the most severe constraints in this paradigm; we propose adistributed; cross-layer scheduling scheme for it. In this scheme; each node employs itsMAC; routing; and query layers to negotiate with its parent its timing for transmission andconstructs a schedule for its query processing. It then follows the schedule to compute;communicate; and sleep in each query processing cycle. This scheduling reduces wastedlistening and receiving as well as the switching between active and sleeping modes.Consequently; it results in 50-60% of power saving on real sensor nodes in our experiments.Additionally; it outperforms two existing scheduling schemes both on schedule …,Pervasive Computing and Communications; 2006.

Browsing on small displays by transforming Web pages into hierarchically structured subpages,Xiangye Xiao; Qiong Luo; Dan Hong; Hongbo Fu; Xing Xie; Wei-Ying Ma,Abstract We propose a new Web page transformation method to facilitate Web browsing onhandheld devices such as Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs). In our approach; an originalWeb page that does not fit on the screen is transformed into a set of subpages; each ofwhich fits on the screen. This transformation is done through slicing the original page intopage blocks iteratively; with several factors considered. These factors include the size of thescreen; the size of each page block; the number of blocks in each transformed page; thedepth of the tree hierarchy that the transformed pages form; as well as the semanticcoherence between blocks. We call the tree hierarchy of the transformed pages an SP-tree.In an SP-tree; an internal node consists of a textually enhanced thumbnail image withhyperlinks; and a leaf node is a block extracted from a subpage of the original Web page …,ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB),2009,44

VMNet: Realistic emulation of wireless sensor networks,Hejun Wu; Qiong Luo; Pei Zheng; Lionel M Ni,Many research activities on wireless sensor networks (WSNs) need detailed performancestatistics about protocols; systems; and applications; however; current simulation tools andtestbeds lack mechanisms to report these statistics realistically and conveniently. To addressthis need; we have developed a WSN emulator; VMNet. VMNet emulates networked sensornodes at the level of CPU clock cycles and executes the binary code of real applicationsdirectly. It emulates the radio channel with loss and noise as well as emulates theperipherals in sufficient detail. Moreover; VMNet takes parameter values from the real worldand logs detailed runtime information of emulated nodes. Consequently; the applicationperformance; both in response time and in power consumption; is reported realistically inVMNet; as demonstrated by our comparison studies with real sensor networks,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2007,40

Flexible aggregate similarity search,Yang Li; Feifei Li; Ke Yi; Bin Yao; Min Wang,Abstract Aggregate similarity search; aka aggregate nearest neighbor (Ann) query; findsmany useful applications in spatial and multimedia databases. Given a group Q of M queryobjects; it retrieves the most (or top-k) similar object to Q from a database P; where thesimilarity is an aggregation (eg; sum; max) of the distances between the retrieved object pand all the objects in Q.

Cache-conscious automata for XML filtering,Bingsheng He; Qiong Luo; Byron Choi,Hardware cache behavior is an important factor in the performance of memory-resident; data-intensive systems such as XML filtering engines. A key data structure in several recent XMLfilters is the automaton; which is used to represent the long-running XML queries in the mainmemory. In this paper; we study the cache performance of automaton-based XML filteringthrough analytical modeling and system measurement. Furthermore; we propose a cache-conscious automaton organization technique; called the hot buffer; to improve the locality ofautomaton state transitions. Our results show that 1) our cache performance model for XMLfiltering automata is highly accurate and 2) the hot buffer improves the cache performanceas well as the overall performance of automaton-based XML filtering,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2006,33
Dbcache: Database caching for web application servers,Mehmet Altinel; Qiong Luo; Sailesh Krishnamurthy; C Mohan; Hamid Pirahesh; Bruce G Lindsay; Honguk Woo; Larry Brown,Abstract Many e-Business applications today are being developed and deployed on multi-tier environments involving browser-based clients; web application servers and backenddatabases. The dynamic nature of these applications necessitates generating web pages on-demand; making middle-tier database caching an effective approach to achieve highscalability and performance [3]. In the DBCache project; we are incorporating a databasecache feature in DB2 UDB by modifying the engine code and leveraging existing federateddatabase functionality. This allows us to take advantage of DB2's sophisticated distributedquery processing power for database caching. As a result; the user queries can be executedat either the local database cache or the remote backend server; or more importantly; thequery can be partitioned and then distributed to both databases for cost optimum …,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2002,33

Caching and materialization for web databases,Alexandros Labrinidis; Qiong Luo; Jie Xu; Wenwei Xue,Abstract Database systems have been driving dynamic websites since the early 1990s;nowadays; even seemingly static websites employ a database back-end for personalizationand advertising purposes. In order to keep up with the high demand fuelled by the rapidgrowth of the Internet; a number of caching and materialization techniques have beenproposed for web databases over the years. The main goal of these techniques is to improveperformance; scalability; and manageability of database-driven dynamic websites; in a waythat the quality of data is not compromised. Although caching and materialization are well-understood concepts in the traditional database and networking/operating systemsliterature; the Web and web databases bring forth unique characteristics that warrant newtechniques and approaches.

Slicing*-tree based web page transformation for small displays,Xiangye Xiao; Qiong Luo; Dan Hong; Hongbo Fu,Abstract We propose a new Web page transformation method for browsing on mobiledevices with small displays. In our approach; an original web page that does not fit into thescreen is transformed into a set of pages; each of which fits into the screen. Thistransformation is done through slicing the original page. The resulting set of transformedpages form a multi-level tree structure; called a slicing*-tree; in which an internal nodeconsists of a thumbnail image with hyperlinks and a leaf node is a block from the originalweb page. Our slicing*-tree based Web page transformation eases Web browsing on smalldisplays by providing screen-fitting visual context and reducing page scrolling effort.,Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2005,26
Semantic Sensor Net: an extensible framework,Lionel M Ni; Yanmin Zhu; Jian Ma; Qiong Luo; Yunhao Liu; Shing Chi Cheung; Qiang Yang; Minglu Li; Min-you Wu,Existing approaches for sensor networks suffer from a number of serious drawbacks;including assumption of homogeneous sensor nodes; application-dependency; engineering-orientation; and lack of interoperability. To overcome these drawbacks; we propose anextensive framework: Semantic Sensor Net (SSN). It is a framework catering forheterogeneous sensor networks; which enables dynamic tagging of semantic information tosensory data to allow more efficient and systematic monitoring and handling ofenvironmental dynamics to provide diverse services. Semantics refers to the importantmeaning of sensory data; sensor nodes and application requirements. Essential semanticsenables integration; exchange; and reuse of sensory data across various applications.,International Journal of Ad Hoc and Ubiquitous Computing,2009,23
Cache-oblivious query processing,Bingsheng He,Abstract As CPU caches have become a performance bottleneck for main memorydatabases; optimizing the cache performance is essential for high-performance queryprocessing on relational databases. Cache-oblivious techniques; proposed by the theorycommunity; have optimal asymptotic bounds on the amount of data transferred between anytwo adjacent levels of an arbitrary memory hierarchy. Moreover; this optimal performance isachieved without any hardware platform specific tuning. These properties are highlyattractive to autonomous databases; especially because the hardware architectures arebecoming increasingly complex and diverse.,*,2008,23
Action-Oriented Query Processing for Pervasive Computing.,Wenwei Xue; Qiong Luo,Abstract Pervasive computing applications monitor physical-world phenomena and integratedata acquisition; communication and actions across small; heterogeneous devices (eg;smart sensors; network cameras and handheld devices). To ease the development of theseapplications; we propose to perform their tasks by executing action-embedded queries;which are continuous queries with operations towards devices. We extend SQL to allowapplications to specify actions and action-embedded queries. We treat actions as first-classcitizens (operators) in query execution plans; and investigate adaptive; costbasedoptimization techniques for a single query as well as for multiple queries. We evaluate ourprototype query processor; Aorta; using a pervasive lab monitoring application. The initialexperimental results show that Aorta ensures correct application semantics; improves …,CIDR,2005,22
Calibrating large scale vehicle trajectory data,Siyuan Liu; Ce Liu; Qiong Luo; Lionel M Ni; Ramayya Krishnan,An accurate and sufficient vehicle trajectory data set is the basis to many trajectory-baseddata mining tasks and applications. However; vehicle trajectories sampled by GPS devicesare usually at a relatively low sampling rate and contain notable location errors. To addressthese two problems in GPS trajectory data; we propose WI-matching; the first vehicletrajectory calibration framework to take advantage of road networks topology and geometryinformation and trajectory historical information in large scale. WI-matching consists of aWeighting-based map matching algorithm and a trajectory Interpolation-based matchingalgorithm. In our WI-matching framework; we first integrate the vehicle GPS data with digitalroad networks data; to identify the roads where a vehicle traveled and the vehicle locationsalong the roads. Then our weighting-based map matching algorithm considers (1) the …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2012 IEEE 13th International Conference on,2012,18
Form-based proxy caching for database-backed web sites: keywords and functions,Qiong Luo; Jeffrey F Naughton; Wenwei Xue,Abstract Web caching proxy servers are essential for improving web performance andscalability; and recent research has focused on making proxy caching work for database-backed web sites. In this paper; we explore a new proxy caching framework that exploits thequery semantics of HTML forms. We identify two common classes of form-based queriesfrom real-world database-backed web sites; namely; keyword-based queries and function-embedded queries. Using typical examples of these queries; we study two representativecaching schemes within our framework:(i) traditional passive query caching; and (ii) activequery caching; in which the proxy cache can service a request by evaluating a query overthe contents of the cache. Results from our experimental implementation show that our form-based proxy is a general and flexible approach that efficiently enables active caching …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2008,18
Cache-oblivious nested-loop joins,Bingsheng He; Qiong Luo,Abstract We propose to adapt the newly emerged cache-oblivious model to relational queryprocessing. Our goal is to automatically achieve an overall performance comparable to thatof fine-tuned algorithms on a multi-level memory hierarchy. This automaticity is becausecache-oblivious algorithms assume no knowledge about any specific parameter values;such as the capacity and block size of each level of the hierarchy. As a first step; we proposerecursive partitioning to implement cache-oblivious nested-loop joins (NLJs) withoutindexes; and recursive clustering and buffering to implement cache-oblivious NLJs withindexes. Our theoretical results and empirical evaluation on three different architecturesshow that our cache-oblivious NLJs match the performance of their manually optimized;cache-conscious counterparts.,Proceedings of the 15th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2006,18
Cache Portal: Technology for Accelerating Database-driven e-commerce Web Sites.,Wen-Syan Li; K Selçuk Candan; Wang-Pin Hsiung; Oliver Po; Divyakant Agrawal; Qiong Luo; Wei-Kuang Waine Huang; Yusuf Akca; Cemal Yilmaz,Response time is one key point of differentiation among electronic commerce (e-commerce)Web sites. Snafu and slow-downs at major Web sites during special events or peak timesdemonstrate the difficulty of scaling up ecommerce sites. Such slow response times anddown times can be devastating for e-commerce sites as indicated in a recent study by ZonaResearch [1] on the relationship between Web page download time and user abandonmentrate. The study shows that only 2% of users will leave a Web site (ie abandonment rate) ifthe download time is less than 7 seconds. However; The abandonment rate goes up to 70%when the download time is around 12 seconds. This study clearly establishes theimportance of fast response times to an e-commerce Web site to retain its customers.

Pattern-based event detection in sensor networks,Wenwei Xue; Qiong Luo; Hejun Wu,Abstract Many applications of wireless sensor networks monitor the physical world andreport events of interest. To facilitate event detection in these applications; in this paper wepropose a pattern-based event detection approach and integrate the approach into an in-network sensor query processing framework. Different from existing threshold-based eventdetection; we abstract events into patterns in sensory data and convert the problem of eventdetection into a pattern matching problem. We focus on applying single-node temporalpatterns; and define the general patterns as well as five types of basic patterns for eventspecification. Considering the limited storage on sensor nodes; we design an on-nodecache manager to maintain the historical data required for pattern matching and developevent-driven processing techniques for queries in our framework.

Quality aware query scheduling in wireless sensor networks,Hejun Wu; Qiong Luo; Jianjun Li; Alexandros Labrinidis,Abstract We study query scheduling in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) with a focus ontwo important metrics: Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Data (QoD). The motivationcomes from our observation that most WSN scheduling techniques ignore the qualityrequirements of queries. As a result; they are inefficient or inapplicable to quite a fewapplications that have different quality requirements. In this paper; we propose a distributedQuality Aware Scheduling (QAS) framework to address this problem. QAS works on top ofexisting quality-unaware query scheduling protocols and allows individual users to specifytheir QoS and QoD requirements on their queries. Given these quality requirements; QASdetermines the target qualities to be provided in scheduling and the execution order of thesequeries so as to maximize the total system profit.

High-performance short sequence alignment with GPU acceleration,Mian Lu; Yuwei Tan; Ge Bai; Qiong Luo,Abstract Sequence alignment is a fundamental task for computational genomics research.We develop G-Aligner; which adopts the GPU as a hardware accelerator to speed up thesequence alignment process. A leading CPU-based alignment tool is based on the Bi-BWTindex; however; a direct implementation of this algorithm on the GPU cannot fully utilize thehardware power due to its irregular algorithmic structure. To better utilize the GPU hardwareresource; we propose a filtering-verification algorithm employing both the Bi-BWT searchand direct matching. We further improve this algorithm on the GPU through variousoptimizations; eg; the split of a large kernel; the warp based implementation to avoid user-level synchronization. As a result; G-Aligner outperforms another state-of-the-art GPU-accelerated alignment tools SOAP3 by 1.8–3.5 times for in-memory sequence alignment.,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2012,15

FD-buffer: a buffer manager for databases on flash disks,Sai Tung On; Yinan Li; Bingsheng He; Ming Wu; Qiong Luo; Jianliang Xu,Abstract We design and implement FD-Buffer; a buffer manager for database systemsrunning on flash-based disks. Unlike magnetic disks; flash media has an inherent read-writeasymmetry: writes involve expensive erase operations and as a result are usually muchslower than reads. Therefore; we address this asymmetry in FD-Buffer. Specifically; we usethe average I/O cost per page access as opposed to the traditional miss rate as theperformance metric for a buffer. We develop a new replacement policy in which we separateclean and dirty pages into two pools. The size ratio of the two pools is automatically adaptedto the read-write asymmetry and the runtime workload. We evaluate FD-Buffer with trace-driven experiments on real flash disks. Our evaluation results show that our algorithmachieves up to 33% improvement on the overall performance on commodity flash disks; in …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,13
Academic conference homepage understanding using constrained hierarchical conditional random fields,Xin Xin; Juanzi Li; Jie Tang; Qiong Luo,Abstract We address the problem of academic conference homepage understanding for theSemantic Web. This problem consists of three labeling tasks-labeling conference functionpages; function blocks; and attributes. Different from traditional information extraction tasks;the data in academic conference homepages has complex structural dependencies acrossmultiple Web pages. In addition; there are logical constraints in the data. In this paper; wepropose a unified approach; Constrained Hierarchical Conditional Random Fields; toaccomplish the three labeling tasks simultaneously. In this approach; complex structuraldependencies can be well described. Also; the constrained Viterbi algorithm in the inferenceprocess can avoid logical errors.

Accurate emulation of wireless sensor networks,Hejun Wu; Qiong Luo; Pei Zheng; Bingsheng He; Lionel M Ni,Abstract Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have a wide range of useful; data-centricapplications; and major techniques involved in these applications include in-network queryprocessing and query-informed routing. Both techniques require realistic environments anddetailed system feedback for development and evaluation. Unfortunately; neither real sensornetworks nor existing simulators/emulators are suitable for this requirement.

Stack-based parallel recursion on graphics processors,Ke Yang; Bingsheng He; Qiong Luo; Pedro V Sander; Jiaoying Shi,Abstract Recent research has shown promising results on using graphics processing units(GPUs) to accelerate general-purpose computation. However; today's GPUs do not supportrecursive functions. As a result; for inherently recursive algorithms such as tree traversal;GPU programmers need to explicitly use stacks to emulate the recursion. Parallelizing suchstack-based implementation on the GPU increases the programming difficulty; moreover; it isunclear how to improve the efficiency of such parallel implementations. As a first step toaddress both ease of programming and efficiency issues; we propose three parallel stackimplementation alternatives that differ in the granularity of stack sharing. Taking treetraversals as an example; we study the performance tradeoffs between these alternativesand analyze their behaviors in various situations.

Template-based runtime invalidation for database-generated web contents,Chun Yi Choi; Qiong Luo,Abstract We propose a template based runtime invalidation approach for maintaining cacheconsistency of database generated web contents. In our approach; the invalidator sitsbetween a web cache and a database server; and intercepts query statements as well asupdate statements transparently. Moreover; it maintains templates for queries and updates;as well as a mapping between URLs and SQL queries. At runtime; the invalidator checks anupdate statement against the query statements whose corresponding HTML fragments havebeen cached; and decides on if any cached HTML fragments should be invalidated basedon an extended satisfiability testing algorithm without sending any polling queries to thebackend database. We further improve the efficiency of this checking process by utilizing thesemantic information of the templates.

A meta-search method with clustering and term correlation,Dyce Jing Zhao; Dik Lun Lee; Qiong Luo,Abstract A meta-search engine propagates user queries to its participant search enginesfollowing a server selection strategy. To facilitate server selection; the meta-search enginemust keep concise descriptors about the document collections indexed by the participantsearch engines. Most existing approaches record in the descriptors information about whatterms appear in a document collection; but they skip information about which documents akeyword appears in. This results in ineffective server ranking for multi-term queries; becausea document collection may contain all of the query terms but not all of the terms appear inthe same document. In this paper; we propose a server ranking approach in which eachsearch engine's document collection is divided into clusters by indexed terms. Furthermore;we keep the term correlation information in a cluster descriptor as a concise method to …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2004,10

In this paper; we propose a novel approach tomodel and detect events of interest in sensor networks. Our approach models an eventusing the kind of spatio-temporal sensor data distribution it generates; and specifies suchdistribution as a number of regression models over spatial regions within the networkcoverage at discrete points in time. The event is detected by matching the modeleddistribution with the real-time sensor data collected at a gateway.

EaseDB: a cache-oblivious in-memory query processor,Bingsheng He; Yinan Li; Qiong Luo; Dongqing Yang,Abstract We propose to demonstrate EaseDB; the first cache-oblivious queryprocessor for in-memory relational query processing. The cache-oblivious notion from the theory communityrefers to the property that no parameters in an algorithm or a data structure need to be tunedfor a specific memory hierarchy for optimality. As a result; EaseDB automatically optimizesthe cache performance as well as the overall performance of query processing on anymemory hierarchy. We have developed a visualization interface to show the detailedperformance of EaseDB in comparison with its cache-conscious counterpart; with both theparameters in the cache-conscious algorithms and the hardware platforms varied.,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,9
Distributed; hierarchical clustering and summarization in sensor networks,Xiuli Ma; Shuangfeng Li; Qiong Luo; Dongqing Yang; Shiwei Tang,Abstract We propose DHCS; a method of distributed; hierarchical clustering andsummarization for online data analysis and mining in sensor networks. Different from theacquisition and aggregation of raw sensory data; our method clusters sensor nodes basedon their current data values as well as their geographical proximity; and computes asummary for each cluster. Furthermore; these clusters; together with their summaries; areproduced in a distributed; bottom-up manner. The resulting hierarchy of clusters and theirsummaries facilitates interactive data exploration at multiple resolutions. It can also be usedto improve the efficiency of data-centric routing and query processing in sensor networks.Our simulation results on real world data sets as well as synthetic data sets show theeffectiveness and efficiency of our approach.,*,2007,9

Resveratrol hada wide spectrum of healthy beneficial effects with multiple targets. Interestingly; its tetramer;vaticaffinol; exerted more intensive immunosuppressive activity than resveratrol. Vaticaffinolsignificantly inhibited T cells proliferation activated by concanavalin A (Con A) or anti-CD3plus anti-CD28 in a dose-and time-dependent manner. It also induced Con A-activated Tcells undergoing apoptosis through mitochondrial pathway. Moreover; this compoundprevented cells from entering S phase and G2/M phase during T cells activation.

Adaptive holistic scheduling for query processing in sensor networks,Hejun Wu; Qiong Luo,Abstract We observe two deficiencies of current query processing and schedulingtechniques for sensor networks:(1) A query execution plan does not adapt to the hardwarecharacteristics of sensing devices; and (2) the data communication schedule of each node isnot adapted to the query runtime workload. Both cause time and energy waste in queryprocessing in sensor networks. To address this problem; we propose an adaptive holisticscheduler; AHS; to run on each node in a wireless sensor network. AHS schedules both thequery evaluation and the wireless communication operations; and is able to adapt theschedule to the runtime dynamics of these operations on each node. We have implementedAHS and tested it on real motes as well as in simulation. Our results show that AHSimproves the performance of query processing in various dynamic settings.,Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing,2010,8

FD-Buffer: A cost-based adaptive buffer replacement algorithm for flashmemory devices,Sai Tung On; Shen Gao; Bingsheng He; Ming Wu; Qiong Luo; Jianliang Xu,In this paper; we present a design and implementation of FD-Buffer; a cost-based adaptivebuffer manager for flash memory devices. Due to flash memory's unique hardware features;it has an inherent read-write asymmetry: writes involve expensive erase operations; whichusually makes them much slower than reads. To address this read-write asymmetry; werevisit buffer management and consider the average I/O cost per page access as the maincost metric; as opposed to the traditional miss rate. While there have been a number ofbuffer management algorithms that take the read-write asymmetry into consideration; mostalgorithms fail to effectively adapt to the runtime workload or different degrees of asymmetry.In this paper; we develop a new replacement algorithm in which we separate clean and dirtypages into two pools. The size ratio of the two pools is automatically adapted based on …,IEEE Transactions on Computers,2014,7
Accelerating topic model training on a single machine,Mian Lu; Ge Bai; Qiong Luo; Jie Tang; Jiuxin Zhao,Abstract We present the design and implementation of GLDA; a library that utilizes the GPU(Graphics Processing Unit) to perform Gibbs sampling of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) ona single machine. LDA is an effective topic model used in many applications; eg;classification; feature selection; and information retrieval. However; training an LDA modelon large data sets takes hours; even days; due to the heavy computation and intensivememory access. Therefore; we explore the use of the GPU to accelerate LDA training on asingle machine. Specifically; we propose three memory-efficient techniques to handle largedata sets on the GPU:(1) generating document-topic counts as needed instead of storing allof them;(2) adopting a compact storage scheme for sparse matrices; and (3) partitioningword tokens. Through these techniques; the LDA training which would take 10 GB …,Asia-Pacific Web Conference,2013,7
VPeers: A peer-to-peer service discovery framework for Virtual Manufacturing Organizations,Anbo Xiang; Liming Liu; Qiong Luo,Abstract We present VPeers; a peer-to-peer service discovery framework for a VirtualManufacturing Organization (VMO). In our framework; each VPeer (a VMO member)publishes the services that it intends to share and maintains a list of friend VPeers that it hasrecently interacted with. When a VPeer receives a search query; it will first search its localservices. If the search query is not satisfied locally; this VPeer will forward the query to itsfriend VPeers with an additional time constraint. This process continues recursively until thesearch query is fully satisfied or the time allowed by the constraint has elapsed. The featuresof the VPeers framework include:(1) a fully distributed search process;(2) a search queryinvolving both string matches and range predicates; and (3) a ranking scheme that rankssearch results by predefined quality measures.

System design issues in sensor databases,Qiong Luo; Hejun Wu,Abstract In-network sensor query processing systems (ISQPs); or sensor databases; havebeen developed to acquire; process and aggregate data from wireless sensor networks(WSNs). Because WSNs are resource-limited and involve multiple layers of embeddedsoftware; the system design issues have a significant impact on the performance of sensordatabases. Therefore; we propose this tutorial to study the state of the art on these issueswith a focus on their interaction with query processing techniques. Our goal is to present thechallenges and efforts in developing holistic; efficient ISQPs. Specifically; we will coverarchitectural design; scheduling; data-centric routing; and wireless medium access control.This tutorial is intended for database researchers who are interested in sensor networks.,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,7
A comparative study on classifying the functions of web page blocks,Xiangye Xiao; Qiong Luo; Xing Xie; Wei-Ying Ma,Abstract In this paper; we study the problem of learning block classification models toestimate block functions. We distinguish general models; which are learned across multiplesites; and site-specific models; which are learned within individual sites. We further considerseveral factors that affect the learning process and model effectiveness. These factorsinclude the layout features; the content features; the classifiers; and the term selectionmethods. We have empirically evaluated the performance of the models when the factorsare varied. Our main results are that layout features do better than content features forlearning both general and site-specific models.,Proceedings of the 15th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2006,7
Cache-Oblivious hash joins,Bingsheng He; Qiong Luo,Abstract Partitioning has been used to improve the performance of the hash join in the mainmemory; however; cache-conscious partitioning requires the knowledge about the cacheparameters; such as the capacity and unit size; of a chosen level of the CPU caches; eg; theL2 cache. Obtaining this knowledge and subsequently tuning the algorithm may beinconvenient; and sometimes infeasible; for complex systems. As evidence; our experimentson three different hardware platforms show that; on each platform; the best partitioninggranularity was none of the cache parameters. Therefore; we propose a cache-obliviousapproach to partitioned hash joins; in which the algorithm is aware of the existence of thememory hierarchy but requires no knowledge about the parameter values. In specific; weperform binary partitioning on a join relation recursively until the base case is reached. To …,Hong Kong University Technical Report,2006,7

Regulation of thepolarization has been reported to be effective therapeutics for various kinds of inflammatorydiseases. The aims of the present study were to investigate the anti-inflammatory property ofisomeranzin isolating from Murraya exotica as well as potential molecular mechanisms.Results showed that isomeranzin specifically reduced the M1 macrophage-associated pro-inflammatory cytokines through down-regulation of NF-κB and ERK signals.Immunoprecipitation and RNA silencing indicated suppression of isomeranzin in NF-κBactivation was relying on the decreasing of TRAF6 ubiquitination.

We propose data edibilization; ie;encoding data with edible materials; as a novel approach to leverage multiple sensorychannels to convey data stories. We conduct a preliminary data tasting workshop to explorehow users interact with and interpret data edibilization. Based on the participants' feedback;we summarize the advantages of edibilization in terms of attractiveness; richness;memorability; affectiveness; and sociability. We also identify several challenges with dataedibilization. We discuss possible pragmatic processes; enabling technologies; andpotential research opportunities to provide insights into the design space of dataedibilization and its practicality.,Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2016,6
Continuous; online monitoring and analysis in large water distribution networks,Xiuli Ma; Hongmei Xiao; Shuiyuan Xie; Qiong Li; Qiong Luo; Chunhua Tian,Clean drinking water and safe water supply is vital to our life. Recent advances intechnologies have made it possible to deploy smart sensor networks in large waterdistribution networks to monitor and identify the water quality online. In such a large-scalereal-time monitoring application; large amounts of data stream out of multiple concurrentsensors continuously. In this paper; we present a system to monitor and analyze the sensordata streams online; find and summarize the spatio-temporal distribution patterns andcorrelations in co-evolving data; detect contamination events rapidly and facilitate correctiveactions or notification. The system consists of an online data mining engine and a GUIproviding the user with the current patterns discovered in the network; and an alerternotifying the user if there is anomalous water quality in the network.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,6
Discovering co-located queries in geographic search logs,Xiangye Xiao; Longhao Wang; Xing Xie; Qiong Luo,Abstract A geographic search request contains a query consisting of one or more keywords;and a search-location that the user searches for. In this paper; we study the problem ofdiscovering co-located queries; which are geographic search requests for nearby search-locations. One example co-located query pattern is {" shopping mall";" parking"}. This patternindicates that people often search" shopping mall" and" parking" over locations close to oneanother. Co-located queries have many applications; such as query suggestion; locationrecommendation; and local advertisement. We formally define co-located query patterns andpropose two approaches to mining the patterns. Our basic approach is based on an existingspatial mining algorithm. To find more specific co-located queries that only appear in specificregions; we propose a lattice based approach. It divides the geographic space into …,Proceedings of the first international workshop on Location and the web,2008,6
Supporting adaptive sampling in wireless sensor networks,Hejun Wu; Qiong Luo,Adaptive sampling is proposed to improve the power efficiency of wireless sensor networksin that the sampling rate of a sensor node can change in response to the changes in theenvironment. To transmit the sampled data promptly; the nodes with different anddynamically changing sampling rates have to transmit at different and changing ratescorrespondingly; which in turn causes severe packet loss and power consumption. Toaddress this problem; we propose a routing-layer scheduling scheme; SPAS; to supportadaptive sampling. In SPAS; each node keeps a record of packets to be forwarded andwakes up at scheduled times to transmit and to receive. Furthermore; each node candynamically optimize its route to the sink based on the transmission rates of its neighboringnodes. Our simulation results show that SPAS achieves both high power efficiency and a …,Wireless Communications and Networking Conference; 2007. WCNC 2007. IEEE,2007,6
DPTree: a distributed pattern tree index for partial-match queries in peer-to-peer networks,Dyce Jing Zhao; Dik Lun Lee; Qiong Luo,Abstract Partial-match queries return data items that contain a subset of the query keywordsand order the results based on the statistical properties of the matched keywords. They areessential for information retrieval on large document repositories. However; most currentpeer-to-peer networks for information retrieval are based on distributed hashing and as suchcannot support partial-match queries efficiently. In this paper; we describe an efficient andscalable technique to support partial-match queries on peer-to-peer networks. We observethat the combinations of keywords in the queries are only a small subset of all possiblecombinations of the keywords in the documents. Therefore; we propose a distributed indexstructure; called a distributed pattern tree (DPTree); to record frequent query patterns; ie;combinations of keywords; learnt from the query history at each node in the network …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,6

Template-based proxy caching for table-valued functions,Qiong Luo; Wenwei Xue,Abstract Certain types of database-backed web sites heavily utilize user-defined functions inSQL queries. Unfortunately; existing web proxy caching schemes can not handle thesefunctions. In order to enable proxy caching for such web sites; we propose a template-basedproxy caching framework; a function proxy; for table-valued functions. In our framework;function templates are registered with the proxy so that the proxy can answer new queriesbased on previously cached data in collaboration with the original web site. We identify acommon class of function-embedded queries and present several active caching schemesfor them. Our experiments with real web sites show the feasibility and usefulness of thefunction proxy. Additionally; we find that cache-intersecting queries may not be worthhandling at the proxy and that containment-based active caching is efficient and practical.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2004,6
Parallelizing astronomical source extraction on the GPU,Baoxue Zhao; Qiong Luo; Chao Wu,In astronomical observatory projects; raw images are processed so that information aboutthe celestial objects in the images is extracted into catalogs. As such; this source extractionis the basis for the various analysis tasks that are subsequently performed on the catalogproducts. With the rapid progress of new; large astronomical projects; observational imageswill be produced every few seconds. This high speed of image production requires fastsource extraction. Unfortunately; current source extraction tools cannot meet the speedrequirement. To address this problem; we propose to use the GPU (Graphics ProcessingUnit) to accelerate source extraction. Specifically; we start from SExtractor; an astronomicalsource extraction tool widely used in astronomy projects; and study its parallelization on theGPU.

Accelerating in-memory cross match of astronomical catalogs,Senhong Wang; Yan Zhao; Qiong Luo; Chao Wu; Yang Xv,New astronomy projects generate observation images continuously and these images areconverted into tabular catalogs online. Furthermore; each such new table; called a sampletable; is compared against a reference table on the same patch of sky to annotate the starsthat match those in the reference and to identify transient objects that have no matches. Thiscross match must be done within a few seconds to enable timely issuance of alerts as wellas shipping of the data products off the pipeline. To perform the online cross match of tableson celestial objects; we propose two parallel algorithms; zone Match and grid Match; both ofwhich divide up celestial objects by their locations in the spherical coordinate system.Specifically; zone Match divides the observation area by the declination coordinate of thecelestial sphere whereas grid Match utilizes a two-dimensional grid on the declination …,eScience (eScience); 2013 IEEE 9th International Conference on,2013,4

Accelerating astronomical image subtraction on heterogeneous processors,Yan Zhao; Qiong Luo; Senhong Wang; Chao Wu,Image subtraction is an effective method used in astronomy to search transient objects oridentify objects that have time-varying brightness. The state-of-the-art astronomical imagesubtraction methods work by taking two aligned images of the same observation area;calculating a space-varying convolution kernel for the two images; and finally obtaining thedifference image using the convolution kernel. With the need for fast image subtraction inastronomy projects; we study the parallelization of HOTPANTS; a popular astronomicalimage subtraction package by Andrew Becker; on multicore CPUs and GPUs. Specifically;we identify the components in HOTPANTS that are data parallel and parallelize thesecomponents on the GPU and multicore CPU. We divide the work between the CPU and theGPU to minimize the overall time. In the GPU-based components; we investigate the …,eScience (eScience); 2013 IEEE 9th International Conference on,2013,3
PTL: Partitioned logging for database storage on flash solid state drives,Robin Jun Yang; Qiong Luo,Abstract We propose Partitioned Logging (PTL); a storage layout for databases on flashsolid state drives. In PTL; we replace data writes with logging; and put data and logs intoseparate blocks. Moreover; we group data blocks into partitions so that updates on eachpartition are appended as log entries to one log block. This way; we can tune the partitionsize to balance the read and write performance based on the hardware and workloadcharacteristics. We have implemented PTL in PostgreSQL; which involves moderatechanges to the buffer manager; the storage manager; and the transaction manager. Wehave also developed an analytical model to determine the PTL parameter values. We haveevaluated PTL using the standard TPC-C benchmark as well as homegrown workloads. Theempirical results match our analytical analysis; and show a considerable improvement …,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2012,3
Integrating GPU-accelerated sequence alignment and SNP detection for genome resequencing analysis,Mian Lu; Yuwei Tan; Jiuxin Zhao; Ge Bai; Qiong Luo,Abstract DNA sequence alignment and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection aretwo important tasks in genomics research. A common genome resequencing analysisworkflow is to first perform sequence alignment and then detect SNPs among the alignedsequences. In practice; the performance bottleneck in this workflow is usually theintermediate result I/O due to the separation of the two components; especially when the in-memory computation has been accelerated; eg; by graphics processors. To address thisbottleneck; we propose to integrate the two tasks tightly so as to eliminate the I/O ofintermediate results in the workflow. Specifically; we make the following three changes forthe tight integration:(1) we adopt a partition-based approach so that the external sorting ofalignment results; which was required for SNP detection; is eliminated;(2) we perform …,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2012,3
Learning bidirectional asymmetric similarity for collaborative filtering via matrix factorization,Bin Cao; Qiang Yang; Jian-Tao Sun; Zheng Chen,Abstract Memory-based collaborative filtering (CF) aims at predicting the rating of a certainitem for a particular user based on the previous ratings from similar users and/or similaritems. Previous studies in finding similar users and items have several drawbacks. First; theyare based on user-defined similarity measurements; such as Pearson CorrelationCoefficient (PCC) or Vector Space Similarity (VSS); which are; for the most part; not adaptiveand optimized for specific applications and data. Second; these similarity measures arerestricted to symmetric ones such that the similarity between A and B is the same as that forB and A; although symmetry may not always hold in many real world applications. Third;they typically treat the similarity functions between users and functions between itemsseparately. However; in reality; the similarities between users and between items are inter …,Data mining and knowledge discovery,2011,3
Adaptive Index Utilization in Memory-Resident Structural Joins,B He; Q Luo; B Choi,We consider adaptive index utilization as a fine-grained problem in autonomic databases inwhich an existing index is dynamically determined to be used or not in query processing. Asa special case; we study this problem for structural joins; the core operator in XML queryprocessing; in the main memory. We find that index utilization is beneficial for structural joinsonly under certain join selectivity and distribution of matching elements. Therefore; wepropose adaptive algorithms to decide whether to use an index probe or a data scan foreach step of matching during the processing of a structural join operator. Our adaptivealgorithms are based on the history; the look-ahead information; or both. We havedeveloped a cost model to facilitate this adaptation and have conducted experiments withboth synthetic and real-world data sets. Our results show that adaptively utilizing indexes …,Knowledge and Data Engineering; IEEE Transactions on,2007,3

A guided tour of literature review: Facilitating academic paper reading with narrative visualization,Yun Wang; Dingyu Liu; Huamin Qu; Qiong Luo; Xiaojuan Ma,Abstract Reading academic paper is a daily task for researchers and graduate students.However; reading effectively can be challenging; particularly for novices in scientificresearch. For example; when readers are reading the related work section that cites a fairnumber of references in limited page space; they often need to flip back and forth betweenthe text and the references and may also frequently search elsewhere for more informationabout the references. This increases the difficulty of understanding a paper. In this paper; wepropose a narrative visualization system that helps the reading of academic papers. As afirst step; we adopt narrative visualization to present literature review as interactive slides.Specifically; we propose a narrative structure with three levels of granularities that the readercan drill down or roll up freely. The logic flow of a slideshow can be organized based on …,Proceedings of the 9th International Symposium on Visual Information Communication and Interaction,2016,2
Multi-assignment single joins for parallel cross-match of astronomic catalogs on heterogeneous clusters,Xiaoying Jia; Qiong Luo,Abstract Cross-match is a central operation in astronomic databases to integrate multiplecatalogs of celestial objects. With the rapid development of new astronomy projects; largeamounts of astronomic catalogs are generated and require fast cross-match with existingdatabases. In this paper; we propose to adopt a Multi-Assignment Single Join (MASJ)method for cross-match on heterogeneous clusters that consist of both CPUs and GPUs. Wechose MASJ for cross-match; because (1) cross-matching records from astronomic catalogsis essentially a spatial distance join on two sets of points; and (2) each reference point ismapped to only a small number of search intervals. As a result; the MASJ cross-match; orMASJ-CM algorithm is feasible and highly efficient in a heterogeneous cluster environment.We have implemented MASJ-CM in two packages: one is an MPI-CUDA implementation …,Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2016,2

As current commodity clusters typically consist of heterogeneous processorsincluding both multi-core CPUs and GPUs; we study how to efficiently cross-match largeastronomical catalogs on such clusters. Specifically; we develop a three-phase commonalgorithm for parallel cross-match; and optimize it for a single GPU; multiple GPUs on anode; and a heterogeneous cluster of multiple nodes; respectively. Furthermore; we studythe performance impact of data chunk size and that of inter-node communicationmechanisms in the cluster.

Such data distribution can be got through clustering; whichpartitions the network into contiguous regions; each of which contains sensor nodes of arange of similar readings. This paper proposes a method named Distributed; HierarchicalClustering (DHC) for online data analysis and mining in senior networks. Different from theacquisition and aggregation of raw sensory data; DHC clusters sensor nodes based on theircurrent data values as well as their geographical proximity; and computes a summary foreach cluster. Furthermore; these clusters; together with their summaries; are produced in adistributed; bottom-up manner. The resulting hierarchy of clusters and their summariesfacilitates interactive data exploration at multiple resolutions. It can also be used to …,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2011,2

Cuttle: Enabling Cross-Column Compression in Distributed Column Stores,Hao Liu; Jiang Xiao; Xianjun Guo; Haoyu Tan; Qiong Luo; Lionel M Ni,Abstract We observe that; in real-world distributed data warehouse systems; data columnsfrom different sources often exhibit redundancy. Even though these systems can employboth general and column-oriented compression schemes to reduce the data storagepressure; such cross-column redundancy (CCR) is not recognized or exploited effectively.Therefore; we propose Cuttle; a column storage system that enables cross-columncompression to reduce CCR. Specifically; we identify three kinds of CCR and develop areferential transformation encoding (RTE) scheme to compress multiple columns of data withCCR. Furthermore; we address the CCR selection problem and propose a greedy algorithmto generate cross-column compression schemes. Our experiments on real-world datasetsshow that Cuttle can further reduce data size by half after applying both the column …,Asia-Pacific Web (APWeb) and Web-Age Information Management (WAIM) Joint Conference on Web and Big Data,2017,1
HIMM: An HMM-Based Interactive Map-Matching System,Xibo Zhou; Ye Ding; Haoyu Tan; Qiong Luo; Lionel M Ni,Abstract Due to the inaccuracy of GPS devices; the location error of raw GPS points can beup to several hundred meters. Many applications using GPS-based vehicle location datarequire map-matching to pre-process GPS points by aligning them to a road network.However; existing map-matching algorithms can be limited in accuracy due to variousfactors including low sampling rates; abnormal GPS points; and dense road networks. In thispaper; we propose the design and implementation of HIMM; an H MM-based I nteractive Map-M atching system that produces accurate map-matching results through humaninteraction. The main idea is to involve human annotations in the matching process of someelaborately selected error-prone points and to let the system automatically adjust thematching of the remaining points.

T lymphocyte SHP2-deficiency triggers anti-tumor immunity to inhibit colitis-associated cancer in mice,Wen Liu; Wenjie Guo; Lihong Shen; Zhen Chen; Qiong Luo; Xiaolin Luo; GenSheng Feng; Yongqian Shu; Yanhong Gu; Qiang Xu; Yang Sun,Abstract Nonresolving inflammation is involved in the initiation and progression process oftumorigenesis. Src homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2) is knownto inhibit acute inflammation but its role in chronic inflammation-associated cancer remainsunclear. The role of SHP2 in T cells in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis andazoxymethane-DSS-induced colitis-associated carcinogenesis was examined using SHP2CD4−/− conditional knockout mice. SHP2 deficiency in T cells aggravated colitis withincreased level of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IFN-γ and IL-17A. In contrast; theSHP2 CD4−/− mice developed much fewer and smaller tumors than wild type mice withhigher level of IFN-γ and enhanced cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells in the tumor and peritumoralareas.

Animated narrative visualization for video clickstream data,Yun Wang; Zhutian Chen; Quan Li; Xiaojuan Ma; Qiong Luo; Huamin Qu,Abstract Video clickstream data are important for understanding user behaviors andimproving online video services. Various visual analytics techniques have been proposed toexplore patterns in these data. However; those techniques are mainly developed foranalysis and do not sufficiently support presentations. It is still difficult for data analysts toconvey their findings to an audience without prior knowledge. In this paper; we propose touse animated narrative visualization to present video clickstream data. Compared withtraditional methods which directly turn click events into animations; our animated narrativevisualization focuses on conveying the patterns in the data to a general audience andadopts two novel designs; non-linear time mapping and foreshadowing; to make thepresentation more engaging and interesting.

Robust shrinkage m-estimators of large covariance matrices,Nicolas Auguin; David Morales-Jimenez; Matthew McKay; Romain Couillet,Robust high dimensional covariance estimators are considered; comprising regularized(linear shrinkage) modifications of Maronna's classical M-estimators. Such estimators aim toprovide robustness to outliers; while simultaneously giving well-defined solutions under highdimensional scenarios where the number of samples does not exceed the number ofvariables. By applying tools from random matrix theory; we characterize the asymptoticperformance of such estimators when the number of samples and variables grow largetogether. In particular; our results show that; when outliers are absent; many estimators ofthe shrinkage-Maronna type share the same asymptotic performance; and for suchestimators we present a data-driven method for choosing the asymptotically optimalshrinkage parameter. Although our results assume an outlier-free scenario; simulations …,Statistical Signal Processing Workshop (SSP); 2016 IEEE,2016,1
Stac: Enhancing stacked graphs for time series analysis,Yun Wang; Tongshuang Wu; Zhutian Chen; Qiong Luo; Huamin Qu,Stacked graphs have been widely used to represent multiple time series simultaneously toshow the changes of individual values and their aggregation over time. However; when thenumber of time series becomes very large; the layers representing time series with smallvalues take up only very small proportions in the stacked graph; making them hard to trace.As a result; it is challenging for analysts to detect the correlation of individual layers and theiraggregation; and find trend similarities and differences between layers solely with stackedgraphs. In this paper; we study the correlations of individual layers; and their aggregation intime series data presented with stacked graphs; focusing on the local regions within anygiven time intervals. Specifically; we present STAC; an interactive visual analytics system; tohelp analysts gain insights into the correlations in stacked graphs.

GPU-Accelerated Cloud Computing for Data-Intensive Applications,Baoxue Zhao; Jianlong Zhong; Bingsheng He; Qiong Luo; Wenbin Fang; Naga K Govindaraju,Abstract Recently; many large-scale data-intensive applications have emerged from theInternet and science domains. They pose significant challenges on the performance;scalability and programmability of existing data management systems. The challenges areeven greater when these data management systems run on emerging parallel anddistributed hardware and software platforms. In this chapter; we study the use of the GPU(Graphics Processing Units) in MapReduce and general graph processing in the Cloud forthese data-intensive applications.

Accelerating minor allele frequency computation with graphics processors,Mian Lu; Jiuxin Zhao; Qiong Luo; Bingqiang Wang,Abstract The computation of minor allele frequency (MAF) is at the core of a Genome-WideAssociation Study (GWAS). Due to the high computation intensity and high precisionrequirement; so far the scale of MAF computation analysis is up to hundreds of individuals.To enable the computation for thousands of individuals; we have developed GAMA; a highperformance MAF computation program with GPU acceleration. Specifically; we design aparallel reduction algorithm that matches the GPU's data-parallel architecture. To implementthe new algorithm efficiently on the GPU; we utilize the fast; on-chip local memory sharedwithin each GPU multiprocessor effectively. To avoid user-level thread synchronization; weexploit the GPU thread-warp based scheduling. Furthermore; we address the floating pointunderflow issue through a logarithm transformation. As a result; GAMA enables MAF …,Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Big Data; Streams and Heterogeneous Source Mining: Algorithms; Systems; Programming Models and Applications,2012,1
A general framework for improving query processing performance on multi-level memory hierarchies,Bingsheng He; Yinan Li; Qiong Luo; Dongqing Yang,Abstract We propose a general framework for improving the query processing performanceon multi-level memory hierarchies. Our motivation is that (1) the memory hierarchy is animportant performance factor for query processing;(2) both the memory hierarchy anddatabase systems are becoming increasingly complex and diverse; and (3) increasing theamount of tuning does not always improve the performance. Therefore; we categorizemultiple levels of memory performance tuning and quantify their performance impacts. As acase study; we use this framework to improve the in-memory performance of storagemodels; B+-trees; nested-loop joins and hash joins. Our empirical evaluation verifies theusefulness of the proposed framework.,Proceedings of the 3rd international workshop on Data management on new hardware,2007,1
Collaboratively querying sensor networks through handheld devices,Tsz Wai Chiu; Qiong Luo,We envision that in some wireless sensor network applications; such as environmentalmonitoring; assisted living; and industrial control; handheld devices will be used from time totime to query the sensor networks. However; there is no full-fledged query processor for thispurpose. Therefore; we propose WinyDB; a relational query processing system on Windows-CE based PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants) for sensor networks. One of the main featuresof WinyDB is that multiple PDAs running WinyDB can answer queries collaboratively. Thisfeature is useful in that it improves both the energy efficiency and the data quality. OurWinyDB prototype package is available online at http://www. cse. ust. hk/winydb and oursimulation experiments have shown promising results on collaborative query processing.,Mobile Data Management; 2007 International Conference on,2007,1
Adaptive Holistic Scheduling for In-Network Sensor Query Processing,Hejun Wu; Qiong Luo,ABSTRACT We observe two problems in the current scheduling schemes for in-networksensor query processing:(1) A query execution plan never changes after it is injected intothe network and (2) the data communication schedule rarely considers the query workload.Both problems severely hurt the performance; because the runtime dynamics; such as thewireless connectivity and the data flows; change frequently and affect the performancegreatly. To address these two problems; we propose an adaptive; holistic scheduler; AHS;which schedules both the query operators and the data communication; and is able to adaptthe schedules to the runtime dynamics. We have implemented AHS in nesC and have testedit on real motes as well as in simulation. Our results show that AHS improves theperformance of query processing in various dynamic settings.,Completed for IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2007,1
Binary Search Join between an IR System and an RDBMS,Ernest Dawei Wang; Qiong Luo; Dongqing Yang; Shiwei Tang,Integrating relational database technologies into Web information retrieval enables users toask complex queries beyond traditional keyword searches over Web pages. One approachto this integration is to have a software layer on top of an information retrieval (IR) systemand an RDBMS (relational database management system). A core operation in this top layeris to join the intermediate results from the two underlying systems (called the IR results andthe DB results correspondingly) in order to produce the final ranked results for each query.Unfortunately; most conventional join algorithms are inefficient for this operation. In thispaper; we propose one simple join algorithm called binary search join (BSJ) for theoperation of joining the IR results and the DB results. This algorithm takes advantage of thefact that the IR results are already ranked by relevance and that the DB results are …,Web Intelligence; 2006. WI 2006.

Information retrieval in a peer-to-peer environment,Dik Lun Lee; Dyce Jing Zhao; Qiong Luo,Abstract Due to rapid information growth; peer-to-peer (P2P) systems have become apromising alternative to centralized; client/server-based approaches for large-scale datasharing. By allowing peers to join and leave the system freely; they offer the peers autonomyto control their own resources; high scalability and high robustness against single-peerfailures. P2P systems have many applications. This paper focuses on peer-to-peerinformation retrieval (P2PIR); which aims to retrieve textual documents based on theircontents and ranks them based on some relevance measures against the query. The" opennature" of P2P systems and their lack of centralized control pose difficult challenges to thesearch capability and performance of P2PIR systems.

Proxy caching for database-backed web sites,Qiong Luo,Abstract Database-backed web sites face great challenges in performance and scalability;due to the large and growing amount of online activity at these sites. To address thisperformance and scalability problem; we study research issues in improving common proxycaching techniques for database-backed web sites. The key insight of the work in this area isto add some query processing capability to web proxies so that they can share the workloadof the backend database server. We discuss alternatives and considerations on adding aquery processing capability to a web proxy using our work as examples. We find that it isfeasible and useful to have web proxies perform advanced caching beyond exact URLmatching for database-backed web sites.,*,2005,1
Function proxy: template-based proxy caching for table-valued functions,Qiong Luo; Wenwei Xue,In this paper; we demonstrate advanced proxy-caching techniques for function-embeddedqueries. We term our proxy a function proxy. It does not only service a function-embeddedquery that is an exact match to a previous one; but also services a query that can beanswered by processing results of previous queries. We focus on table-valued functions(which return a set of tuples) as opposed to scalar functions (which return a scalar value);because the former brings additional challenges as well as opportunities for our functionproxy.,Data Engineering; 2004.

A novel combination of astilbin and low-dose methotrexate respectively targeting A 2A AR and its ligand adenosine for the treatment of collagen-induced arthritis,Yuxiang Ma; Zhe Gao; Fang Xu; Li Liu; Qiong Luo; Yan Shen; Xuefeng Wu; Xingxin Wu; Yang Sun; Xudong Wu; Qiang Xu,Abstract Methotrexate (MTX) is widely used for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment withfrequently serious adverse effects. Therefore; combination of low-dose MTX with other drugsis often used in clinic. In this study; we investigated the improvement of astilbin and low-doseMTX combination on collagen-induced arthritis in DBA/1J mice. Results showed that theclinic score; incidence rate; paw swelling; pathological changes of joints and rheumatoidfactors were more alleviated in combination therapy than MTX or astilbin alone group.Elevated antibodies (IgG; IgG1; IgG2a; IgM and anti-collagen IgG) and pro-inflammatorycytokines (IL-1β; IL-6; TNF-α and IFN-γ) in serum were significantly inhibited; while anti-inflammatory cytokine; IL-10; was enhanced by combination therapy.

Small molecule-mediated upregulation of CCR7 ameliorates murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by accelerating T-cell homing,Xin Li; Tingting Lu; Wenwen Xue; Yixuan Wang; Qiong Luo; Huiming Ge; Renxiang Tan; Yan Shen; Qiang Xu,Abstract Impairing the infiltration of immune cells into the CNS is a promising target forsuppressing the development of multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model experimentalautoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Here; we found that oral administration of a syntheticsmall molecular compound Fc24 showed potential preventive effects on the development ofEAE; including the reduction in EAE severity and a delay in the onset of the disease. Fc24facilitated the accumulation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells within spleen and lymph nodes;while having no effect on MOG-specific T cell responses. Furthermore; CCR7 expressionwas upregulated by Fc24 on activated T cells in vivo and in vitro; accompanied by ERKactivation in the treated T cells in response to CCL19.

TICC: Transparent Inter-Column Compression for Column-Oriented Database Systems,Hao Liu; Yudian Ji; Jiang Xiao; Haoyu Tan; Qiong Luo; Lionel M Ni,Abstract In this paper; we present TICC; an automatic data compression component that cantransparently eliminate data redundancies across columns in column-oriented databasesystems. We further propose two approaches to integrate inter-column compression intoexisting database systems. One approach is to use User Defined Functions (UDFs); and theother is native. We implement these two approaches on top of Hive based on the ORC file; acommon data format in column stores; and evaluate the performance of TICC using real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that TICC can significantly reduce thestorage overhead and process a variety of queries over large-scale data with up to 20%performance improvement over the original Hive.,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2017,*
Accelerating Exact Protein Structure Alignment with Graphics Processors,Yishui Wu; Shuang Qiu; Qiong Luo,Among different structural alignment tools; DALIX is one capable of calculating an optimalstructural alignment based on the DALI score in most cases. It outperforms DALI; one of themost popular structural alignment algorithms; on the alignment quality. However; the hightime complexity of DALIX hinders its application to large protein or complex structurealignments. In this paper; we parallelize the major steps of DALIX on the GPU (GraphicsProcessing Units) to speed up its processing. Specifically; to better utilize the massive GPUthread parallelism; we design a two-level parallel algorithm for the dynamic programming;which is the most time-consuming component in the tool. We compact the decision table inthe dynamic programming so that it can fit into the shared memory for inter-threadcommunication to further improve the performance.

Parallelizing Big De Bruijn Graph Construction on Heterogeneous Processors,Shuang Qiu; Qiong Luo,De Bruijn graph construction is the first step in de novo assemblers to connect input readsinto a complete sequence without a reference genome. This step is both time and memoryspace consuming. To address this problem; we develop ParaHash; a system that partitionsthe input data in a compact format; parallelizes the computation on both the CPUs and theGPUs in a single computer; and performs hash-based De Bruijn graph construction. Thisway; ParaHash utilizes all available processors to assemble big genomes that cannot fit intomemory. Furthermore; we analyze the characteristics of genome data to set the hash tablesize; design concurrent hashing algorithms to handle the inherent multiplicity; and pipelinethe data transfer and the computation for further efficiency.

ACTS: An Active Learning Method for Time Series Classification,Fengchao Peng; Qiong Luo; Lionel M Ni,Active learning has been widely used to select the most informative data for labeling inclassification tasks; except for time series classification. The main challenge of activelearning in time series classification is to evaluate the informativeness of a time seriesinstance. Specifically; many informativeness metrics have been proposed for traditionalactive learning; however; none of them is particularly effective on time series data. In thispaper; we design an informativeness metric that considers the characteristics of time seriesdata in defining our instance uncertainty and utility. We prove that our informativeness metricis a submodular set function; and further develop an effective and efficient algorithm to selectthe most informative time series instances for training.

Detecting Unmetered Taxi Rides from Trajectory Data,Xibo Zhou; Ye Ding; Fengchao Peng; Qiong Luo; Lionel Ni,Abstract—Taxi fraud has become a serious problem in many large cities; where passengersare overcharged by taxi drivers in various ways. Researchers have developed a number ofmethods to detect taxi frauds with the assumption that fraudulent trips; among normal trips;are recorded by taximeters. In this paper; different from the previous work; we identify a newtype of taxi fraud called unmetered taxi rides; where taxi drivers carry passengers withoutactivating the taximeters. Since these fraudulent rides are not recorded by taximeters;previous detection approaches cannot directly apply to them. Hence; we propose a novelfraud detection system specifically designed for unmetered taxi rides. Our system uses alearning model to detect unmetered trajectory segments that are similar to metered rides;and introduces a heuristic algorithm to construct maximum fraudulent trajectories from the …,2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Data,2017,*

For this reason; ACM SAC included a special Track on Internet Data Managementthis year for the first time. This Track aims to examine the state of the art in Internet datamanagement; focusing on emerging applications in addition to traditional web datamanagement. The underlying theme of the Track is in building systems that are easy to useand are scalable. These usability/scalability issues will be considered in many dimensions:manageability; heterogeneity; performance; reliability; device capabilities; user behaviors …,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2004,*

Caching for Web-based database applications.,Qiong Luo,The three questions addressed in this dissertation are (i) how we add a query processing capabilityto web proxies or application servers; (ii) what query processing capability we add; and (iii) howthese enhanced proxy servers perform. Correspondingly; we make the following threecontributions. Firstly; we demonstrate that a query processing capability can be added to a proxyby having the web server send the proxy a piece of Java code dynamically; or by collocatinga query processing engine with the proxy statically. Secondly; we show that the query processingcapability added to the proxy can range from query containment checking and simple query processingthat take advantage of the characteristics of web queries in lightweight approaches; to full SQLprocessing in industrial-strength solutions. Finally; we find that even the overhead of addinga full-fledged DBMS to an application server and that of propagating updates from the …,*,2003,*

Storytelling and Visualization: A Survey,Chao Tong; Richard Roberts; Robert S Laramee; Kodzo Wegba; Aidong Lu; Yun Wang; Huamin Qu; Qiong Luo; Xiaojuan Ma,Abstract: Throughout history; storytelling has been an effective way of conveying informationand knowledge. In the field of visualization; storytelling is rapidly gaining momentum andevolving cutting-edge techniques that enhance understanding. Many communities havecommented on the importance of storytelling in data visualization. Storytellers tend to beintegrating complex visualizations into their narratives in growing numbers. In this paper; wepresent a survey of storytelling literature in visualization and present an overview of thecommon and important elements in storytelling visualization. We also describe thechallenges in this field as well as a novel classification of the literature on storytelling invisualization. Our classification scheme highlights the open and unsolved problems in thisfield as well as the more mature storytelling sub-fields. The benefits offer a concise …,*,*,*
Message from the Organizing Committee,Alexandros Labrinidis; Samuel R Madden; Amol Deshpande; Qiong Luo,The past few years have seen substantial amounts of computer science research on sensornetworks as they have the potential to bring an unprecedented level of access to thephysical world. Other subfields of Computer Science have had a number of workshops onthe topic. Also; there are now at least two major conferences–the Conference on InformationProcessing in Sensor Networks (IPSN); started in 2002 (the 2006 IPSN was held in April);and the ACM Conference on Sensor Systems (SenSys); started in 2003 (the 2006 SenSyswill be held in November). These conferences have published a small number of databasepapers; but there is no exclusive forum for discussion on early and innovative work on datamanagement in sensor networks. We believe that the DMSN 2006 workshop; building on thesuccesses of the DMSN 2004 and DMSN 2005 workshops; fills a significant gap in the …,*,*,*
Information Retrieval in a Peer-to-Peer Environment,Dik Lun Lee Dyce Jing Zhao; Qiong Luo,Abstract Due to rapid information growth; peer-to-peer (P2P) systems have become apromising alternative to centralized; client/server-based approaches for large-scale datasharing. By allowing peers to join and leave the system freely; they offer the peers autonomyto control their own resources; high scalability and high robustness against single-peerfailures. P2P systems have many applications. This paper focuses on peer-to-peerinformation retrieval (P2PIR); which aims to retrieve textual documents based on theircontents and ranks them based on some relevance measures against the query. The “opennature” of P2P systems and their lack of centralized control pose difficult challenges to thesearch capability and performance of P2PIR systems.,*,*,*
