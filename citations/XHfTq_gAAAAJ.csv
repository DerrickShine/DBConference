Vapor-phase fabrication and properties of continuous-filament ceramic composites,TM Besmann; BW Sheldon; RA Lowden; DP Stinton,The continuous-filament ceramic composite is becoming recognized as necessary for new;high-temperature structural applications. Yet because of the susceptibility of the filaments todamage from traditional methods for the preparation of ceramics; vapor-phase infiltrationhas become the fabrication method of choice. The chemical vapor infiltration methods forproducing these composites are now being studied in earnest; with the complexity offilament weaves and deposition chemistry being merged with standard heat and mass-transport relationships. Two of the most influential effects on the mechanical properties ofthese materials are the adhesion and frictional force between the fibers and the matrix;which can be controlled by a tailored interface coating. A variety of materials are availablefor producing these composites including carbide; nitride; boride; and oxide filaments and …,Science,1991,382

Carbon/carbon composite bipolar plate for proton exchange membrane fuel cells,Theodore M Besmann; James W Klett; John J Henry; Edgar Lara‐Curzio,Abstract Carbon/carbon‐composite bipolar plates for proton exchange membrane fuel cells(PEMFC) have been fabricated by slurry molding a chopped‐fiber preform followed bysealing with chemically vapor‐infiltrated carbon. The resulting component is hermetic withrespect to through‐thickness leakage and has a high electronic conductivity (200–300 S/cm)as a result of the deposited graphitic carbon. The material has a low density Formula due toretained porosity resulting in a low‐weight component. Biaxial flexure strength wasmeasured to be 175±26 MPa. Cell testing of a Formula active area; single‐sided plateindicated very low cell resistance and high efficiency; but with a somewhat steep drop‐off involtage with current at high values. Corrosion testing indicated minimal corrosion in fuel cellenvironments.© 2000 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.,Journal of the Electrochemical Society,2000,189

Depletion effects of silicon carbide deposition from methyltrichlorosilane,Theodore M Besmann; Brian W Sheldon; Thomas S Moss; Michael D Kaster,Abstract The deposition rate of SiC on carbon-coated Nicalon fibers frommethyltrichlorosilane in hydrogen was measured as a function of temperature; pressure;total flow rate; and simulated reactant depletion. The results; together with kinetic informationon the stability of methyltrichlorosilane; led to two conclusions:(1) two different mechanismsof deposition can occur depending on whether the methyltrichlorosilane has an opportunityto dissociate into separate silicon-and carbon-containing precursors; and (2) the depositionrate is strongly reduced by the generation of byproduct HCl. The data were fitted to a simpleetch model to obtain a kinetic expression that accounts for the significant effect of HCl.,Journal of the American Ceramic Society,1992,93
Properties of Multilayered Interphases in SiC/SiC Chemical‐Vapor‐Infiltrated Composites with “Weak” and “Strong” Interfaces,Francis Rebillat; Jacques Lamon; Roger Naslain; Edgar Lara‐Curzio; Mattison K Ferber; Theodore M Besmann,Abstract The interfacial properties of SiC/SiC composites with interphases that consist of (C-SiC) sequences deposited on the fibers have been determined by single-fiber push-outtests. The matrix has been reinforced with either as-received or treated Nicalon fibers. Themeasured interfacial properties are correlated with the fiber-coatingbond strength and thenumber of interlayers. For the composites reinforced with as-received (weakly bonded)fibers; interfacial characteristics are extracted from the nonlinear portion of the stress-displacement curve by fitting Hsueh's push-out model. The interfacial characteristics arecontrolled by the carbon layer adjacent to the fiber. The resistance to interface crack growthand fiber sliding increases as the number of (C-SiC) sequences increases.

Thermochemical modeling of oxide glasses,Theodore M Besmann; Karl E Spear,Abstract A modified associate species approach is used to model the liquid phase in oxidesystems. The relatively simple technique treats oxide liquids as solutions of end-memberand associate species. The model is extended to representing glasses by treating them asundercooled liquids. Equilibrium calculations using the model allow the determination ofspecies activities; phase separation; precipitation of crystalline phases; and volatilization. Insupport of nuclear waste glass development; a model of the Na 2 O–Al 2 O 3–B 2 O 3–SiO 2system has been developed that accurately reproduces its phase equilibria. The techniquehas been applied to the CaO–SiO 2 system; which is used to demonstrate how twoimmiscible liquids can be treated.,Journal of the American Ceramic Society,2002,75
Chemical Vapor Deposition in the Boron‐Carbon‐Nitrogen System,Theodore M Besmann,Abstract The preparation of a two-phase coating of B 4 C-BN was addressed as a potentialwear coating because of its likelihood of having a high fracture toughness resulting from itscomposite nature and inherent lubrication due to the presence of BN.

Interfacial Bond Strength in SiC/C/SiC Composite Materials; As Studied by Single‐Fiber Push‐Out Tests,Francis Rebillat; Jacques Lamon; Roger Naslain; Edgar Lara‐Curzio; Mattison K Ferber; Theodore M Besmann,Abstract The interfacial characteristics of SiC/C/SiC composites with different fiber-coatingbond strengths have been investigated using single-fiber push-out tests. Previous studieshave shown that weak or strong bonds can be obtained by using as-received or treatedfibers; respectively; and that the stress-strain behavior is improved with the treated fibers.This effect results from multiple branching of the cracks within the interphase. The modelused to extract interfacial characteristics from nanoindentation and microindentation testsdoes not consider the presence of an interphase. However; the results highlight thesignificant effect of the interphase on the interfacial parameters; as well as the effect ofroughness along the sliding surfaces. For the composite with treated fibers; the uncommonupward curvature of the push-out curves is related to different modes of crack propagation …,Journal of the American Ceramic Society,1998,73
Reaction and diffusion kinetics during the initial stages of isothermal chemical vapor infiltration,Brian W Sheldon; Theodore M Besmann,Abstract Individual bundles of ceramic fibers were infiltrated with SiC to study the reactionand diffusion kinetics during isothermal chemical vapor infiltration (CVI). More uniforminfiltration was observed in samples where baffles were placed in the reactor and when HClwas added to the inlet gases. The evolution of the microstructure was modeled using ananalytical expression for impinging cylindrical fibers. The transport of reactants was treatedusing classical descriptions of molecular and Knudsen diffusion in a porous body and alsoby considering the existence of a percolation threshold. All of these models predict thatinfiltration should be more uniform than the results that were obtained experimentally. It ispossible that this discrepancy occurs because mass transport is more complex than thedescriptions that were used. However; a more likely explanation is that the deposition …,Journal of the American Ceramic Society,1991,61
Effect of Hf and Y alloy additions on aluminide coating performance,Bruce A Pint; James A Haynes; Theodore M Besmann,Abstract Iron-and Ni-base alloys; with and without Hf or Hf and Y alloy additions; werealuminized by chemical vapor deposition to study the potential for minor alloy additions toimprove oxidation resistance of coated alloys. Compared to uncoated specimens; the coatedspecimens showed improved cyclic oxidation resistance at 1100° and 1150° C. However;alumina scale spallation was observed at relatively short times and; particularly for the Ni-base alloy X; the aluminized lab-cast alloy with Hf tended to have poor coating performancecompared to the commercial alloy without Hf. Internal oxidation of Hf at 1150° C and rapid Aldepletion in the relatively thin aluminide coatings contributed to the observed detrimental Hfeffect. For the Ni-base alloys; the increased scale spallation could be attributed to muchhigher S contents (10–50 ppma) in the laboratory-cast alloys.

Preparation of MoS 2 thin films by chemical vapor deposition,Woo Y Lee; Theodore M Besmann; Michael W Stott,Abstract The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of MoS 2 by reaction of H 2 S withmolybdenum halides was determined to be thermodynamically favored over a wide range oftemperature; pressure; and precursor concentration conditions as long as excess H 2 S wasavailable. The thermochemical stability of H 2 S; MoF 6; and MoCI 5 was also assessed toaddress their suitability as precursors for the CVD of MoS 2. The results from thethermodynamic analysis were used as guidance in the deposition of MoS 2 thin films fromMoF 6 and H 2 S. The (002) basal planes of MoS 2 films deposited above 700 K werepreferentially oriented perpendicular to the substrate surface.,Journal of materials research,1994,55

Self-aligned Cu–Si core–shell nanowire array as a high-performance anode for Li-ion batteries,Jun Qu; Huaqing Li; John J Henry Jr; Surendra K Martha; Nancy J Dudney; Hanbing Xu; Miaofang Chi; Michael J Lance; Shannon M Mahurin; Theodore M Besmann; Sheng Dai,Abstract Silicon nanowires (NWs) have been reported as a promising anode thatdemonstrated high capacity without pulverization during cycling; however; they presentsome technical issues that remain to be solved. The high aspect ratio of the NWs and theirsmall contact areas with the current collector cause high electrical resistance; which resultsin inefficient electron transport. The nano-size interface between a NW and the substrateexperiences high shear stress during lithiation; causing the wire to separate from the currentcollector. In addition; most reported methods for producing silicon NWs involve high-temperature processing and require catalysts that later become contaminants. This studydeveloped a new self-aligned Cu–Si core–shell NW array using a low-temperature; catalyst-free process to address the issues described.

The in-reactor oxygen potential is assumed to becontrolled by either UO2+ x+ Cs2UO4 or Zr+ ZrO2. The important condensed phases in-reactor are UO2+ x; CS2UO4; and CsI; and the major gaseous species are Cs; Cs2; CsI; andCs2I2. The presence of steam does not alter these species; although CsOH also becomes amajor gaseous species. In a 50% steam—50% air mixture; the equilibrium condensedphases are U3O8 or UO3 and Cs2U15O46.

These results; coupled with previously determined thermodynamicequilibrium compositions and deposit morphologies; were used to develop models for thedeposition process. At high temperatures the principal rate‐limiting mechanism is thediffusion of gaseous species through a gas boundary layer above the deposition surface.However; low Formula or high Formula fractions in the reactant gas cause a chemical kineticmechanism to become rate limiting. At lower deposition temperatures equilibrium no longerappears to exist at the substrate surface and a chemical kinetic rate‐limiting mechanismbecomes important.

Recent advances in forced-flow; thermal-gradient CVI for refractory composites,Kent J Probst; Theodore M Besmann; David P Stinton; Richard A Lowden; Timothy J Anderson; Thomas L Starr,Abstract Chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) is simply chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on theinternal surfaces of a porous preform and has been used to produce a variety ofdevelopmental and application materials. The greatest use of CVI is to infiltrate continuous-filament preforms taking advantage of the relatively low-stress CVD process. In CVI;reactants are introduced in the porous preform via either diffusion or forced convection andthe CVD precursors deposit the appropriate phase (s). As infiltration proceeds; the depositon the internal surfaces becomes thicker. Thus; after some length of time; the growingsurfaces meet bonding the preform and fill much of the free volume with deposited matrix.The forced-flow/thermal-gradient technique (FCVI) developed at Oak Ridge NationalLaboratory overcomes the problems of slow diffusion and restricted permeability; and has …,Surface and Coatings Technology,1999,41

Fiber-matrix interfaces in ceramic composites,TM Besmann; DP Stinton; ER Kupp; S Shanmugham; PK Liaw,Abstract The mechanical properties of ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) are governed bythe relationships between the matrix; the interface material; and the fibers. In non-oxidematrix systems the use of compliant pyrolytic carbon or BN have been demonstrated to beeffective interface materials; allowing for absorption of mismatch stresses between fiber andmatrix and offering a poorly bonded interface for crack deflection. The resulting materialshave demonstrated remarkable strain/damage tolerance together with high strength. Carbonor BN; however; suffer from oxidative loss in many service environments; and thus there is amajor search for oxidation resistant alternatives. This paper will review the issues related todeveloping a stable and effective interface material for non-oxide matrix CMCs.,MRS Online Proceedings Library Archive,1996,22

Chemical vapor deposition techniques,TM Besmann; DP Stinton; RA Lowden,Abstract Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is one of the few deposition processes in whichthe deposited phase is produced in situ via chemical reaction (s). Thus the vapor source forCVD can consist of high vapor pressure species at moderate temperatures and yet depositvery high-melting phases. For example; pure TiB 2; which melts at 3225 C; can be producedat 900 C from TiCl 4; BC1 3; and H 2.,MRS bulletin,1988,21
Thermodynamic assessment of the conversion of plutonium dioxide to plutonium monocarbide,Theodore M Besmann; Terrence B Lindemer,Abstract The equilibrium thermodynamics of the carbothermic reduction of PuO 2 to PuC0.88 are reassessed in light of new thermodynamic values for the Pu-CO system. Analysis ofthe thermodynamic data indicates that the PuC x O y phase can be successfully modeled byan ideal solid solution of PuC 0.88 and PuO. Equilibrium calculations show that oxygen-freemono-carbide cannot be practically prepared by the direct carbothermic reduction of PuO 2because of plutonium vaporization. These results imply that significant plutoniumvaporization will occur in similarly reduced UO 2-PuO 2 mixtures unless the actinides areinitially present as a solid solution. Equilibrium calculations also suggest that PuC 0.88 canbe successfully prepared by a two-step method: the carbothermic reduction of PuO 2 to PuC1.5 followed by the hydrogen reduction of PuC 1.5 to PuC 0.88,Journal of Nuclear Materials,1977,21

Initial efforts involved the use of chemicalvapor infiltration to produce minicomposites (single tows of fibers). In subsequent work;forced-flow thermal-gradient chemical vapor infiltration was used to produce a singlecomposite plate with a multilayer interface from ceramic-grade Nicalon fabric and two platesfrom Hi-Nicalon fabric; one with a single carbon layer and one with a multilayer interface.Tensile testing of the minicomposites and of specimens cut from the plates revealed typicalcomposite behavior and strengths for the as-processed samples.

MoF 6 and H 2 S were utilized as the precursors for MoS 2 formation; while Ti((CH 3) 2 N) 4 and NH 3 were used for TiN deposition. The composition and microstructureof the coatings were investigated by X-ray diffraction; Auger electron spectroscopy; andtransmission electron microscopy. The molar ratios of TiN and MoS 2 in the compositemicrostructure could be controlled by adjusting the MoF 6 concentration in the reagentmixture.

To obtain adequate fissile loading the kernelof the TRISO particle will likely need to be UN instead of UO 2. In support of the necessarydevelopment effort for this new fuel system; an assessment of phase regions of interest inthe U–C–N system was undertaken as the fuel will be prepared by the carbothermicreduction of the oxide followed by nitriding; will be in equilibrium with carbon within theTRISO particle; and will react with minor actinides and fission products.

Numerical verification of equilibrium thermodynamic computations in nuclear fuel performance codes,MHA Piro; Theodore M Besmann; Srdjan Simunovic; BJ Lewis; WT Thompson,Abstract There is an increasing desire to integrate thermodynamic computations directly intomulti-physics nuclear fuel performance and safety codes. These computations provide;among other matters; boundary conditions in heat and mass transport modules in predictingfuel behaviour. Precision must be maintained in computations involving fission andactivation products with very low concentrations; which may nonetheless have significantradiological consequences. Also; there is the concern about the propagation of numericalerrors in multi-physics codes. A method to numerically verify equilibrium thermodynamiccomputations is therefore necessary to satisfy rigorous quality assurance standards of thenuclear industry without significantly impeding computational performance. A technique ispresented that can be applied to systems of any number of phases and system …,Journal of Nuclear Materials,2011,18

Projections of US GHG reductions from nuclear power new capacity based on historic levels of investment,Theodore M Besmann,Abstract Historical rates of capital investment in nuclear plant construction were used as aguide to estimate the potential rate of future capacity introduction. The total linear rate ofcapital expenditure over the entire period of historical construction from 1964 to 1990 wasdetermined to equal $11.5 billion/yr; and that for the period of peak construction from 1973 to1985 was computed as $17.9 billion/yr; all in 2004$. These values were used with a varietyof current capital cost estimates for nuclear construction to obtain several scenarios forpossible future nuclear capacity additions. These values were used to obtain the effect ofprojected nuclear generating capacity on GHG emissions assuming nuclear would directlyreplace coal-fired generation. It was concluded that actual reductions in emissions would notbe experienced until 2038; yet growth in emissions from electrical production would be …,Energy Policy,2010,15
Thermochemical assessment of oxygen gettering by SiC or ZrC in PuO2− x TRISO fuel,Theodore M Besmann,Abstract Particulate nuclear fuel in a modular helium-cooled reactor is being considered forthe consumption of excess plutonium and related transuranics. In this work athermochemical analysis was performed to predict oxygen potential behavior in plutoniaTRISO fuel to burnups of 88% FIMA of the Pu 239 content with and without the presence ofoxygen gettering SiC and ZrC. The gettering phases are designed to prevent kernelmigration; a serious issue in TRISO fuel; and this has been demonstrated with both SiC andZrC. The phases reduce CO pressure; thus also reducing the peak pressure within theparticles by at least 50%; decreasing the likelihood of pressure-induced particle failure. Amodel for kernel migration based on vapor transport by CO was used to semi-quantitativelyassess the effect of controlling oxygen potential with SiC or ZrC and demonstrate the …,Journal of Nuclear Materials,2010,15

Phase equilibria in the U-Si system from first-principles calculations,Mark J Noordhoek; Theodore M Besmann; David Andersson; Simon C Middleburgh; Aleksandr Chernatynskiy,Abstract Density functional theory calculations have been used with spin-orbit coupling andon-site Coulomb correction (GGA+ U) methods to investigate the U-Si system. Structuralprediction methods were employed to identify alternate stable structures. Convex hulls of theU-Si system were constructed for each of the methods to highlight the competing energeticsof various phases. For GGA calculations; new structures are predicted to be dynamicallystable; but these have not been experimentally observed. When the GGA+ U (U eff> 1.3 eV)method is considered; the experimentally observed structures are predicted to beenergetically preferred. Phonon calculations were used to investigate the energy predictionsand showed that the use of the GGA+ U method removes the significant imaginaryfrequencies observed for U 3 Si 2 when the correction is not considered.

Epitaxical nucleation of polycrystalline silicon carbide during chemical vapor deposition,Brian W Sheldon; Theodore M Besmann; Karren L More; Thomas S Moss,Abstract Polycrystalline silicon carbide was deposited from methyltrichlorosilane in cold-walled and hot-walled reactors; on (100) SiC surface layers that were formed on (100) Siwafers. The initial stages of the process were studied by electron microscopy after relativelyshort deposition times. Submicron surface features nucleated with a specific crystallographicorientation with respect to the substrate; where h111j planes in th—SiC substrate coincidedwith h0001j planes in the a–SiC features. These a–SiC features occurred only at twins onh111j planes of the b–SiC substrate. This demonstrates that nucleation under theseconditions is controlled by defects in the substrate. Surface contamination and the reactorconfiguration also had substantial effects on nucleation.,Journal of materials research,1993,11

Thermochemical modeling of refractory corrosion in slagging coal gasifiers,Theodore M Besmann,Abstract Slagging coal gasifiers suffer corrosive attack on the refractory liner and theseinteractions were thermochemically simulated. The slag is observed to penetrate therefractory; which complicates modeling the phase behavior of the slag-penetrated interior ofthe refractory. A simple strategy was adopted such that stepwise changes in compositionwith decreasing slag content were assumed to account for the compositional changes asslag penetrates the refractory. The thermochemical equilibrium calculations following thisstrategy typically yielded three solution phases as well as the stoichiometric crystallinephases AlPO 4 and Ca 3 (PO 4) 2 depending on composition/penetration. Under someconditions a slag liquid miscibility gap exists such that two slag liquids coexist.,Calphad,2008,9

Chemical Vapor Infiltration of TiB2‐Matrix Composites,Theodore M Besmann; James H Miller; Kevin M Cooley; Richard A Lowden; Thomas L Starr,Abstract The efficiency of the Hall–Heroult electrolytic reduction of aluminum can besubstantially improved by the use of a TiB 2 cathode. The use of TiB 2 components;however; has been hampered by the brittle nature of the material and the grain boundaryattack of sintering-aid phases by molten aluminum. In the current work; TiB 2 is toughenedthrough the use of reinforcing fibers; with chemical vapor infiltration used to produce the TiB2 matrix. In early efforts it was observed that the formation of TiB 2 from chloride precursorsat fabrication temperatures below 900–1000 C may have allowed the retention of destructivelevels of chlorine.

Hf‐Doped Ni–Al2O3 Interfaces at Equilibrium,Hila Meltzman; Theodore M Besmann; Wayne D Kaplan,Abstract In this study; a series of solid-state dewetting experiments of pure and Hf-doped Nifilms on sapphire and Hf O 2 substrates were conducted in order to measure the change ininterfacial energy of the Ni–Al 2 O 3 interface in the presence of Hf; and to study Hf interfacialsegregation. It was found that Hf oxidizes under the conditions of the experiment (P (O 2)=10− 20 atm); Hf does not segregate to the Ni–Al 2 O 3 interface; and that the interface energyof Ni–Hf O 2 is 2.7±0.4 J/m 2 vs 2.16±0.2 J/m 2 for the Ni–Al 2 O 3 interface. This contradictsseveral theoretical studies that predict that Hf segregates to the interface to stabilize itthermodynamically. The solubility of Hf in bulk Ni was found to be significantly lower than thevalue reported in the equilibrium phase diagram.,Journal of the American Ceramic Society,2012,3

Although chemically stable and inexpensive to manufacture; the in-core performance of UO2 fuel is limited by its low thermal conductivity. There will beenormous financial benefits to any utility that can exploit a new type of fuel that is chemicallystable; has a high thermal conductivity; and is inexpensive to manufacture. At reactoroperating temperatures; UO2 has a very low thermal conductivity (< 5 W/m· K); whichdecreases with temperature and fuel burnup. This low thermal conductivity limits the rate atwhich energy can be removed from the fuel; thus limiting the total integrated reactor power.

A Combined Experimental and Computational Thermodynamic Investigation of the U–Th–O System,Jacob Wesley McMurray; Stewart L Voit; Theodore M Besmann,Abstract The thermodynamics of the U–Th–O system have been assessed using theCalphad method. The compound energy formalism (CEF) and a partially ionic two-sublatticeliquid model (TSLM) were used for the fluorite U 1–y Th y O 2±x; γ-(U; Th) 4 O 9; and the U–Th–O melt. The O 2 activity of fluorite U 1–y Th y O 2±x with temperature and compositionwas determined by thermogravimetric analysis. Thermodynamic studies for the Th–O binaryand U–Th–O ternary available in the open literature were critically reviewed. A self-consistent data set was selected and compiled with the equilibrium oxygen pressuresdetermined by thermogravimetry in order to optimize the adjustable parameters of modelsselected to represent the phases in the Th–O and U–Th–O systems.,*,2016,2

Light-scattering analyses incorporating specific nucleation and growthmodels were developed. With these methods; it was possible to analyze the angularscattering spectra and directly measure the nucleation and growth rates. These results wereverified by using image analysis to quantify the number and size distribution of surfacefeatures that were observed with scanning electron microscopy.

Uranium nitride-silicide advanced nuclear fuel: Higher efficiency and greater safety,Theodore M Besmann; Tashiema L Wilson; Emily E Moore; Mallikharjuna Bogala; Mark J Noordhoek; Elizabeth Sooby Wood; Andrew T Nelson; Jacob W McMurray; Simon Middleburgh; Peng Xu,Abstract The development of new nuclear fuel compositions is being driven by an interest inimproving efficiency/lowering cost and increasing safety margins. Nuclear fuel efficiency is inlarge measure a function of the atomic density of the uranium; that is; the more fissionableuranium available per unit volume the less fuel volume that is required.

One would expect that the amount of cesium would be about oneorder of magnitude greater than iodine based on the difference in fission yields of 235 U and239 Pu.

In particular; oxide systems in which low-melting liquids or glasses can form; andvapor-phase systems involving compounds below the first row of the periodic table (forexample; aluminum and silicon) or transition metals; are difficult to model for this reason.Since there are few experimental efforts ongoing today that can provide such data; thisrepresents a major impediment to developing models that can be used to improve theenergy efficiency of such processes and reduce waste.

THERMOCHEMICAL MODELING OF REFRACTORY CORROSION IN SLAGGING COAL GASIFIERS IN SUPPORT OF DEVELOPMENT OF IMPROVED REFRACTO...,Theodore Besmann; Arthur Petty; Kyei-Sing Kwong; James Bennett; Cynthia Powell,ABSTRACT Slagging coal gasifiers suffer from significant attack by the coal slag on therefractory liner. To better understand the corrosive attack on the refractory the interactionswere thermochemically simulated. The slag is observed to penetrate the refractory; whichcomplicates modeling the phase behavior of the slagpenetrated interior of the refractory. Toaddress this issue a simple strategy was adopted such that stepwise changes incomposition with decreasing slag content were assumed to account for the compositionalchanges as slag penetrates the refractory; at least partially through its thickness. Thethermochemical equilibrium calculations following this strategy typically yielded threesolution phases as well as the stoichiometric crystalline phases AlPO4 and Ca3 (PO4) 2depending on composition/penetration.

Current;experimentally determined values are less than desirable since they depend onmeasurement of the leach rate under non-realistic conditions designed to accelerateprocesses that occur on a geologic time scale. The often-used assumption that the activity ofa species is either unity or equal to the overall concentration of the metal can also yieldmisleading results.

CHEMICAL VAPOR INFILTRATION OF TiB2 FIBROUS COMPOSITES,Theodore M Besmann,This program is designed to develop a Hall-Heroult aluminum smelting cathode withsubstantially improved properties. The carbon cathodes in current use require signiﬁcantanode-to-cathode spacing in order to prevent shorting; causing signiﬁcant electricalinefﬁciencies. This is due to the non-wettability of carbon by aluminum which causesinstability in the cathodic aluminum pad. It is suggested that a ﬁber reinforced-TiB2 matrixcomposite would have the requisite wettability; strength; strain-to-failure; cost; and lifetime tosolve this problem. The approach selected to fabricate such a cathode material is chemicalvapor inﬁltration (CVI). This process produces high purity matrix TiB2 without damaging therelatively fragile ﬁbers. The program is designed to evaluate potential ﬁber reinforcements;fabricate test specimens; and scale the process to provide demonstration components.,Advanced Industrial Materials,1997,*

Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) and Infiltration (CVI),Theodore M Besmann; David P Stinton; Richard A Lowden; Woo Y Lee,Abstract Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) takes advantage of gas phase reactants to formdesired phases in situ. CVD reactions are not unlike those described in Part Four; whereceramic materials are prepared from vapor phase precursors. The significant difference isthat in CVD the resultant material is in the form of a coating deposited on a substrate. Thus;the CVD process takes advantage of the lowered energies for phase formation afforded bynucleation and growth on existing surfaces.,*,1997,*

In certain cases;this choice was made purely for reasons of simplicity: gas cylinder; gas species alreadyused in another field; etc. Experience has subsequently shown; however; that this choicecan give rise to significant changes in the nature and proportions of deposited phases.These are highly dependent upon: the value of the oxidiser: reducer ratio in the gas phase;the degree of metal oxidation in the halide considered; and possible competition betweentwo reducing agents designed to reduce the halide. These factors; among others; stronglyinfluence the thermochemistry of the deposition reaction. Their roles must therefore beclearly understood; interpreted and predicted by the thermochemical analysis. Based on …,*,1993,*

Chemical vapor infiltration of TiB [sub 2] composites,TM Besmann; JH Miller; KC Cooley; RA Lowden; TL Starr,The efficiency of the Hall-Heroult electrolytic reduction of aluminum can be substantiallyimproved by the use of a TiB2 cathode surface. The use of TiB2; however; has beenhampered by the brittle nature of the material and the grain-boundary attack of sintering-aidphases by molten aluminum. In the current work; TiB2 is toughened through the use ofreinforcing fibers; with chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) used to produce pure TiB2. It hasbeen observed; however; that the formation of TiB2from chloride precursors at fabricationtemperatures below 900 to 1000* Callows the retention of destructive levels of chlorine inthe material.

Demand for Electricity,Theodore M Besmann,Mark Crawford (News & Comment; 18 Nov.; p. 1005) is correct in noting the likely powercrunch parts of the country will experience in the next decade; but misses the most importantpoint.

Thedemand for power has directly matched growth in the economy for over a decade; while thede-mand for oil and gas has largely declined.

These temperatures; levels of stress; and hostile environments maybe outside the capability of refractory alloys; which has created interest in the use of ceramiccomposites as structural materials. There are currently two MMW space reactor power cyclesunder consideration; a Brayton and a Rankine cycle. The Brayton cycle Is envisioned asusing inert gas as the working fluid during continuous operation with a peak temperature of1500 K and hydrogen as the working fluid for short duration (30 min); high power operationat a temperature of 2500 K.

To improve the fitthese data were omitted via fitting only points between x= 0.05 and x= 0.3; with the result thatthe top is calculated to appear at~ 930 K (fig. 1).

Equilibrium thermodynamics of mixed carbide fuel,TM Besmann,In recent years the interest in advanced nuclear fuels has turned increasingly towards thetwo-phase actinide carbides (uranium-plutonium monocarbide plus some sesquicarbide). Ithas been observed; however; that the actinides segregate such that plutonium concentratesmore in one phase (usually the sesquicarbide) than the other. The resulting fissile atomconcentration inhomogeneities may cause undesirable reactivity changes during burnupand the severity of this effect is a function of grain size and the degree of segregation.

Colloque C5; supplement au n05; Tome 50; mai 1989,TM BESMANN; RA LOWDEN; DP STINTON; TL STARR,Abstract-Processes for the preparation of composite bodies using chemical vapor depositionhave been developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Composites are preparedby infiltrating ceramic fiber preforms; held at elevated temperatures; with reactant gases thatdecompose to deposit ceramic matrix material between and around the fibers. The OWLprocess is a marked improvement over those commonly in use; preforms that previouslyrequired weeks to densify now require-24 h. Specimens with densities up to 90% oftheoretical and strengths in the range of 400 to 450 MPa have been produced. Mostimportantly; the materials fail noncatastrophically; exhibiting typical composite behavior.,*,*,*

Fiber‐Matrix Bond Strength; Fiber Factional Sliding and the Macroscopic Tensile Behavior of a 2D SiC/SiC Composite with Tailored Interfaces,Edgar Lara‐Curzio; MK Ferber; TM Besmann; Francis Rebillat; Jacques Lamon,Summary The fiber-matrix interface of Nicalon™/SiC composites with “weak” and “strong”fiber bonding was characterized by means of single-fiber push-out tests. It was found that thestress vs. fiber-end displacement push-out curves for the composites with “strong” fiberbonding were increasingly stiffer; in contrast to the traditional increasingly compliant curvesobtained for composites with “weak” fiber bonding as predicted by standard interfacialmodels. These results are analyzed in light of the superior mechanical behavior of thecomposite with “strong” fiber bonding. The philosophy for developing ceramic matrixcomposites with “weak” fiber bonding is revisited.,Proceedings of the 19th Annual Conference on Composites; Advanced Ceramics; Materials; and Structures-B: Ceramic Engineering and Science Proceedings; Volume 16; Issue 5,*,*

Wear along Debonded Interfaces in SiC/SiC Composites Investigated Using Push-Back Tests,F Rebillat; J Lamon; E Lara-Curzio; TM Besmann,SUMMARY: The effect of wear along sliding debonded surfaces in composites is wellobserved during fatigue tests. Indeed; under cyclic loadings; the load transfer becomes lessand less efficient; and the composites break under lower stresses when comparing withmonotonic loading. With the aim to better understand wear of sliding interfaces in SiC/SiCcomposites; fibers have firstly been debonded through single push out tests; and; thenreloaded several times in the reverse direction via single push back tests. Interface data areextracted from the stress vs. displacement curves by fitting the Hsuehls model. Thus; theevolution of interface characteristics is obtained in function of the number of push backs; iethe number of sliding cycles. The wear of a sliding interface in a SiC/SiC composite ishighlighted through decrease in the sliding resistance. The influence of the direction of …,Wear,*,*
Computation of thermodynamic equilibria of nuclear materials in multi-physics codes,MH Piro; BJ Lewis; WT Thompson; S Simunovic; TM Besmann,ABSTRACT A new equilibrium thermodynamic solver is being developed with the primaryimpetus of direct integration into nuclear fuel performance and safety codes to provideimproved predictions of fuel behavior. This solver is intended to provide boundary conditionsand material properties for continuum transport calculations. There are several legitimateconcerns with the use of existing commercial thermodynamic codes: i) licensingentanglements associated with code distribution; ii) computational performance; and iii)limited capabilities of handling large multi-component systems of interest to the nuclearindustry. The development of this solver is specifically aimed at addressing these concerns.In support of this goal; a new numerical algorithm for computing chemical equilibria ispresented which is not based on the traditional steepest descent method or “Gibbs …,*,*,*
