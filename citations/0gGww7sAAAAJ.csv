Schema-free xquery,Yunyao Li; Cong Yu; HV Jagadish,Abstract The widespread adoption of XML holds out the promise that document structure canbe exploited to specify precise database queries. However; the user may have only a limitedknowledge of the XML structure; and hence may be unable to produce a correct XQuery;especially in the context of a heterogeneous information collection. The default is to usekeyword-based search and we are all too familiar with how difficult it is to obtain preciseanswers by these means. We seek to address these problems by introducing the notion ofMeaningful Lowest Common Ancestor Structure (MLCAS) for finding related nodes within anXML document. By automatically computing MLCAS and expanding ambiguous tag names;we add new functionality to XQuery and enable users to take full advantage of XQuery inquerying XML data precisely and efficiently without requiring (perfect) knowledge of the …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,476
Making database systems usable,HV Jagadish; Adriane Chapman; Aaron Elkiss; Magesh Jayapandian; Yunyao Li; Arnab Nandi; Cong Yu,Abstract Database researchers have striven to improve the capability of a database in termsof both performance and functionality. We assert that the usability of a database is asimportant as its capability. In this paper; we study why database systems today are sodifficult to use. We identify a set of five pain points and propose a research agenda toaddress these. In particular; we introduce a presentation data model and recommend directdata manipulation with a schema later approach. We also stress the importance ofprovenance and of consistency across presentation models.,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,225

A partial wave analysis of the resonant structure of the τ→ 3π π 0 ν τ decay has been performed; the spectral decomposition of the four pion system isdominated by the ω π and a 1 π final states. The mass and width of the ρ′ resonance havebeen extracted from a fit to the τ→ ω π ν τ spectral function. We have searched for secondclass currents in the decay τ→ ω π ν τ using spin-parity analysis and established an upperlimit on the non-vector current contribution.,Physical Review D,2000,147
SystemT: a system for declarative information extraction,Rajasekar Krishnamurthy; Yunyao Li; Sriram Raghavan; Frederick Reiss; Shivakumar Vaithyanathan; Huaiyu Zhu,Abstract As applications within and outside the enterprise encounter increasing volumes ofunstructured data; there has been renewed interest in the area of information extraction (IE)--the discipline concerned with extracting structured information from unstructured text.Classical IE techniques developed by the NLP community were based on cascadinggrammars and regular expressions. However; due to the inherent limitations ofgrammarbased extraction; these techniques are unable to:(i) scale to large data sets; and (ii)support the expressivity requirements of complex information tasks. At the IBM AlmadenResearch Center; we are developing SystemT; an IE system that addresses these limitationsby adopting an algebraic approach. By leveraging well-understood database concepts suchas declarative queries and costbased optimization; SystemT enables scalable execution …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2009,146
NaLIX: an interactive natural language interface for querying XML,Yunyao Li; Huahai Yang; HV Jagadish,Abstract Database query languages can be intimidating to the non-expert; leading to theimmense recent popularity for keyword based search in spite of its significant limitations. Theholy grail has been the development of a natural language query interface. We presentNaLIX; a generic interactive natural language query interface to an XML database. Oursystem can accept an arbitrary English language sentence as query input; which caninclude aggregation; nesting; and value joins; among other things. This query is translated;potentially after reformulation; into an XQuery expression that can be evaluated against anXML database. The translation is done through mapping grammatical proximity of naturallanguage parsed tokens to proximity of corresponding elements in the result XML. In thisdemonstration; we show that NaLIX; while far from being able to pass the Turing test; is …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,146
SystemT: an algebraic approach to declarative information extraction,Laura Chiticariu; Rajasekar Krishnamurthy; Yunyao Li; Sriram Raghavan; Frederick R Reiss; Shivakumar Vaithyanathan,Abstract As information extraction (IE) becomes more central to enterprise applications; rule-based IE engines have become increasingly important. In this paper; we describe SystemT;a rule-based IE system whose basic design removes the expressivity and performancelimitations of current systems based on cascading grammars. SystemT uses a declarativerule language; AQL; and an optimizer that generates high-performance algebraic executionplans for AQL rules. We compare SystemT's approach against cascading grammars; boththeoretically and with a thorough experimental evaluation. Our results show that SystemTcan deliver result quality comparable to the state-of-the-art and an order of magnitude higherannotation throughput.,Proceedings of the 48th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2010,132
Rule-based information extraction is dead! long live rule-based information extraction systems!,Laura Chiticariu; Yunyao Li; Frederick R Reiss,Abstract The rise of “Big Data” analytics over unstructured text has led to renewed interest ininformation extraction (IE). We surveyed the landscape of IE technologies and identified amajor disconnect between industry and academia: while rule-based IE dominates thecommercial world; it is widely regarded as dead-end technology by the academia. Webelieve the disconnect stems from the way in which the two communities measure thebenefits and costs of IE; as well as academia's perception that rulebased IE is devoid ofresearch challenges. We make a case for the importance of rule-based IE to industrypractitioners. We then lay out a research agenda in advancing the state-of-theart in rule-based IE systems which we believe has the potential to bridge the gap between academicresearch and industry practice.,Proceedings of the 2013 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing,2013,115
Domain adaptation of rule-based annotators for named-entity recognition tasks,Laura Chiticariu; Rajasekar Krishnamurthy; Yunyao Li; Frederick Reiss; Shivakumar Vaithyanathan,Abstract Named-entity recognition (NER) is an important task required in a wide variety ofapplications. While rule-based systems are appealing due to their well-known"explainability;" most; if not all; state-of-the-art results for NER tasks are based on machinelearning techniques. Motivated by these results; we explore the following natural question inthis paper: Are rule-based systems still a viable approach to named-entity recognition?Specifically; we have designed and implemented a high-level language NERL on top ofSystemT; a general-purpose algebraic information extraction system. NERL is tuned to theneeds of NER tasks and simplifies the process of building; understanding; and customizingcomplex rule-based named-entity annotators. We show that these customized annotatorsmatch or outperform the best published results achieved with machine learning …,Proceedings of the 2010 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2010,115
Regular expression learning for information extraction,Yunyao Li; Rajasekar Krishnamurthy; Sriram Raghavan; Shivakumar Vaithyanathan; HV Jagadish,Abstract Regular expressions have served as the dominant workhorse of practicalinformation extraction for several years. However; there has been little work on reducing themanual effort involved in building high-quality; complex regular expressions for informationextraction tasks. In this paper; we propose ReLIE; a novel transformation-based algorithm forlearning such complex regular expressions. We evaluate the performance of our algorithmon multiple datasets and compare it against the CRF algorithm. We show that ReLIE; inaddition to being an order of magnitude faster; outperforms CRF under conditions of limitedtraining data and cross-domain data. Finally; we show how the accuracy of CRF can beimproved by using features extracted by ReLIE.,Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2008,110

We measure branching fractions B (B+→η c K+)=(0.69− 0.21+ 0.26±0.08±0.20)× 10− 3 and B (B→ η c K)=(1.09− 0.42+0.55±0.12±0.31)× 10− 3; where the first error is statistical; the second is systematic; and thethird is from the η c branching fraction uncertainty. From these we extract the η c decayconstant in the factorization approximation; f η c= 335±75 MeV. We also search for B decaysto a χ c 0 and a kaon.

Getting work done on the web: supporting transactional queries,Yunyao Li; Rajasekar Krishnamurthy; Shivakumar Vaithyanathan; HV Jagadish,Abstract Many searches on the web have a transactional intent. We argue that pagessatisfying transactional needs can be distinguished from the more common pages that havesome information and links; but cannot be used to execute a transaction. Based on thishypothesis; we provide a recipe for constructing a transaction annotator. By constructing anannotator with one corpus and then demonstrating its classification performance on another;we establish its robustness. Finally; we show experimentally that a search procedure thatexploits such pre-annotation greatly outperforms traditional search for retrievingtransactional pages.,Proceedings of the 29th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2006,40

Absorption of NOx into nitric acid solution in rotating packed bed,Li Yu; Liu Youzhi; Luyao ZHANG; Su Qiang; JIN Guoliang,Abstract Absorption of NO x into nitric acid solutions was studied in the presence of ozone byusing a rotating packed bed (RPB) contactor. The influences of operating parameters; suchas high gravity number; amount of ozone; gas velocity; liquid spray density and inletconcentration of NO x; on the removal efficiency of NO x were investigated; among which thehigh gravity number and ozone amount are more important. Ozone was introduced tooxidize HNO 2 to HNO 3 to prevent the decomposition of HNO 2 in the liquid phase. Thehigh gravity number presents the effective external force for enhancing the mass transfer ofozone from gas phase to liquid phase. Under the experimental condition; the removalefficiency of NO x is higher than 90% and the concentration of nitric acid product exceeds45%.,Chinese Journal of chemical engineering,2010,32

Understanding queries in a search database system,Ronald Fagin; Benny Kimelfeld; Yunyao Li; Sriram Raghavan; Shivakumar Vaithyanathan,Abstract It is well known that a search engine can significantly benefit from an auxiliarydatabase; which can suggest interpretations of the search query by means of the involvedconcepts and their interrelationship. The difficulty is to translate abstract notions like conceptand interpretation into a concrete search algorithm that operates over the auxiliary database.To surpass existing heuristics; there is a need for a formal basis; which is realized in thispaper through the framework of a search database system; where an interpretation isidentified as a parse. It is shown that the parses of a query can be generated in polynomialtime in the combined size of the input and the output; even if parses are restricted to thosehaving a nonempty evaluation. Identifying that one parse is more specific than another isimportant for ranking answers; and this framework captures the precise semantics of …,Proceedings of the twenty-ninth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2010,28

Identifying user needs from social media,Huahai Yang; Yunyao Li,ABSTRACT With the rise of social media; writings by ordinary people are becomingincreasingly available for linguistic analysis. Such analyses offer great opportunities toidentify individual users' needs from user-generated content; so that better tailored productsor services can be recommended. Literature suggests that several types of human needsare universal and directly influence consumer purchase behavior. In this paper; weinvestigate the use of social media to identify such fundamental needs for individuals. Wedeveloped psychometric measures of universal needs through a crowd-sourced study. Wealso built several models to predict people's needs based on their writings. We conducted adetailed analysis of the models and showed that our models can effectively identify users'needs based on their social media data. Our results also confirm that some inferred …,IBM Research Division; San Jose,2013,25

Adaptive parser-centric text normalization,Congle Zhang; Tyler Baldwin; Howard Ho; Benny Kimelfeld; Yunyao Li,Abstract Text normalization is an important first step towards enabling many NaturalLanguage Processing (NLP) tasks over informal text. While many of these tasks; such asparsing; perform the best over fully grammatically correct text; most existing textnormalization approaches narrowly define the task in the word-to-word sense; that is; thetask is seen as that of mapping all out-of-vocabulary non-standard words to their in-vocabulary standard forms. In this paper; we take a parser-centric view of normalization thataims to convert raw informal text into grammatically correct text. To understand the real effectof normalization on the parser; we tie normalization performance directly to parserperformance. Additionally; we design a customizable framework to address the oftenoverlooked concept of domain adaptability; and illustrate that the system allows for …,Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers),2013,22

A graph approach to spelling correction in domain-centric search,Zhuowei Bao; Benny Kimelfeld; Yunyao Li,Abstract Spelling correction for keyword-search queries is challenging in restricted domainssuch as personal email (or desktop) search; due to the scarcity of query logs; and due to thespecialized nature of the domain. For that task; this paper presents an algorithm that isbased on statistics from the corpus data (rather than the query log). This algorithm; whichemploys a simple graph-based approach; can incorporate different types of data sourceswith different levels of reliability (eg; email subject vs. email body); and can handle complexspelling errors like splitting and merging of words. An experimental study shows thesuperiority of the algorithm over existing alternatives in the email domain.,Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies-Volume 1,2011,17

The masses of the χ b states aredetermined from the measured radiative photon energies. The ratio of mass splittingsbetween the χ b substates; r≡(MJ= 2− MJ= 1)/(MJ= 1− MJ= 0); with M the χ b mass; providesinformation on the nature of the bb confining potential. We find r (1 P)= 0.542±0.022±0.024.This value is somewhat lower than the previous world average; but more consistent with thetheoretical expectation that r (1 P)< r (2 P); ie; that this mass splitting ratio is smaller for the χb (1 P) states than for the χ b (2 P) states.,Physical Review D,1999,15

Automatic suggestion of query-rewrite rules for enterprise search,Zhuowei Bao; Benny Kimelfeld; Yunyao Li,Abstract Enterprise search is challenging for several reasons; notably the dynamicterminology and jargon that are specific to the enterprise domain. This challenge is partlyaddressed by having domain experts maintaining the enterprise search engine andadapting it to the domain specifics. Those administrators commonly address user complaintsabout relevant documents missing from the top matches. For that; it has been proposed toallow administrators to influence search results by crafting query-rewrite rules; eachspecifying how queries of a certain pattern should be modified or augmented with additionalqueries. Upon a complaint; the administrator seeks a semantically coherent rule that iscapable of pushing the desired documents up to the top matches. However; the creation andmaintenance of rewrite rules is highly tedious and time consuming.

Selectivity estimation for extraction operators over text data,Daisy Zhe Wang; Long Wei; Yunyao Li; Frederick Reiss; Shivakumar Vaithyanathan,Recently; there has been increasing interest in extending relational query processing toefficiently support extraction operators; such as dictionaries and regular expressions; overtext data. Many text processing queries are sophisticated in that they involve multipleextraction and join operators; resulting in many possible query plans. However; there hasbeen little research on building the selectivity or cost estimation for these extractionoperators; which is crucial for an optimizer to pick a good query plan. In this paper; we definethe problem of selectivity estimation for dictionaries and regular expressions; and propose todevelop document synopses over a text corpus; from which the selectivity can be estimated.We first adapt the language models in the Natural Language Processing literature to formthe top-k n-gram synopsis as the baseline document synopsis.

Forward modeling to improve seismic reflection energy of a protective coal seam based on Zoeppritz equation,Wen-Peng Tao; Shou-Hua Dong; LI Yang,Abstract In seismic exploration for coal; seismic waves are very difficult to transmit downwardbecause of high velocity protective layers; making the reflection information very hard toreceive above ground. Based on the Snell law and the Zoeppritz equation; we studied therelationship between the incidence angle and reflection seismic wave energy using aforward model of level media. The result shows that the seismic wave energy has a suddenincrease at the critical angle. Based on the energy propagation rule; using big offset toreceive the seismic wave energy under a protective layer can effectively reduce itsprotection effect.,Journal of China University of Mining and Technology,2008,11

Facilitating pattern discovery for relation extraction with semantic-signature-based clustering,Yunyao Li; Vivian Chu; Sebastian Blohm; Huaiyu Zhu; Howard Ho,Abstract Hand-crafted textual patterns have been the mainstay device of practical relationextraction for decades. However; there has been little work on reducing the manual effortinvolved in the discovery of effective textual patterns for relation extraction. In this paper; wepropose a clustering-based approach to facilitate the pattern discovery for relationextraction. Specifically; we define the notion of semantic signature to represent the mostsalient features of a textual fragment. We then propose a novel clustering algorithm basedon semantic signature; S2C; and its enhancement S2C+. Experiments on two real-worlddata sets show that; when compared with k-means clustering; S2C and S2C+ are at least anorder of magnitude faster; while generating high quality clusters that are at least comparableto the best clusters generated by k-means without requiring any manual tuning.

Rewrite rules for search database systems,Ronald Fagin; Benny Kimelfeld; Yunyao Li; Sriram Raghavan; Shivakumar Vaithyanathan,Abstract The results of a search engine can be improved by consulting auxiliary data. In asearch database system; the association between the user query and the auxiliary data isdriven by rewrite rules that augment the user query with a set of alternative queries. Thispaper develops a framework that formalizes the notion of a rewrite program; which isessentially a collection of hedge-rewriting rules. When applied to a search query; the rewriteprogram produces a set of alternative queries that constitutes a least fixpoint (lfp). The mainfocus of the paper is on the lfp-convergence of a rewrite program; where a rewrite program islfp-convergent if the least fixpoint of every search query is finite. Determining whether agiven rewrite program is lfp-convergent is undecidable; to accommodate that; the paperproposes a safety condition; and shows that safety guarantees lfp-convergence; and that …,Proceedings of the thirtieth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2011,10

We have constructed NaLIX; a natural language interface for querying XMLdata. Through our experience with NaLIX; we find that failures in natural language queryunderstanding can often be dealt with as ambiguities in term meanings. These failures aretypically the result of either the user's poor knowledge of the database schema or thesystem's lack of linguistic coverage. With automatic term expansion techniques andappropriate interactive feedback; we are able to resolve these ambiguities.

Discovery of the connection among age-related macular degeneration; MTHFR C677T and PAI 1 4G/5G gene polymorphisms; and body mass index by means of Ba...,Aydan Celebiler; Huseyin Seker; BORA YÜKSEL; Ahmet Orun; Sibel Bilgili; Muhammet Baysal Karaca,Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversibleblindness in the elderly. The aim of this study was therefore to explore the relationshipbetween the presence of multiple gene polymorphisms and 2 distinct advanceddry andwet'AMD phenotypes; and to assess gene interactions with the influence of personal factorsin a Turkish population as a pilot study. For the analysis; the data were collected from 73unrelated participants; grouped as 29 wet and 26 dry AMD patients; and 18 healthy controls.They were all genotyped for the multiple gene polymorphisms in 12 different genes. Thedata set collected was then analyzed using the Bayesian inference methods and visualizedby means of the Bayesian networks. The results suggest that: 1) the PAI-1 4G/5G and FVG1691A genes have joint roles in the separation of the 3 groups; 2) both wet and dry …,Turkish Journal of Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences,2013,4
Automatic term ambiguity detection,Tyler Baldwin; Yunyao Li; Bogdan Alexe; Ioana R Stanoi,Abstract While the resolution of term ambiguity is important for information extraction (IE)systems; the cost of resolving each instance of an entity can be prohibitively expensive onlarge datasets. To combat this; this work looks at ambiguity detection at the term; rather thanthe instance; level. By making a judgment about the general ambiguity of a term; a system isable to handle ambiguous and unambiguous cases differently; improving throughput andquality. To address the term ambiguity detection problem; we employ a model that combinesdata from language models; ontologies; and topic modeling. Results over a dataset ofentities from four product domains show that the proposed approach achieves significantlyabove baseline F-measure of 0.96.,Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers),2013,4
Fatigue strengths of the 54SiCr6 steel under different cyclic loading conditions,CHEN Shuming LI Yongde LIU Yangbo; YANG Zhenguo LI Shouxin ZHANG Zhefeng,Abstract Since ultrasonic fatigue test has been used to study the very high cycle fatigue (10 7—10 9 cyc); the difference between ultrasonic and conventional fatigue test methods shouldbe evaluated in order to ensure the validity of ultrasonic fatigue result. By comparing someresults of other researchers; it is found that the frequency effect is negligible; and the loadingcondition is the main reason for the difference. A comparison of the fatigue strengths of the54SiCr6 high strength spring steel under three kinds of cyclic loading conditions; rotatingbending (RB); tension compression (TC) and ultrasonic (UL); was reported. The resultsreveal that the three kinds of fatigue specimens display different fracture features; and thefatigue strength of RB is the highest; TC is the lowest; and UL is somewhere in between. Thedifference in the fatigue strengths is mainly attributed to the distinctions of stress gradient …,Acta Metall Sin,2009,4

K-SRL: Instance-based Learning for Semantic Role Labeling,Alan Akbik; Yunyao Li,Abstract Semantic role labeling (SRL) is the task of identifying and labeling predicate-argument structures in sentences with semantic frame and role labels. A known challenge inSRL is the large number of low-frequency exceptions in training data; which are highlycontext-specific and difficult to generalize. To overcome this challenge; we propose the useof instance-based learning that performs no explicit generalization; but rather extrapolatespredictions from the most similar instances in the training data. We present a variant of k-nearest neighbors (kNN) classification with composite features to identify nearest neighborsfor SRL. We show that high-quality predictions can be derived from a very small number ofsimilar instances. In a comparative evaluation we experimentally demonstrate that ourinstance-based learning approach significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art …,Proceedings of COLING 2016; the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers,2016,3
Towards semi-automatic generation of proposition banks for low-resource languages,Alan Akbik; Yunyao Li,Abstract Annotation projection based on parallel corpora has shown great promise ininexpensively creating Proposition Banks for languages for which high-quality parallelcorpora and syntactic parsers are available. In this paper; we present an experimental studywhere we apply this approach to three languages that lack such resources: Tamil; Bengaliand Malayalam. We find an average quality difference of 6 to 20 absolute F-measure pointsvis-avis high-resource languages; which indicates that annotation projection alone isinsufficient in low-resource scenarios. Based on these results; we explore the possibility ofusing annotation projection as a starting point for inexpensive data curation involving bothexperts and non-experts. We give an outline of what such a process may look like andpresent an initial study to discuss its potential and challenges.,Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2016,3
Multilingual aliasing for auto-generating proposition banks,Alan Akbik; Xinyu Guan; Yunyao Li,Abstract Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is the task of identifying the predicate-argumentstructure in sentences with semantic frame and role labels. For the English language; theProposition Bank provides both a lexicon of all possible semantic frames and large amountsof labeled training data. In order to expand SRL beyond English; previous work investigatedautomatic approaches based on parallel corpora to automatically generate PropositionBanks for new target languages (TLs). However; this approach heuristically produces theframe lexicon from word alignments; leading to a range of lexicon-level errors andinconsistencies. To address these issues; we propose to manually alias TL verbs to existingEnglish frames. For instance; the German verb drehen may evoke several meanings;including” turn something” and” film something”. Accordingly; we alias the former to the …,Proceedings of COLING 2016; the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers,2016,3

An in-depth analysis of the effect of text normalization in social media,Tyler Baldwin; Yunyao Li,Abstract Recent years have seen increased interest in text normalization in social media; asthe informal writing styles found in Twitter and other social media data often cause problemsfor NLP applications. Unfortunately; most current approaches narrowly regard thenormalization task as a “one size fits all” task of replacing non-standard words with theirstandard counterparts. In this work we build a taxonomy of normalization edits and present astudy of normalization to examine its effect on three different downstream applications(dependency parsing; named entity recognition; and text-to-speech synthesis). The resultssuggest that how the normalization task should be viewed is highly dependent on thetargeted application. The results also show that normalization must be thought of as morethan word replacement in order to produce results comparable to those seen on clean …,Proceedings of the 2015 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies,2015,3
Seroprevalence of newly discovered duck flavivirus in farm animals,X Ma; B Huang; Y Li; Z Qin; F Li,Abstract New flavivirus has recently emerged in domestic ducks in China. The virus;provisionally designated duck flavivirus (DFV); causes highly significant economic losses toduck industry in China as a result of reduction in duck meat and eggs. Little is known aboutthe epidemiology of this new viral disease. In this study; we developed a fluorescence-based microneutralization assay to evaluate the seroprevalence of neutralizing antibodies toDFV in domestic farm animals as well as to assess antibody responses in ducks receivingan inactivated DFV vaccine. Screening of duck and pig serum samples found that 54.7%and 1.2%; respectively; of individuals had measurable neutralizing antibody titers to DFV.Interestingly; no serologic evidence of chicken infection was found in a collection of 356chicken sera from farms where outbreaks of DFV infection among ducks were …,J Immunol Tech Infect Dis 2,2013,3

Local MAD method for probe vehicle data processing,XUEGANG BAN; LI YUWEI; Alex Skabardonis,This paper presents a local median absolute deviation (MAD) method to process travel timesfrom raw probe vehicles data. The method is applied locally to each time window (band) witha fixed duration. To determine a proper band width; a sensitivity analysis is conducted tostudy how the band width impacts the performance of the method. The analysis reveals thatif data samples are fairly large; a band width of 15-30 minutes can be chosen in order tocapture the trend of travel times and the statistical rigor of the local MAD method. Themethod and the analysis presented in this paper are expected to provide some insights topractitioners who plan to use probe vehicle data for traffic analyses.

Interferon-γ induced expression of MHC antigens facilitates identification of donor cells in chimeric transplant recipients,Abdul S Rao; Anthony J Demetris; Shiguang Qian; Noriko Murase; Youping Li; John J Fung; Thomas E Starzl,Abstract After whole organ transplantation; donor bone marrow-derived cells migrate out ofthe graft into the recipient; leading to establishment of chimerism; which is the first steptowards the subsequent induction of donor-specific tolerance. In routineimmunohistochemical staining; monoclonal antibodies specific for heterotopic MHC allelesare used to identify donor and recipient cells. However; it is difficult to detect these cellsusing this technique in longterm allograft recipients who have a persistently low donor cellpopulation (microchimerism). Because Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) is known to induceexpression of MHC class I and class II cell surface molecules; we used this cytokine 12-48 hbefore sacrifice; to facilitate the identification of donor and recipient cells in the tissues ofanimals transplanted with either liver (B10→ C3H) or bone marrow (LEW→ BN).

Active learning for black-box semantic role labeling with neural factors,Chenguang Wang; Laura Chiticariu; Yunyao Li,Abstract Active learning is a useful technique for tasks for which unlabeled data is abundantbut manual labeling is expensive. One example of such a task is semantic role labeling(SRL); which relies heavily on labels from trained linguistic experts. One challenge inapplying active learning algorithms for SRL is that the complete knowledge of the SRLmodel is often unavailable; against the common assumption that active learning methodsare aware of the details of the underlying models. In this paper; we present an activelearning framework for blackbox SRL models (ie; models whose details are unknown). Inlieu of a query strategy based on model details; we propose a neural query strategy modelthat embeds both language and semantic information to automatically learn the querystrategy from predictions of an SRL model alone.

Natural Language Data Management and Interfaces: Recent Development and Open Challenges,Yunyao Li; Davood Rafiei,Abstract The volume of natural language text data has been rapidly increasing over the pasttwo decades; due to factors such as the growth of the Web; the low cost associated topublishing and the progress on the digitization of printed texts. This growth combined withthe proliferation of natural language systems for search and retrieving information providestremendous opportunities for studying some of the areas where database systems andnatural language processing systems overlap. This tutorial explores two more relevant areasof overlap to the database community:(1) managing natural language text data in arelational database; and (2) developing natural language interfaces to databases. Thetutorial presents state-of-the-art methods; related systems; research opportunities andchallenges covering both areas.,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data,2017,1
Synthesizing extraction rules from user examples with seer,Maeda F Hanafi; Azza Abouzied; Laura Chiticariu; Yunyao Li,Abstract Our demonstration showcases SEER's end-to-end Information Extraction (IE)workflow where users highlight texts they wish to extract. Given a small set of user-specifiedexample extractions; SEER synthesizes easy-to-understand IE rules and suggests them tothe user. In addition to rule suggestions; users can quickly pick the desired rule by filteringthe rule suggestion by accepting or rejecting proposed extractions. SEER's workflow allowsusers to jump start the IE rule development cycle; it is a less time-consuming alternative tomachine learning methods that require large labeled datasets or rule-based approachesthat are labor-intensive. SEER's design principles and learning algorithm are motivated byhow rule developers naturally construct data extraction rules.,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data,2017,1
Seer: Auto-generating information extraction rules from user-specified examples,Maeda F Hanafi; Azza Abouzied; Laura Chiticariu; Yunyao Li,Abstract Time-consuming and complicated best describe the current state of the InformationExtraction (IE) field. Machine learning approaches to IE require large collections of labeleddatasets that are difficult to create and use obscure mathematical models; occasionallyreturning unwanted results that are unexplainable. Rule-based approaches; while resultingin easy-to-understand IE rules; are still time-consuming and labor-intensive. SEERcombines the best of these two approaches: a learning model for IE rules based on a smallnumber of user-specified examples. In this paper; we explain the design behind SEER andpresent a user study comparing our system against a commercially available tool in whichusers create IE rules manually. Our results show that SEER helps users complete textextraction tasks more quickly; as well as more accurately.,Proceedings of the 2017 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2017,1

CROWD-IN-THE-LOOP: A Hybrid Approach for Annotating Semantic Roles,Chenguang Wang; Alan Akbik; Yunyao Li; Fei Xia; Anbang Xu,Abstract Crowdsourcing has proven to be an effective method for generating labeled data fora range of NLP tasks. However; multiple recent attempts of using crowdsourcing to generategold-labeled training data for semantic role labeling (SRL) reported only modest results;indicating that SRL is perhaps too difficult a task to be effectively crowdsourced. In thispaper; we postulate that while producing SRL annotation does require expert involvement ingeneral; a large subset of SRL labeling tasks is in fact appropriate for the crowd. We presenta novel workflow in which we employ a classifier to identify difficult annotation tasks androute each task either to experts or crowd workers according to their difficulties.

Digital Calibration for Current-Loop Output of Piezoresistive Sensors,Chao Yan; Jian Ning Ding; Zong Xing Li; Chao Min Mao,Abstract: Article Preview Article Preview The precision of piezoresistive sensors is lowbetween wide temperature range. The conditioning result isn't ideal by analog approaches.Also the efficiency is very low. To improve this condition; a digital approach is introduced. Itcoverts sensors' analog signal to digital value; and then uses polynomial and coefficientsstored in singlechip to correct the digital value. At last; the singlechip coverts correcteddigital value to analog signal to output. Its conditioning principle and calibration process isalso described. We realized 4-to-20mA-current-loop-output of piezoresistive sensors usingthis aprroch. Calibration results show this method is efficient and low cost.,Advanced Materials Research,2011,*

Application of non-stationary Poisson model prediction on seismic belts in northwestern of China,Ying Li; Wei-ming Zhao; Wen-xiao Zhang; He-qing Ma; Xue-mei Ren,Earthquake probability prediction is based on earthquakes occurred in a certain seismo-tectonic region to predict the probable times and probability of certain magnitude segmentearthquake or the earthquake whose magnitude is larger than certain magnitude low limit inthe coming certain period; this was extensively applied to earthquake risk analysis andearthquake forecast. The main characteristics of the method are that when earthquakestatistical model was founded according to the occurred earthquake in tectonic region; thedetailed course and activity image could be ignored. With the continued study of earthquakephenomenon and its geophysical; mechanical mechanism and mathematical physicspatterns; some probability forecast models were proposed sequentially to describe differentearthquake processes.

The construction of cDNA expression library from the venom of Inimicus japonicus,Jiang Xiaoyu; Tu Hongbin; Chen Huiping; Wei Jianwen; Yang Wenli; Wu Wenyan; Xu Anlong,Abstract A cDNA library of the venom of Inimicus japonicus was constructed. The cDNA wascloned into eukaryotical expression plasmid pcDNA3. 0. SMART~(TM) protocol was used forcDNA library construction and bioinformatics analysis was carried out. 94 novel EST cloneswere obtained from 150 sequences in the library; of which there were 35 full-length clones;including cytolysin genes; short neurotoxin gene; C-type lectin gene; macrophage migrationinhibitory factor gene and so on. Most of those genes were reported for the first time inInimicus japonicus. Further studies on those genes and large scales of sequencing in thelibrary are going on; which may be helpful to make clear the components of Inimicusjaponicus venom and understand the function of those proteins at molecular level.,Sheng wu hua xue yu sheng wu wu li jin zhan,2002,*

Transparent Machine Learning for Information Extraction: State-of-the-Art and the Future,Laura Chiticariu; Yunyao Li; Frederick R Reiss,The rise of Big Data analytics over unstructured text has led to renewed interest ininformation extraction (IE). These applications need effective IE as a first step towardssolving end-to-end real world problems (eg biology; medicine; finance; media andentertainment; etc). Much recent NLP research has focused on addressing specific IEproblems using a pipeline of multiple machine learning techniques. This approach requiresan analyst with the expertise to answer questions such as:“What ML techniques should Icombine to solve this problem?”;“What features will be useful for the composite pipeline?”;and “Why is my model giving the wrong answer on this document?”. The need for thisexpertise creates problems in real world applications. It is very difficult in practice to find ananalyst who both understands the real world problem and has deep knowledge of …,*,*,*

DaNaLIX: for Querying XML,Yunyao Li; Ishan Chaudhuri; Huahai Yang; Satinder Singh; HV Jagadish,ABSTRACT We present DaNaLIX; a prototype domain-adaptive natural language interfacefor querying XML. Our system is an extension of NaLIX; a generic natural language interfacefor querying XML [4; 5]. While retaining the portability of a purely generic system like NaLIX;DaNaLIX can exploit domain-specific knowledge; whenever available; to its advantage forquery translation. More importantly; in DaNaLIX such domain-specific knowledge does nothave to be pre-defined; instead it can be automatically obtained from the interactionsbetween a user and the system. In this demonstration; we describe the overall architecture ofDaNaLIX. We also demonstrate how a generic system like DaNaLIX can take advantage ofdomain-specific knowledge to improve its usability and query translation accuracy. Inaddition; we show DaNaLIX still possesses the portability of a generic system by using …,Ann Arbor,*,*
