Quantifying Controversy on Social Media,Kiran Garimella; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis; Michael Mathioudakis,Abstract Which topics spark the most heated debates on social media? Identifying thosetopics is not only interesting from a societal point of view but also allows the filtering andaggregation of social media content for disseminating news stories. In this article; weperform a systematic methodological study of controversy detection by using the content andthe network structure of social media. Unlike previous work; rather than studying controversyin a single hand-picked topic and using domain-specific knowledge; we take a generalapproach to study topics in any domain. Our approach to quantifying controversy is basedon a graph-based three-stage pipeline; which involves (i) building a conversation graphabout a topic;(ii) partitioning the conversation graph to identify potential sides of thecontroversy; and (iii) measuring the amount of controversy from characteristics of the …,ACM Transactions on Social Computing,2018,69
Load prediction and hot spot detection models for autonomic cloud computing,Prasad Saripalli; Venkata Rama Kiran Garimella; R Ravi Shankar; Harish Narware; Nitin Bindal,Cloud computing is leading to transformational changes with stringent requirements onusability; performance and security over very heterogeneous workloads. Their run-timemanagement requires realistic algorithms and techniques for sampling; measurement andcharacterization for load prediction. Due to the expectation of elasticity; large swings in theirdemand are common; which cannot be modeled accurately based on raw measures such asthe number of session requests; which show very large variability and poor auto-correlation.We demonstrate the use of load prediction algorithms for cloud platforms; using a two-stepapproach of load trend tracking followed by load prediction; using cubic spline Interpolation;and hotspot detection algorithm for sudden spikes. Such algorithms integrated into theautonomic management framework of a cloud platform can be used to ensure that the …,Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC); 2011 Fourth IEEE International Conference on,2011,61
Who watches (and shares) what on youtube? and when?: using twitter to understand youtube viewership,Adiya Abisheva; Venkata Rama Kiran Garimella; David Garcia; Ingmar Weber,Abstract By combining multiple social media datasets; it is possible to gain insight into eachdataset that goes beyond what could be obtained with either individually. In this paper wecombine user-centric data from Twitter with video-centric data from YouTube to build a richpicture of who watches and shares what on YouTube. We study 87K Twitter users; 5.6million YouTube videos and 15 million video sharing events from user-; video-and sharing-event-centric perspectives. We show that features of Twitter users correlate with YouTubefeatures and sharing-related features. For example; urban users are quicker to share thanrural users. We find a superlinear relationship between initial Twitter shares and the finalamounts of views. We discover that Twitter activity metrics play more role in video popularitythan mere amount of followers. We also reveal the existence of correlated behavior …,Proceedings of the 7th ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2014,53
Inferring international and internal migration patterns from twitter data,Emilio Zagheni; Venkata Rama Kiran Garimella; Ingmar Weber,Abstract Data about migration flows are largely inconsistent across countries; typicallyoutdated; and often inexistent. Despite the importance of migration as a driver ofdemographic change; there is limited availability of migration statistics. Generally;researchers rely on census data to indirectly estimate flows. However; little can be inferredfor specific years between censuses and for recent trends. The increasing availability ofgeolocated data from online sources has opened up new opportunities to track recent trendsin migration patterns and to improve our understanding of the relationships between internaland international migration. In this paper; we use geolocated data for about 500;000 users ofthe social network website" Twitter". The data are for users in OECD countries during theperiod May 2011-April 2013. We evaluated; for the subsample of users who have posted …,Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on World Wide Web,2014,51
Secular vs. islamist polarization in egypt on twitter,Ingmar Weber; Venkata R Kiran Garimella; Alaa Batayneh,Abstract We use public data from Twitter; both in English and Arabic; to study thephenomenon of secular vs. Islamist polarization in Twitter. Starting with a set of prominentseed Twitter users from both camps; we follow retweeting edges to obtain an extendednetwork of users with inferred political orientation. We present an in-depth description of themembers of the two camps; both in terms of behavior on Twitter and in terms of offlinecharacteristics such as gender. Through the identification of partisan users; we compute avalence on the secular vs. Islamist axis for hashtags and use this information both to analyzetopical interests and to quantify how polarized society as a whole is at a given point in time.For the last 12 months; large values on this" polarization barometer" coincided with periodsof violence.

Mining web query logs to analyze political issues,Ingmar Weber; Venkata Rama Kiran Garimella; Erik Borra,Abstract We present a novel approach to using anonymized web search query logs toanalyze and visualize political issues. Our starting point is a list of politically annotated blogs(left vs. right). We use this list to assign a numerical political leaning to queries leading toclicks on these blogs. Furthermore; we map queries to Wikipedia articles and to fact-checkedstatements from politifact. com; as well as applying sentiment analysis to search results. Withthis rich; multi-faceted data set we obtain novel graphical visualizations of issues anddiscover connections between the different variables. Our findings include (i) an interest in"the other side" where queries about Democrat politicians have a right leaning and viceversa;(ii) evidence that" lies are catchy" and that queries pertaining to false statements aremore likely to attract large volumes; and (iii) the observation that the more right-leaning a …,Proceedings of the 4th Annual ACM Web Science Conference,2012,37
Gender Asymmetries in Reality and Fiction: The Bechdel Test of Social Media.,David Garcia; Ingmar Weber; Venkata Rama Kiran Garimella,Abstract The subjective nature of gender inequality motivates the analysis and comparisonof data from real and fictional human interaction. We present a computational extension ofthe Bechdel test: A popular tool to assess if a movie contains a male gender bias; by lookingfor two female characters who discuss about something besides a man. We provide the toolsto quantify Bechdel scores for both genders; and we measure them in movie scripts andlarge datasets of dialogues between users of MySpace and Twitter. Comparing movies andusers of social media; we find that movies and Twitter conversations have a consistent malebias; which does not appear when analyzing MySpace. Furthermore; the narrative of Twitteris closer to the movies that do not pass the Bechdel test than to those that pass it. We link theproperties of movies and the users that share trailers of those movies. Our analysis …,ICWSM,2014,30
Reducing controversy by connecting opposing views,Kiran Garimella; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis; Michael Mathioudakis,Abstract Society is often polarized by controversial issues that split the population intogroups with opposing views. When such issues emerge on social media; we often observethe creation ofecho chambers'; ie; situations where like-minded people reinforce eachother's opinion; but do not get exposed to the views of the opposing side. In this paper westudy algorithmic techniques for bridging these chambers; and thus reduce controversy.Specifically; we represent the discussion on a controversial issue with an endorsementgraph; and cast our problem as an edge-recommendation problem on this graph. The goalof the recommendation is to reduce the controversy score of the graph; which is measuredby a recently-developed metric based on random walks. At the same time; we take intoaccount the acceptance probability of the recommended edge; which represents how …,Proceedings of the Tenth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2017,28

Political hashtag trends,Ingmar Weber; Venkata Rama Kiran Garimella; Asmelash Teka,Abstract Political Hashtag Trends (PHT) is an analysis tool for political left-vs.-rightpolarization of Twitter hashtags. PHT computes a leaning for trending; political hashtags in agiven week; giving insights into the polarizing US American issues on Twitter. The leaning ofa hashtag is derived in two steps. First; users retweeting a set of “seed users” with a knownpolitical leaning; such as Barack Obama or Mitt Romney; are identified and thecorresponding leaning is assigned to retweeters. Second; a hashtag is assigned a fractionalleaning corresponding to which retweeting users used it. Non-political hashtags areremoved by requiring certain hashtag co-occurrence patterns. PHT also offers functionalityto put the results into context. For example; it shows example tweets from different leanings;it shows historic information and it links to the New York Times archives to explore a topic …,European Conference on Information Retrieval,2013,23
From “I love you babe” to “leave me alone”-Romantic Relationship Breakups on Twitter,Venkata Rama Kiran Garimella; Ingmar Weber; Sonya Dal Cin,Abstract We use public data from Twitter to study the breakups of the romantic relationshipsof 661 couples. Couples are identified through profile references such as@ user1 writing “@user2 is the best boyfriend ever!!”. Using this data set we find evidence for a number ofexisting hypotheses describing psychological processes including (i) pre-relationshipcloseness being indicative of post-relationship closeness;(ii)“stonewalling”; ie; ignoringmessages by a partner; being indicative of a pending breakup; and (iii) post-breakupdepression. We also observe a previously undocumented phenomenon of “batch un-friending and being un-friended” where users who break up experience sudden drops of 15-20 followers and friends. Our work shows that public Twitter data can be used to gain newinsights into psychological processes surrounding relationship dissolutions; something …,International Conference on Social Informatics,2014,19

Towards multi-document summarization of scientific articles: making interesting comparisons with SciSumm,Nitin Agarwal; VRK Garimella; Ravi Shankar Reddy; Carolyn Penstein Rosé,Abstract We present a novel unsupervised approach to the problem of multi-documentsummarization of scientific articles; in which the document collection is a list of papers citedtogether within the same source article; otherwise known as a co-citation. At the heart of theapproach is a topic based clustering of fragments extracted from each co-cited article andrelevance ranking using a query generated from the context surrounding the co-cited list ofpapers. This analysis enables the generation of an overview of common themes from the co-cited papers that relate to the context in which the co-citation was found. We present asystem called SciSumm that embodies this approach and apply it to the 2008 ACLAnthology. We evaluate this summarization system for relevant content selection using goldstandard summaries prepared on principle based guidelines.

Evolutionary clustering using frequent itemsets,Ravi Shankar; Venkata Rama Kiran Garimella; Vikram Pudi,Abstract Evolutionary clustering is an emerging research area addressing the problem ofclustering dynamic data. An evolutionary clustering should take care of two conflictingcriteria: preserving the current cluster quality and not deviating too much from the recenthistory. In this paper we propose an algorithm for evolutionary clustering using frequentitemsets. A frequent itemset based approach for evolutionary clustering is natural and itautomatically satisfy the two criteria of evolutionary clustering. We provide theoretical as wellas experimental proofs to support our claims. We performed experiments on our approachusing different datasets and the results show that our approach is comparable to most of theexisting algorithms for evolutionary clustering.,Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Novel Data Stream Pattern Mining Techniques,2010,16
Inferring audience partisanship for youtube videos,Ingmar Weber; Venkata Rama Kiran Garimella; Erik Borra,Abstract Political campaigning and the corresponding advertisement money are increasinglymoving online. Some analysts claim that the US~ elections were partly won through a smartuse of (i) targeted advertising and (ii) social media. But what type of information dopoliticized users consume online? And; the other way around; for a given content; eg aYouTube video; is it possible to predict its political audience? To address this latter question;we present a large scale study of anonymous YouTube video consumption of politicizedusers; where political orientation is derived from visits to" beacon pages"; namely; politicalpartisan blogs. Though our techniques are relevant for targeted political advertising; webelieve that our findings are also of a wider interest.,Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web,2013,14
Social media image analysis for public health,Venkata Rama Kiran Garimella; Abdulrahman Alfayad; Ingmar Weber,Abstract Several projects have shown the feasibility to use emph {textual} social media datato track public health concerns; such as temporal influenza patterns or geographical obesitypatterns. In this paper; we look at whether geo-tagged emph {images} from Instagram alsoprovide a viable data source. Especially for" lifestyle" diseases; such as obesity; drinking orsmoking; images of social gatherings could provide information that is not necessarilyshared in; say; tweets. In this study; we explore whether (i) tags provided by the users and(ii) annotations obtained via automatic image tagging are indeed valuable for studyingpublic health.

A long-term analysis of polarization on Twitter,Venkata Rama Kiran Garimella; Ingmar Weber,Abstract: Social media has played an important role in shaping political discourse over thelast decade. At the same time; it is often perceived to have increased political polarization;thanks to the scale of discussions and their public nature. In this paper; we try to answer thequestion of whether political polarization in the US on Twitter has increased over the lasteight years. We analyze a large longitudinal Twitter dataset of 679;000 users and look atsigns of polarization in their (i) network-how people follow political and media accounts;(ii)tweeting behavior-whether they retweet content from both sides; and (iii) content-howpartisan the hashtags they use are. Our analysis shows that online polarization has indeedincreased over the past eight years and that; depending on the measure; the relative changeis 10%-20%.

Co-following on Twitter,Venkata Rama Kiran Garimella; Ingmar Weber,Abstract We present an in-depth study of co-following on Twitter based on the observationthat two Twitter users whose followers have similar friends are also similar; even though theymight not share any direct links or a single mutual follower. We show how this observationcontributes to (i) a better understanding of language-agnostic user classification onTwitter;(ii) eliciting opportunities for Computational Social Science; and (iii) improving onlinemarketing by identifying cross-selling opportunities. We start with a machine learningproblem of predicting a user's preference among two alternative choices of Twitter friends.We show that co-following information provides strong signals for diverse classification tasksand that these signals persist even when the most discriminative features are removed.Going beyond mere classification performance optimization; we present applications of …,Proceedings of the 25th ACM conference on Hypertext and social media,2014,9

Quote rts on twitter: usage of the new feature for political discourse,Kiran Garimella; Ingmar Weber; Munmun De Choudhury,Abstract Social media platforms provide several social interactional features. Due to thelarge scale reach of social media; these interactional features help enable various types ofpolitical discourse. Constructive and diversified discourse is important for sustaining healthycommunities and reducing the impact of echo chambers. In this paper; we empiricallyexamine the role of a newly introduced Twitter feature;'quote retweets'(or'quote RTs') inpolitical discourse; specifically whether it has led to improved; civil; and balanced exchange.Quote RTs allow users to quote the tweet they retweet; while adding a short comment. Ouranalysis using content; network and crowd labeled data indicates that the feature hasincreased political discourse and its diffusion; compared to existing features. We discuss theimplications of our findings in understanding and reducing online polarization.,Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Web Science,2016,6
Exploring controversy in twitter,Kiran Garimella; Michael Mathioudakis; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis,Abstract Among the topics discussed on social media; some spark more heated debate thanothers. For example; experience suggests that major political events; such as a vote forhealthcare law in the US; would spark more debate be-tween opposing sides than otherevents; such as a concert of a popular music band. Exploring the topics of discussion onTwitter and understanding which ones are controver-sial is extremely useful for a variety ofpurposes; such as for journalists to understand what issues divide the public; or for socialscientists to understand how controversy is manifested in social interactions.,Proceedings of the 19th ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing Companion,2016,6
The ebb and flow of controversial debates on social media,Kiran Garimella; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis; Michael Mathioudakis,Abstract: We explore how the polarization around controversial topics evolves on Twitter-over a long period of time (2011 to 2016); and also as a response to major external eventsthat lead to increased related activity. We find that increased activity is typically associatedwith increased polarization; however; we find no consistent long-term trend in polarizationover time among the topics we study.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.05994,2017,5
Visualizing User-Defined; Discriminative Geo-Temporal Twitter Activity.,Ingmar Weber; Venkata Rama Kiran Garimella,Abstract We present a system that visualizes geo-temporal Twitter activity. Thedistinguishing features our system offers include;(i) a large degree of user freedom inspecifying the subset of data to visualize and (ii) a focus on discriminative patterns ratherthan high volume patterns. Tweets with precise GPS co-ordinates are assigned togeographical cells and grouped by (i) tweet language;(ii) tweet topic;(iii) day of week; and(iv) time of day. The spatial resolutions of the cells is determined in a data-driven mannerusing quad-trees and recursive splitting. The user can then choose to see data for; say;English tweets on weekend evenings for the topic “party”. This system has beenimplemented for 1.8 million geo-tagged tweets from Qatar (http://qtr. qcri. org/) and for 4.8million geotagged tweets from New York City (http://nyc. qcri. org/) and can be easily …,ICWSM,2014,5
Using Co-Following for Personalized Out-of-Context Twitter Friend Recommendation.,Ingmar Weber; Venkata Rama Kiran Garimella,Abstract We present two demos that give personalized “out-of-context” recommendations ofTwitter users to follow. By out-of-context we mean that a user wants to receiverecommendation on; say; musicians to follow even though the user's tweets' contents andsocial links have no connection to the “context” of music. In this setting; where a user hasnever expressed interest in the context of music; many existing methods fail. Our approachexploits co-following information and hidden correlations where; say; a user's politicalpreference might actually provide clues about their likely music preference. For example; auser u might be recommended a particular music band b because u also follows a set ofpoliticians P; and other users who follow members of P tend to follow b; rather than analternative b0. We implement this framework in two very distinct settings: one for …,ICWSM,2014,4
Factors in recommending contrarian content on social media,Kiran Garimella; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis; Michael Mathioudakis,Abstract Polarization is a troubling phenomenon that can lead to societal divisions and hurtthe democratic process. It is therefore important to develop methods to reduce it. Wepropose an algorithmic solution to the problem of reducing polarization. The core idea is toexpose users to content that challenges their point of view; with the hope broadening theirperspective; and thus reduce their polarity. Our method takes into account several aspects ofthe problem; such as the estimated polarity of the user; the probability of accepting therecommendation; the polarity of the content; and popularity of the content beingrecommended.,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Web Science Conference,2017,3
A motif-based approach for identifying controversy,Mauro Coletto; Kiran Garimella; Aristides Gionis; Claudio Lucchese,Abstract: Among the topics discussed in Social Media; some lead to controversy. A numberof recent studies have focused on the problem of identifying controversy in social mediamostly based on the analysis of textual content or rely on global network structure. Suchapproaches have strong limitations due to the difficulty of understanding natural language;and of investigating the global network structure. In this work we show that it is possible todetect controversy in social media by exploiting network motifs; ie; local patterns of userinteraction. The proposed approach allows for a language-independent and fine-grainedand efficient-to-compute analysis of user discussions and their evolution over time. Thesupervised model exploiting motif patterns can achieve 85% accuracy; with an improvementof 7% compared to baseline structural; propagation-based and temporal network features …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.05053,2017,3

The combination of these data sets1; with around 87k Twitter users; 5.6 million YouTube videos and 15 million video sharingevents; allows rich analysis that goes beyond what could be obtained with either of the twodata sets individually. For Twitter; we generate user features that relate to (i) activity;(ii)interests; and (iii) demographics. For YouTube; we obtain video features for (i) the topic;(ii)the popularity; and (iii) the polarization. These two feature sets are then combined throughsharing events for YouTube URLs on Twitter. This combination is done both in a user-centric; a video-centric and a sharing-event-centric manner.

Political Discourse on Social Media: Echo Chambers; Gatekeepers; and the Price of Bipartisanship,Kiran Garimella; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis; Michael Mathioudakis,Abstract: Echo chambers; ie; situations where one is exposed only to opinions that agreewith their own; are an increasing concern for the political discourse in many democraticcountries. This paper studies the phenomenon of political echo chambers on social media.We identify the two components in the phenomenon: the opinion that is shared ('echo'); andthe place that allows its exposure ('chamber'---the social network); and examine closely athow these two components interact. We define a production and consumption measure forsocial-media users; which captures the political leaning of the content shared and receivedby them. By comparing the two; we find that Twitter users are; to a large degree; exposed topolitical opinions that agree with their own. We also find that users who try to bridge the echochambers; by sharing content with diverse leaning; have to pay a'price of bipartisanship'in …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.01665,2018,1
The effect of collective attention on controversial debates on social media,Kiran Garimella; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis; Michael Mathioudakis,Abstract We study the evolution of long-lived controversial debates as manifested on Twitterfrom 2011 to 2016. Specifically; we explore how the structure of interactions and content ofdiscussion varies with the level of collective attention; as evidenced by the number of usersdiscussing a topic. Spikes in the volume of users typically correspond to external events thatincrease the public attention on the topic-as; for instance; discussions about'guncontrol'often erupt after a mass shooting. This work is the first to study the dynamic evolutionof polarized online debates at such scale. By employing a wide array of network and contentanalysis measures; we find consistent evidence that increased collective attention isassociated with increased network polarization and network concentration within each sideof the debate; and overall more uniform lexicon usage across all users.,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Web Science Conference,2017,1

Balancing information exposure in social networks,Kiran Garimella; Aristides Gionis; Nikos Parotsidis; Nikolaj Tatti,Abstract Social media has brought a revolution on how people are consuming news.Beyond the undoubtedly large number of advantages brought by social-media platforms; apoint of criticism has been the creation of echo chambers and filter bubbles; caused bysocial homophily and algorithmic personalization. In this paper we address the problem ofbalancing the information exposure} in a social network. We assume that two opposingcampaigns (or viewpoints) are present in the network; and that network nodes have differentpreferences towards these campaigns. Our goal is to find two sets of nodes to employ in therespective campaigns; so that the overall information exposure for the two campaigns isbalanced. We formally define the problem; characterize its hardness; develop approximationalgorithms; and present experimental evaluation results.

Joint Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Learning Ideological Leaning on Twitter,Preethi Lahoti; Kiran Garimella; Aristides Gionis,Abstract People are shifting from traditional news sources to online news at an incrediblyfast rate. However; the technology behind online news consumption promotes content thatconfirms the users» existing point of view. This phenomenon has led to polarization ofopinions and intolerance towards opposing views. Thus; a key problem is to modelinformation filter bubbles on social media and design methods to eliminate them. In thispaper; we use a machine-learning approach to learn a liberal-conservative ideology spaceon Twitter; and show how we can use the learned latent space to tackle the filter bubbleproblem. We model the problem of learning the liberal-conservative ideology space of socialmedia users and media sources as a constrained non-negative matrix-factorization problem.Our model incorporates the social-network structure and content-consumption information …,Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2018,*
Studying Migrant Assimilation Through Facebook Interests,Antoine Dubois; Emilio Zagheni; Kiran Garimella; Ingmar Weber,Abstract: Migrants' assimilation is a major challenge for European societies; in part becauseof the sudden surge of refugees in recent years and in part because of long-termdemographic trends. In this paper; we use Facebook's data for advertisers to study the levelsof assimilation of Arabic-speaking migrants in Germany; as seen through the interests theyexpress online. Our results indicate a gradient of assimilation along demographic lines;language spoken and country of origin. Given the difficulty to collect timely migration data; inparticular for traits related to cultural assimilation; the methods that we develop and theresults that we provide open new lines of research that computational social scientists arewell-positioned to address.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.09430,2018,*
Professional Gender Gaps Across US Cities,Karri Haranko; Emilio Zagheni; Kiran Garimella; Ingmar Weber,Abstract: Gender imbalances in work environments have been a long-standing concern.Identifying the existence of such imbalances is key to designing policies to help overcomethem. In this work; we study gender trends in employment across various dimensions in theUnited States. This is done by analyzing anonymous; aggregate statistics that wereextracted from LinkedIn's advertising platform. The data contain the number of male andfemale LinkedIn users with respect to (i) location;(ii) age;(iii) industry and (iv) certain skills.We studied which of these categories correlate the most with high relative male or femalepresence on LinkedIn. In addition to examining the summary statistics of the LinkedIn data;we model the gender balance as a function of the different employee features using linearregression. Our results suggest that the gender gap varies across all feature types; but the …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.09429,2018,*
Polarization on Social Media,Kiran Garimella,Social media and the web have provided a foundation where users can easily accessdiverse information from around the world. However; over the years; various factors; such asuser homophily (social network structure); and algorithmic filtering (eg; news feeds andrecommendations) have narrowed the breadth of content that a user consumes. This haslead to an ever-increasing cycle where users on social media only consume content thatagrees with their beliefs and hence are recommended more such content; ultimately leadingto a polarized society where diverse opinions are not encouraged. This thesis provides abroad overview of polarization on social media; along with algorithmic techniques to identifypolarized topics; understanding their properties over time; and finally; to reduce polarization.First; we provide methods to identify polarized topics automatically from social-media …,*,2018,*

Understanding Para Social Breakups on Twitter,Kiran Garimella; Jonathan Cohen; Ingmar Weber,Abstract Celebrity and fandom have been studied extensively in real life. Perceived virtualrelationships; commonly known as para-social relationships (PSR) have been shown toexist between celebrities and fans (Horton and Wohl; 1956). The end of such relationships;para-social breakups (PSB); have also been studied (Eyal and Cohen; 2006). However; withmore and more celebrities using social media; the dynamics of PSR and PSB havechanged. Using data from 57;000 fans for the top followed celebrities on Twitter; we try tounderstand how para-social breakups manifest on Twitter. We hypothesize that a PSB onTwitter happens as an act of unfollowing the celebrity and study the differences in engagingin a PSB between various types of fans. We find that; surprisingly; the most devoted fans aremore likely to be involved in a para-social breakup. Given our scale and dependence on …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Web Science Conference,2017,*
Ad-blocking: A Study on Performance; Privacy and Counter-measures,Kiran Garimella; Orestis Kostakis; Michael Mathioudakis,Abstract Many internet ventures rely on advertising for their revenue. However; users feeldiscontent by the presence of ads on the websites they visit; as the data-size of ads is oftencomparable to that of the actual content. This has an impact not only on the loading time ofwebpages; but also on the internet bill of the user in some cases. In absence of a mutually-agreed procedure for opting out of advertisements; many users resort to ad-blockingbrowser-extensions. In this work; we study the performance of popular ad-blockers on alarge set of news websites. Moreover; we investigate the benefits of ad-blockers on userprivacy as well as the mechanisms used by websites to counter them. Finally; we explore thetraffic overhead due to the ad-blockers themselves.,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Web Science Conference,2017,*
Characterizing Fan Behavior to Study Para Social Breakups,Kiran Garimella; Jonathan Cohen; Ingmar Weber,Abstract: Celebrity and fandom have been studied extensively in real life. However; withmore and more celebrities using social media; the dynamics of interaction betweencelebrities and fans has changed. Using data from a set of 57;000 fans for the top followedcelebrities on Twitter; we define a wide range of features based on their Twitter activity.Using factor analysis we find the most important factors that underlie fan behavior. Usingthese factors; we conduct analysis on (i) understanding fan behavior by gender\& age; and(ii) para-social breakup behavior. We find that (i) fandom is a social phenomenon;(ii) femalefans are often more devoted and younger fans are more active & social; and (iii) the mostdevoted fans are more likely to be involved in a para-social breakup. Our findings confirmexisting research on para-social interactions. Given the scale of our study and …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.09087,2017,*
Media Attention to Science,Kiran Garimella; Han Xiao,Abstract How has media attention to science changed over the past decade? Does mediaattention bring scientific attention too? To answer these questions; we collected mediaattention statistics from Altmetric. com for over 40;000 papers published in PNAS journal inthe last 13 years. Our analysis reveals that (i) Media attention to science has slowly; butsteadily increased over time;(ii) Media attention doesn't necessarily translate into scientificattention (citations) and;(iii) It is non-trivial to predict the amount of media attention a papergets from attributes such as authors; author affiliations; abstract; and title.,Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web Companion,2017,*
Understanding International Migration using Tensor Factorization,Hieu Nguyen; Kiran Garimella,Understanding human migration is of great interest to demographers and social scientists.User generated digital data has made it easier to study such patterns at a global scale. Geocoded Twitter data; in particular; has been shown to be a promising source to analyse largescale human migration. But given the scale of these datasets; a lot of manual effort has to beput into processing and getting actionable insights from this data. In this paper; we explorethe the feasibility of using a new tool; tensor decomposition; to understand trends in globalhuman migration. We model human migration as a three mode tensor; consisting of (origincountry; destination country; time of migration) and apply CP decomposition to getmeaningful low dimensional factors. Our experiments on a large Twitter dataset spanning 5years and over 100M tweets show that we can extract meaningful migration patterns.,Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web Companion,2017,*

Document Clustering using various External Knowledge sources,VRK Garimella,Abstract The problem of document clustering is to arrange a set of documents into groupssuch that documents within a group are related to each other. Document clustering has beenstudied extensively because of the huge increase in the amount of digital text content onlineand also due to its wide applicability in areas such as web mining; information retrieval; etc.Typical document clustering algorithms have issues like handling high dimensionality;scalability; building an efficient hierarchy; good clustering accuracy; etc. In this thesis; wepresent a framework for document clustering that addresses all the above issues. Theframework is a fusion of two broach approaches. The first approach consists of a topic-baseddocument clustering algorithm; and in the second approach we provide methods to enhancethe clustering produced using various external knowledge sources like Wikipedia and …,*,2011,*
