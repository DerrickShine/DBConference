Here we have shown that Ly-6C+ monocytes constitutivelytrafficked into skin; lung; and lymph nodes (LNs). Entry was unaffected in gnotobiotic mice.Monocytes in resting lung and LN had similar gene expression profiles to blood monocytesbut elevated transcripts of a limited number of genes including cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2)and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII); induced by monocyte interaction withendothelium. Parabiosis; bromodoxyuridine (BrdU) pulse-chase analysis; and intranasalinstillation of tracers indicated that instead of contributing to resident macrophages in thelung; recruited endogenous monocytes acquired antigen for carriage to draining LNs; afunction redundant with DCs though differentiation to DCs did not occur. Thus; monocytes …,Immunity,2013,323
Liposome-siRNA-peptide complexes cross the blood-brain barrier and significantly decrease PrPC on neuronal cells and PrPRES in infected cell cultures,Bruce Pulford; Natalia Reim; Aimee Bell; Jessica Veatch; Genevieve Forster; Heather Bender; Crystal Meyerett; Scott Hafeman; Brady Michel; Theodore Johnson; A Christy Wyckoff; Gino Miele; Christian Julius; Jan Kranich; Alan Schenkel; Steven Dow; Mark D Zabel,Background Recent advances toward an effective therapy for prion diseases employ RNAinterference to suppress PrPC expression and subsequent prion neuropathology; exploitingthe phenomenon that disease severity and progression correlate with host PrPC expressionlevels. However; delivery of lentivirus encoding PrP shRNA has demonstrated only modestefficacy in vivo. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we describe a new siRNA deliverysystem incorporating a small peptide that binds siRNA and acetylcholine receptors (AchRs);acting as a molecular messenger for delivery to neurons; and cationic liposomes that protectsiRNA-peptide complexes from serum degradation. Conclusions/Significance Liposome-siRNA-peptide complexes (LSPCs) delivered PrP siRNA specifically to AchR-expressingcells; suppressed PrPC expression and eliminated PrPRES formation in vitro.

In vitro strain adaptation of CWD prions by serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification,Crystal Meyerett; Brady Michel; Bruce Pulford; Terry R Spraker; Traci A Nichols; Theodore Johnson; Timothy Kurt; Edward A Hoover; Glenn C Telling; Mark D Zabel,Abstract We used serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification (sPMCA) to amplify the D10strain of CWD prions in a linear relationship over two logs of D10 dilutions. The resultantPMCA-amplified D10 induced terminal TSE disease in CWD-susceptible Tg (cerPrP) 1536mice with a survival time approximately 80 days shorter than the original D10 inoculum;similar to that produced by in vivo sub-passage of D10 in Tg (cerPrP) 1536 mice. Both invitro-amplified and mouse-passaged D10 produced brain lesion profiles; glycoform ratiosand conformational stabilities significantly different than those produced by the original D10inoculum in Tg (cerPrP) 1536 mice. These findings demonstrate that sPMCA can amplifyand adapt prion strains in vitro as effectively and much more quickly than in vivo strainadaptation by mouse passage. Thus sPMCA may represent a powerful tool to assess …,Virology,2008,61
Incunabular immunological events in prion trafficking,Brady Michel; Crystal Meyerett-Reid; Theodore Johnson; Adam Ferguson; Christy Wyckoff; Bruce Pulford; Heather Bender; Anne Avery; Glenn Telling; Steven Dow; Mark D Zabel,Abstract While prions probably interact with the innate immune system immediately followinginfection; little is known about this initial confrontation. Here we investigated incunabularevents in lymphotropic and intranodal prion trafficking by following highly enriched;fluorescent prions from infection sites to draining lymph nodes. We detected biphasiclymphotropic transport of prions from the initial entry site upon peripheral prion inoculation.Prions arrived in draining lymph nodes cell autonomously within two hours of intraperitonealadministration. Monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs) required Complement for optimal priondelivery to lymph nodes hours later in a second wave of prion trafficking. B cells constitutedthe majority of prion-bearing cells in the mediastinal lymph node by six hours; indicatingintranodal prion reception from resident DCs or subcapsulary sinus macrophages or …,Scientific reports,2012,26
Genetic depletion of complement receptors CD21/35 prevents terminal prion disease in a mouse model of chronic wasting disease,Brady Michel; Adam Ferguson; Theodore Johnson; Heather Bender; Crystal Meyerett-Reid; Bruce Pulford; Adriana Von Teichman; Davis Seelig; John H Weis; Glenn C Telling; Adriano Aguzzi; Mark D Zabel,The complement system has been shown to facilitate peripheral prion pathogenesis. Micelacking complement receptors CD21/35 partially resist terminal prion disease when infectedip with mouse-adapted scrapie prions. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an emerging priondisease of captive and free-ranging cervid populations that; similar to scrapie; has beenshown to involve the immune system; which probably contributes to their relatively facilehorizontal and environmental transmission. In this study; we show that mice overexpressingthe cervid prion protein and susceptible to CWD (Tg (cerPrP) 5037 mice) but lack CD21/35expression completely resist clinical CWD upon peripheral infection. CD21/35-deficientTg5037 mice exhibit greatly impaired splenic prion accumulation and replication throughoutdisease; similar to CD21/35-deficient murine prion protein mice infected with mouse …,The Journal of Immunology,2012,22
Complement protein C3 exacerbates prion disease in a mouse model of chronic wasting disease,Brady Michel; Adam Ferguson; Theodore Johnson; Heather Bender; Crystal Meyerett-Reid; A Christy Wyckoff; Bruce Pulford; Glenn C Telling; Mark D Zabel,Abstract Accumulating evidence shows a critical role of the complement system in facilitatingattachment of prions to both B cells and follicular dendritic cells and assisting in prionreplication. Complement activation intensifies disease in prion-infected animals; andelimination of complement components inhibits prion accumulation; replication andpathogenesis. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a highly infectious prion disease of captiveand free-ranging cervid populations that utilizes the complement system for efficientperipheral prion replication and most likely efficient horizontal transmission. Here we showthat complete genetic or transient pharmacological depletion of C3 prolongs incubationtimes and significantly delays splenic accumulation in a CWD transgenic mouse model.Using a semi-quantitative prion amplification scoring system we show that C3 impacts …,International immunology,2013,15
Monitoring immune cells trafficking fluorescent prion rods hours after intraperitoneal infection,Theodore E Johnson; Brady A Michel; Crystal Meyerett; Angela Duffy; Anne Avery; Steven Dow; Mark D Zabel,Abstract Presence of an abnormal form a host-encoded prion protein (PrPC) that is proteaseresistant; pathologic and infectious characterizes prion diseases such as Chronic WastingDisease (CWD) of cervids and scrapie in sheep. The Prion hypothesis asserts that thisabnormal conformer constitutes most or all of the infectious prion. The role of the immunesystem in early events in peripheral prion pathogenesis has been convincinglydemonstrated for CWD and scrapie 1-3. Transgenic and pharmacologic studies in micerevealed an important role of the Complement system in retaining and replicating prionsearly after infection 4-6. In vitro and in vivo studies have also observed prion retention bydendritic cells 7-10; although their role in trafficking remains unclear 11-16. Macrophageshave similarly been implicated in early prion pathogenesis; but these studies have …,Journal of visualized experiments: JoVE,2010,6
