The R+-Tree: A Dynamic Index for Multi-Dimensional Objects.,Timos Sellis; Nick Roussopoulos; Christos Faloutsos,The problem of indexing multidimensional objects is considered. First; a classification ofexisting methods in given along with a discussion of the major issues involved inmultidimensional data indexing. Second; a variation to Guttman's R-trees (R+-trees) thatavoids overlapping rectangles in intermediate nodes of the tree is introduced. Algorithms forsearching; updating; initial packing and reorganization of the structure are discussed indetail. Finally; we provide analytical results indicating that R+-tree achieve up to 50%savings in disk accesses compared to an R-tree when searching files of thousands ofrectangles.,*,1987,2008
Multiple-query optimization,Timos K Sellis,Abstract Some recently proposed extensions to relational database systems; as well as todeductive database systems; require support for multiple-query processing. For example; ina database system enhanced with inference capabilities; a simple query involving a rulewith multiple definitions may expand to more than one actual query that has to be run overthe database. It is an interesting problem then to come up with algorithms that process thesequeries together instead of one query at a time. The main motivation for performing such aninterquery optimization lies in the fact that queries may share common data. We examine theproblem of multiple-query optimization in this paper. The first major contribution of the paperis a systematic look at the problem; along with the presentation and analysis of algorithmsthat can be used for multiple-query optimization. The second contribution lies in the …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1988,876

A survey of logical models for OLAP databases,Panos Vassiliadis; Timos Sellis,Abstract In this paper; we present different proposals for multidimensional data cubes; whichare the basic logical model for OLAP applications. We have grouped the work in the field intwo categories: commercial tools (presented along with terminology and standards) andacademic efforts. We further divide the academic efforts in two subcategories: the relationalmodel extensions and the cube-oriented approaches. Finally; we attempt a comparativeanalysis of the various efforts.,ACM Sigmod Record,1999,423
Spatio-temporal indexing for large multimedia applications,Yannis Theodoridis; Michael Vazirgiannis; Timos Sellis,Multimedia applications usually involve a large number of multimedia objects (texts; images;sounds; etc.). Spatial and temporal relationships among these objects should be efficientlysupported and retrieved within a multimedia authoring tool. In this paper; we present severalspatial; temporal and spatio-temporal relationships of interest; and propose efficientindexing schemes; based on multidimensional (spatial) data structures; for large multimediaapplications that involve thousands of objects. Evaluation models of the proposed schemesare also presented; as well as hints for the selection of the most appropriate one; accordingto the multimedia author's requirements.,Multimedia Computing and Systems; 1996.; Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Conference on,1996,393

A model for the prediction of R-tree performance,Yannis Theodoridis; Timos Sellis,Abstract: In this paper we present an analytical model that predicts the performance of R-trees (and its variants) when a range query needs to be answered. The cost model usesknowledge of the dataset only; ie; the proposed formula that estimates the number of diskaccesses is a hmction of data properties; namely; the amount of data and their density in thework space. In other words; the proposed model is applicable even before the constructionof the R-tree index; a fact that makes it a useful tool for dynamic spatial databases. Severalexperiments on synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed analytical model is veryaccurate; the relative error being usually around 10%-15%; for uniform and non-uniformdistributions. We believe that this error is involved with the gap between efficient R-treevariants; like the R*-tree; and an optimum; not implemented yet; method.

Topological relations in the world of minimum bounding rectangles: A study with R-trees,Dimitris Papadias; Timos Sellis; Yannis Theodoridis; Max J Egenhofer,Abstract Recent developments in spatial relations have led to their use in numerousapplications involving spatial databases. This paper is concerned with the retrieval oftopological relations in Minimum Bounding Rectangle-based data structures. We study thetopological information that Minimum Bounding Rectangles convey about the actual objectsthey enclose; using the concept of projections. Then we apply the results to R-trees and theirvariations; R+-trees and R*-trees in order to minimise disk accesses for queries involvingtopological relations. We also investigate queries that involve complex spatial conditions inthe form of disjunctions and conjunctions and we discuss possible extensions.,ACM Sigmod Record,1995,327
An efficient pictorial database system for PSQL,Nick Roussopoulos; Christos Faloutsos; Timos Sellis,Pictorial databases require efficient and direct spatial search based on the analog form ofspatial objects and relationships instead of search based on some cumbersomealphanumeric encodings of the pictures. A description is given of PSQL; a query languagethat allows pictorial domains to be presented to the user in their analog form and allows himor her to do direct manipulation on the objects found on those domains. Direct spatial searchand computation on the pictures is done using efficient data structures; R-and R/sup+/-trees(multidimensional B-trees); which are excellent devices for searching spatial objects andrelationships found on pictures.,IEEE transactions on software engineering,1988,326
Data warehouse configuration,Dimitri Theodoratos; Timos Sellis,Abstract In the data warehousing approach to the integration of data from multipleinformation sources; selected information is extracted in advance and stored in a repository.A data warehouse DW can therefore be seen as a set of materialized views defined over thesources. When a query is posed; it is evaluated locally; using the materialized views; withoutaccessing the original information sources. The applications using DWs require high queryperformance. This requirement is in conflict with the need to maintain in the DW updatedinformation. The DW configuration problem is the problem of selecting a set of views tomaterialize in the DW that answers all the queries of interest while minimizing the total queryevaluation and view maintenance cost. In this paper we provide a theoretical framework forthis problem in terms of the relational model. We develop a method for dealing with it by …,VLDB,1997,309
Optimizing ETL processes in data warehouses,Alkis Simitsis; Panos Vassiliadis; Timos Sellis,Extraction-transformation-loading (ETL) tools are pieces of software responsible for theextraction of data from several sources; their cleansing; customization and insertion into adata warehouse. Usually; these processes must be completed in a certain time window;thus; it is necessary to optimize their execution time. In this paper; we delve into the logicaloptimization of ETL processes; modeling it as a state-space search problem. We considereach ETL workflow as a state and fabricate the state space through a set of correct statetransitions. Moreover; we provide algorithms towards the minimization of the execution costof an ETL workflow.,Data Engineering; 2005. ICDE 2005. Proceedings. 21st International Conference on,2005,243

The author provides atheoretical justification for the fuzzy identifiers by proving that they are capable of followingthe output of a general nonlinear dynamic system to arbitrary accuracy in any finite timeinterval. The fuzzy identifiers are constructed from a set of adaptable fuzzy IF-THEN rulesand can combine both numerical information (in the form of input-output pairs obtained byexciting the system with an input signal and measuring the corresponding outputs) andlinguistic information (in the form of IF-THEN rules about the behavior of the system in termsof vague and fuzzy words) into their designs in a uniform fashion.

A methodology for clustering XML documents by structure,Theodore Dalamagas; Tao Cheng; Klaas-Jan Winkel; Timos Sellis,Abstract The processing and management of XML data are popular research issues.However; operations based on the structure of XML data have not received strong attention.These operations involve; among others; the grouping of structurally similar XMLdocuments. Such grouping results from the application of clustering methods with distancesthat estimate the similarity between tree structures. This paper presents a framework forclustering XML documents by structure. Modeling the XML documents as rooted orderedlabeled trees; we study the usage of structural distance metrics in hierarchical clusteringalgorithms to detect groups of structurally similar XML documents. We suggest the usage ofstructural summaries for trees to improve the performance of the distance calculation and atthe same time to maintain or even improve its quality. Our approach is tested using a …,Information Systems,2006,219
Analysis of object oriented spatial access methods,Christos Faloutsos; Timos Sellis; Nick Roussopoulos,Abstract This paper provides an analysis of R-trees and a variation (R+-trees) that avoidsoverlapping rectangles in intermediate nodes of the tree. The main contributions of thepaper are the following. We provide the first known analysis of R-trees. Although formulasare given for objects in one dimension (line segments); they can be generalized for objectsin higher dimensions as well. We show how the transformation of objects to higherdimensions [HINR83] can be effectively used as a tool for the analysis of R-and R+-trees.Finally; we derive formulas for R+-trees and compare the two methods analytically. Theresults we obtained show that R+-trees require less than half the disk accesses required bya corresponding R-tree when searching files of real life sizes R+-trees are clearly superior incases where there are few long segments and a lot of small ones.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1987,214
Qualitative representation of spatial knowledge in two-dimensional space,Dimitris Papadias; Timos Sellis,Abstract Various relation-based systems; concerned with the qualitative representation andprocessing of spatial knowledge; have been developed in numerous application domains. Inthis article; we identify the common concepts underlying qualitative spatial knowledgerepresentation; we compare the representational properties of the different systems; and weoutline the computational tasks involved in relation-based spatial information processing.We also describe symbolic spatial indexes; relation-based structures that combine severalideas in spatial knowledge representation. A symbolic spatial index is an array thatpreserves only a set of spatial relations among distinct objects in an image; called themodeling space; the index array discards information; such as shape and size of objects;and irrelevant spatial relations.

Specifications for efficient indexing in spatiotemporal databases,Yannis Theodoridis; Timos Sellis; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,A new issue that arises in modern applications involves the efficient manipulation of (staticor moving) spatial objects; and the relationships among them. As a result; modern databasesystems should be able to efficiently support that type of data. Towards this goal; appropriateextensions of multidimensional access methods can be exploited in order to index andretrieve spatiotemporal objects; satisfying users' demands.

Spatio-temporal composition and indexing for large multimedia applications,Michael Vazirgiannis; Yannis Theodoridis; Timos Sellis,Abstract. Multimedia applications usually involve a large number of multimedia objects(texts; images; sounds; etc.). An important issue in this context is the specification of spatialand temporal relationships among these objects. In this paper we define such a model;based on a set of spatial and temporal relationships between objects participating inmultimedia applications. Our work exploits existing approaches for spatial and temporalrelationships. We extend these relationships in order to cover the specific requirements ofmultimedia applications and we integrate the results in a uniform framework for spatio-temporal composition representation. Another issue is the efficient handling of queriesrelated to the spatio-temporal relationships among the objects during the authoring process.Such queries may be very costly and appropriate indexing schemes are needed so as to …,Multimedia systems,1998,171

Efficient cost models for spatial queries using R-trees,Yannis Theodoridis; Emmanuel Stefanakis; Timos Sellis,Selection and join queries are fundamental operations in database management systems(DBMS). Support for nontraditional data; including spatial objects; in an efficient manner is ofongoing interest in database research. Toward this goal; access methods and cost modelsfor spatial queries are necessary tools for spatial query processing and optimization. Wepresent analytical models that estimate the cost (in terms of node and disk accesses) ofselection and join queries using R-tree-based structures. The proposed formulae need noknowledge of the underlying R-tree structure (s) and are applicable to uniform-like andnonuniform data distributions. In addition; experimental results are presented which showthe accuracy of the analytical estimations when compared to actual runs on both syntheticand real data sets.,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2000,168
An organizational framework for cooperating intelligent information systems,Mike P Papazoglou; Steven C Laufmann; Timos K Sellis,There is a growing belief that the next generation of information processing systems will bebased on the paradigm of Intelligent and Cooperative Information Systems (ICISs). Suchsystems will involve information agents—distributed over the nodes of a commoncommunication network—which work in a synergistic manner by exchanging informationand expertise; coordinating their activities and negotiating how to solve parts of a commoninformation-intensive problem. Along with motivating the importance of such systems thepaper gives an overview of related research areas; notably Distributed Artificial Intelligence(DAI) and Distributed Databases (DDBs); and presents a generic architecture which viewsan ICIS as a community of communicating and cooperating intelligent information agents.,International Journal of Intelligent and Cooperative information systems,1992,156

ARKTOS: towards the modeling; design; control and execution of ETL processes,Panos Vassiliadis; Zografoula Vagena; Spiros Skiadopoulos; Nikos Karayannidis; Timos Sellis,Abstract Extraction-Transformation-loading (ETL) tools are pieces of software responsible forthe extraction of data from several sources; their cleansing; customization and insertion intoa data warehouse. Literature and personal experience have guided us to conclude that theproblems concerning the ETL tools are primarily problems of complexity; usability and price.To deal with these problems we provide a uniform metamodel for ETL processes; coveringthe aspects of data warehouse architecture; activity modeling; contingency treatment andquality management.

Ranking and clustering web services using multicriteria dominance relationships,Dimitrios Skoutas; Dimitris Sacharidis; Alkis Simitsis; Timos Sellis,As the web is increasingly used not only to find answers to specific information needs butalso to carry out various tasks; enhancing the capabilities of current web search engineswith effective and efficient techniques for web service retrieval and selection becomes animportant issue. Existing service matchmakers typically determine the relevance between aweb service advertisement and a service request by computing an overall score thataggregates individual matching scores among the various parameters in their descriptions.Two main drawbacks characterize such approaches. First; there is no single matchingcriterion that is optimal for determining the similarity between parameters. Instead; there arenumerous approaches ranging from Information Retrieval similarity measures up tosemantic logic-based inference rules. Second; the reduction of individual scores to an …,IEEE Transactions on Services Computing,2010,138
Sampling trajectory streams with spatiotemporal criteria,Michalis Potamias; Kostas Patroumpas; Timos Sellis,Monitoring movement of high-dimensional points is essential for environmental databases;geospatial applications; and biodiversity informatics as it reveals crucial information aboutdata evolution; provenance detection; pattern matching etc. Despite recent research intereston processing continuous queries in the context of spatiotemporal data streams; the mainfocus is on managing the current location of numerous moving objects. In this paper; we turnour attention onto a historical perspective of movement and examine trajectories generatedby streaming positional updates. The key challenge is how to maintain a concise; yet quitereliable summary of each object's movement; avoiding any superfluous details and saving inprocessing complexity and communication cost.

Designing data warehouses,Dimitri Theodoratos; Timos Sellis,Abstract A Data Warehouse (DW) is a database that collects and stores data from multipleremote and heterogeneous information sources. When a query is posed; it is evaluatedlocally; without accessing the original information sources. In this paper we deal with theissue of designing a DW; in the context of the relational model; by selecting a set of views tomaterialize in the DW. First; we briefly present a theoretical framework for the DW designproblem; which concerns the selection of a set of views that (a) fit in the space allocated tothe DW;(b) answer all the queries of interest; and (c) minimize the total query evaluation andview maintenance cost. We then formalize the DW design problem as a state space searchproblem by taking into account multiquery optimization over the maintenance queries (ie;queries that compute changes to the materialized views) and the use of auxiliary views for …,Data & knowledge engineering,1999,135
Parametric query optimization,Yannis E Ioannidis; Raymond T Ng; Kyuseok Shim; Timos K Sellis,Abstract In most database systems; the values of many important run-time parameters of thesystem; the data; or the query are unknown at query optimization time. Parametric queryoptimization attempts to identify several execution plans; each one of which is optimal for asubset of all possible values of the run-time parameters. We present a general formulation ofthis problem and study it primarily for the bu er size parameter. We adopt randomizedalgorithms as the main approach to this style of optimization and enhance them with asideways information passing feature that increases their e ectiveness in the new task.Experimental results of these enhanced algorithms show that they optimize queries for largenumbers of bu er sizes in the same time needed by their conventional versions for a singlebu er size; without much sacri ce in the output quality.,VLDB,1992,134
MAC: Conceptual data modeling for OLAP.,Aris Tsois; Nikos Karayannidis; Timos K Sellis,Abstract In this paper we address the issue of conceptual modeling of data used inmultidimensional analysis. We view the problem from the end-user point of view and wedescribe a set of requirements for the conceptual modeling of realworld OLAP scenarios.Based on those requirements we then define a new conceptual model that intends tocapture the static properties of the involved information. In its definition we use a minimal setof well-understood OLAP concepts like dimensions; levels; hierarchies; measures andcubes. The central concept of the model is the Multidimensional Aggregation Cube (MAC);which gives a broad and flexible definition to the notion of a multidimensional cube. Weevaluate our model against other existing multidimensional models and show that MACoffers a unique combination of modeling skills. Our main contribution is the definition of …,DMDW,2001,133

Global query optimization,Timos K Sellis,Abstract In some recently proposed extensions to relational database systems as well as indeductive databases; a database system is presented with a collection of queries to processinstead of just one. It is an interesting problem then; to come up with algorithms that processthese queries together instead of one query at a time. We examine the problem of multiple(global) query optimization in this paper. A hierarchy of algorithms that can be used forglobal query optimization is exhibited and analyzed. These algorithms range from anarbitrary serial execution without any sharing of common results among the queries to anexhaustive search of all possible ways to process all queries.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1986,91
Query languages for relational multidatabases,John Grant; Witold Litwin; Nick Roussopoulos; Timos Sellis,Abstract With the existence of many autonomous databases widely accessible throughcomputer networks; users will require the capability to jointly manipulate data in differentdatabases. A multidatabase system provides such a capability through a multidatabasemanipulation language; such as MSQL. We propose a theoretical foundation for suchlanguages by presenting a multirelational algebra and calculus based on the relationalalgebra and calculus. The proposal is illustrated by various queries on an examplemultidatabase. It is shown that properties of the multirelational algebra may be used foroptimization and that every multirelational algebra query can be expressed as amultirelational calculus query. The connection between the multirelational languages andMSQL; the multidatabase version of SQL; is also investigated.,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,1993,86
Intelligent caching and indexing techniques for relational database systems,Timos K Sellis,Abstract Recent developments in the design of database systems include proposals forseveral extensions to the basic model of relational database systems. In this paper wepresent some ideas on the design of intelligent support mechanisms for large databaseswhere procedures in the form of database commands are stored in relation fields. First; weexamine the idea of storing results of previously processed procedures in secondary storage(caching). Problems associated with cache organizations; such as replacement policies andvalidation schemes; are examined in depth. Another means for reducing the execution costof queries is indexing. Conventional indexing techniques assume that all values are known;such schemes cannot be used effectively. As a solution to that problem; a new indexingscheme; Partial Indexing; is proposed and analyzed. Uses of partial indexes in …,Information Systems,1988,84
Cost models for join queries in spatial databases,Yannis Theodoridis; Emmanuel Stefanakis; Timos Sellis,The join query is one of the fundamental operations in database management systems(DBMSs). Modern DBMSs should be able to support non traditional data; including spatialobjects; in an efficient manner. Towards this goal; spatial data structures can be adopted inorder to support the execution of join queries on sets of multidimensional data. The paperintroduces analytical models that estimate the cost (in terms of node or disk accesses) of joinqueries involving two multidimensional indexed data sets using R tree based structures. Inaddition; experimental results are presented; which show the accuracy of the analyticalestimations when compared to actual runs on both synthetic and real data sets. It turns outthat the relative error rarely exceeds 15% for all combinations; a fact that makes theproposed cost models useful tools for efficient spatial query optimization.,Data Engineering; 1998.

A pictorial query-by-example language,Dimitris Papadias; Timos Sellis,Abstract A symbolic image is an array representing a set of objects and a set of spatialrelations among them. Symbolic images and related structures have been used in a numberof applications including image databases; spatial reasoning; path planning and spatialpattern matching. In this paper we describe a pictorial query-by-example (PQBE) languageaimed at the retrieval of direction relations from symbolic images. As in the case of verbalquery-by-example; PQBE generalizes from the example given by the user; but; instead ofhaving queries in the form of skeleton tables showing the relation scheme; we have skeletonimages which are themselves symbolic images. PQBE provides an intuitive interface for usein geographic applications because of its close correspondence with the structure of space.,Journal of Visual Languages & Computing,1995,82
Window specification over data streams,Kostas Patroumpas; Timos Sellis,Abstract Several query languages have been proposed for managing data streams inmodern monitoring applications. Continuous queries expressed in these languages usuallyemploy windowing constructs in order to extract finite portions of the potentially unboundedstream. Explicitly or not; window specifications rely on ordering. Usually; timestamps areattached to all tuples flowing into the system as a means to provide ordered access to dataitems. Several window types have been implemented in stream prototype systems; but aprecise definition of their semantics is still lacking. In this paper; we describe a formalframework for expressing windows in continuous queries over data streams. After classifyingwindows according to their basic characteristics; we give algebraic expressions for the mostsignificant window types commonly appearing in applications.

The retrieval of direction relations using R-trees,Dimitris Papadias; Yannis Theodoridis; Timos Sellis,Abstract R-trees and related structures; like R+-trees and R*-trees; have been used toanswer queries involving topological information about objects represented by theirminimum bounding rectangles (MBRs). This paper describes how the R-tree method can beused for the storage and retrieval of direction relations. Direction relations deal with order inspace; as for instance; left; above; north; southeast etc. In this paper we define directionrelations between points and extend the definitions to relations between objects. Then wepresent our tests regarding the retrieval of direction relations between objects using R-treesand discuss the representational properties of MBR approximations with respect todirections in 2D space.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,1994,78

View selection for designing the global data warehouse,Dimitri Theodoratos; Spyros Ligoudistianos; Timos Sellis,Abstract A global data warehouse (DW) integrates data from multiple distributedheterogeneous databases and other information sources. A global DW can be abstractlyseen as a set of materialized views. The selection of views for materialization in a DW is animportant decision in the design of a DW. Current commercial products do not provide toolsfor automatic DW design. We provide a general method that; given a set of select-project-join queries to be satisfied by the DW; generates sets of materialized views that satisfy all theinput queries. This process is complex sincecommon subexpressions' between the queriesneed to be detected and exploited.

Flexible and adaptable buffer management techniques for database management systems,Christos Faloutsos; Raymond Ng; Timos Sellis,The problem of buffer management in database management systems is concerned with theefficient main memory allocation and management for answering database queries.Previous works on buffer allocation are based either exclusively on the availability of buffersat runtime or on the access patterns of queries. In this paper; we first propose a unifiedapproach for buffer allocation in which both of these considerations are taken into account.Our approach is based on the notion of marginal gains which specify the expected reductionin page faults by allocating extra buffers to a query. Then; we extend this approach tosupport adaptable buffer allocation. An adaptable buffer allocation algorithm automaticallyoptimizes itself for the specific query workload. To achieve this adaptability; we proposeusing runtime information; such as the load of the system; in buffer allocation decisions …,IEEE Transactions on Computers,1995,71
Top-k dominant web services under multi-criteria matching,Dimitrios Skoutas; Dimitris Sacharidis; Alkis Simitsis; Verena Kantere; Timos Sellis,Abstract As we move from a Web of data to a Web of services; enhancing the capabilities ofthe current Web search engines with effective and efficient techniques for Web servicesretrieval and selection becomes an important issue. Traditionally; the relevance of a Webservice advertisement to a service request is determined by computing an overall score thataggregates individual matching scores among the various parameters in their descriptions.Two drawbacks characterize such approaches. First; there is no single matching criterionthat is optimal for determining the similarity between parameters. Instead; there arenumerous approaches ranging from using Information Retrieval similarity metrics up tosemantic logic-based inference rules. Second; the reduction of individual scores to anoverall similarity leads to significant information loss. Since there is no consensus on how …,Proceedings of the 12th international conference on extending database technology: advances in database technology,2009,67
On-line discovery of hot motion paths,Dimitris Sacharidis; Kostas Patroumpas; Manolis Terrovitis; Verena Kantere; Michalis Potamias; Kyriakos Mouratidis; Timos Sellis,Abstract We consider an environment of numerous moving objects; equipped with location-sensing devices and capable of communicating with a central coordinator. In this setting; weinvestigate the problem of maintaining hot motion paths; ie; routes frequently followed bymultiple objects over the recent past. Motion paths approximate portions of objects'movement within a tolerance margin that depends on the uncertainty inherent in positionalmeasurements. Discovery of hot motion paths is important to applications requiringclassification/profiling based on monitored movement patterns; such as targeted advertising;resource allocation; etc. To achieve this goal; we delegate part of the path extraction processto objects; by assigning to them adaptive lightweight filters that dynamically suppressunnecessary location updates and; thus; help reducing the communication overhead.

Parametric query optimization,Yannis E Ioannidis; Raymond T Ng; Kyuseok Shim; Timos K Sellis,Abstract. In most database systems; the values of many important run-time parameters of thesystem; the data; or the query are unknown at query optimization time. Parametric queryoptimization attempts to identify at compile time several execution plans; each one of whichis optimal for a subset of all possible values of the run-time parameters. The goal is that atrun time; when the actual parameter values are known; the appropriate plan should beidentifiable with essentially no overhead. We present a general formulation of this problemand study it primarily for the buffer size parameter. We adopt randomized algorithms as themain approach to this style of optimization and enhance them with a sideways informationpassing feature that increases their effectiveness in the new task. Experimental results ofthese enhanced algorithms show that they optimize queries for large numbers of buffer …,The VLDB Journal,1997,61

A ranking mechanism for semanticweb service discovery,Dimitrios Skoutas; Alkis Simitsis; Timos Sellis,This paper presents an approach for ranking semantic Web service advertisements withrespect to a service request. The use of recall and precision is proposed as suitablemeasures for determining the degree of match between the request and the advertisement.Ranking is based on the use of the domain ontology to infer the semantic similarity betweenthe parameters of the request and the advertisement. The proposed approach is applicableto several types of ontologies; ranging from simple taxonomies to highly expressiveontologies; such as OWL ontologies.,Services; 2007 IEEE Congress on,2007,57
Processing star queries on hierarchically-clustered fact tables,Nikos Karayannidis; Aris Tsois; Timos Sellis; Roland Pieringer; Volker Markl; Frank Ramsak; Robert Fenk; Klaus Elhardt; Rudolf Bayer,This chapter presents a complete abstract processing plan that captures all the necessarysteps in evaluating such queries over hierarchically clustered fact tables. Data warehousing(DW) has evolved into a major trend in database technology through the last decade.Furthermore; the multidimensional paradigm seems to be the undisputed winner as a designchoice for such databases. Regardless of the underlying physical layer; relationaltechnology or proprietary multidimensional structures; the conceptual model adopted is adata warehouse consisting of facts (or measures) organized into a set of dimensions; whichin turn are organized into levels of different aggregation (that is; detail) that comprise one ormore hierarchies. In particular; for relational databases; the multidimensional datawarehouse consists of one or more star schemata. Star queries are the most prevalent …,*,2002,57

Designing the global data warehouse with SPJ views,Dimitri Theodoratos; Spyros Ligoudistianos; Timos Sellis,Abstract A global Data warehouse (DW) integrates data from multiple distributedheterogeneous databases and other information sources. A global DW can be abstractlyseen as a set of materialized views. The selection of views for materialization in a DW is animportant decision in the implementation of a DW.

Efficient semantic web service discovery in centralized and P2P environments,Dimitrios Skoutas; Dimitris Sacharidis; Verena Kantere; Timos Sellis,Abstract Efficient and scalable discovery mechanisms are critical for enabling service-oriented architectures on the Semantic Web. The majority of currently existing approachesfocuses on centralized architectures; and deals with efficiency typically by pre-computingand storing the results of the semantic matcher for all possible query concepts. Suchapproaches; however; fail to scale with respect to the number of service advertisements andthe size of the ontologies involved. On the other hand; this paper presents an efficient andscalable index-based method for Semantic Web service discovery that allows for fastselection of services at query time and is suitable for both centralized and P2Penvironments. We employ a novel encoding of the service descriptions; allowing the matchbetween a request and an advertisement to be evaluated in constant time; and we index …,International Semantic Web Conference,2008,51
ARKTOS: A tool for data cleaning and transformation in data warehouse environments,Panos Vassiliadis; Zografoula Vagena; Spiros Skiadopoulos; Nikos Karayannidis; Timos Sellis,Abstract Extraction-Transformation-Loading (ETL) and Data Cleaning tools are pieces ofsoftware responsible for the extraction of data from several sources; their cleaning;customization and insertion into a data warehouse. To deal with the complexity andefficiency of the transformation and cleaning tasks we have developed a tool; namelyARKTOS; capable of modeling and executing practical scenarios; by providing explicitprimitives for the capturing of common tasks. ARKTOS provides three ways to describe sucha scenario; including a graphical point-and-click front end and two declarative languages:XADL (an XML variant); which is more verbose and easy to read and SADL (an SQL-likelanguage) which has a quite compact syntax and is; thus; easier for authoring.,IEEE Data Eng.

Conflict resolution of rules assigning values to virtual attributes,Yannis E Ioannidis; Timos K Sellis,Abstract In the majority of research work done on logic programming and deductivedatabases; it is assumed that the set of rules defined by the user is consistent; ie; that nocontradictory facts can be inferred by the rules. In this paper; we address the problem ofresolving conflicts of rules that assign values to virtual attributes. We devise a generalframework for the study of the problem; and we propose an approach that subsumes allpreviously suggested solutions. Moreover; it suggests several additional solutions; whichvery often capture the semantics of the data more accurately than the known approaches.Finally; we address the issue of how to index rules so that conflicts are resolved efficiently;ie; only one of the applicable rules is processed at query time.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1989,50
Dynamic data warehouse design,Dimitri Theodoratos; Timos Sellis,Abstract A data warehouse (DW) can be seen as a set of materialized views defined overremote base relations. When a query is posed; it is evaluated locally; using the materializedviews; without accessing the original information sources. The DWs are dynamic entities thatevolve continuously over time. As time passes; new queries need to be answered by them.Some of these queries can be answered using exclusively the materialized views. In generalthough new views need to be added to the DW. In this paper we investigate the problem ofincrementally designing a DW when new queries need to be answered and extra space isallocated for view materialization. Based on an AND/OR dag representation of multiplequeries; we model the problem as a state space search problem. We design incrementalalgorithms for selecting a set of new views to additionally materialize in the DW that fits in …,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,1999,48
GrouPeer: Dynamic clustering of P2P databases,Verena Kantere; Dimitrios Tsoumakos; Timos Sellis; Nick Roussopoulos,Abstract Sharing structured data in a P2P network is a challenging problem; especially in theabsence of a mediated schema. The standard practice of answering a consecutivelyrewritten query along the propagation path often results in significant loss of information. Onthe opposite; the use of mediated schemas requires human interaction and globalagreement; both during creation and maintenance. In this paper we present GrouPeer; anadaptive; automated approach to both issues in the context of unstructured P2P databaseoverlays. By allowing peers to individually choose which rewritten version of a query toanswer and evaluate the received answers; information-rich sources left hidden otherwiseare discovered. Gradually; the overlay is restructured as semantically similar peers areclustered together. Experimental results show that our technique produces very accurate …,Information Systems,2009,47
Integrating keywords and semantics on document annotation and search,Nikos Bikakis; Giorgos Giannopoulos; Theodore Dalamagas; Timos Sellis,Abstract This paper describes GoNTogle; a framework for document annotation andretrieval; built on top of Semantic Web and IR technologies. GoNTogle supports ontology-based annotation for documents of several formats; in a fully collaborative environment. Itprovides both manual and automatic annotation mechanisms. Automatic annotation isbased on a learning method that exploits user annotation history and textual information toautomatically suggest annotations for new documents. GoNTogle also provides searchfacilities beyond the traditional keyword-based search. A flexible combination of keyword-based and semantic-based search over documents is proposed in conjunction withadvanced ontology-based search operations. The proposed methods are implemented in afully functional tool and their effectiveness is experimentally validated.,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2010,46

Incorporating fuzzy set methodologies in a DBMS repository for the application domain of GIS,Emmanuel Stefanakis; Michael Vazirgiannis; Timos Sellis,It has been recently recognized that fuzzy set theory provides useful concepts and tools forboth the representation and analysis of the uncertainty related to geographical data. Hencethe incorporation of fuzzy set methodologies into a DBMS repository for the applicationdomain of GIS should be beneficial and will improve its level of intelligence. Focusing in thisarea the paper addresses both a representation and a reasoning issue. Specifically; itextends a general spatial data model to deal with the uncertainty of geographical entities;and shows how the standard data interpretation operations available in GIS packages maybe extended to support the fuzzy spatial reasoning. Representative geographicaloperations; suchas the fuzzy overlay; fuzzy distance and fuzzy select; are examined; whileseveral real world examples are given.,International Journal of Geographical Information Science,1999,46
Exploiting concurrency in a DBMS implementation for production systems,Louiqa Raschid; Timos Sellis; Chih-Chen Lin,Abstract An important aspect of integration of AI and DBMS technology is identifyingfunctional similarities in database processing and reasoning with rules. In this paper; wefocus on applying concurrency techniques to rule-based production systems. We tailorDBMS concurrent execution to a production system environment and investigate theresulting concurrent execution strategies for productions. This research is in conjunction witha novel DBMS mechanism for testing if the left hand side conditions of productions aresatisfied. This set-oriented mechanism uses a special data structure implemented usingrelational tables. To demonstrate the equivalence of a serial and a concurrent (interleaved)execution strategy; for a set of productions; we assume a locking scheme to enforceserializability and specify what locks must be obtained. We define a logical commit point …,Proceedings of the first international symposium on Databases in parallel and distributed systems,2000,44
Coupling production systems and database systems: A homogeneous approach,Timos Sellis; C-C Lin; Louiqa Raschid,Methods for storing and manipulating large rule bases using a relational databasemanagement systems (DBMS) are discussed. An approach to decomposing and storing thecondition elements in the antecedents of rules such as those used in production rule-basedsystems is presented. A set-oriented approach; DBCond; which uses a special data structurethat is implemented using relations is proposed. A matching algorithm for DBCond uses therelational structures to efficiently identify rules whose antecedents are satisfied. Theperformance of DBCond is compared with that of DBRete; a DBMS implementation of theRete match algorithm developed for use with the production rule language OPS5. DBCondis also compared with DBQuery; a method that is based on evaluating queriescorresponding to the conditions in the antecedents of the rules.

Storing and indexing spatial data in p2p systems,Verena Kantere; Spiros Skiadopoulos; Timos Sellis,The peer-to-peer (P2P) paradigm has become very popular for storing and sharinginformation in a totally decentralized manner. At first; research focused on P2P systems thathost 1D data. Nowadays; the need for P2P applications with multidimensional data hasemerged; motivating research on P2P systems that manage such data. The majority of theproposed techniques are based either on the distribution of centralized indexes or on thereduction of multidimensional data to one dimension.

Managing Trajectories of Moving Objects as Data Streams.,Kostas Patroumpas; Timos K Sellis,Abstract The advent of modern monitoring applications; such as location-based services;presents several new challenges when dealing with continuously evolving spatiotemporalinformation. Frequent updates in the positions of moving objects; unexpected fluctuations indata volume and the requirement for real-time responses to continuous spatiotemporalqueries indicate the limitations of traditional database systems. We attempt to modelmanagement of moving objects with the underlying assumption that their trajectories areessentially continuous; timevarying and possibly unbounded data streams. We propose abasic framework for managing trajectory streams; and suggest the introduction of enhancedconstructs for advanced query capabilities.

A combination of trie-trees and inverted files for the indexing of set-valued attributes,Manolis Terrovitis; Spyros Passas; Panos Vassiliadis; Timos Sellis,Abstract Set-valued attributes frequently occur in contexts like market-basked analysis andstock market trends. Late research literature has mainly focused on set containment joinsand data mining without considering simple queries on set valued attributes. In this paperwe address superset; subset and equality queries and we propose a novel indexing schemefor answering them on set-valued attributes. The proposed index superimposes a trie-treeon top of an inverted file that indexes a relation with set-valued data. We show that we canefficiently answer the aforementioned queries by indexing only a subset of the most frequentof the items that occur in the indexed relation. Finally; we show through extensiveexperiments that our approach outperforms the state of the art mechanisms and scalesgracefully as database size grows.,Proceedings of the 15th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2006,40
Spatio-temporal composition in multimedia applications,Michalis Vazirgiannis; Yannis Theodoridis; Timos Sellis,The motivation for this research work is the lack of a complete declarative method forrepresentative spatio-temporal composition of objects in the current multimedia documentstandards and authoring tools. We define such a model which is based on a set of spatialand temporal relationships between actors in multimedia applications. Our work exploitsexisting approaches for spatial and temporal relationships. We extend these relationships inorder to cover the specific requirements of multimedia applications and we integrate theresults in a uniform framework for spatio-temporal composition representation.,Multimedia Software Development; 1996.

The semantics of relations in 2D space using representative points: Spatial indexes,Dimitris Papadias; Timos Sellis,Abstract The paper describes spatial indexes; a 2D array structure which can be used for therepresentation of spatial information. A spatial index preserves only a set of spatial relationsof interest; called the modelling space; and discards visual information (such as shape; sizeetc.) and information about irrelevant spatial relations. Every relation in the modelling spacecan be defined using a set of special points; called the representative points. By filling theindex array cells with representative points we can gain adequate expressive power toanswer queries regarding the spatial relations of the modelling space without the need toaccess the initial image or an object database.,European Conference on Spatial Information Theory,1993,40

When a query is posed; it is evaluatedlocally; without accessing the original information sources. In this paper we deal with theissue of designing a DW; in the context of the relational model; by selecting a set of views tomaterialize in it. Views allow to compute both the schema and the instance of the DW fromthe schemas and the instances of the source relations. We briefly present a theoreticalframework for the DW design problem; which concerns the selection of a set of views that (a)fits in the space allocated to the DW;(b) answers all the queries of interest; and (c) minimizesthe total query evaluation and view maintenance cost.

These include the use of special datastructures to store rule definitions; they are implemented using relations. A matchingalgorithm uses these structures to efficiently identify when the antecedents of productionsare satisfied; making them applicable for execution. Partial match information stored in thedata structures is used by the matching algorithm. We also describe a proposed concurrentexecution strategy for applicable productions; which surpasses in performance; thetraditional sequential OPS5 production execution algorithm. The requirements for a correct;serializable execution; based on locking; is described. An advantage of the matchingtechnique in DIPS is that it is fully parallelizable; which makes it attractive for …,ACM Sigmod Record,1989,37
Direction relations and two-dimensional range queries: optimisation techniques,Yannis Theodoridis; Dimitris Papadias; Emmanuel Stefanakis; Timos Sellis,Abstract This paper defines direction relations (eg; north; northeast) between two-dimensional objects and shows how they can be efficiently retrieved using B-; KDB-and R-tree-based data structures. Essentially; our work studies optimisation techniques for 2Drange queries that arise during the processing of direction relations. We test the efficiency ofalternative indexing methods through extensive experimentation and present analyticalmodels that estimate their performance. The analytical estimates are shown to be very closeto the actual results and can be used by spatial query optimizers in order to predict theretrieval cost. In addition; we implement modifications of the existing structures that yieldbetter performance for certain queries. We conclude the paper by discussing the mostsuitable method depending on the type of the range and the properties of the data.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,1998,36
Advances in Object-Oriented Database Systems,Asuman Dogac; M Tamer Özsu; Alexandros Biliris; Timos Sellis,Object-oriented database management systems (OODBMSs) have generated significantexcitement in the database community in the last decade. This interest stems from a realneed for data management support for what are called" advanced application areas" that arenot well-served by relational technology. The case for object-oriented technology has beenmade on three fronts. First is the data modeling requirements of the new applications. Someof the more important shortcomings of the relational systems in meeting the requirements ofthese applications include: 1. Relational systems deal with a single object type: a relation. Arelation is used to model different real-world objects; but the semantics of this association isnot part of the database. Furthermore; the attributes of a relation may come only from simpleand fixed data type domains (numeric; character; and; sometimes; date types). Advanced …,*,2013,35
A family of directional relation models for extended objects,Spiros Skiadopoulos; Nikos Sarkas; Timos Sellis; Manolis Koubarakis,In this paper; we introduce a family of expressive models for qualitative spatial reasoningwith directions. The proposed family is based on the cognitive plausible cone-based model.We formally define the directional relations that can be expressed in each model of thefamily. Then; we use our formal framework to study two interesting problems: computing theinverse of a directional relation and composing two directional relations. For the compositionoperator; in particular; we concentrate on two commonly used definitions; namely;consistency-based and existential composition. Our formal framework allows us to prove thatour solutions are correct. The presented solutions are handled in a uniform manner andapply to all of the models of the family.,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2007,35
Ontology-driven conceptual design of ETL processes using graph transformations,Dimitrios Skoutas; Alkis Simitsis; Timos Sellis,Abstract One of the main tasks during the early steps of a data warehouse project is theidentification of the appropriate transformations and the specification of inter-schemamappings from the source to the target data stores. This is a challenging task; requiring firstlythe semantic and secondly the structural reconciliation of the information provided by theavailable sources. This task is a part of the Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process; which isresponsible for the population of the data warehouse. In this paper; we propose acustomizable and extensible ontology-driven approach for the conceptual design of ETLprocesses. A graph-based representation is used as a conceptual model for the source andtarget data stores. We then present a method for devising flows of ETL operations by meansof graph transformations. In particular; the operations comprising the ETL process are …,*,2009,34

Serving the sky: Discovering and selecting semantic web services through dynamic skyline queries,Dimitrios Skoutas; Dimitris Sacharidis; Alkis Simitsis; Timos Sellis,Semantic Web service descriptions are typically multi-parameter constructs. Discoveringsemantically relevant services given a desirable service description is typically addressedby performing a pairwise; logic-based match between the requested and offeredparameters. However; little or no attention is given to combining these partial results tocompile the final list of candidate services. Instead; this is often done in an ad hoc manner;implying a priori assumptions regarding the user's preferences. In this paper; we focus onidentifying the best candidate Semantic Web services given the description of a requestedservice. We model the problem as a skyline query; also known as the maximum vectorproblem; and we show how the service selection process can be performed efficiently.

Optimization issues in R-tree construction,Yannis Theodoridis; Timos Sellis,Abstract The construction of an efficient tree structure should take into account parametersthat can be optimized. Coverage of a node; deadarea of a node and overlap between nodesare examples of such parameters. Existing access methods do not combine all theseparameters. In this paper we study the effects of the above criteria on the performance of theR-tree structure and we propose a combination of all of them into a complex one that wouldbe responsible for the tree construction.,*,1994,31
Using differential technlques to efficiently support transaction time,Christian S Jensen; Leo Mark; Nick Roussopoulos; Timos Sells,Abstract We present an architecture for query processing in the relational model extendedwith transaction time. The architecture integrates standard query optimization andcomputation techniques with new differential computation techniques. Differentialcomputation computes a query incrementally or decrementally from the cahced and indexedresults of previous computations. The use of differential computation techniques is essentialin order to provide efficient processing of queries that access very large temporal relations.Alternative query plans are integrated into a state transition network; where the state spaceincludes backlogs of base relations; cached results from previous computations; a cacheindex; and intermediate results; the transitions include standard relational algebra operators;operators for constructing differential files; operators for differential computation; and …,The VLDB Journal,1993,31
Twitter analytics: a big data management perspective,Oshini Goonetilleke; Timos Sellis; Xiuzhen Zhang; Saket Sathe,Abstract With the inception of the Twitter microblogging platform in 2006; a myriad ofresearch efforts have emerged studying different aspects of the Twittersphere. Each studyexploits its own tools and mechanisms to capture; store; query and analyze Twitter data.Inevitably; platforms have been developed to replace this ad-hoc exploration with a morestructured and methodological form of analysis. Another body of literature focuses ondeveloping languages for querying Tweets. This paper addresses issues around the bigdata nature of Twitter and emphasizes the need for new data management and querylanguage frameworks that address limitations of existing systems. We review existingapproaches that were developed to facilitate twitter analytics followed by a discussion onresearch issues and technical challenges in developing integrated solutions.,ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter,2014,30

Efficiently supporting procedures in relational database systems,Timos K Sellis,Abstract We examine an extended relational database system which supports databaseprocedures as full fledged objects. In particular; we focus on the problems of queryprocessing and efficient support for database procedures. First; a variation to the originalINGRES decomposition algorithm is presented. Then; we examine the idea of storing resultsof previously processed procedures in secondary storage (caching). Using a cache; the costof processing a query can be reduced by preventing multiple evaluations of the sameprocedure. Problems associated with cache organizations; such as replacement policiesand validation schemes are examined. Another means for reducing the execution cost ofqueries is indexing. A new indexing scheme for cached results; Partial Indexing; is proposedand analyzed.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1987,29
Caching dynamic skyline queries,Dimitris Sacharidis; Panagiotis Bouros; Timos Sellis,Abstract Given a query tuple q; the dynamic skyline query retrieves the tuples that are notdynamically dominated by any other in the data set with respect to q. A tuple dynamicallydominates another; wrt q; if it has closer to q's values in all attributes; and has strictly closerto q's value in at least one. The dynamic skyline query can be treated as a standard skylinequery; subject to the transformation of all tuples' values. In this work; we make theobservation that results to past dynamic skyline queries can help reduce the computationcost for future queries. To this end; we propose a caching mechanism for dynamic skylinequeries and devise a cache-aware algorithm. Our extensive experimental evaluationdemonstrates the efficiency of this mechanism compared to standard techniques withoutcaching.,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2008,28
Spatial reasoning using symbolic arrays,Dimitris Papadias; Timos Sellis,Abstract Research in Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science has suggested thedistinction between visual knowledge (such as shape; volume and colour of objects) andspatial knowledge (that is; spatial relationships among the different objects of a visualscene). We find this distinction applicable to Information Systems concerned with spatialreasoning and especially to Geographic Information Systems. In particular; this paper dealswith the representation of spatial information in GIS. The paper presents a representationalformalism which captures the knowledge embedded in spatial relationships and providesthe ability to represent; retrieve and reason about spatial information not explicitly stored inmemory.,*,1992,28
Checking the temporal integrity of interactive multimedia documents,Isabelle Mirbel; Barbara Pernici; Timos Sellis; Savos Tserkezoglou; Michalis Vazirgiannis,Abstract When authoring multimedia scenarios; and in particular scenarios with userinteraction; where the sequence and time of occurrence of interactions is not predefined; it isdifficult to guarantee the consistency of the resulting scenarios. As a consequence; theexecution of the scenario may result in unexpected behavior or inconsistent use of media.The present paper proposes a methodology for checking the temporal integrity of interactivemultimedia document (IMD) scenarios at authoring time at various levels. The IMD flow ismainly defined by the events occurring during the IMD session. Integrity checking consists ofa set of discrete steps; during which we transform the scenario into temporal constraintnetworks representing the constraints linking the different possible events in the scenario.Temporal constraint verification techniques are applied to verify the integrity of the …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2000,27
Evaluating reachability queries over path collections,Panagiotis Bouros; Spiros Skiadopoulos; Theodore Dalamagas; Dimitris Sacharidis; Timos Sellis,Abstract Several applications in areas such as biochemistry; GIS; involve storing andquerying large volumes of sequential data stored as path collections. There is a number ofinteresting queries that can be posed on such data. This work focuses on reachabilityqueries: given a path collection and two nodes vs; vt; determine whether a path from vs to vtexists and identify it. To answer these queries; the path-first search paradigm; which treatspaths as first-class citizens; is proposed. To improve the performance of our techniques; twoindexing structures that capture the reachability information of paths are introduced. Further;methods for updating a path collection and its indices are discussed. Finally; an extensiveexperimental evaluation verifies the advantages of our approach.,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2009,25

Experimental evaluation of data warehouse configuration algorithms,Spyros Ligoudistianos; Dimitri Theodoratos; Timos Sellis,A data warehouse (DW) can be seen as a set of materialized views defined over relationsthat are stored in remote heterogeneous database systems. When a query is posed to theDW; it is evaluated locally; using only the materialized views. The DW configuration problemis the problem of selecting an optimal set of views to materialize that answer a given set ofqueries. The objective is the minimization of the combination of the query evaluation andview maintenance costs. We report on the experimental evaluation of an exhaustivealgorithm and we develop new greedy and heuristic algorithms that expand only a smallfraction of the states produced by the exhaustive algorithm. The algorithms are described interms of a state space search problem. Finally; we report on experimental results anddiscuss the observed behavior of the algorithms.,Database and Expert Systems Applications; 1998. Proceedings. Ninth International Workshop on,1998,25

Maintaining consistent results of continuous queries under diverse window specifications,Kostas Patroumpas; Timos Sellis,Abstract Continuous queries applied over nonterminating data streams usually specifywindows in order to obtain an evolving–yet restricted–set of tuples and thus provide timelyand incremental results. Although sliding windows get frequently employed in many userrequests; additional types like partitioned or landmark windows are also available in streamprocessing engines. In this paper; we set out to study the existence of monotonic-relatedsemantics for a rich set of windowing constructs in order to facilitate a more efficientmaintenance of their changing contents. After laying out a formal foundation for expressingwindowed queries; we investigate update patterns observed in most common windowvariants as well as their impact on adaptations of typical operators (like windowed join;union or aggregation); thus offering more insight towards design and implementation of …,Information Systems,2011,23
Probabilistic contextual skylines,Dimitris Sacharidis; Anastasios Arvanitis; Timos Sellis,The skyline query returns the most interesting tuples according to a set of explicitly definedpreferences among attribute values. This work relaxes this requirement; and allows users topose meaningful skyline queries without stating their choices. To compensate for missingknowledge; we first determine a set of uncertain preferences based on user profiles; ie;information collected for previous contexts. Then; we define a probabilistic contextual skylinequery (p-CSQ) that returns the tuples which are interesting with high probability. Weemphasize that; unlike past work; uncertainty lies within the query and not the data; ie; it is inthe relationships among tuples rather than in their attribute values. Furthermore; due to thenature of this uncertainty; popular skyline methods; which rely on a particular tuple visitorder; do not apply for p-CSQs. Therefore; we present novel non-indexed and index …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,23

Dynamic pickup and delivery with transfers,Panagiotis Bouros; Dimitris Sacharidis; Theodore Dalamagas; Timos Sellis,Abstract In the dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem with Transfers (dPDPT); a set oftransportation requests that arrive at arbitrary times must be assigned to a fleet of vehicles.We use two cost metrics that capture both the company's and the customer's viewpointsregarding the quality of an assignment. In most related problems; the rule of thumb is toapply a two-phase local search algorithm to heuristically determine a good requests-to-vehicles assignment. This work proposes a novel solution based on a graph-basedformulation of the problem that treats each request independently. Briefly; in this conceptualgraph; the goal is to find a shortest path from a node representing the pickup location to thatof the delivery location. However; we show that efficient Bellman-Ford or Dijkstra-likealgorithms cannot be applied. Still; our method is able to find dPDPT solutions …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2011,22

Diversifying user comments on news articles,Giorgos Giannopoulos; Ingmar Weber; Alejandro Jaimes; Timos Sellis,Abstract In this paper we present an approach for diversifying user comments on newsarticles. In our proposed framework; we analyse user comments wrt four different criteria inorder to extract the respective diversification dimensions in the form of feature vectors. Thesecriteria involve content similarity; sentiment expressed within comments; article's namedentities also found within comments and commenting behavior of the respective users. Then;we apply diversification on comments; utilizing the extracted features vectors. The outcomeof this process is a subset of the initial comments that contains heterogeneous comments;representing different aspects of the news article; different sentiments expressed; as well asdifferent user categories; wrt their commenting behavior. We perform a preliminaryqualitative analysis showing that the diversity criteria we introduce result in distinctively …,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2012,21

The results include a generalalgebraic definition of the Pre-Grouping transformation along with the formal definition ofsufficient conditions for applying the transformation. Using a provided theorem; this chaptershows that pre-grouping can be applied in the presence of functional and inclusiondependencies without the explicit usage of hierarchical surrogate keys. An additional resultof the study is the definition of the Surrogate-Join transformation that can modify a joincondition using a number of dependencies. One important such optimization technique;called hierarchical pre-grouping; uses the hierarchical surrogate keys in order to aggregatethe fact table tuples as early as possible and to avoid redundant joins.The Generalized …,*,2003,21
Implementing a query language for context-dependent semistructured data,Yannis Stavrakas; Kostis Pristouris; Antonis Efandis; Timos Sellis,Abstract In today's global environment; the structure and presentation of information maydepend on the underlying context of the user. To address this issue; in previous work wehave proposed multidimensional semistructured data (MSSD); where an information entitycan have alternative variants; or facets; each holding under some world; and MOEM; a datamodel suitable for representing MSSD. In this paper we briefly present MQL; a querylanguage for MSSD that supports context-driven queries; and we attempt to motivate thedirect use of context in data models and query languages by comparing MOEM and MQLwith equivalent; context-unaware forms of representing and querying information.Specifically; we implemented an evaluation process for MQL during which MQL queries aretranslated to equivalent Lorel queries; and MOEM databases are transformed to …,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2004,20

OLAP poses new requirements to the physicalstorage layer of a database management system. Special characteristics of OLAP cubessuch as multidimensionality; hierarchical structure of dimensions; data sparseness; etc.; aredifficult to handle with ordinary record-oriented storage managers. The SISYPHUS storagemanager is based on a chunk-based data model that enables the hierarchical clustering ofdata with a very low storage cost.

Event and action representation and composition for multimedia application scenario modelling,Michalis Vazirgiannis; T Sellis,Abstract In this paper we present a model for the representation of multimedia applicationsbased on the scenario concept. The scenario is described in terms of events and actions.The proposed model represents all the events that may occur in a multimedia application(originated from the system; the application or the user). As regards actions we propose arich scheme for spatial and temporal composition representation based on operators thatcover all the spatial and temporal relationships among multimedia objects. Finally thescenario of the application is represented as a set of scenario tuples that correspond tofundamental sets of actions originated by the same event (or events).,European Workshop on Interactive Distributed Multimedia Systems and Telecommunication Services,1996,20
On enhancing scalability for distributed RDF/S stores,George Tsatsanifos; Dimitris Sacharidis; Timos Sellis,Abstract This work presents MIDAS-RDF; a distributed P2P RDF/S repository that is built ontop of a distributed multi-dimensional index structure. MIDAS-RDF features fast retrieval ofRDF triples satisfying various pattern queries by translating them into multi-dimensionalrange queries; which can be processed by the underlying index in hops logarithmic to thenumber of peers. More importantly; MIDAS-RDF utilizes a labeling scheme to handleexpensive transitive closure computations efficiently. This allows for distributed RDFSreasoning in a more scalable way compared to existing methods; as also demonstrated byour extensive experimental study. Furthermore; MIDAS-RDF supports a publish-subscribemodel that enables remote peers to selectively subscribe to RDF content.,Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2011,19

The selectionof views for materialization in a DW is thus an important decision problem. The objective isthe minimization of the combination of the query evaluation and view maintenance costs. Inthis paper we expand on our previous work by proposing new heuristic algorithms for theDW design problem. These algorithms are described in terms of a state space searchproblem; and are guaranteed to deliver an optimal solution by expanding only a smallfraction of the states produced by the (original) exhaustive algorithm.,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,1999,19

We abstractExtract-Transform-Load (ETL) activities as queries and sequences of views. ETL activitiesand its sources are uniformly modeled as a graph that is annotated with rules for themanagement of evolution events. Given a change at an element of the graph; our frameworkdetects the parts of the graph that are affected by this change and highlights the way theyare tuned to respond to it. We then present the system architecture of a tool calledHecataeus that implements the main concepts of the proposed framework.,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2009,18
Efficient evaluation of generalized path pattern queries on XML data,Xiaoying Wu; Stefanos Souldatos; Dimitri Theodoratos; Theodore Dalamagas; Timos Sellis,Abstract Finding the occurrences of structural patterns in XML data is a key operation in XMLquery processing. Existing algorithms for this operation focus almost exclusively on path-patterns or tree-patterns. Requirements in flexible querying of XML data have motivatedrecently the introduction of query languages that allow a partial specification of path-patternsin a query. In this paper; we focus on the efficient evaluation of partial path queries; ageneralization of path pattern queries. Our approach explicitly deals with repeated labels(that is; multiple occurrences of the same label in a query). We show that partial path queriescan be represented as rooted dags for which a topological ordering of the nodes exists. Wepresent three algorithms for the efficient evaluation of these queries under the indexedstreaming evaluation model. The first one exploits a structural summary of data to …,Proceedings of the 17th international conference on World Wide Web,2008,18
Monitoring orientation of moving objects around focal points,Kostas Patroumpas; Timos Sellis,Abstract We consider a setting with numerous location-aware moving objects thatcommunicate with a central server. Assuming a set of focal points of interest; we aim atcontinuously monitoring object orientations and hence detect situations where many objectsget closer to or move away from any such site. Towards this goal; we propose a streamingapproach that delegates part of the processing to objects; which relay positional updatesupon significant deviations at their course. The central processor maintains the changingdistribution of current object headings around each focal point and may issue alerts once itobserves many objects moving along a direction (eg; increased northbound traffic near thestadium). To efficiently answer such navigational queries; we introduce a novel accessmethod that indexes object headings influencing a specific site. Furthermore; we extent …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2009,17
Data warehouse refreshment,Alkis Simitisis; Panos Vassiliadis; Spiros Skiadopoulos; Timos Sellis,Abstract In the early stages of a data warehouse project; the designers/administrators haveto come up with a decision concerning the design and deployment of the backstagearchitecture. The possible options are (a) the usage of a commercial ETL tool or (b) thedevelopment of an in-house ETL prototype. Both cases have advantages anddisadvantages. However; in both cases the design and modeling of the ETL workflows havethe same characteristics. The scope of this chapter is to indicate the main challenges;issues; and problems concerning the manufacturing of ETL workflows; in order to assist thedesigners/administrators to decide which solution suits their data warehouse project betterand to help them construct an efficient; robust; and evolvable ETL workflow that implementsthe refreshment of their warehouse.,*,2007,17

A pictorial language for the retrieval of spatial relations from image databases,Dimitris Papadias; Timos Sellis,Abstract The paper describes a Pictorial Query-By-Example (PQBE) aimed at the retrieval ofdirection relations from Image Databases. PQBE incorporates several features such asobject; image and relation retrieval; union; intersection etc. Unlike verbal query languages itdoes not presume knowledge of keywords for spatial relations on behalf of the user; norfamiliarity with database models; but complex spatial conditions are expressed in astraightforward manner. Furthermore; with the incorporation of some additional features;such as topological relations; distances and class retrieval; PQBE can be used as anintuitive GIS interface; independently of the underlying representation.,the Proceedings of the 6th International Symposium on Spatial Data Handling (SDH),1994,16
Efficient compilation of large rule bases using logical access paths,Timos K Sellis; Nick Roussopoulos; Raymond T Ng,Abstract This paper presents an efficient way to compile and store large deductivedatabases. Deductive rules are modeled through logical access paths and then integratedinto a global structure; the Rule-base Access Path Schema (RAP Schema). The RAPSchema stores information on the interrelationships that exist among the computationsrequired for rule executions. Ground data as well as data derived through some ruleexecutions and cached for later reuse are also modeled in the RAP Schema. Some of theadvantages of using this rule base organization scheme include the automatic detection ofshared computations; the inclusion of cached results of rule executions and query results inthe knowledge base. The details of the compilation and query processing phases are thefocus of the paper.,Information Systems,1990,16
Hierarchically compressed wavelet synopses,Dimitris Sacharidis; Antonios Deligiannakis; Timos Sellis,Abstract The wavelet decomposition is a proven tool for constructing concise synopses oflarge data sets that can be used to obtain fast approximate answers. Existing researchstudies focus on selecting an optimal set of wavelet coefficients to store so as to minimizesome error metric; without however seeking to reduce the size of the wavelet coefficientsthemselves. In many real data sets the existence of large spikes in the data values results inmany large coefficient values lying on paths of a conceptual tree structure known as theerror tree. To exploit this fact; we introduce in this paper a novel compression scheme forwavelet synopses; termed hierarchically compressed wavelet synopses; that fully exploitshierarchical relationships among coefficients in order to reduce their storage.

Online amnesic summarization of streaming locations,Michalis Potamias; Kostas Patroumpas; Timos Sellis,Abstract Massive data streams of positional updates become increasingly difficult to manageunder limited memory resources; especially in terms of providing near real-time response tomultiple continuous queries. In this paper; we consider online maintenance forspatiotemporal summaries of streaming positions in an aging-aware fashion; by graduallyevicting older observations in favor of greater precision for the most recent portions ofmovement. Although several amnesic functions have been proposed for approximation oftime series; we opt for a simple; yet quite efficient scheme that achieves contiguity along allretained stream pieces. To this end; we adapt an amnesic tree structure that effectivelymeets the requirements of time-decaying approximation while taking advantage of thesuccession inherent in positional updates. We further exemplify the significance of this …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2007,15
A simulation-based study on the concurrent execution of rules in a database environment,Louiqa Raschid; Timos Sellis; Alex Delis,Abstract We present our research on the concurrent execution of rules in a databaseenvironment. Traditionally; the serializability criterion of correctness is defined on the basisof read/write conflicts. With rules; however; the conditions must be true for the actions toexecute; and rules must fail when their conditions are no longer true. A different correctnesscriterion is thus defined on the basis of conflicts between conditions and actions. Wedevelop a locking based protocol and discuss extensions to a conventional transactionmanager. One extension is a new lock compatibility matrix which provides greaterconcurrent access. The second extension is to allow concurrent execution within atransaction. A simulation-based performance study is described. We identify characteristicfeatures of the rules and study their impact on performance. The impact of using the new …,Journal of Parallel and Distributed computing,1994,15
On the properties of non-media digital watermarking: a review of state of the art techniques,Arezou Soltani Panah; Ron Van Schyndel; Timos Sellis; Elisa Bertino,Over the last 25 years; there has been much work on multimedia digital watermarking. In thisdomain; the primary limitation to watermark strength has been in its visibility. For multimediawatermarks; invisibility is defined in human terms (that is; in terms of human sensorylimitations). In this paper; we review recent developments in the non-media applications ofdata watermarking; which have emerged over the last decade as an exciting new sub-domain. Since by definition; the intended receiver should be able to detect the watermark;we have to redefine invisibility in an acceptable way that is often application-specific andthus cannot be easily generalized. In particular; this is true when the data is not intended tobe directly consumed by humans. For example; a loose definition of robustness might be interms of the resilience of a watermark against normal host data operations; and of …,IEEE Access,2016,14
Learning to rank user intent,Giorgos Giannopoulos; Ulf Brefeld; Theodore Dalamagas; Timos Sellis,Abstract Personalized retrieval models aim at capturing user interests to providepersonalized results that are tailored to the respective information needs. User interests arehowever widely spread; subject to change; and cannot always be captured well; thusrendering the deployment of personalized models challenging. We take a different approachand study ranking models for user intent. We exploit user feedback in terms of click data tocluster ranking models for historic queries according to user behavior and intent. Eachcluster is finally represented by a single ranking model that captures the contained searchinterests expressed by users. Once new queries are issued; these are mapped to theclustering and the retrieval process diversifies possible intents by combining relevantranking functions. Empirical evidence shows that our approach significantly outperforms …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,14
Efficient answering of set containment queries for skewed item distributions,Manolis Terrovitis; Panagiotis Bouros; Panos Vassiliadis; Timos Sellis; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract In this paper we address the problem of efficiently evaluating containment (ie;subset; equality; and superset) queries over set-valued data. We propose a novel indexingscheme; the Ordered Inverted File (OIF) which; differently from the state-of-the-art; indexesset-valued attributes in an ordered fashion. We introduce query processing algorithms thatpractically treat containment queries as range queries over the ordered postings lists of OIFand exploit this ordering to quickly prune unnecessary page accesses. OIF is simple toimplement and our experiments on both real and synthetic data show that it greatlyoutperforms the current state-of-the-art methods for all three classes of containment queries.,Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2011,14

SISYPHUS: A Chunk-Based Storage Manager for OLAP Cubes.,Nikos Karayannidis; Timos K Sellis,Abstract In this paper; we present SISYPHUS; a storage manager for data cubes thatprovides an efficient physical base for performing OLAP operations. On-Line AnalyticalProcessing (OLAP) poses new requirements to the physical storage layer of a databasemanagement system. Special characteristics of OLAP cubes such as multidimensionality;hierarchical structure of dimensions; data sparseness; etc.; are difficult to handle withordinary record-oriented storage managers. The SISYPHUS storage manager is based on achunk-based data model that enables the hierarchical clustering of data with a very lowstorage cost. Moreover; it provides an access interface that is “hierarchy aware” and thusnative to the OLAP data space. This interface can be used to implement efficient accesspaths to cube data.,DMDW,2001,14
Supporting inconsistent rules in database systems,Yannis E Ioannidis; Timos K Sellis,Abstract When a set of rules generates (conflicting) values for a virtual attribute of sometuple; the system must resolve the inconsistency and decide on a unique value that isassigned to that attribute. In most current systems; the conflict is resolved based on criteriathat choose one of the rules in the conflicting set and use the value that it generated. Thereare several applications; however; where inconsistencies of the above form arise; whosesemantics demand a different form of resolution. We propose a general framework for thestudy of the conflict resolution problem; and suggest a variety of resolution criteria; whichcollectively subsume all previously known solutions. With several new criteria beingintroduced; the semantics of several applications are captured more accurately than in thepast. We discuss how conflict resolution criteria can be specified at the schema or the rule …,Journal of Intelligent Information Systems,1992,14
Probabilistic range monitoring of streaming uncertain positions in geosocial networks,Kostas Patroumpas; Marios Papamichalis; Timos Sellis,Abstract We consider a social networking service where numerous subscribers consent todisclose their current geographic location to a central server; but with a varying degree ofuncertainty in order to protect their privacy. We aim to effectively provide instant response tomultiple user requests; each focusing at continuously monitoring possible presence of theirfriends or followers in a time-varying region of interest. Every continuous range query mustalso specify a cutoff threshold for filtering out results with small appearance likelihood; forinstance; a user may wish to identify her friends currently located somewhere in the citycenter with a probability no less than 75%. Assuming a continuous uncertainty model forstreaming positional updates; we develop novel pruning heuristics based on spatial andprobabilistic properties of the data so as to avoid examination of non-qualifying …,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2012,13
Sailing the web with captain nemo: a personalized metasearch engine,Stefanos Souldatos; Theodore Dalamagas; Timos Sellis,Abstract Personalization on the Web is an issue that has gained a lot of interest lately. Websites have already started providing services such as preferences for the interface; the layoutand the functionality of the applications. Personalization services have also been introducedin Web search and metasearch engines; ie tools that retrieve Web pages relevant tokeywords given by the users. However; those services deal mostly with the presentationstyle and ignore issues like the retrieval model; the ranking algorithm and topic preferences.In this paper; we present Captain Nemo; a fully-functionable metasearch engine that exploitspersonal user search spaces. Users can define their personal retrieval model andpresentation style. They can also define topics of interest. Captain Nemo exploits severalpopular Web search engines to retrieve Web pages relevant to keywords given by the …,Proceedings of the Learning in Web Search Workshop; at the 22nd ICML Conference,2005,13
Computing and handling cardinal direction information,Spiros Skiadopoulos; Christos Giannoukos; Panos Vassiliadis; Timos Sellis; Manolis Koubarakis,Abstract Qualitative spatial reasoning forms an important part of the commonsensereasoning required for building intelligent Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Previousresearch has come up with models to capture cardinal direction relations for typical GISdata. In this paper; we target the problem of efficiently computing the cardinal directionrelations between regions that are composed of sets of polygons and present the first twoalgorithms for this task. The first of the proposed algorithms is purely qualitative andcomputes; in linear time; the cardinal direction relations between the input regions. Thesecond has a quantitative aspect and computes; also in linear time; the cardinal directionrelations with percentages between the input regions. The algorithms have beenimplemented and embedded in an actual system; CarDirect; that allows the user to …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2004,13
Cost-based optimization of aggregation star queries on hierarchically clustered data warehouses.,Aris Tsois; Nikos Karayannidis; Timos K Sellis; Dimitri Theodoratos,Abstract A methodology recently proposed to improve processing of star queries on datawarehouses is the clustering and indexing of fact tables using their multidimensionalhierarchies [DRSN98; MRB99; KS01]. Due to this improved organization schema;processing of aggregation star queries changes dramatically creating new optimizationopportunities. An important optimization technique is the so-called pre-groupingtransformation. Although this transformation is expected to improve the query-processingplan in most cases; there are several cases where it is not beneficial. In this paper weattempt to apply a cost-based method for the optimal application of the pre-groupingtransformation. Taking into consideration the special characteristics of our domain weidentify the most suitable algorithms for the operations related to pre-grouping and derive …,DMDW,2002,13
Answering multidimensional queries on cubes using other cubes,Dimitri Theodoratos; Timos Sellis,Recently there is an important interest in On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) technology.In this context; in order to facilitate complex analysis; data are usually modeledmultidimensionally where multiple hierarchies are associated with the dimensions. Thesemultidimensional (MD) data structures are called data cubes. In the existing OLAP products;the user interaction is limited to one operation at a time. Further computing OLAP operationsis very expensive since sequential scans are required. In this paper we provide a simpledata model for MD databases; and a simple algebraic MD query language that permit themodeling of the principal OLAP operations. The MD query language allows the user todirectly specify the result. Therefore; optimization techniques can be applied globally to theMD query evaluation. We state declarative conditions for answering queries on cubes …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2000. Proceedings. 12th International Conference on,2000,13
Interoperability and definition of a national standard for geospatial data: the case of the Hellenic Cadastre,Thanassis Hadzilakos; George Halaris; Marinos Kavouras; Margarita Kokla; George Panopoulos; Ioannis Paraschakis; Timos Sellis; Lysandros Tsoulos; Michalis Zervakis,Abstract This study; evaluation and proposal of a standard suitable for the exchange ofgeographic data was conducted by the National Technical University of Athens as part of aresearch project on behalf of KTIMATOLOGIO SA and the Hellenic Mapping and CadastralOrganization. The primary application interest was the Hellenic Cadastre Project; which canbe seen as a case-study of the role of standards; the functionality they provide; and theireffects. The study reported relates mainly to theoretical and scientific issues ofstandardization. Several subjects were addressed during the process of selecting thestandard and a series of evaluation criteria were formed. Three primary trends instandardization were considered; Open GIS; ISO/TC 211 and CEN/TC 287; and a generic-profile-product approach was pursued.

Personalized influential topic search via social network summarization,Jianxin Li; Chengfei Liu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Yi Chen; Timos Sellis; J Shane Culpepper,Social networks are a vital mechanism to disseminate information to friends and colleagues.In this work; we investigate an important problem-the personalized influential topic search;or PIT-Search in a social network: Given a keyword query q issued by a user u in a socialnetwork; a PIT-Search is to find the top-k q-related topics that are most influential for thequery user u. The influence of a topic to a query user depends on the social connectionbetween the query user and the social users containing the topic in the social network. Tomeasure the topics' influence at the similar granularity scale; we need to extract the socialsummarization of the social network regarding topics. To make effective topic-aware socialsummarization; we propose two random-walk based approaches: random clustering and anL-length random walk. Based on the proposed approaches; we can find a small set of …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,12
Multi-granular time-based sliding windows over data streams,Kostas Patroumpas; Timos Sellis,We introduce a multi-level window operator that concurrently spans temporal extents ofincreasing granularity over a streaming dataset. This windowing construct is inherentlysliding with time; essentially providing at each granularity a varying; but always finite portionof the most recent stream items. After a careful algebraic formulation of its semantics; weinvestigate interesting properties and suggest a suitable data structure that can efficientlymaintain tuples qualifying for each granular level. Moreover; we propose techniques forevaluating advanced continuous requests against multiple time horizons; achieving nearreal-time response at reduced overhead. Finally; this framework is empirically validatedagainst streaming data; offering concrete evidence of its benefits to online streamprocessing.,Temporal Representation and Reasoning (TIME); 2010 17th International Symposium on,2010,12
Mining user navigation patterns for personalizing topic directories,Theodore Dalamagas; Panagiotis Bouros; Theodore Galanis; Magdalini Eirinaki; Timos Sellis,Abstract Topic directories are popular means of organizing information resources in the web.In this work; we introduce a methodology for personalizing topic directories. The key featureof our methodology is that the personalization is based on the mining of navigation patternsextracted from previous user visits. These patterns; expressed in the form of visitedcategories and retrieved resources; represent the navigation behaviour and interests ofdifferent users or user groups. Our work provides a set of mining tasks for user navigationpatterns and a set of personalization tasks that customize the organization of the topicdirectory according to these patterns for certain user groups.,Proceedings of the 9th annual ACM international workshop on Web information and data management,2007,12
Evaluation of partial path queries on XML data,Stefanos Souldatos; Xiaoying Wu; Dimitri Theodoratos; Theodore Dalamagas; Timos Sellis,Abstract XML query languages typically allow the specification of structural patterns ofelements. Finding the occurrences of such patterns in an XML tree is the key operation inXML query processing. Many algorithms have been presented for this operation. Thesealgorithms focus mainly on the evaluation of path-pattern or tree-pattern queries. In thispaper; we define a partial path-pattern query language; and we address the problem of itsefficient evaluation on XML data. In order to process partial path-pattern queries; weintroduce a set of sound and complete inference rules to characterize structural relationshipderivation. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for detecting query unsatisfiabilityand node redundancy. We show how partial path-pattern queries can be equivalently put ina canonical directed acyclic graph form. We developed two stack-based algorithms for the …,Proceedings of the sixteenth ACM conference on Conference on information and knowledge management,2007,12
Heuristic containment check of partial tree-pattern queries in the presence of index graphs,Dimitri Theodoratos; Stefanos Souldatos; Theodore Dalamagas; Pawel Placek; Timos Sellis,Abstract The wide adoption of XML has increased the interest of the database community ontree-structured data management techniques. Querying capabilities are provided throughtree-pattern queries. The need for querying tree-structured data sources when their structureis not fully known; and the need to integrate multiple data sources with different treestructures have driven; recently; the suggestion of query languages that relax the completespecification of a tree pattern. In this paper; we use a query language which allows partialtree-pattern queries (PTPQs). The structure in a PTPQ can be flexibly specified fully; partiallyor not at all. To evaluate a PTPQ; we exploit index graphs which generate an equivalent setof" complete" tree-pattern queries. In order to process PTPQs; we need to efficiently solvethe PTPQ satisfiability and containment problems.

Combining hierarchy encoding and pre-grouping: intelligent grouping in star join processing,Roland Pieringer; Klaus Elhardt; Frank Ramsak; Volker Markl; Robert Fenk; Rudolf Bayer; Nikos Karayannidis; Aris Tsois; Timos Sellis,Efficient star query processing is crucial for a performant data warehouse (DW)implementation and much work is available on physical optimization (eg; indexing andschema design) and logical optimization (eg; pre-aggregated materialized views with queryrewriting). One important step in the query processing phase is; however; still a bottleneck:the residual join of results from the fact table with the dimension tables in combination withgrouping and aggregation. This phase typically consumes between 50% and 80% of theoverall processing time. In typical DW scenarios pre-grouping methods only have a limitedeffect as the grouping is usually specified on the hierarchy levels of the dimension tablesand not on the fact table itself. We suggest a combination of hierarchical clustering and pre-grouping as we have implemented in the relational DBMS Transbase. Exploiting …,Data Engineering; 2003.

Enhancing operations with spatial access methods in a database management system for GIS,Emmanuel Stefanakis; Timos Sellis,Much attention has been devoted in the past to support classes of applications which are notwell served by conventional database systems. Focusing on the application domain ofgeographic information systems (GIS); several architectural approaches have beenproposed to implement commercial or prototype systems and satisfy the urgent needs forgeographic data handling. However; those systems suffer from several limitations becausethey either perform much processing on an application layer; which is at the top of thedatabase management system (DBMS); or the underlying data models are not rich enoughto represent the spatial dimension of geographic entities. This study examines the spatialoperations that should be provided by a DBMS for the application domain of GIS andfocuses on the various techniques which may be used to support the efficient execution of …,Cartography and Geographic Information Systems,1998,12
Maximizing bichromatic reverse spatial and textual k nearest neighbor queries,Farhana M Choudhury; J Shane Culpepper; Timos Sellis; Xin Cao,Abstract The problem of maximizing bichromatic reverse k nearest neighbor queries(BRkNN) has been extensively studied in spatial databases. In this work; we present arelated query for spatial-textual databases that finds an optimal location; and a set ofkeywords that maximizes the size of bichromatic reverse spatial textual k nearest neighbors(MaxBRSTkNN). Such a query has many practical applications including social mediaadvertisements where a limited number of relevant advertisements are displayed to eachuser. The problem is to find the location and the text contents to include in an advertisementso that it will be displayed to the maximum number of users. The increasing availability ofspatial-textual collections allows us to answer these queries for both spatial proximity andtextual similarity. This paper is the first to consider the MaxBRSTkNN query. We show that …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,11
Top-k-size keyword search on tree structured data,Aggeliki Dimitriou; Dimitri Theodoratos; Timos Sellis,Abstract Keyword search is the most popular technique for querying large tree-structureddatasets; often of unknown structure; in the web. Recent keyword search approaches returnlowest common ancestors (LCAs) of the keyword matches ranked with respect to theirrelevance to the keyword query. A major challenge of a ranking approach is the efficiency ofits algorithms as the number of keywords and the size and complexity of the data increase.To face this challenge most of the known approaches restrict their ranking to a subset of theLCAs (eg; SLCAs; ELCAs); missing relevant results. In this work; we design novel top-k-sizestack-based algorithms on tree-structured data. Our algorithms implement ranking semanticsfor keyword queries which is based on the concept of LCA size. Similar to metric selection ininformation retrieval; LCA size reflects the proximity of keyword matches in the data tree …,Information Systems,2015,11
Spatio-temporal composition of sensor cloud services,Azadeh Ghari Neiat; Athman Bouguettaya; Timos Sellis; Zhen Ye,We propose a new framework for composing Sensor-Cloud services based on dynamicfeatures such as spatio-temporal aspects. To evaluate spatio-temporal Sensor-Cloudservices; two new quality attributes are introduced. We present a heuristic algorithm basedon A* to compose Sensor-Cloud services in terms of spatio-temporal aspects. In addition; anew spatio-temporal technique based on 3D R-tree to access Sensor-Cloud services isproposed. Analytical and simulation results are presented to show the performance of theproposed approach.,Web Services (ICWS); 2014 IEEE International Conference on,2014,11
Optimizing XML queries: Bitmapped materialized views vs. indexes,Xiaoying Wu; Dimitri Theodoratos; Wendy Hui Wang; Timos Sellis,Abstract Optimizing queries using materialized views has not been addressed adequately inthe context of XML due to the many limitations associated with the definition and usability ofmaterialized views in traditional XML query evaluation models. In this paper; we address theXML query optimization problem using materialized views in the framework of the invertedlists evaluation model which has been established as the most prominent one for evaluatingqueries on large persistent XML data. Under this framework; we propose a novel approachwhich instead of materializing the answer of a view materializes exactly the sublists of theinverted lists that are necessary for computing the answer of the view. A further originality ofour approach is that the view materializations are stored as compressed bitmaps. Thistechnique not only minimizes the materialization space but also reduces CPU and I/O …,Information Systems,2013,11
Hierarchical clustering for OLAP: the CUBE File approach,Nikos Karayannidis; Timos Sellis,Abstract This paper deals with the problem of physical clustering of multidimensional datathat are organized in hierarchies on disk in a hierarchy-preserving manner. This is calledhierarchical clustering. A typical case; where hierarchical clustering is necessary forreducing I/Os during query evaluation; is the most detailed data of an OLAP cube. Thepresence of hierarchies in the multidimensional space results in an enormous search spacefor this problem. We propose a representation of the data space that results in a chunk-treerepresentation of the cube. The model is adaptive to the cube's extensive sparseness andprovides efficient access to subsets of data based on hierarchy value combinations. Basedon this representation of the search space we formulate the problem as a chunk-to-bucketallocation problem; which is a packing problem as opposed to the linear ordering …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2008,11
Indexing views to route queries in a PDMS,Lefteris Sidirourgos; George Kokkinidis; Theodore Dalamagas; Vassilis Christophides; Timos Sellis,Abstract P2P computing gains increasing attention lately; since it provides the means forrealizing computing systems that scale to very large numbers of participating peers; whileensuring high autonomy and fault-tolerance. Peer Data Management Systems (PDMS) havebeen proposed to support sophisticated facilities in exchanging; querying and integrating(semi-) structured data hosted by peers. In this paper; we are interested in routing graphqueries in a very large PDMS; where peers advertise their local bases using fragments ofcommunity RDF/S schemes (ie; views). We introduce an original encoding for thesefragments; in order to efficiently check whether a peer view is subsumed by a query. We relyon this encoding to design an RDF/S view lookup service featuring a statefull and a statelessexecution over a DHT-based P2P infrastructure. We finally evaluate experimentally our …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2008,11
CUBE file: A file structure for hierarchically clustered OLAP cubes,Nikos Karayannidis; Timos Sellis; Yannis Kouvaras,Abstract Hierarchical clustering has been proved an effective means for physicallyorganizing large fact tables since it reduces significantly the I/O cost during ad hoc OLAPquery evaluation. In this paper; we propose a novel multidimensional file structure fororganizing the most detailed data of a cube; the CUBE File. The CUBE File achieveshierarchical clustering of the data; enabling fast access via hierarchical restrictions.Moreover; it imposes a low storage cost and adapts perfectly to the extensive sparseness ofthe data space achieving a high compression rate. Our results show that the CUBE Fileoutperforms the most effective method proposed up to now for hierarchically clustering thecube; resulting in 7-9 times less I/Os on average for all workloads tested. Thus; it achieves ahigher degree of hierarchical clustering. Moreover; the CUBE File imposes a 2-3 times …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2004,11
Expert database systems: Efficient support for engineering environments,T Sellis; Nick Roussopoulos; Leo Mark; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract Manufacturing and Engineering processes use both large scale data andknowledge bases; and the use of expert systems in such environments has become anecessity. Expert Database Systems have evolved from conventional database systems tomeet the requirements of current Artificial Intelligence applications. However; future ExpertDatabase Systems will contain knowledge bases of significant size which makes mainmemory insufficient and the use of a database system a necessity. We propose an effectiveway of building High Performance Expert Database Systems to support manufacturing andengineering environments. These systems are based on Incremental Computation Models;such models utilize results of previous computations by merging them with newly derivedresults of computations on small increments representing changes in the database.

GraphVizdb: A scalable platform for interactive large graph visualization,Nikos Bikakis; John Liagouris; Maria Krommyda; George Papastefanatos; Timos Sellis,We present a novel platform for the interactive visualization of very large graphs. Theplatform enables the user to interact with the visualized graph in a way that is very similar tothe exploration of maps at multiple levels. Our approach involves an offline preprocessingphase that builds the layout of the graph by assigning coordinates to its nodes with respectto a Euclidean plane. The respective points are indexed with a spatial data structure; ie; anR-tree; and stored in a database. Multiple abstraction layers of the graph based on variouscriteria are also created offline; and they are indexed similarly so that the user can explorethe dataset at different levels of granularity; depending on her particular needs. Then; oursystem translates user operations into simple and very efficient spatial operations (ie;window queries) in the backend.

mirPub: a database for searching microRNA publications,Thanasis Vergoulis; Ilias Kanellos; Nikos Kostoulas; Georgios Georgakilas; Timos Sellis; Artemis Hatzigeorgiou; Theodore Dalamagas,Abstract Summary: Identifying; amongst millions of publications available in MEDLINE; thosethat are relevant to specific microRNAs (miRNAs) of interest based on keyword search facesmajor obstacles. References to miRNA names in the literature often deviate from standardnomenclature for various reasons; since even the official nomenclature evolves. Forinstance; a single miRNA name may identify two completely different molecules or twodifferent names may refer to the same molecule. mirPub is a database with a powerful andintuitive interface; which facilitates searching for miRNA literature; addressing theaforementioned issues. To provide effective search services; mirPub applies text miningtechniques on MEDLINE; integrates data from several curated databases and exploits datafrom its user community following a crowdsourcing approach.

Processing and evaluating partial tree pattern queries on XML data,Xiaoying Wu; Stefanos Souldatos; Dimitri Theodoratos; Theodore Dalamagas; Yannis Vassiliou; Timos Sellis,XML query languages typically allow the specification of structural patterns using XPath.Usually; these structural patterns are in the form of trees (Tree-Pattern Queries-TPQs).Finding the occurrences of such patterns in an XML tree is a key operation in XML queryevaluation. The multiple previous algorithms presented for this operation focus mainly on theevaluation of tree-pattern queries. Recently; requirements for flexible querying of XML datahave motivated the consideration of query classes that are more expressive and flexiblethan TPQs for which efficient nonmain-memory evaluation algorithms are not known. In thispaper; we consider a class of queries; called Partial Tree-Pattern Queries (PTPQs); whichgeneralize and strictly contain TPQs. PTPQs represent a broad fragment of XPath which isvery useful in practice. In order to process PTPQs; we introduce a set of sound and …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2012,9
Midas: multi-attribute indexing for distributed architecture systems,George Tsatsanifos; Dimitris Sacharidis; Timos Sellis,Abstract This work presents a pure multidimensional; indexing infrastructure for large-scaledecentralized networks that operate in extremely dynamic environments where peers join;leave and fail arbitrarily. We propose a new peer-to-peer variant implementing a virtualdistributed kd tree; and develop efficient algorithms for multidimensional point and rangequeries. Scalability is enhanced as each peer has only partial knowledge of the network.The most prominent feature of our method; is that in expectance each peer maintains O (logn) state and requests are resolved in O (log n) hops with respect to the overlay size n. Inaddition; we provide mechanisms for handling peer failures and improving fault tolerance aswell as balancing the load of peers. Finally; our work is complemented by an experimentalevaluation; where MIDAS is shown to outperform existing methods in spatial as well as in …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2011,9
A model for context aware relational databases,Ioannis N Roussos; Timos Sellis,Abstract Context aware information; ie information that depends on a set of externalparameters like location; time; user's profile etc; is commonplace in real world datamanagement scenarios. There is a growing need to uniformly represent; store and manageinformation entities with different instances (values) or even different schemas (attributes)under varying circumstances as defined by context. Considerable effort has been directedtowards context acquisition from sources and context modeling. However; so far; no datamodel or language for context aware data has been proposed which can be considered anatural analogue to the relational model or algebra. In this work; we argue about the needfor a conceptual model for context aware information and propose a context aware datamodel based on the definition of multi-schema relations. Finally; we present a set of …,*,2008,9
Ontology-based data sharing in P2P databases,Dimitrios Skoutas; Verena Kantere; Alkis Simitsis; Timos Sellis,Abstract We consider peer-to-peer systems in which peers share structured data through theuse of schema mappings. Peers express their queries and rewrite incoming queries on theirlocal schema. We assume the existence of one or more ontologies describing the domain ofinterest of the peers. The ontologies are used to semantically annotate each peer schema;making explicit the type of information provided by it. A major problem in such a system isthat peers cannot easily judge the semantic relativeness of their interests to interests of otherpeers; as these are expressed by the respective local schemas. Moreover; peers cannotevaluate the semantic relativeness of answers that they receive to their queries. In thispaper; we propose a semantic similarity measure for evaluating the semantic relativenessbetween peer schemas; as well as between queries and their rewritten versions on other …,*,2008,9
Rdfsculpt: Managing rdf schemas under set-like semantics,Zoi Kaoudi; Theodore Dalamagas; Timos Sellis,Abstract The Semantic Web is an extension of the current Web in which information is givenwell-defined meaning to support effective data discovery and integration. The RDFframework is a key issue for the Semantic Web. It can be used in resource discovery toprovide better search engine capabilities; in cataloging for describing the content of thematichierarchies in thematic catalogs and digital libraries; in knowledge sharing and exchange ofWeb agents; etc. Up to now; RDF schemas have been treated rather as sets of individualelements (ie model primitives like classes; properties; etc.). Under that view; queries like“find the part of a portal catalog which is not present in another catalog” can be answeredonly in a procedural way; specifying which nodes to select and how to get them. For thisreason; we argue that answering such queries requires treating schemas as a whole …,European Semantic Web Conference,2005,9
Enhancing a database management system for GIS with fuzzy set methodologies,Emmanuel Stefanakis; Timos Sellis,The methods used in commercial GIS packages for both the representation and analysis ofgeographic data are inadequate; because they do not handle uncertainty. This leads toinformation loss and inaccuracy in analysis with adverse consequences in the spatialdecision-making process. The incorporation of fuzzy set methodologies into a DBMSrepository for the application domain of GIS should be beneficial and will improve its level ofintelligence. Focusing on this direction the paper addresses both a representation and areasoning issue. Specifically; it extends a general spatial data model to deal with theuncertainty of geographic entities; and shows how the standard data interpretationoperations available in GIS packages may be extended to support the fuzzy spatialreasoning.

Query optimization for nontraditional database applications,Timos K.  Sellis; Leonard Shapiro,Database query languages and their use for programming nontraditional applications; suchas engineering and artificial intelligence applications; are discussed. In such environments;database programs are used to code applications that work over large data sets residing indatabases. Optimizing such programs then becomes a necessity. An examination is made ofvarious optimization techniques; and transformations are suggested for improving theperformance of database programs. These transformations result in new equivalentdatabase programs with better space and time performance. Several of these techniquesapply to classical query languages; although extended query languages which include aniteration operator are specifically discussed.,IEEE transactions on software engineering,1991,9
Performance of DBMS implementations of production systems,Timos Sellis; C-C Lin,The performance of various methods for the implementation of large production rule bases isstudied. The authors first give a brief overview of the basic techniques; and then presentsome optimization alternatives for one of them. The results obtained indicate that both theRete network method and the one based on COND relations are feasible in a relationaldatabase system environment. One major advantage of the method based on CONDrelations is that it localizes the search for applicable rules. That is; for a given update to thedatabase only a single relation (the corresponding COND relation) needs to be searched.,Tools for Artificial Intelligence; 1990.; Proceedings of the 2nd International IEEE Conference on,1990,9
Towards scalable visual exploration of very large RDF graphs,Nikos Bikakis; John Liagouris; Maria Kromida; George Papastefanatos; Timos Sellis,Abstract In this paper; we outline our work on developing a disk-based infrastructure forefficient visualization and graph exploration operations over very large graphs. Theproposed platform; called graphVizdb; is based on a novel technique for indexing andstoring the graph. Particularly; the graph layout is indexed with a spatial data structure; ie; anR-tree; and stored in a database. In runtime; user operations are translated into efficientspatial operations (ie; window queries) in the backend.,International Semantic Web Conference,2015,8
MR-microT: a MapReduce-based MicroRNA target prediction method,Ilias Kanellos; Thanasis Vergoulis; Dimitris Sacharidis; Theodore Dalamagas; Artemis Hatzigeorgiou; Stelios Sartzetakis; Timos Sellis,Abstract MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules that inhibit the expression ofparticular genes; a function that makes them useful towards the treatment of many diseases.Computational methods that predict which genes are targeted by particular miRNAmolecules are known as target prediction methods. In this paper; we present a MapReduce-based system; termed MR-microT; for one of the most popular and accurate; butcomputational intensive; prediction methods.

Index-based query processing on distributed multidimensional data,George Tsatsanifos; Dimitris Sacharidis; Timos Sellis,Abstract This work introduces decentralized query processing techniques based on MIDAS;a novel distributed multidimensional index. In particular; MIDAS implements a distributed kdtree; where leaves correspond to peers; and internal nodes dictate message routing. MIDASrequires that peers maintain little network information; and features mechanisms that supportfault tolerance and load balancing. The proposed algorithms process point and rangequeries over the multidimensional indexed space in only O (log n) hops in expectance;where n is the network size. For nearest neighbor queries; two processing alternatives arediscussed. The first; termed eager processing; has low latency (expected value of O (log n)hops) but may involve a large number of peers. The second; termed iterative processing;has higher latency (expected value of O (log 2 n) hops) but involves far fewer peers. A …,GeoInformatica,2013,8
Evaluating path queries over frequently updated route collections,Panagiotis Bouros; Dimitris Sacharidis; Theodore Dalamagas; Spiros Skiadopoulos; Timos Sellis,The recent advances in the infrastructure of Geographic Information Systems (GIS); and theproliferation of GPS technology; have resulted in the abundance of geodata in the form ofsequences of points of interest (POIs); waypoints; etc. We refer to sets of such sequences asroute collections. In this work; we consider path queries on frequently updated routecollections: given a route collection and two points ns and nt; a path query returns a path; ie;a sequence of points; that connects ns to n t. We introduce two path query evaluationparadigms that enjoy the benefits of search algorithms (ie; fast index maintenance) whileutilizing transitivity information to terminate the search sooner. Efficient indexing schemesand appropriate updating procedures are introduced. An extensive experimental evaluationverifies the advantages of our methods compared to conventional graph-based search.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,8

Through a graphical interface; users are able to specify typical continuousqueries (such as range; distance; or nearest neighbor search); and receive incrementalresults. Moreover; this application offers capabilities for visual display of objects' trajectoriesand online collection of movement statistics.,Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGSPATIAL international conference on Advances in geographic information systems,2008,8
A framework for semantic grouping in P2P databases,Verena Kantere; Dimitrios Tsoumakos; Timos Sellis,Abstract Sharing of structured data in decentralized environments is a challenging problem;especially in the absence of a global schema. Social network structures map network links tosemantic relations between participants in order to assist in efficient resource discovery andinformation exchange. In this work; we propose a scheme that automates the process ofcreating schema synopses from semantic clusters of peers which own autonomousrelational databases. The resulting mediated schemas can be used as global interfaces forrelevant queries. Active nodes are able to initiate the group schema creation process; whichproduces a mediated schema representative of nodes with similar semantics. Groupschemas are then propagated in the overlay and used as a single interface for relevantqueries. This increases both the quality and the quantity of the retrieved answers and …,Information Systems,2008,8
Approximate order-k Voronoi cells over positional streams,Kostas Patroumpas; Theofanis Minogiannis; Timos Sellis,Abstract Handling streams of positional updates from numerous moving objects has becomea challenging task for many monitoring applications. Several algorithms have been recentlyproposed for providing exact answers particularly to continuous range and k-nearestneighbor queries against current object positions. In this work; we introduce a processingtechnique for efficiently maintaining an approximate order-k Voronoi cell around a certainpoint of interest when all objects continuously change their locations. This heuristic caneasily provide a fairly reliable estimate of the k-nearest neighbors for any query point foundinside the constructed cell. We further extend our method to handle positional updates thatare not received concurrently for all objects; but instead remain valid for a specific timeinterval according to a sliding window model.

Spatio-temporal databases in the years ahead,Manolis Koubarakis; Yannis Theodoridis; Timos Sellis,CHOROCHRONOS has been a fruitful and enjoyable project. It contributed many innovativeideas in the areas of ontology and data modeling; query evalu- ation and prototype systems forspatio-temporal databases. Our ideas have al- ready found uses in various application domainssuch as moving object databases (see Chapter 4); environmental information systems (see theDedale application in Chapter 5); interactive multimedia applications and virtual worlds (seeChap- ter 8). CHOROCHRONOS has opened many avenues for research in spatio-temporaldatabases; but it also left us with lots of challenging research problems awaiting solution. Manyof these problems have already been emphasized in the conclud- ing sections of eachchapter; and there is no reason to repeat them here.1 As an epilogue to this book; we wouldlike to challenge the reader by discussing three important application areas and the role …,*,2003,8

An architecture for high performance engineering information systems,Nick Roussopoulos; Leo Mark; Timos Sellis; Christos Faloutsos,Commercially available database systems do not meet the information and processingneeds of design and manufacturing environments. A new generation of systems-engineering information systems-must be built to meet these needs. The architectural andcomputational aspects of such systems are addressed; and solutions are proposed. Theauthors argue that a mainframe-workstation architecture is needed to provide distributedfunctionality while ensuring high availability and low communication overhead; that explicitcontrol of metaknowledge is needed to support extendibility and evolution; that large rulebases are needed to make the knowledge of the systems active; and that incrementalcomputation models are needed to achieve the required performance of such engineeringinformation systems.,IEEE transactions on software engineering,1991,8
In the shadows we trust: a secure aggregation tolerant watermark for data streams,Arezou Soltani Panah; Ron van Schyndel; Timos Sellis; Elisa Bertino,In many applications such as sensor networks; e-healthcare and environmental monitoring;data is continuously streamed and combined from multiple resources in order to makedecisions based on the aggregated data streams. One major concern in these applicationsis assuring high trustworthiness of the aggregated data stream for correct decision-making.For example; an adversary may compromise a few data-sources and introduce false datainto the aggregated data-stream and cause catastrophic consequences. In this work; wepropose a novel method for verifying data integrity by embedding several signature codeswithin data streams known as digital watermarking. Therefore; the integrity of the datastreams can be verified by decoding the embedded signatures even as the data go throughmultiple stages of aggregation process.

Algorithms and criteria for diversification of news article comments,Giorgos Giannopoulos; Marios Koniaris; Ingmar Weber; Alejandro Jaimes; Timos Sellis,Abstract In this paper; we introduce an approach for diversifying user comments on newsarticles. We claim that; although content diversity suffices for the keyword search setting; asproven by existing work on search result diversification; it is not enough when it comes todiversifying comments of news articles. Thus; in our proposed framework; we definecomment-specific diversification criteria in order to extract the respective diversificationdimensions in the form of feature vectors. These criteria involve content similarity; sentimentexpressed within comments; named entities; quality of comments and combinations of them.Then; we apply diversification on comments; utilizing the extracted features vectors. Theoutcome of this process is a subset of the initial set that contains heterogeneous comments;representing different aspects of the news article; different sentiments expressed; different …,Journal of Intelligent Information Systems,2015,7

Subsuming multiple sliding windows for shared stream computation,Kostas Patroumpas; Timos Sellis,Abstract Shared evaluation of multiple user requests is an utmost priority for streamprocessing engines in order to achieve high throughput and provide timely results. Giventhat most continuous queries specify windowing constraints; we suggest a multi-levelscheme for concurrent evaluation of time-based sliding windows seeking for potentialsubsumptions among them. As requests may be registered or suspended dynamically; wedevelop a technique for choosing the most suitable embedding of a given window into agroup composed of multi-grained time frames already employed for other queries. Intuitively;the proposed methodology” clusters” windowed operators into common hierarchicalconstructs; thus drastically reducing the need for their separate evaluation. Our empiricalstudy confirms that such a scheme achieves dramatic memory savings with almost …,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2011,7

Implementation of a Prolog-INGRES interface,Subrata Ghosh; Chih-Chen Lin; Timos Sellis,Abstract This report describes a working prototype of a Prolog-INGRES interface based onexternal semantic query simplification. Semantic query simplification employs integrityconstraints enforced in a database system for reducing the number of tuple variables andterms in a relational query. This type of query simplifier is useful in providing very high leveluser interfaces to existing database systems. The system employes a graph theoreticapproach to simplify arbitrary conjunctive queries with inequalities. One very interestingfeature of the system is to provide meaningful error messages in case of an empty queryresult resulting from contradiction. In addition to data; rules are stored in the database aswell and are retrieved automatically if the Prolog program references them but they are notdefined in the Prolog rulebase.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1988,7

Evaluation techniques for generalized path pattern queries on XML data,Xiaoying Wu; Dimitri Theodoratos; Stefanos Souldatos; Theodore Dalamagas; Timos Sellis,Abstract Finding the occurrences of structural patterns in XML data is a key operation in XMLquery processing. Existing algorithms for this operation focus almost exclusively on pathpatterns or tree patterns. Current applications of XML require querying of data whosestructure is complex or is not fully known to the user; or integrating XML data sources withdifferent structures. These applications have motivated recently the introduction of querylanguages that allow a partial specification of path patterns in a query. In this paper; weconsider partial path queries; a generalization of path pattern queries; and we focus on theirefficient evaluation under the indexed streaming evaluation model. Our approach explicitlydeals with repeated labels (that is; multiple occurrences of the same label in a query).

The latter are used inorder to express in a declarative manner individual security and consistency requirements ofpeers; that cannot be ensured by default in the P2P environment. Peers achieve to handle ina transparent way data changes that come from local and remote actions and events. Thedistributed triggers are implemented as an extension of the active functionality of acentralized commercial DBMS. The language and execution semantics of distributedtriggers are integrated in the kernel of the DBMS such that the latter handles transparentlyand simultaneously both centralized and distributed triggers.

Window update patterns in stream operators,Kostas Patroumpas; Timos Sellis,Abstract Continuous queries applied over nonterminating data streams usually specifywindows in order to obtain an evolving–yet restricted–set of tuples and thus provide timelyresults. Among other typical variants; sliding windows are mostly employed in streamprocessing engines and several advanced techniques have been suggested for theirincremental evaluation. In this paper; we set out to study the existence of monotonic-relatedsemantics in windowing constructs towards a more efficient maintenance of their changingcontents. We investigate update patterns observed in common window variants as well astheir impact on windowed adaptations of typical operators (like selection; join oraggregation); offering more insight towards design and implementation of stream processingmechanisms.

A heuristic approach for checking containment of generalized tree-pattern queries,Pawel Placek; Dimitri Theodoratos; Stefanos Souldatos; Theodore Dalamagas; Timos Sellis,Abstract Query processing techniques for XML data have focused mainly on tree-patternqueries (TPQs). However; the need for querying XML data sources whose structure is verycomplex or not fully known to the user; and the need to integrate multiple XML data sourceswith different structures have driven; recently; the suggestion of query languages that relaxthe complete specification of a tree pattern. In order to implement the processing of suchlanguages in current DBMSs; their containment problem has to be efficiently solved. In thispaper; we consider a query language which generalizes TPQs by allowing the partialspecification of a tree pattern.

Point representation of spatial objects and query window extension: A new technique for spatial access methods,Emmanuel Stefanakis; Yannis Theodoridis; Timos Sellis; Yuk-Cheung Lee,The use of Spatial Access Methods (SAMs) in spatial database systems; such asGeographical Information Systems; is necessary to achieve efficient retrieval of data itemsaccording to their spatial properties. Existing SAMs organizing minimum bounding rectangle(MBR) approximations of spatial objects can be classified into four groups. Each group ischaracterized by the special technique adopted for managing MBRs:(a) Ordering;(b)Transformation;(c) Clipping; and (d) Overlapping. This paper introduces a new technique.The basic idea of this technique is to represent all spatial objects by their MBRs and furtherreduce them into points of the same dimensionality; so that any multidimensional PointAccess Method (PAM) may be used to support access. Essential for the functionality of thenew method is the query window extension. The results of both analytical and …,International Journal of Geographical Information Science,1997,6

A database implementation for large frame-based systems,Dimitrios Metaxas; Timos Sellis,A major requirement of database systems in engineering design and manufacturingapplications is support for storage and maintenance of complex objects. Frame-basedsystems are capable of modeling complex objects. However; many of these systems areimplemented in main memory. As the number of objects to be sorted far exceeds thecapacity of the main memory of a computer; such an implementation is often unusable. Animplementation of a frame-based system on top of the POSTGRES extensible databasesystem is presented. Such an implementation combines the advantages of databasemanagement and frame-based systems and allows for the development of largeengineering applications with minimal effort.,Data and Knowledge Systems for Manufacturing and Engineering; 1989.; Second International Conference on,1989,6
A hierarchical aggregation framework for efficient multilevel visual exploration and analysis,Nikos Bikakis; George Papastefanatos; Melina Skourla; Timos Sellis,Abstract Data exploration and visualization systems are of great importance in the Big Dataera; in which the volume and heterogeneity of available information make it difficult forhumans to manually explore and analyse data. Most traditional systems operate in an offlineway; limited to accessing preprocessed (static) sets of data. They also restrict themselves todealing with small dataset sizes; which can be easily handled with conventional techniques.However; the Big Data era has realized the availability of a great amount and variety of bigdatasets that are dynamic in nature; most of them offer API or query endpoints for onlineaccess; or the data is received in a stream fashion.

Location estimation using crowdsourced spatial relations,Georgios Skoumas; Dieter Pfoser; Anastasios Kyrillidis; Timos Sellis,Abstract The “crowd” has become a very important geospatial data provider. Specifically;nonexpert users have been providing a wealth of quantitative geospatial data (eg;geotagged tweets or photos; online). With spatial reasoning being a basic form of humancognition; textual narratives expressing user travel experiences (eg; travel blogs) wouldprovide an even bigger source of geospatial data. Narratives typically contain qualitativegeospatial data in the form of objects and spatial relations (eg;“St. John's church is to theNorth of the Acropolis museum.” The scope of this work is (i) to extract these spatial relationsfrom textual narratives;(ii) to quantify (model) them; and (iii) to reason about object locationsbased only on the quantified spatial relations.

Query relaxation across heterogeneous data sources,Verena Kantere; George Orfanoudakis; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Timos Sellis,Abstract The fundamental assumption for query rewriting in heterogeneous environments isthat the mappings used for the rewriting are complete; ie; every relation and attributementioned in the query is associated; through mappings; to relations and attributes in theschema of the source that the query is rewritten. In reality; it is rarely the case that suchcomplete sets of mappings exist between sources; and the presence of partial mappings isthe norm rather than the exception. So; practically; existing query answering algorithms failto generate any rewriting in the majority of cases. The question is then whether we cansomehow relax queries that cannot be rewritten as such (due to insufficient mappings); andwhether we can identify the interesting query relaxations; given the mappings at hand. In thispaper; we propose a technique to compute query relaxations of an input query that can …,Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2015,5

However users are frequently overloaded by thehigh rate of produced microblogging posts; which often carry no new information withrespect to other similar posts.

In thispaper we present our first cut approach on personalizing keyword query results on RDFdata. We adopt the well known Ranking SVM approach; by training ranking functions withRDF-specific training features. The training utilizes historical user feedback; in the form ofratings on the searched items. In order to do so; we join netflix and dbpedia datasets;obtaining a dataset where we can simulate personalized search scenarios for a number ofdiscrete users.

Efficient evaluation of generalized tree-pattern queries with same-path constraints,Xiaoying Wu; Dimitri Theodoratos; Stefanos Souldatos; Theodore Dalamagas; Timos Sellis,Abstract Querying XML data is based on the specification of structural patterns which inpractice are formulated using XPath. Usually; these structural patterns are in the form oftrees (Tree-Pattern Queries–TPQs). Requirements for flexible querying of XML dataincluding XML data from scientific applications have motivated recently the introduction ofquery languages that are more general and flexible than TPQs. These query languagescorrespond to a fragment of XPath larger than TPQs for which efficient non-main-memoryevaluation algorithms are not known. In this paper; we consider a query language; calledPartial Tree-Pattern Query (PTPQ) language; which generalizes and strictly contains TPQs.PTPQs represent a broad fragment of XPath which is very useful in practice. We show howPTPQs can be represented as directed acyclic graphs augmented with “same-path” …,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2009,5

Semantics of spatially-aware windows over streaming moving objects,Kostas Patroumpas; Timos Sellis,Several window constructs are usually specified in continuous queries over data streams asa means of limiting the amount of data processed each time and thus providing real-timeresponses. Current research has mostly focused on tackling the temporal volatility of thestream; overlooking other inherent features of incoming items. In this paper; we argue thatnovel window types; other than strictly temporal; can also prove adequate in providing finiteportions of multidimensional streams. We systematically examine the particular case ofspatiotemporal streams generated from moving point objects and we introduce acomprehensive classification of window variants useful in expressing the most commonoperations; such as range or nearest-neighbor search.

On the performance analysis of multi-dimensional R-tree-based data structures,Yannis Theodoridis; Timos Sellis,Abstract In this paper we report on our research in the field of multi-dimensional datastructures and specifically on the development of powerful analytical models that predict theperformance of a data structure. We present a model that estimates the performance of R-trees (and variants based on the original method) when a window query needs to beanswered. The proposed formula that estimates the number of disk accesses is a function ofdata properties only; namely; the amount of data and their density in the work space.Selectivity of a query is also estimated by transforming the analytical formula.

Spatio-temporal architecture-based framework for testing services in the cloud,Huai Liu; Maria Spichkova; Heinz W Schmidt; Timos Sellis; Matt Duckham,Abstract Increasingly; various services are deployed and orchestrated in the cloud to formglobal; large-scale systems. The global distribution; high complexity; and physicalseparation pose new challenges into the quality assurance of such complex services. Onemajor challenge is that they are intricately connected with the spatial and temporalcharacteristics of the domains they support. In this paper; we present our visions on theintegration of spatial and temporal logic into the system design and quality maintenance ofthe complex services in the cloud. We suggest that new paradigms should be proposed fordesigning software architecture that will particularly embed the spatial and temporalproperties of the cloud services; and new testing methodologies should be developed basedon architecture including spatio-temporal aspects. We also discuss several potential …,Proceedings of the ASWEC 2015 24th Australasian Software Engineering Conference,2015,4
RIPPLE: A Scalable Framework for Distributed Processing of Rank Queries.,George Tsatsanifos; Dimitris Sacharidis; Timos K Sellis,ABSTRACT We introduce a generic framework; termed RIPPLE; for processing rank queriesin decentralized systems. Rank queries are particularly challenging; since the search area(ie; which tuples qualify) cannot be determined by any peer individually. While our proposedframework is generic enough to apply to all decentralized structured systems; we show thatwhen coupled with a particular distributed hash table (DHT) topology; it offers guaranteedworst-case performance. Specifically; rank query processing in our framework exhibitstunable polylogarithmic latency; in terms of the network size. Additionally we provide ameans to trade-off latency for communication and processing cost. As a proof of concept; weapply RIPPLE for top-k query processing. Then; we consider skyline queries; anddemonstrate that our framework results in a method that has better latency and lower …,EDBT,2014,4
Approximate regional sequence matching for genomic databases,Thanasis Vergoulis; Theodore Dalamagas; Dimitris Sacharidis; Timos Sellis,Abstract Recent advances in computational biology have raised sequence matchingrequirements that result in new types of sequence database problems. In this work; weintroduce an important class of such problems; the approximate regional sequencematching (ARSM) problem. Given a data and a pattern sequence; an ARSM result is anapproximate occurrence of a region of the pattern in the data sequence under twoconditions. First; the region must contain a predetermined area of the pattern sequence;termed core. Second; the allowable deviation between the region of the pattern and itsoccurrence in the data sequence depends on the length of the region. We propose the PS-ARSM method that processes holistically the regions of a pattern; taking advantage of theiroverlaps to efficiently identify the ARSM results. Its performance is evaluated with respect …,The VLDB Journal,2012,4
GrouPeer: A system for clustering PDMSs,Verena Kantere; Dimos Bousounis; Timos Sellis,ABSTRACT Sharing structured data in a PDMS is hard due to schema heterogeneity andpeer autonomy. To overcome heterogeneity; peer databases employ mappings that partiallymatch local information to that of their direct neighbors. Traditionally; a query is successivelyrewritten along the propagation path on each peer. This results in gradual querydegradation and the inability to retrieve data pertinent to the original version; even frompeers that store such data. This demonstration presents GrouPeer; a system that overcomesthe query degradation problem and enables the dynamic clustering of the overlay accordingto the semantics of the peer data; utilizing normal query traffic. Peers are provided with amethodology that allows them to choose which rewritten version of a query to answer anddiscover remote information-rich sources. The demonstration illustrates the functionalities …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,4
A tool for mapping discovery over revealing schemas,Verena Kantere; Dimos Bousounis; Timos Sellis,Abstract In a world of wide-scale information sharing; the decentralized coordination has toconsolidate a variety of heterogeneity. Shared data are described in different formats; ie datastructures; values and schemas. Querying manifold such sources entails techniques that canbridge the data formats. Some of these techniques deal with producing mappings for theschemas of data. The existing techniques view complementary aspects of the schemamapping problem. Important ones; consider producing all the possible mappings for a pair ofschemas; insinuating any accompanying semantics in the mappings and adapting correctmappings as schemas evolve. Towards this end we have developed a solution that is fine-tuned for the discovery of mappings as schemas of autonomous sources are graduallyrevealed. In this demonstration we exhibit a new prototype tool that implements this …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,4
Evaluating “find a path” reachability queries,Panagiotis Bouros; Theodore Dalamagas; Spiros Skiadopoulos; Timos Sellis,Abstract. Graphs are used for modelling complex problems in many areas; such as spatialand road networks; social networks; Semantic Web. An important type of queries in graphsare reachability queries. In this paper; we consider the problem of answering “find a path”reachability queries. Given two nodes s and t in a graph; we want to find a path from s to t. Tothis end; we propose a novel representation of a graph as a set of paths that preserve thereachability information and introduce P-Index to index and provide efficient access in thisrepresentation. Then; we extend the depth-first search algorithm to work with the paths of therepresentation; instead of the graph edges; for evaluating “find a path” reachability queries.Finally; we conduct a preliminary set of experiments that indicate the advantage of exploitinga set of paths for efficiently answering “find a path” reachability queries instead of using …,Proceedings of the European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI) Workshop on Spatial and Temporal Reasoning (Patras; Greece),2008,4
Modeling and manipulating the structure of hierarchical schemas for the web,Theodore Dalamagas; Alexandra Meliou; Timos Sellis,Abstract The Semantic Web is the next step of the current Web where information willbecome more machine-understandable to support effective data discovery and integration.Hierarchical schemas; either in the form of tree-like structures (eg; DTDs; XML schemas); orin the form of hierarchies on a category/subcategory basis (eg; thematic hierarchies of portalcatalogs); play an important role in this task. They are used to enrich semantically theavailable information. Up to now; hierarchical schemas have been treated rather as sets ofindividual elements; acting as semantic guides for browsing or querying data. Under thatview; queries like “find the part of a portal catalog which is not present in another catalog”can be answered only in a procedural way; specifying which nodes to select and how to getthem. For this reason; we argue that hierarchical schemas should be treated as full …,Information Sciences,2008,4
Handling spatial data in distributed environments,Verena Kantere; Timos Sellis,Abstract Handling spatial data in distributed environments is an intriguing issue. Weconsider autonomous sites of an overlay network that are bound to specific spatialinformation. We assume that each site has partial knowledge of the overlay. Actually; thesites are aware of and can communicate with some other sites; according to the spatial datato which they are bound to. We are interested in routing queries about spatial data in suchoverlays; solely by exploiting local knowledge on sites; ie based on locality and directionalityin space. For such a system; we explore the parameters that can make search for any spatialinformation realizable and efficient. In this work we focus on the management of grid-partitioned space. In such a system there is a necessity for a mechanism that provides evenknowledge of space to each site of the overlay. We investigate two different ways to …,Proceedings of the 15th annual ACM international symposium on Advances in geographic information systems,2007,4
Integrity Constraints on Interactive Multimedia Scenarios,I Mirbel; B Pernici; T Sellis; M Vazirgiannis,Abstract When authoring multimedia scenarios; and in particular scenarios with userinteraction; where the sequence and time of occurrence of interactions is not predefined; it isdifficult to guarantee the consistency of the resulting scenarios. As a consequence; theexecution of the scenario may result in unexpected behavior or inconsistent use of media.The present paper proposes a methodology for checking the temporal integrity of InteractiveMultimedia Document (IMD) scenarios at authoring time at various levels. The IMD flow ismainly defined by the events occurring during the IMD session. Integrity checking consists ofa set of discrete steps; during which we transform the scenario into temporal constraintnetworks representing the constraints linking the different possible events in the scenario.Temporal constraint verification techniques are applied to verify the integrity of the …,Submitted for publication,1998,4

Anytime concurrent clustering of multiple streams with an indexing tree,Zhinoos Razavi Hesabi; Timos Sellis; Xiuzhen Zhang,Abstract With the advancement of data generation technologies such as sensor networks;multiple data streams are continuously generated. Clustering multiple data streams ischallenging as the requirement of clustering at anytime becomes more critical. We aim tocluster multiple data streams concurrently and in this paper we report our work in progress.ClusTree is an anytime clustering algorithm for a single stream. It uses a hierarchical treestructure to index micro-clusters; which are summary statistics for streaming data objects. Wedesign a dynamic; concurrent indexing tree structure that extends the ClusTree structure toachieve more granular micro clusters (summaries) of multiple streams at any time.

Batch processing of Top-k Spatial-textual Queries,Farhana M Choudhury; J Shane Culpepper; Timos Sellis,Abstract Top-k spatial-textual queries have received significant attention in the researchcommunity. Several techniques to efficiently process this class of queries are now widelyused in a variety of applications. However; the problem of how best to process multiplequeries efficiently is not well understood. Applications relying on processing continuousstreams of queries; and offline pre-processing of other queries could benefit from solutionsto this problem. In this work; we study practical solutions to efficiently process a set of top-kspatial-textual queries. We propose an efficient best-first algorithm for the batch processingof top-k spatial-textual queries that promotes shared processing and reduced I/O in eachquery batch. By grouping similar queries and processing them simultaneously; we are ableto demonstrate significant performance gains using publicly available datasets.,Second International ACM Workshop on Managing and Mining Enriched Geo-Spatial Data,2015,3

Tarcloud: A cloud-based platform to support mirna target prediction,Thanasis Vergoulis; Michail Alexakis; Theodore Dalamagas; Manolis Maragkakis; Artemis G Hatzigeorgiou; Timos Sellis,Abstract Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules that target protein coding genesand inhibit protein production. Since experimental identification of miRNA targets posesdifficulties; computational miRNA target prediction is one of the key means in decipheringthe role of microRNAs in development and disease. However; these computational methodsare CPU-intensive. For example; the predictions for a single miRNA molecule on the wholehuman genome according to a popular target prediction method require about 30 minutes.Such performance is a hindrance to the biologists' requirement for near-real time targetprediction. In this paper; we present TARCLOUD; a Cloud-based target prediction solutionbuilt on Microsoft's Azure platform.

Peer coordination through distributed triggers,Verena Kantere; Maher Manoubi; Iluju Kiringa; Timos Sellis; John Mylopoulos,Abstract This is a demonstration of data coordination in a peer data management systemthrough the employment of distributed triggers. The latter express in a declarative mannerindividual security and consistency requirements of peers; that cannot be ensured by defaultin the P2P environment. Peers achieve to handle in a transparent way data changes thatcome from local and remote actions and events. The distributed triggers are implemented asan extension of the active functionality of a centralized commercial DBMS. The languageand execution semantics of distributed triggers are integrated in the kernel of the DBMSsuch that the latter handles transparently and simultaneously both centralized anddistributed triggers. Moreover; the management of distributed triggers is associated with aset of peer acquaintance and termination protocols which are incorporated in the …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,3
Collaborative Ranking Function Training for Web Search Personalization,Giorgos Giannopoulos; Theodore Dalamagas; Timos Sellis,ABSTRACT In this paper; we present a framework for improving the ranking function trainingand the re-ranking process for web search personalization. Our method is based on utilizingclickthrough data from several users in order to create multiple ranking functions thatcorrespond to different topic areas. Those ranking functions are combined each time a userposes a new query in order to produce a new ranking; taking into account the similarity ofthe query with each of the topic areas mentioned before. We compare our method with thetraditional approaches of training one ranking function per user; or per group of users andwe show preliminary experimental results.,Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop PersDB,2009,3

Semantic grouping of social networks in p2p database settings,Verena Kantere; Dimitrios Tsoumakos; Timos Sellis,Abstract Social network structures map network links to semantic relations betweenparticipants in order to assist in efficient resource discovery and information exchange. Inthis work; we propose a scheme that automates the process of creating schema synopsesfrom semantic clusters of peers which own autonomous relational databases. The resultingmediated schemas can be used as global interfaces for relevant queries. As ourexperimental evaluations show; this method increases both the quality and the quantity ofthe retrieved answers and allows for faster discovery of semantic groups by joining peers.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2007,3

Reusing classical query rewriting in P2P databases,Verena Kantere; Timos Sellis,Abstract Sharing of structured data in P2P overlays is a challenging problem; especially inthe absence of a global schema. The nature of structured data stored in the overlay enforcesstrict methods of querying. However; the intention of the user is usually to obtain informationthat is semantically relevant to the posed query and not information that strictly complies tostructural constraints. The rewriting mechanisms for structured data were initially developedfor tasks such as data integration and mediation; which by nature dictate strict consistency.In this work we propose ways of preprocessing a query in order to produce a version thatcan be rewritten in the classical way. We propose preprocessing guidelines that produce anew query that is most similar to the initially posed query. Accordingly; we discussthoroughly query similarity aspects from a structural point of view. Finally; we present an …,*,2007,3
DOMProxy: Enabling dynamic-content front-end web caching,Manolis Veliskakis; John Roussos; Panos Georgantas; Timos Sellis,Proxy caching is a commonly accepted methodology used to reduce Internet traffic;decrease back-end related user delays; and generally improve Web performance.Nevertheless; it seems to be inadequate when it comes to caching dynamic Web pages; dueto their low degree of reusability and strong dependency on the back-end site infrastructure.In order to overcome these drawbacks we present DOMProxy (dynamic objects managerproxy); a new proxy architecture that enables front-end Web caching for dynamicallygenerated Web pages. Instead of caching Web pages produced dynamically or theirfragments; the proposed architecture provides methods for" caching" their generationprocess. This is achieved by caching both the applications and the back-end data contentthat are used to create dynamic Web pages.

Metadata and data warehouse quality,Matthias Jarke; Maurizio Lenzerini; Yannis Vassiliou; Panos Vassiliadis,Abstract In the traditional view; data warehouses provide large-scale caches of historic data.They sit between (a) information sources gained externally or through online transactionprocessing systems (OLTP) and (b) decision support or data mining queries following thevision of online analytic processing (OLAP). Three main arguments have been put forward infavor of this caching approach: 1. Performance and safety considerations. The concurrencycontrol methods of most DBMS do not react well to a mix of short update transactions (as inOLTP) and OLAP queries that typically search a large portion of the database. Moreover; theOLTP systems are often critical for the operation of the organization and must not be indanger of corruption by other applications. 2. Logical interpretability problems.

The tool may be used both for prototyping and verificationof multimedia presentations or spatiotemporal compositions in general. Regarding theauthoring phase; emphasis was put on the flexible definition of spatial and temporalrelationships of the participating entities.

Towards the design of a DBMS repository for the application domain of GIS,Emmanuel Stefanakis; Timos Sellis,Abstract. Much attention has been devoted in the past to support classes of applicationswhich are not well served by conventional database systems. Focusing on the applicationdomain of geographic information systems (GISs); several architectural approaches havebeen proposed to implement commercial or prototype systems and satisfy the urgent needsfor operational geographic data handling. However; those systems suffer from severallimitations; because either they perform lots of processing on an application layer; which lieson the top of the database management system (DBMS) repositories; or the underlying datamodels do not accommodate all dimensions of geographic data (ie; thematic; spatial;temporal; quality and multimedia).

A frame-based model for large manufacturing databases,Dimitris Metaxas; Timos Sellis,Abstract A major requirement of database systems in engineering design and manufacturingapplications is support for storage and maintenance of complex objects. Frame basedsystems are capable of modeling complex objects. However; many of these systems areimplemented in main memory. As the number of objects to be stored far exceeds thecapacity of the main memory of a computer; such an implementation is often unusable.Therefore; new ways to model and manipulate large manufacturing databases are needed.In this paper we present an implementation of a frame based system on top of thePOSTGRES extensible database system. Such an implementation combines theadvantages of database management and frame based systems and allows for thedevelopment of large manufacturing database applications with minimal effort.,Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing,1991,3

Our goal is to efficiently find the top-k trajectories by computing spatial and textualsimilarity at each point. The computational cost for pointwise matching is significantly higherthan previous approaches. Therefore; we introduce an incremental pruning baseline andexplore how to adaptively tune our approach; introducing a gap-based optimization and anovel twolevel threshold algorithm to improve efficiency.

In this study; we present a learning method torecognize such behaviours from smartphone sensor input which can be considered as atype of multi-channel time series. Unlike other learning methods; this Genetic Programming(GP) based method does not require pre-processing and manually designed features.Hence domain knowledge and manual coding can be significantly reduced by thisapproach. This method can achieve accurate real-time recognition of risky driver behaviourson raw input and can outperform classic learning methods operating on features. In additionthis GP-based method is general and suitable for detecting multiple types of driverbehaviours.,Australasian Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2013,2

Search behavior-driven training for result re-ranking,Giorgos Giannopoulos; Theodore Dalamagas; Timos Sellis,Abstract In this paper we present a framework for improving the ranking learning process;taking into account the implicit search behaviors of users. Our approach is query-centric.That is; it examines the search behaviors induced by queries and groups together querieswith similar such behaviors; forming search behavior clusters. Then; it trains multiple rankingfunctions; each one corresponding to one of these clusters. The trained models are finallycombined to re-rank the results of each new query; taking into account the similarity of thequery with each cluster. The main idea is that similar search behaviors can be detected andexploited for result re-ranking by analysing results into feature vectors; and clustering them.The experimental evaluation shows that our method improves the ranking quality of a stateof the art ranking model.,International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries,2011,2

Conceptual synopses of semantics in social networks sharing structured data,Verena Kantere; Maria-Eirini Politou; Timos Sellis,Abstract We are interested in the problem of data sharing in overlay networks that have asocial structure; ie participants are linked and exchange data with others wrt the similarity oftheir data semantics. In this paper we propose a methodology to produce conceptualsynopses for the semantics that are encapsulated in the schemas of relational data that areshared in a social network. These synopses are constructed solely based on semantics thatcan be deduced from schemas themselves with some optional additional conceptualclarifications. The produced synopses represent in a concentrated way the currentsemantics. Existing or new participants can refer to these synopses in order to determinetheir interest in the network.

Boosting the ranking function learning process using clustering,Giorgos Giannopoulos; Theodore Dalamagas; Magdalini Eirinaki; Timos Sellis,Abstract As the Web continuously grows; the results returned by search engines are toomany to review. Lately; the problem of personalizing the ranked result list based on userfeedback has gained a lot of attention. Such approaches usually require a big amount ofuser feedback on the results; which is used as training data. In this work; we present amethod that overcomes this issue by exploiting all search results; both rated and unrated; inorder to train a ranking function. Given a small initial set of user feedback for some searchresults; we first perform clustering on all results returned by the search. Based on theclusters created; we extend the initial set of rated results; including new; unrated results.Then; we use a popular training method (Ranking SVM) to train a ranking function using theexpanded set of results.

A reinforcement learning approach for adaptive query processing,Kostas Tzoumas; Timos Sellis; Christian S Jensen,Abstract In adaptive query processing; query plans are improved at runtime by means offeedback. In the very flexible approach based on so-called eddies; query execution istreated as a process of routing tuples to the query operators that combine to compute aquery. This makes it possible to alter query plans at the granularity of tuples. Further; thecomplex task of searching the query plan space for a suitable plan now resides in therouting policies used. These policies must adapt to the changing execution environment andmust converge at a near-optimal plan when the environment stabilizes. This paper advancesadaptive query processing in two respects. First; it proposes a general framework for therouting problem that may serve the same role for adaptive query processing as does theframework of search in query plan space for conventional query processing.

Modeling and manipulating the structure of portal catalogs,Theodore Dalamagas; Alexandra Meliou; Timos Sellis,Abstract Portal catalog sites are Web information nodes that provide querying and browsingcapabilities on data organized in a thematic hierarchy. Up to now; portal catalogs have notbeen treated as full-fledged objects so as to allow for their manipulation. A major challengeis thus to complement catalog search and browsing with operations that manipulatestructural information from similar vertical portal catalog sites; that is sites of a specificsubject or domain. This work proposes models and operators that allow for structuralmanipulation of vertical portal catalog sites; considering them as first-class citizens in theinformation search space.

STEDEL: A Language For Interactive Spatiotemporal Compositions.,Iosif Lazaridis; Michalis Vazirgiannis; Timos K Sellis,ABSTRACT The two fundamental challenges in Virtual Reality over the WWW are (i) tofacilitate the process of creating convincing; non-trivial; highly interactive and maintainablecontent and (ii) to efficiently deliver this content to the client with QoS guarantees. This paperfocuses on the first challenge: we have created a data model for spatio-temporalcompositions that allows us to define relative placement of objects in a virtual world bymeans of their geometric characteristics (Joints). Thus; we model spatial relationships ofobjects at a higher level of abstraction than simple co-ordinate system transformations. Wealso define the behavior of objects in a declarative way; by means of Event-Condition-Actionrules. Events and Actions can be synthesized by a set of operators for the creation of reallycomplex behavior. Our model has been realized in prototype form in Spatio-Temporal …,ICME,2001,2
Reminiscences in influential papers,Richard Snodgrass,Fundamentally; we are in this business to embrace the novel concepts that intrigue anddelight us. These insights are generated or discovered by one or a few; then somehowpropagated through the fabric of the intellectual community; via publication; presentation;and informal conversation. However; the transference is often more accidental thanintentional. The common model is of a researcher having a question and searching for thepaper that answers that question. Seemingly just as prevalent is a haphazard event. Theresearcher comes across a paper that touches something deep inside; triggering a radicalrestructuring of their mental model and allowing them to see things in a new light. Timing isimportant: often that paper or interaction would not have had such a profound effect ifencountered earlier or later.

Shrink: Distance preserving graph compression,Amin Sadri; Flora D Salim; Yongli Ren; Masoomeh Zameni; Jeffrey Chan; Timos Sellis,Abstract The ever increasing size of graphs makes them difficult to query and store. In thispaper; we present Shrink; a compression method that reduces the size of the graph whilepreserving the distances between the nodes. The compression is based on the iterativemerging of the nodes. During each merging; a system of linear equations is solved to definenew edge weights in a way that the new weights have the least effect on the distances.Merging nodes continues until the desired size for the compressed graph is reached. Thecompressed graph; also known as the coarse graph; can be queried withoutdecompression. As the complexity of distance-based queries such as shortest path queriesis highly dependent on the size of the graph; Shrink improves the performance in terms oftime and storage. Shrink not only provides the length of the shortest path but also …,Information Systems,2017,1
Crowdsourced Coverage as a Service: Two-Level Composition of Sensor Cloud Services,Azadeh Ghari Neiat; Athman Bouguettaya; Timos Sellis; Sajib Mistry,We present a new two-level composition model for crowdsourced Sensor-Cloud servicesbased on dynamic features such as spatio-temporal aspects. The proposed approach isdefined based on a formal Sensor-Cloud service model that abstracts the functionality andnon-functional aspects of sensor data on the cloud in terms of spatio-temporal features. Aspatio-temporal indexing technique based on the 3D R-tree to enable fast identification ofappropriate Sensor-Cloud services is proposed. A novel quality model is introduced thatconsiders dynamic features of sensors to select and compose Sensor-Cloud services. Thequality model defines Coverage as a Service which is formulated as a composition ofcrowdsourced Sensor-Cloud services. We present two new QoS-aware spatio-temporalcomposition algorithms to select the optimal composition plan. Experimental results …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,1
Towards an asynchronous aggregation-capable watermark for end-to-end protection of big data streams,Arezou Soltani Panah; Ron van Schyndel; Timos Sellis,Abstract We consider how an untrusted data aggregator can be assessed over multiple datastreams. The aggregator could be the sink node in a sensor network where all the sensorydata are gathered; or a smart-meter responsible for computing power measurements of agroup of households; or any other entity that is basically in charge of answering aggregationqueries such as average or summation in a data streaming environment. In theseapplications; important decisions are made based on the aggregated results and therefore; itis vitally important to investigate the authenticity and integrity of aggregated values. Onepossible approach for solving this problem is marking the data before sending it out to theaggregators (ie marked at the point of origin) such that the existence of those marks could beverified subsequently after the aggregation process. Our goal is to produce hidden marks …,Future Generation Computer Systems,2017,1
Edge Labeling Schemes for Graph Data,Oshini Goonetilleke; Danai Koutra; Timos Sellis; Kewen Liao,ABSTRACT Given a directed graph; how should we label both its outgoing and incomingedges to achieve be er disk locality and support neighborhood-related edge queries? In thispaper; we answer this question with edge labeling schemes GR and FIO; to label edges withintegers based on the premise that edges should be assigned integer identi ers exploitingtheir consecutiveness to a maximum degree. We provide extensive experimental analysison real-world graphs; and compare our proposed schemes with other labeling methodsbased on assigning edge IDs in the order of insertion or even randomly; as traditionallydone. We show that our methods are e cient and result in signi cantly improved query I/Operformance; including with indexes built on directed a ributed edges. is ultimately leads tofaster execution of neighborhood-related edge queries.,Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management; ser.

Most influential community search over large social networks,Jianxin Li; Xinjue Wang; Ke Deng; Xiaochun Yang; Timos Sellis; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Detecting social communities in large social networks provides an effective way to analyzethe social media users' behaviors and activities. It has drawn extensive attention from bothacademia and industry. One essential aspect of communities in social networks is outerinfluence which is the capability to spread internal information of communities to externalusers. Detecting the communities of high outer influence has particular interest in a widerange of applications; eg; Ads trending analytics; social opinion mining and newspropagation pattern discovery. However; the existing detection techniques largely ignore theouter influence of the communities. To fill the gap; this work investigates the Most InfluentialCommunity Search problem to disclose the communities with the highest outer influences.We firstly propose a new community model; maximal kr-Clique community; which has …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on,2017,1
Monitoring the top-m rank aggregation of spatial objects in streaming queries,Farhana M Choudhury; Zhifeng Bao; J Shane Culpepper; Timos Sellis,In this paper; we propose and study the problem of top-m rank aggregation of spatial objectsin streaming queries; where; given a set of objects O; a stream of spatial queries (kNN orrange); the goal is to report the m objects with the highest aggregate rank. The rank of anobject with respect to an individual query is computed based on its distance from the querylocation; and the aggregate rank is computed from all of the individual rank orderings. Inorder to solve this problem; we show how to upper and lower bound the rank of an object forany unseen query. Then we propose an approximation solution to continuously monitor thetop-m objects efficiently; for which we design an Inverted Rank File (IRF) index to guaranteethe error bound of the solution. In particular; we propose the notion of safe ranking todetermine whether the current result is still valid or not when new queries arrive; and …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on,2017,1
Monitoring the top-m aggregation in a sliding window of spatial queries,Farhana M Choudhury; Zhifeng Bao; J Shane Culpepper; Timos Sellis,Abstract: In this paper; we propose and study the problem of top-m rank aggregation ofspatial objects in streaming queries; where; given a set of objects O; a stream of spatialqueries (kNN or range); the goal is to report m objects with the highest aggregate rank. Therank of an object wrt an individual query is computed based on its distance from the querylocation; and the aggregate rank is computed from all of the individual rank orderings.Solutions to this fundamental problem can be used to monitor the popularity of spatialobjects; which in turn can provide new analytical tools for spatial data. Our work drawsinspiration from three different domains: rank aggregation; continuous queries and spatialdatabases.

Mapping discovery over revealing schemas,Verena Kantere; Dimos Bousounis; Timos Sellis,In a world of wide-scale information sharing; data are described in different formats; ie datastructures; values and schemas. Querying such sources entails techniques that can bridgethe data formats. Some existing techniques deal with schema mapping and viewcomplementary aspects of the problem. Important ones; consider producing all the possiblemappings for a pair of schemas; insinuating accompanying semantics in the mappings andadapting correct mappings as schemas evolve. In this work; we consider the problem ofdiscovering mappings as schemas of autonomous sources are gradually revealed. Using asan example setting an overlay of peer databases; we present a schema mapping solutionthat discovers correct mappings as peer schemas are gradually revealed to remote peers.Mapping discovery is schema-centric and incorporates new semantics as they are …,International Journal of Cooperative Information Systems,2015,1
On crowdsensed data acquisition using multi-dimensional point processes,Saket Sathe; Timos Sellis; Karl Aberer,Crowdsensing applications are increasing at a tremendous rate. In crowdsensing; mobilesensors (humans; vehicle-mounted sensors; etc.) generate streams of information that isused for inferring high-level phenomena of interest (eg; traffic jams; air pollution). Unliketraditional sensor network data; crowdsensed data has a highly skewed spatio-temporaldistribution caused largely due to the mobility of sensors [1]. Thus; designing systems thatcan mitigate this effect by acquiring crowdsensed at a fixed spatio-temporal rate are needed.In this paper we propose using multi-dimensional point processes (MDPPs); a mathematicalmodeling tool that can be effectively used for performing this data acquisition task.,Data Engineering Workshops (ICDEW); 2015 31st IEEE International Conference on,2015,1

Emergency Management Support by Spatial Reasoning,Jan Olaf Blech; Heinz Schmidt; Timos Sellis,Abstract Emergency management benefits from techniques such as the eCall that allow anautomatic transmission of vehicle data and location to initiate response operations in case ofan accident. Such operations may comprise the deployment of ambulances and recoveryvehicles. Based on available data one can decide on the type of ambulances; police andother recovery vehicles needed; on prioritization in case of multiple events and on strategiesfor an efficient management of available resources. Automatically handling these constraintswhich can go beyond traditional database operations and deriving decisions is achallenging problem. In this paper; we describe how our existing spatio-temporal descriptionand reasoning framework based on formal methods can be used to facilitate decisions inemergency recovery situations in combination with indexing of available information.,*,2015,1

In the past few years the problemhas been studied extensively; and a great number of external memory algorithms have beenproposed. We thoroughly study the most important scan-based methods; which perform anumber of passes over the database in order to extract the skyline. Although thesealgorithms are specifically designed to operate in external memory; there are manyimplementation details which are neglected; as well as several design choices resulting indifferent flavors for these basic methods. We perform an extensive experimental evaluationusing real and synthetic data. We conclude that specific design choices can have asignificant impact on performance.

Prioritized evaluation of continuous moving queries over streaming locations,Kostas Patroumpas; Timos Sellis,Abstract Existing approaches to the management of streaming positional updates generallyassume that all active user requests have equal importance; ignoring the possibility of anypriorities concerning delivery of results in mission-critical mobile applications. Queryprioritization could be assigned either explicitly after users' preferences or implicitly by theprocessing engine itself to better regulate system load. In this work; we specifically examinepriority-based evaluation of ranked continuous range queries against locations of movingobjects streaming into a central processor.

Advanced ad hoc star query processing,Nikos Karayannidis; Aris Tsois; Timos Sellis,Abstract Star queries are the most prevalent kind of queries in data warehousing; onlineanalytical processing (OLAP); and business intelligence applications. Thus; there is animperative need for efficiently processing star queries. To this end; a new class of fact tableorganizations has emerged that exploits path-based surrogate keys in order to hierarchicallycluster the fact table data of a star schema. In the context of these new organizations; starquery processing changes radically. In this chapter; we present a complete abstractprocessing plan that captures all the necessary steps in evaluating such queries overhierarchically clustered fact tables. Furthermore; we realize the abstract operations in termsof physical operations over the CUBE File data structure. Finally we discuss star queryoptimization issues over the presented abstract plan.,Data Warehouses and OLAP: Concepts; Architectures and Solutions: Concepts; Architectures and Solutions,2006,1

An Efficient Cost Model for Spatial Joins Using R-trees,Yannis Theodoridis; Emmanuel Stefanakis; Timos Sellis,ABSTRACT Spatial join is one of the fundamental operations in a Spatial Data BaseManagement System. Recently; the family of R-tree-based data structures has been adoptedto support the execution of spatial joins. This paper introduces an analytical model thatefficiently estimates the cost (in terms of disk accesses) of a spatial join query between twospatial datasets. The proposed model is based on an analytical formula that estimates thecost of the range query using R-trees. In addition; comparison results are presented whichshow the accuracy of the analytical estimations when compared to actual tests on bothsynthetic and real datasets. It turns out that the relative error rarely exceeds 15% for allcombinations.,*,1997,1

Experiments on the concurrent rule execution in database systems,Alex Delis; Louiqa Raschid; T Sellis,Issues pertinent to the concurrent execution of rules in a database management system(DBMS) are studied. Rules are modeled as database transactions. As such; they shouldfollow serializability as their correctness criterion for execution. Rule execution has theadditional constraint that the rules; conditions must be true in the database for the actionsthat execute; and rules must fail when their conditions are not true any longer. Based on thisobservation; two locking-based protocols are discussed. Information on the possibleconflicts between conditions and actions of rules is used to provide greater concurrentaccess to the relations; based on a new lock paradigm. A simulation testbed was developedin order to study the rule features and database characteristics that play an important role inthe performance of concurrent production rule execution.,Tools with Artificial Intelligence; 1992.

Extended database logic: Complex objects and deduction,John Grant; Timos K Sellis,Abstract Database logic was proposed in the late 1970s as a generalization of first-orderlogic in order to deal in a uniform manner with relational; hierarchic and network databases.At about the same time; the study of deductive (relational) databases has become important;primarily as a vehicle for the development of expert database systems. Also; prolog; themain logic-programming language; has become prominent for many applications in artificialintelligence and its connections with deductive databases have been investigated. Althoughthe relational model provides a suitable framework for traditional; essentially data-processing applications; several researchers have found the need for complex objects innewer applications; such as engineering databases.

Performance issues in the binary relationship model,Chih-Chen Lin; Leo Mark; Timos Sellis; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract In this paper we propose to use the Binary Relationship Model not only in thelogical; but also in the physical level. At the logical level we propose and analyze a queryoptimization algorithm. The major optimization issue is to find an optimized join sequence forchain queries. A branch-and-bound search algorithm with dynamic programming is used inthe search for such a sequence. At the physical level we propose to store the binaryrelations using multiattribute hashing. We develop a join algorithm which takes advantage ofthe clustering that multiattribute hashing achieves; and derive analytical formulas to predictits performance.,Data & knowledge engineering,1989,1
Quality-Oriented Optimization of the Design of the Global Data Warehouse,Panos Vassiliadis; Spyros Ligoudistianos; Timos Sellis; Dimitri Theodoratos,Abstract Decision analysts require from data warehouse systems to provide the highest levelof data and service quality. The Data Staging Area (DSA) is the central layer of the datawarehouse architecture that integrates data from the different enterprise sources. The DSAcan be seen as a set of materialized views defined over relations that are stored in remoteheterogeneous database systems. The DSA design problem is the problem of selecting anoptimal set of views to materialize that answer a given set of queries. In this paper we extendprevious approaches to the problem; by treating the problem formally; with respect tospecific; objective quality factors. Moreover; by using already existing cost-based DSAdesign methods; we incorporate data quality factors in the cost formulae of these methods inorder to be taken under consideration during the selection of the final data warehouse …,Proceedings of the 8th Panhellenic Conference on Informatics,*,1

Supporting Large-scale Geographical Visualization in a Multi-granularity Way,Mingzhao Li; Zhifeng Bao; Farhana Choudhury; Timos Sellis,Abstract Urban data (eg; real estate data; crime data) often have multiple attributes whichare highly geography-related. With the scale of data increases; directly visualizing millions ofindividual data points on top of a map would overwhelm users' perceptual and cognitivecapacity and lead to high latency when users interact with the data. In this demo; we presentConvexCubes; a system that supports interactive visualization of large-scalemultidimensional urban data in a multi-granularity way. Comparing to state-of-the-artvisualization-driven data structures; it exploits real-world geographic semantics (eg; country;state; city) rather than using grid-based aggregation. Instead of calculating everything ondemand; ConvexCubes utilizes existing visualization results to efficiently support differentkinds of user interactions; such as zooming & panning; filtering and granularity control …,Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2018,*
Capturing the Spatiotemporal Evolution in Road Traffic Networks,Tarique Anwar; Chengfei Liu; Hai L Vu; Md Saiful Islam; Timos Sellis,The urban road networks undergo frequent traffic congestions during the peak hours andaround the city centre. Capturing the spatiotemporal evolution of the congestion scenario inreal-time in an urban-scale can aid in developing smart traffic management systems; andguiding commuters in making informed decision about route choice. The congestionscenario is often represented by a set of distinguishable network partitions that havehomogeneous level of congestion inside them but are heterogeneous to others. Due to thedynamic nature of traffic; these partitions evolve with time in terms of their structure andlocation. In this paper; we propose a comprehensive framework to capture the evolution byincrementally updating the partitions in an efficient manner using a two-layer approach. Thephysical layer maintains a set of small-sized road network building blocks in a fine …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2018,*
Reverse k Nearest Neighbor Search over Trajectories,Sheng Wang; Zhifeng Bao; Shane Culpepper; Timos Sellis; Gao Cong,GPS enables mobile devices to continuously provide new opportunities to improve our dailylives. For example; the data collected in applications created by Uber or Public TransportAuthorities can be used to plan transportation routes; estimate capacities; and proactivelyidentify low coverage areas. In this paper; we study a new kind of query Reverse k NearestNeighbor Search over Trajectories (RkNNT); which can be used for route planning andcapacity estimation. Given a set of existing routes DR; a set of passenger transitions DT; anda query route Q; an RkNNT query returns all transitions that take Q as one of its k nearesttravel routes. To solve the problem; we first develop an index to handle dynamic trajectoryupdates; so that the most up-to-date transition data are available for answering an RkNNTquery. Then we introduce a filter refinement framework for processing RkNNT queries …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,*
Geo-social influence spanning maximization,Jianxin Li; Timos Sellis; J Shane Culpepper; Zhenying He; Chengfei Liu; Junhu Wang,Influence maximization is a recent but well-studied problem which helps identify a small setof users that are most likely to “influence” the maximum number of users in a social network.The problem has attracted a lot of attention as it provides a way to improve marketing;branding; and product adoption. However; existing studies rarely consider the physicallocations of the users; but location is an important factor in targeted marketing. In this paper;we propose and investigate the problem of influence maximization in location-aware socialnetworks; or; more generally; Geo-social Influence Spanning Maximization. Given a query $q $ composed of a region $ R $; a regional acceptance rate $\rho $; and an integer $ k $ asa seed selection budget; our aim is to find the maximum geographic spanning regions(MGSR). We refer to this as the MGSR problem. Our approach differs from previous work …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,*
Automated density-based clustering of spatial urban data for interactive data exploration,Erica Rosalina; Flora D Salim; Timos Sellis,This paper presents a method to automatically estimate parameters for density-basedclustering based on data distribution. It also includes several techniques for visualizing theclusters over a map; useful for interactive data exploration. The proposed method enablesparameter estimation to automatically adapt to multiple resolutions; allowing the clusters tobe recomputed and visualized interactively at query time with the changes of zoom levelsand panning of the map. We apply a voting scheme with existing cluster indices to rank theclustering results. The framework of multi-resolution density-based clustering andvisualization is implemented and evaluated using a real-world road crash datasets.,Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS); 2017 IEEE Conference on,2017,*
Continuous summarization over microblog threads,Liangjun Song; Ping Zhang; Zhifeng Bao; Timos Sellis,Abstract With the dramatic growth of social media users; microblogs are created and sharedat an unprecedented rate. The high velocity and large volumes of short text posts(microblogs) bring redundancies and noise; making it hard for users and analysts to elicituseful information. In this paper; we formalize the problem from a summarization angle–Continuous Summarization over Microblog Threads (CSMT); which considers three facets:information gain of the microblog dialogue; diversity; and temporal information. Thissummarization problem is different from the classic ones in two aspects:(i) It is consideredover a large-scale; dynamic data with high updating frequency;(ii) the context betweenmicroblogs are taken into account. We first prove that the CSMT problem is NP-hard. Thenwe propose a greedy algorithm with (1-1/e) performance guarantee.

Joint top-k subscription query processing over microblog threads,Liangjun Song; Zhifeng Bao; Farhana Choudhury; Timos Sellis,Abstract With an increasing amount of social media messages; users on the social platformsstart to seek ideas and opinions by themselves. Publishers/Subscriber queries (akapub/sub) are utilized by these who want to actively read and consume web data. Socialmedia platforms give people opportunities to communicate with others. The social propertyis also important in the pub/sub while currently no other works have ever considered thisproperty. Also; platforms like Twitter only allow users to post a short message which causesthe short-text problem: single posts lack of contextual information. Therefore; we propose themicroblog thread as the minimum information unit to capture social and textual relevantinformation. However; this brings several challenges to this problem: 1.

Efficient Identification of the Highest Diversity Gain Object,Dimitris Sacharidis; Timos Sellis,Abstract Diversification has recently attracted a lot of attention; as a means to retrieve objectsthat are both relevant to a query and sufficiently dissimilar to each other. Since it is acomputationally expensive problem; greedy techniques that iteratively identify the mostpromising objects are typically used. We focus on the sub-task within one iteration andformalize it as the highest diversity gain problem. We show that it is possible to optimallysolve such problems; by appropriately defining a novelty function and identifying the objectwith the highest novelty. Furthermore; we are able to determine parts of the search spacethan cannot contain promising objects. Based on these results; we propose a greedydiversification algorithm that iteratively invokes a procedure to determine the most novelobject. This procedure uses an index to guide the search towards promising objects; and …,International Workshop on Information Search; Integration; and Personalization,2014,*

Publishing Diachronic Life Science Linked Data.,Katerina Gkirtzou; Thanasis Vergoulis; Artemis G Hatzigeorgiou; Timos K Sellis; Theodore Dalamagas,Abstract. The Linked Data paradigm involves practices to publish; share; and connect dataon the Web. Thus; it is a compelling approach for the dissemination and re-use of scientificdata; realizing the vision of the so-called Linked Science. However; by just converting legacyscientific data as Linked Data; we do not fully meet the requirements of data re-use.Scientific data is evolving data. To ensure re-use and allow exploitation and validation ofscientific results; several challenges related to scientific data dynamics should be tackled. Inthis paper; we deal with the publication of diachronic life science linked data. We propose achange model based on RDF to capture versioned entities. Based on this model we convertlegacy data from biological databases as diachronic linked data.

Evaluating Path Queries over Frequently Updated Route Collections TR-2010-6,Panagiotis Bouros; Dimitris Sacharidis; Theodore Dalamagas; Spiros Skiadopoulos; Timos Sellis,Abstract The recent advances in the infrastructure of Geographic Information Systems (GIS);and the proliferation of GPS technology; have resulted in the abundance of geodata in theform of sequences of points of interest (POIs); waypoints etc. We refer to sets of suchsequences as route collections. In this work; we consider path queries on frequently updatedroute collections: given a route collection and two points ns and nt; a path query returns apath; ie; a sequence of points; that connects ns to nt. We introduce two path query evaluationparadigms that enjoy the benefits of search algorithms (ie; fast index maintenance) whileutilizing transitivity information to terminate the search sooner. Efficient indexing schemesand appropriate updating procedures are introduced. An extensive experimental evaluationverifies the advantages of our methods compared to conventional graph-based search.,*,2010,*

INTERACTION ISSUES AND DECISION SUPPORT IN INTELLIGENT GIS,E Stefanakis; T Sellis,Summary The synergy of commercial GIS packages with other specialist systems andmethodologies is usually imposed in order to build systems able to meet the requirements ofadvanced geographic applications. On the other hand; in order for a computer system to beusable by humans; it should provide an appropriate user interface. Recent experienceshows that this can only be achieved if end-users are involved in all stages of the systemdesign process. The present study examines the issues regarding the connection of GIS toother software systems and with human users; towards the development of more intelligentand usable systems; called Intelligent GIS. Several prototype systems developed for differentapplication domains at variable architectures and user interfaces are also presented.,ADVANCED GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS-Volume I,2009,*

Moreover; the interpretation and suitability of data may depend on changingconditions; eg the current position of the user or the media he is using (laptop; mobile; PDA;etc.). To cater for such ambiguous situations the information provider needs to specify thecontext under which information becomes relevant. Conversely; information users canspecify their own current context when requesting for data in order to denote the part that isrelevant to their specific situation.

PatMan: A visual database system to manipulate path patterns and data in hierarchical catalogs,Aggeliki Koukoutsaki; Theodore Dalamagas; Timos Sellis; Panagiotis Bouros,Abstract. Hierarchical structures are a way to organize and enrich semantically the availableinformation on the Web. Popular examples of such structures are the product catalogs of e-market stores; which provide data (ie products) organized in thematic hierarchies on acategory/subcategory basis. Users can navigate these hierarchies to identify data of theirpreference. Such hierarchies group data under certain properties. Navigational paths arethe knowledge artifacts to represent such groups. We consider paths in hierarchies aspatterns which provide a conceptual clustering of data in groups sharing commonproperties. Under this perspective; we have designed and implemented PatMan; a visualdatabase system to manage hierarchical catalogs. The system can store navigational pathsand data from hierarchical catalogs; and provides a pictorial query-by-example language …,Sigma,2005,*

“Efficient Cost Models for Spatial Queries Using R-trees”(Yannis Theodoridis,Emmanuel Stefanakis; Timos Sellis,Abstract Selection and join queries are fundamental operations in Data Base ManagementSystems (DBMS). Support for non-traditional data; including spatial objects; in an efficientmanner is of ongoing interest in database research. Towards this goal; access methods andcost models for spatial queries are necessary tools for spatial query processing andoptimization. In this paper; we present analytical models that estimate the cost (in terms ofnode and disk accesses) of selection and join queries using R-tree-based structures. Theproposed formulae need no knowledge of the underlying R-tree structure (s) and areapplicable to uniform-like and non-uniform data distributions. In addition; experimentalresults are presented; which show the accuracy of the analytical estimations whencompared to actual runs on both synthetic and real data sets.,To appear in IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2000,*

An incremental database access method for autonomous interoperable databases,Nicholas Roussopoulos; Timos Sellis,Abstract: We investigated a number of design and performance issues of interoperabledatabase management systems (DBMS's). The major results of our investigation wereobtained in the areas of client-server database architectures for heterogeneous DBMS's;incremental computation models; buffer management techniques; and query optimization.We finished a prototype of an advanced client-server workstation-based DBMS which allowsaccess to multiple heterogeneous commercial DBMS's. Experiments and simulations werethen run to compare its performance with the standard client-server architectures. The focusof this research was on adaptive optimization methods of heterogeneous database systems.Adaptive buffer management accounts for the random and object-oriented access methodsfor which no known characterization of the access patterns exists.

Using Caching; Cache Indexing; and,Timos Sellis,ABSTRACT We present a framework for query processing in the relational model extendedwith transaction time. The framework integrates standard query optimization andcomputation techniques with new differential computation techniques. Differentialcomputation incrementally or decrementally computes a query from the cached and indexedresults of previous computations. The use of differential computation techniques is essentialin order to provide efﬁcient processing of queries that access very large temporal relations.Altemative query plans are integrated into a state transition network; where the state spaceincludes backlogs of base relations; cached results from previous computations; a cacheindex; and intermediate results; the transitions include standard relational algebra operators;operators for constructing differential ﬁles; operators for differential computation; and …,*,1989,*

Extended Database Logic: complex Objects and Deduction,John Grant Timos K Sellis; J Grant,Abstract Database Logic was proposed in the late 1970's as a generalization of first-orderlogic in order to deal in a uniform manner with relational; hierarchic; and network data-bases. At about the same time; the study of deductive (relational) databases has becomeimportant; primarily as a vehicle for the development of expert database sys-tems. Also;Prolog; the main logic programming language; has become prominent for many applicationsin artificial intelligence; and its connections with deductive databases have beeninvestigated. Although the relational model provides a suitable framework for traditional;essentially data processing applications; several researchers have found the need forcomplex objects in newer applications; such as engineering databases.

Towards RDF/S-based Data Management Systems,Manolis Koubarakis; Timos Sellis,RDF/S [1] represents nowadays the most popular language for exchanging resourcedescriptions on the Semantic Web (SW). In the RDF data model [23]; a universe of discourseto be modeled is a set of resources (essentially anything that can have a universal resourceidentifier; URI). Resources are then described through a set of properties (ie binarypredicates) while descriptions are statements (ie triples) of the form subject-predicate-object:a subject denotes the described resource; a predicate denotes a resource property; and anobject the corresponding property value. The predicate and object are in turn resources (orliteral values). A vocabulary (called namespace) of the properties but also of the classesemployed to describe resources can be defined in the RDF Schema (RDFS [24]) languagealso represented in the core RDF model. An RDF/S graph G is a set of RDF/S triples T …,*,*,*
TO VIRTUALATTRIBUTES,Yannis E Ioannidis; Timos K Sellis,Abstract In the majority of research work done on logic programming and deductivedatabases; it is assumed that the set of rules defined by the user is consistent; ie; that nocontradictory facts can be inferred by the rules. In this paper; we address the problem ofresolving conflicts of rules that assign values to virtual attributes. We devise a generalframework for the study of the problem; and we propose an approach that subsumes allpreviously suggested solutions. Moreover; it suggests several additional solutions; whichvery often capture the semantics of the data more accurately than the known approaches.Finally; we address the issue of how to index rules so that conflicts are resolved efficiently;ie; only one of the applicable rules is processed at query time.,*,*,*

Technical Report: September 2008 A Model for Context Aware Relational Databases,Ioannis N Roussos; Timos Sellis,ABSTRACT Context aware information; ie information that depends on a set of externalparameters like location; time; user's profile etc; is commonplace in real world datamanagement scenarios. There is a growing need to uniformly represent; store and manageinformation entities with different instances (values) or even different schemas (attributes)under varying circumstances as defined by context. Considerable effort has been directedtowards context acquisition from sources and context modeling. However; so far; no datamodel or language for context aware data has been proposed which can be considered anatural analogue to the relational model or algebra. In this work; we argue about the needfor a conceptual model for context aware information and propose a context aware datamodel based on the definition of multi-schema relations.

MAC: Conceptual Data Modeling for OLAP,Nikos Karayannidis; Aris Tsois; Timos Sellis,Abstract In this paper we address the issue of conceptual modeling of data used inmultidimensional analysis. We view the problem from the end-user point of view and wedescribe a set of requirements for the conceptual modeling of realworld OLAP scenarios.Based on those requirements we then define a new conceptual model that intends tocapture the static properties of the involved information. In its definition we use a minimal setof well-understood OLAP concepts like dimensions; levels; hierarchies; measures andcubes. The central concept of the model is the Multidimensional Aggregation Cube (MAC);which gives a broad and flexible definition to the notion of a multidimensional cube. Weevaluate our model against other existing multidimensional models and show that MACoffers a unique combination of modeling skills. Our main contribution is the definition of …,*,*,*

Thisin turn may lead to assess older experimental data under a new light. Moreover;experiments may be repeated using more advanced methods; and old data may besubstituted by more precise; new data.

Collaborative information spaces: Research directions at IMIS,George Papastefanatos; Yannis Stavrakas; Christos Papatheodorou; Theodore Dalamagas; Dieter Pfoser; Timos Sellis,The Institute for the Management of Information Systems (IMIS) is a research institute withinthe Research and Innovation Center in Information; Communication and KnowledgeTechnologies" Athena". The research at IMIS has a strong collaborative aspect; and rangesfrom basic to applied research. The collaborative aspect is expressed in that research isconducted with national and international partners from industry as well as academia; oftenalso in the context of novel and innovative projects. Data management in the context ofinformation spaces is one of the primary research areas at IMIS. Data and informationspaces is a growing research area aiming at exploiting collections of heterogeneous; highlydistributed data which may vary in structure; origin and semantics. The amount andcomplexity of data increase in a variety of applications; such as enterprise data …,*,*,*

Foundations of Data Warehouse Quality,S Ligoudistianos; D Theodoratos; T Sellis,Abstract A Data Warehouse (DW) can be seen as a set of materialized views defined overrelations that are stored in remote heterogeneous database systems. When a query is posedto the DW; it is evaluated locally; using only the materialized views. The DW configurationproblem is the problem of selecting an optimal set of views to materialize that answer agiven set of queries. The objective is the minimization of the combination of the queryevaluation and view maintenance costs. In this paper we report on the experimentalevaluation of an exhaustive algorithm and we develop new greedy and heuristic algorithmsthat expand only a small fraction of the states produced by the exhaustive algorithm. Thealgorithms are described in terms of a state space search problem. Finally; we report onexperimental results and discuss the observed behavior of the algorithms.,*,*,*
ECA rules as a modeling approach for interactive spatio-temporal application contexts,I Mirbel; B Pernici; T SellisyM Vazirgiannisy,Lately a new generation of application domains is emerging. Examples of these newapplications; heavily dynamic and interactive; are interactive multimedia applications; virtualreality worlds; digital movies or 3D animations. The features of these applications are:increased complexity. rich interaction modes; external and internal. The issue of interactionis gaining importance with the new developments in user interfaces and the ability ofcomputers process to present multimedia information in real time. A feasible model torepresent interaction is based on events. Events represent atomic or composite happeningsof interest to the application 8]. The interaction may be external (ie originated by the user (s)of the application) or internal (related to events that involve entities and objects thatparticipated in the application). intensive spatio-temporal dependencies between the …,*,*,*
Managing Streaming Spatial Data,Timos Sellis,• Managing streaming locations–accept incoming flux of object statuses with space-timestamps➢ deduce whether objects are actually moving or remain stationary–collectunbounded sequences from multiple objects➢ assume that finite data feeds arrive pertimestamp–manipulate missing or noisy data➢ exploit correlations typical in geostreamingdata (eg; traffic patterns)➢ smooth outliers according to archived historical traces,*,*,*
