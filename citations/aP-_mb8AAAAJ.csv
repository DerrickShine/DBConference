Natural language watermarking: Design; analysis; and a proof-of-concept implementation,Mikhail J Atallah; Victor Raskin; Michael Crogan; Christian Hempelmann; Florian Kerschbaum; Dina Mohamed; Sanket Naik,Abstract We describe a scheme for watermarking natural language text by embedding smallportions of the watermark bit string in the syntactic structure of a number of selectedsentences in the text; with both the selection and embedding keyed (via quadratic residue)to a large prime number. Meaning-preserving transformations of sentences of the text (eg;translation to another natural language) cannot damage the watermark. Meaning-modifyingtransformations have a probability; of damaging the watermark; proportional to thewatermark length over the number of sentences. Having the key is all that is required forreading the watermark. The approach is best suited for longish meaning-rather than style-oriented” expository” texts (eg; reports; directives; manuals; etc.); of which governments andindustry produce in abundance and which need protection more frequently than fiction or …,International Workshop on Information Hiding,2001,259
Secure and private sequence comparisons,Mikhail J Atallah; Florian Kerschbaum; Wenliang Du,Abstract We give an efficient protocol for sequence comparisons of the edit-distance kind;such that neither party reveals anything about their private sequence to the other party (otherthan what can be inferred from the edit distance between their two sequences-which isunavoidable because computing that distance is the purpose of the protocol). The amount ofcommunication done by our protocol is proportional to the time complexity of the best-knownalgorithm for performing the sequence comparison. The problem of determining thesimilarity between two sequences arises in a large number of applications; in particular inbioinformatics. In these application areas; the edit distance is one of the most widely usednotions of sequence similarity: It is the least-cost set of insertions; deletions; andsubstitutions required to transform one string into the other. The generalizations of edit …,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM workshop on Privacy in the electronic society,2003,176
Analysis of vulnerabilities in internet firewalls,Seny Kamara; Sonia Fahmy; Eugene Schultz; Florian Kerschbaum; Michael Frantzen,Abstract Firewalls protect a trusted network from an untrusted network by filtering trafficaccording to a specified security policy. A diverse set of firewalls is being used today. As it isinfeasible to examine and test each firewall for all possible potential problems; a taxonomyis needed to understand firewall vulnerabilities in the context of firewall operations. Thispaper describes a novel methodology for analyzing vulnerabilities in Internet firewalls. Afirewall vulnerability is defined as an error made during firewall design; implementation; orconfiguration; that can be exploited to attack the trusted network that the firewall is supposedto protect. We examine firewall internals; and cross-reference each firewall operation withcauses and effects of weaknesses in that operation; analyzing twenty reported problemswith available firewalls. The result of our analysis is a set of matrices that illustrate the …,Computers & Security,2003,152
Plug-in privacy for smart metering billing,Marek Jawurek; Martin Johns; Florian Kerschbaum,Abstract Traditional electricity meters are replaced by Smart Meters in customers'households. Smart Meters collect fine-grained utility consumption profiles from customers;which in turn enables the introduction of dynamic; time-of-use tariffs. However; the fine-grained usage data that is compiled in this process also allows to infer the inhabitant'spersonal schedules and habits. We propose a privacy-preserving protocol that enablesbilling with time-of-use tariffs without disclosing the actual consumption profile to thesupplier. Our approach relies on a zero-knowledge proof based on Pedersen Commitmentsperformed by a plug-in privacy component that is put into the communication link betweenSmart Meter and supplier's back-end system. We require no changes to the Smart Meterhardware and only small changes to the software of Smart Meter and back-end system.

Simple cross-site attack prevention,Florian Kerschbaum,Many web applications are security critical; since they involve real-world monetarytransactions; eg online auctions or online banking. Attackers have found new attacks toexploit vulnerabilities in these web applications. Among these attacks reflected cross-sitescripting and request forgery attacks have received much attention in the recent scientificliterature. There are client-side and server-side solutions which can complement each otherin protecting against these cross-site attacks. Server-side solutions are currently limited toeither cross-site request forgery attacks or cross-site scripting attacks which attack theintegrity of the session (session theft). This paper presents a lightweight and efficientsolution that prevents reflected cross-site scripting and request forgery attacks using agateway at the server. It is so strikingly simple (yet solves this practically pressing problem …,Security and Privacy in Communications Networks and the Workshops; 2007. SecureComm 2007.

Pathtrust: A trust-based reputation service for virtual organization formation,Florian Kerschbaum; Jochen Haller; Yücel Karabulut; Philip Robinson,Abstract Virtual Organizations enable new forms of collaboration for businesses in anetworked society. During their formation business partners are selected on an as-neededbasis. We consider the problem of using a reputation system to enhance the memberselection in Virtual Organizations. The paper identifies the requirements for and the benefitsof using a reputation system for this task. We identify attacks and analyze their impact andthreat to using reputation systems. Based on these findings we propose the use of a specificmodel of reputation different from the prevalent models of reputation. The major contributionof this paper is an algorithm (called PathTrust) in this model that exploits the graph ofrelationships among the participants. It strongly emphasizes the transitive model of trust in aweb of trust. We evaluate its performance; especially under attack; and show that it …,International Conference on Trust Management,2006,83
Searchable encryption with secure and efficient updates,Florian Hahn; Florian Kerschbaum,Abstract Searchable (symmetric) encryption allows encryption while still enabling search forkeywords. Its immediate application is cloud storage where a client outsources its files whilethe (cloud) service provider should search and selectively retrieve those. Searchableencryption is an active area of research and a number of schemes with different efficiencyand security characteristics have been proposed in the literature. Any scheme for practicaladoption should be efficient--ie have sub-linear search time--; dynamic--ie allow updates--and semantically secure to the most possible extent. Unfortunately; efficient; dynamicsearchable encryption schemes suffer from various drawbacks. Either they deteriorate fromsemantic security to the security of deterministic encryption under updates; they require tostore information on the client and for deleted files and keywords or they have very large …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2014,79
Outsourced private set intersection using homomorphic encryption,Florian Kerschbaum,Abstract Private set intersection enables two parties--a client and a server--to compute theintersection of their respective sets without disclosing anything else. It is a fundamentaloperation--equivalent to a secure; distributed database join--and has many applicationsparticularly in privacy-preserving law enforcement. In this paper we present a novel protocolthat has linear complexity; is secure in the malicious model without random oracles; is clientset size-independent and efficient. Furthermore; the computation of the intersection can beoutsourced to an oblivious service provider; as in secure cloud computing. We leverage acompletely novel construction for computing the intersection using Bloom filter andhomomorphic encryption. For outsourcing we require and introduce a new homomorphicencryption scheme which may be of independent interest.,Proceedings of the 7th ACM Symposium on Information; Computer and Communications Security,2012,75
Optimal average-complexity ideal-security order-preserving encryption,Florian Kerschbaum; Axel Schroepfer,Abstract Order-preserving encryption enables performing many classes of queries--including range queries--on encrypted databases. Popa et al. recently presented an ideal-secure order-preserving encryption (or encoding) scheme; but their cost of insertions(encryption) is very high. In this paper we present an also ideal-secure; but significantlymore efficient order-preserving encryption scheme. Our scheme is inspired by Reed'sreferenced work on the average height of random binary search trees. We show that ourscheme improves the average communication complexity from O (n log n) to O (n) underuniform distribution. Our scheme also integrates efficiently with adjustable encryption asused in CryptDB. In our experiments for database inserts we achieve a performanceincrease of up to 81% in LANs and 95% in WANs.,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2014,70
A Framework for Understanding Vulnerabilities in Firewalls Using a Dataflow Model of Firewall Internals1,Mike Frantzen; Florian Kerschbaum; E Eugene Schultz; Sonia Fahmy,Abstract Vulnerabilities in vendor as well as freeware implementations of firewalls continueto emerge at a rapid pace. Each vulnerability superficially appears to be the result ofsomething such as a coding flaw in one case; or a configuration weakness in another. Giventhe large number of firewall vulnerabilities that have surfaced in recent years; it is importantto develop a comprehensive framework for understanding both what firewalls actually dowhen they receive incoming traffic and what can go wrong when they process this traffic. Anintuitive starting point is to create a firewall dataflow model composed of discrete processingstages that reflect the processing characteristics of a given firewall. These stages do notnecessarily all occur in all firewalls; nor do they always conform to the sequential orderindicated in this paper. This paper also provides a more complete view of what happens …,Computers & Security,2001,62
Privacy-preserving social network analysis for criminal investigations,Florian Kerschbaum; Andreas Schaad,Abstract Social network analysis (SNA) is now a commonly used tool in criminalinvestigations; but evidence gathering and analysis is often restricted by data privacy laws.We consider the case where multiple investigators want to collaborate; but do not yet havesufficient evidence that justifies a plaintext data exchange. This paper proposes a solutionfor privacy-preserving social network analysis where several investigators can collaboratewithout actually exchanging sensitive private information. An investigator can request datafrom other sites to augment his view without revealing personally identifiable data. Theinvestigator can compute important metrics by means of a SNA on the subject while keepingthe entire social network unknown him.,Proceedings of the 7th ACM workshop on Privacy in the electronic society,2008,60
Fault-tolerant privacy-preserving statistics,Marek Jawurek; Florian Kerschbaum,Abstract Real-time statistics on smart meter consumption data must preserve consumerprivacy and tolerate smart meter failures. Existing protocols for this private distributedaggregation model suffer from various drawbacks that disqualify them for application in thesmart energy grid. Either they are not fault-tolerant or if they are; then they require bi-directional communication or their accuracy decreases with an increasing number offailures. In this paper; we provide a protocol that fixes these problems and furthermore;supports a wider range of exchangeable statistical functions and requires no group keymanagement. A key-managing authority ensures the secure evaluation of authorizedfunctions on fresh data items using logical time and a custom zero-knowledge proofproviding differential privacy for an unbounded number of statistics calculations.

Zero-knowledge using garbled circuits: how to prove non-algebraic statements efficiently,Marek Jawurek; Florian Kerschbaum; Claudio Orlandi,Abstract Zero-knowledge protocols are one of the fundamental concepts in moderncryptography and have countless applications. However; after more than 30 years from theirintroduction; there are only very few languages (essentially those with a group structure) forwhich we can construct zero-knowledge protocols that are efficient enough to be used inpractice.,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGSAC conference on Computer & communications security,2013,57
Frequency-hiding order-preserving encryption,Florian Kerschbaum,Abstract Order-preserving encryption allows encrypting data; while still enabling efficientrange queries on the encrypted data. This makes its performance and functionality verysuitable for data outsourcing in cloud computing scenarios; but the security of order-preserving is still debatable. We present a scheme that achieves a strictly stronger notion ofsecurity than any other scheme so far. The basic idea is to randomize the ciphertexts to hidethe frequency of plaintexts. Still; the client storage size remains small; in our experiments upto 1/15 of the plaintext size. As a result; one can more securely outsource large data sets;since we can also show that our security increases with larger data sets.,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2015,52
L1-an intermediate language for mixed-protocol secure computation,Axel Schropfer; Florian Kerschbaum; Gunter Muller,Secure Computation (SC) enables secure distributed computation of arbitrary functions ofprivate inputs. It has many useful applications; eg benchmarking or auctions. Severalgeneral protocols for SC have been proposed and recently been implemented in a numberof compilers and frameworks. These compilers or frameworks implement one general SCprotocol and then require the programmer to implement the function he wants the protocol tocompute. Performance remains a challenge for this approach and it has been realized earlyon that special protocols for important problems can deliver superior performance. In thispaper we propose a new intermediate language (L1) for optimizing SC compilers whichenables efficient implementation of special protocols potentially mixing several general SCprotocols. We show by three case studies-one for computation of the median; one for …,Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC); 2011 IEEE 35th Annual,2011,51

Security and trust in it business outsourcing: a manifesto,Yuecel Karabulut; Florian Kerschbaum; Fabio Massacci; Philip Robinson; Artsiom Yautsiukhin,Abstract Nowadays many companies understand the benefit of outsourcing. Yet; in currentoutsourcing practices; clients usually focus primarily on business objectives and security isnegotiated only for communication links. It is however not determined how data must beprotected after transmission. Strong protection of a communication link is of little value if datacan be easily stolen or corrupted while on a supplier's server. The problem raises a numberof related challenges such as: identification of metrics which are more suitable for security-level negotiation; client and contractor perspective and security guarantees in servicecomposition scenarios. These challenges and some others are discussed in depth in thearticle.,Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science,2007,45
Building a privacy-preserving benchmarking enterprise system,Florian Kerschbaum,Benchmarking is the process of comparing one's own performance to the statistics of agroup of competitors; named peer group. It is a common and important process in thebusiness world for many important business metrics; called key performance indicators(KPI). Privacy is of the utmost importance; since these KPIs allow the inference of sensitiveinformation. Therefore several secure multi-party computation protocols for securely andprivately computing the statistics of KPIs have recently been developed. These protocols arethe basic building blocks for a privacy-preserving benchmarking system; but in order tocomplete an enterprise system that offers a benchmarking service to its customers moreproblems need to be solved. We first analyse how peer group participation impacts privacyand vice versa. Peer group formation is the process of forming sensible peer groups out …,Enterprise Information Systems,2008,44
Filtering for private collaborative benchmarking,Florian Kerschbaum; Orestis Terzidis,Abstract Collaborative Benchmarking is an important issue for modern enterprises; but thebusiness performance quantities used as input are often highly confidential. Secure Multi-Party Computation can offer protocols that can compute benchmarks without leaking theinput variables. Benchmarking is a process of comparing to the “best”; so often it isnecessary to only include the k-best enterprises for computing a benchmark to not distort theresult with some outlying performances. We present a protocol that can be used as a filter;before running any collaborative benchmarking protocol that restricts the participants to the kbest values. Our protocol doesn't use the general circuit construction technique for SMCaiming to optimize performance. As building blocks we present the fastest implementation ofYao's millionaires' protocol and a protocol that achieves a fair shuffle in O (log n) rounds.,*,2006,43
Practical privacy-preserving multiparty linear programming based on problem transformation,Jannik Dreier; Florian Kerschbaum,Cryptographic solutions to privacy-preserving multiparty linear programming are slow. Thismakes them unsuitable for many economically important applications; such as supply chainoptimization; whose size exceeds their practically feasible input range. In this paper wepresent a privacy-preserving transformation that allows secure outsourcing of the linearprogram computation in an efficient manner. We evaluate security by quantifying theleakage about the input after the transformation and present implementation results. Usingthis transformation; we can mostly replace the costly cryptographic operations and securelysolve problems several orders of magnitude larger.,Privacy; Security; Risk and Trust (PASSAT) and 2011 IEEE Third Inernational Conference on Social Computing (SocialCom); 2011 IEEE Third International Conference on,2011,41
Automatically optimizing secure computation,Florian Kerschbaum,Abstract On the one hand; compilers for secure computation protocols; such as FairPlay orFairPlayMP; have significantly simplified the development of such protocols. On the otherhand; optimized protocols with high performance for special problems demand manualdevelopment and security verification. The question considered in this paper is: Can weconstruct a compiler that produces optimized protocols? We present an optimizationtechnique based on logic inference about what is known from input and output. Using theexample of median computation we can show that our program analysis and rewritingtechnique translates a FairPlay program into an equivalent--in functionality and security--program that corresponds to the protocol by Aggarwal et al. Nevertheless our technique isgeneral and can be applied to optimize a wide variety of secure computation protocols.,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Computer and communications security,2011,40
Secure collaborative supply chain planning and inverse optimization–The JELS model,Richard Pibernik; Yingying Zhang; Florian Kerschbaum; Axel Schröpfer,Abstract It is a well-acknowledged fact that collaboration between different members of asupply chain yields a significant potential to increase overall supply chain performance.Sharing private information has been identified as prerequisite for collaboration and; at thesame time; as one of its major obstacles. One potential avenue for overcoming this obstacleis Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMC). SMC is a cryptographic technique that enablesthe computation of any (well-defined) mathematical function by a number of parties withoutany party having to disclose its input to another party. In this paper; we show how SMC canbe successfully employed to enable joint decision-making and benefit sharing in a simplesupply chain setting. We develop secure protocols for implementing the well-known “JointEconomic Lot Size (JELS) Model” with benefit sharing in such a way that none of the …,European Journal of Operational Research,2011,39
Privacy-preserving pattern matching for anomaly detection in RFID anti-counterfeiting,Florian Kerschbaum; Nina Oertel,Abstract Traces of RFID-equipped item can be used to detect counterfeits. Neverthelesscompanies are reluctant to share the necessary traces; since it is unclear what can beinferred from them. In this paper we present a provably secure pattern matching algorithmthat can be used for distributed anomaly detection. We improve performance and detectioncapabilities compared to competing approaches by storing partial; malleable information onthe RFID tag.,International Workshop on Radio Frequency Identification: Security and Privacy Issues,2010,39
A verifiable; centralized; coercion-free reputation system,Florian Kerschbaum,Abstract Reputation systems are popular tools to evaluate the trustworthiness of an unknownparty before a transaction; but the reputation score can greatly impact the rated subject; suchthat it might be inclined to suppress negative ratings. In order to elicit coercion-resistant;honest feedback; this paper proposes a reputation system that provides complete privacy ofthe ratings; ie neither the ratee nor the reputation system will learn the value of the rating.We take both; a cryptographic as well as a non-cryptographic approach; to the problem.Privacy of ratings may foster bad mouthing attacks where an attacker leaves intentionallybad feedback. We limit the possibility for this attack by providing a token system such thatone can only leave feedback after a transaction; and provide a cryptographic proof of theprivacy of our system. We consider the Virtual Organization formation problem and …,Proceedings of the 8th ACM workshop on Privacy in the electronic society,2009,39
Performance comparison of secure comparison protocols,Florian Kerschbaum; Debmalya Biswas; Sebastiaan de Hoogh,Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) has gained tremendous importance with the growth ofthe Internet and E-commerce; where mutually untrusted parties need to jointly compute afunction of their private inputs. However; SMC protocols usually have very highcomputational complexities; rendering them practically unusable. In this paper; we tackle theproblem of comparing two input values in a secure distributed fashion. We propose efficientsecure comparison protocols for both the homomorphic encryption and secret sharingschemes. We also give experimental results to show their practical relevance.,Database and Expert Systems Application; 2009. DEXA'09. 20th International Workshop on,2009,39
RFID-based supply chain partner authentication and key agreement,Florian Kerschbaum; Alessandro Sorniotti,Abstract The growing use of RFID in supply chains brings along an indisputable addedvalue from the business perspective; but raises a number of new interesting securitychallenges. One of them is the authentication of two participants of the supply chain thathave possessed the same tagged item; but that have otherwise never communicated before.The situation is even more complex if we imagine that participants to the supply chain maybe business competitors. We present a novel cryptographic scheme that solves this problem.In our solution; users exchange tags over the cycle of a supply chain and; if two entities havepossessed the same tag; they agree on a secret common key they can use to protect theirexchange of business sensitive information. No rogue user can be successful in a maliciousauthentication; because it would either be traceable or it would imply the loss of a secret …,Proceedings of the second ACM conference on Wireless network security,2009,39
Automatic protocol selection in secure two-party computations,Florian Kerschbaum; Thomas Schneider; Axel Schröpfer,Abstract Performance of secure computation is still often an obstacle to its practical adaption.There are different protocols for secure computation that compete for the best performance.In this paper we propose automatic protocol selection which selects a protocol for eachoperation resulting in a mix with the best performance so far. Based on an elaborateperformance model; we propose an optimization algorithm and an efficient heuristic for thisselection problem. We show that our mixed protocols achieve the best performance on a setof use cases. Furthermore; our results underpin that the selection problem is so complicatedand large in size; that a programmer is unlikely to manually make the optimal selection. Ourproposed algorithms nevertheless can be integrated into a compiler in order to yield the best(or near-optimal) performance.,International Conference on Applied Cryptography and Network Security,2014,34
Fostering the uptake of secure multiparty computation in e-commerce,Octavian Catrina; Florian Kerschbaum,Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) protocols enable a group of mutually distrustfulparties to perform a joint computation with private inputs. Novel e-commerce applicationshave emerged that could benefit from strong privacy protection; eg; benchmarking; auctions;and collaborative supply chain management and planning. However; the uptake of SMC inthese applications is still rare. We argue that this is due to poor performance; functionality;and scalability; as well as architectures that do not meet the needs of e-commerceapplications. This paper explores SMC approaches and research directions; aiming atproviding better support for e-commerce applications.,Availability; Reliability and Security; 2008. ARES 08.

On the practical importance of communication complexity for secure multi-party computation protocols,Florian Kerschbaum; Daniel Dahlmeier; Axel Schröpfer; Debmalya Biswas,Abstract Many advancements in the area of Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMC)protocols use improvements in communication complexity as a justification. We conductedan experimental study of a specific protocol for a real-world sized problem under realisticconditions and it suggests that the practical performance of the protocol is almostindependent of the network performance. We argue that our result can be generalized to awhole class of SMC protocols.,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM symposium on Applied Computing,2009,32
Practical privacy-preserving benchmarking,Florian Kerschbaum,Abstract Benchmarking is an important process for companies to stay competitive in today'smarkets. The basis for benchmarking are statistics of performancemeasures of a group ofcompanies. The companies need to collaborate in order to compute these statistics.Protocols for privately computingstatistics have been proposed in the literature.

Public-key encrypted bloom filters with applications to supply chain integrity,Florian Kerschbaum,Abstract Bloom filters provide a space-and time-efficient mean to check the inclusion of anelement in a set. In some applications it is beneficial; if the set represented by the Bloomfilter is only revealed to authorized parties. Particularly; operations data in supply chainmanagement can be very sensitive and Bloom filters can be applied to supply chain integrityvalidation. Despite the protection of the represented set; Bloom filter operations; such as theverification of set inclusion; need to be still feasible. In this paper we present privacy-preserving; publicly verifiable Bloom filters which offer both: privacy for the represented setand public Bloom filter operations. We give security proofs in the standard model.,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2011,29

Using embedded sensors for detecting network attacks,Florian Kerschbaum; Eugene H Spafford; Diego Zamboni,Abstract Embedded sensors for intrusion detection consist of code added to the operatingsystem and the programs of the hosts where monitoring will take place. The sensors checkfor specific conditions that indicate an attack is taking place; or an intrusion has occurred.Embedded sensors have advantages over other data collection techniques (usuallyimplemented as separate processes) in terms of reduced host impact; resistance to attack;efficiency and effectiveness of detection. We describe the use of embedded sensors ingeneral; and their application to the detection of specific network-based attacks. The sensorswere implemented in the OpenBSD operating system; and our tests show a 100% successrate in the detection of the attacks for which sensors were instrumented.

Symmetric-key based proofs of retrievability supporting public verification,Chaowen Guan; Kui Ren; Fangguo Zhang; Florian Kerschbaum; Jia Yu,Abstract Proofs-of-Retrievability enables a client to store his data on a cloud server so thathe executes an efficient auditing protocol to check that the server possesses all of his data inthe future. During an audit; the server must maintain full knowledge of the client's data topass; even though only a few blocks of the data need to be accessed. Since the first work byJuels and Kaliski; many PoR schemes have been proposed and some of them can supportdynamic updates. However; all the existing works that achieve public verifiability are builtupon traditional public-key cryptosystems which imposes a relatively high computationalburden on low-power clients (eg; mobile devices).

Web services are being positioned as the technological frameworkfor achieving this aggregation in the context of cross-organizational business applications.Numerous architectures have been proposed for securing VOs; mostly for scientificresearch; such that they do not address all the requirements of business-orientedapplications.

Industrial privacy in RFID-based batch recalls,Leonardo Weiss Ferreira Chaves; Florian Kerschbaum,Batch recalls are an important topic for manufacturers and producers. Especially in the foodand in the pharmaceutical industry; producers are obliged to implement recalls in order tocomply with legislation. In extreme cases; non-compliance can cause loss of life; eg whenperished food or medicine reaches the consumer. Current batch recall practice is expensiveand difficult; since many supply chain partners need to combine the data from their ERPsystems. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) can be used to efficiently implement batchrecalls; eg by storing batch numbers from the parts/ingredients used in all manufacturingsteps. But this raises concerns on industrial privacy; since competitors could use thisinformation to gain insight into the whole supply chain.

Collusion-resistant outsourcing of private set intersection,Florian Kerschbaum,Abstract Set intersection is a building block for many data analysis techniques; eg in datamining. Private set intersection enables to compute the set intersection without revealing thenon-matching items. The advent of cloud computing drives the desire to outsource suchcomputations; but without the need to trust the service provider. Homomorphic encryptionenables secure; outsourced computations; but in case of multiple clients cannot preventcollusion. In this paper we present non-interactive; encrypted computation of the setintersection using an untrusted service provider. Two or more clients submit their encryptedsets to the service provider which facilitates the computation of their intersection. The serviceprovider either learns the intersection or remains completely obvious to both input andoutput-including the intersection's size. We prove our protocols secure in the random …,Proceedings of the 27th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2012,20
Secure and sustainable benchmarking in clouds,Florian Kerschbaum,Abstract Cloud computing entails a novel security threat: The cloud service provider isentrusted with the data of all its customers. This may not be sustainable for highlyconfidential data. Encryption; or more generally cryptography; may provide a solution bycomputing on data encrypted by the customers. While this solution is theoretically appealing;it raises a number of research questions in information system design. Using the example ofcollaborative benchmarking the author presents and evaluates an exemplary design andimplementation of a cloud application that operates only on encrypted data; thus protectingthe confidentiality of the customer's data against the cloud service provider. The cloudapplication computes common statistics for benchmarking without disclosing the individualkey performance indicators. Benchmarking is an important process for companies to stay …,Business & Information Systems Engineering,2011,19
Secure conjunctive keyword searches for unstructured text,Florian Kerschbaum,There are a number of searchable encryption schemes that allow secure conjunctivekeyword searches over encrypted data; but all of them assume that the position of thekeywords is known. This is a pity; since in unstructured text; eg the body of an e-mail; thisposition is unknown and one has to construct O (mn) search tokens for n keywords in a textof length m. In this paper we present a searchable encryption scheme that allowsconjunctive keyword searches without specifying the position requiring only one searchtoken with constant ciphertext length. We prove the security of our scheme using the externalDiffie-Hellman assumption in the random oracle model.,Network and System Security (NSS); 2011 5th International Conference on,2011,18
Using internal sensors and embedded detectors for intrusion detection 1,Florian Kerschbaum; Eugene H Spafford; Diego Zamboni,We introduce the concept of using internal sensors to perform intrusion detection in computersystems. We show its practical feasibility and discuss its characteristics; related design and implementationissues. We introduce a classification of data collection mechanisms for intrusion detectionsystems. At a con- ceptual level; these mechanisms are classified as direct and indirectmonitoring. At a practical level; direct monitoring can be implemented using external or internalsensors. Internal sensors provide advantages with respect to reliability; completeness; timelinessand volume of data; in addition to efficiency and re- sistance against attacks. We introduce anarchitecture called ESP as a framework for building intrusion detection systems based on internalsensors. We describe in detail a prototype implementation based on the ESP architecture andintroduce the concept of embedded detectors as a mechanism for localized data …,Journal of Computer Security,2002,18

ENKI: access control for encrypted query processing,Isabelle Hang; Florian Kerschbaum; Ernesto Damiani,Abstract A data owner outsourcing the database of a multi user application wants to preventinformation leaks caused by outside attackers exploiting software vulnerabilities or bycurious personnel. Query processing over encrypted data solves this problem for a singleuser; but provides only limited functionality in the face of access restrictions for multipleusers and keys. ENKI is a system for securely executing queries over sensitive; accessrestricted data on an outsourced database. It introduces an encryption based access controlmodel and techniques for query execution over encrypted; access restricted data on thedatabase with only a few cases requiring computations on the client. A prototype of ENKIsupports all queries seen in three real world use cases and executes queries from TPC-Cbenchmark with a modest overhead compared to the single user mode.,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,16

Privacy-preserving data analytics as an outsourced service,Florian Kerschbaum; Julien Vayssière,Abstract Two sets of privacy requirements need to be fulfilled when a company's accountingdata is audited by an external party: the company needs to safeguard its data; while theauditors do not want to reveal their investigation methods. This problem is usuallyaddressed by physically isolating data and auditors during the course of an audit. Thisapproach however no longer works when auditing is performed remotely. We present asearchable encryption scheme for outsourcing data analytics. In our scheme the data ownerneeds to encrypt his data only once and ship it in encrypted form to the data analyst. Thedata analyst can then perform a series of queries for which he must ask the data owner forhelp in translating the constants in the queries.,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM workshop on Secure web services,2008,16
Distance-preserving pseudonymization for timestamps and spatial data,Florian Kerschbaum,Abstract The need for privacy in intrusion detection data; such as audit logs is widelyrecognized. The prevalent method for privacy protection in audit logs is pseudonymization(and suppression). There is a clear trade-off between the privacy of a pseudonymizationtechnique and its utility for intrusion detection. Eg; for IP addresses a method for prefixpreserving pseudonymization has been developed; that allows pseudonymized IPaddresses to be still grouped into subnets. This paper describes a pseudonymizationtechnique for timestamps that is distance preserving. Ie given two pseudonymizedtimestamps one can compute the distance δ; if d is below or equal to an agreed threshold dand one cannot compute δif δ= 2d. We extend our technique for two dimensional spatialdata; eg location of objects or persons. We also evaluate the privacy any such distance …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM workshop on Privacy in electronic society,2007,16
From business process choreography to authorization policies,Philip Robinson; Florian Kerschbaum; Andreas Schaad,Abstract A choreography specifies the interactions between the resources of multiplecollaborating parties at design time. The runtime management of authorization policies inorder to support such a specification is however tedious for administrators to manuallyhandle. By compiling the choreography into enhanced authorization policies; we are able toautomatically derive the minimal authorizations required for collaboration; as well as enableand disable the authorizations in a just-in-time manner that matches the control flowdescribed in the choreography. We have evaluated the advantage of this utility in acollaborative engineering scenario.,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2006,16

Privacy-preserving computation of benchmarks on item-level data using RFID,Florian Kerschbaum; Nina Oertel; Leonardo Weiss Ferreira Chaves,Abstract Currently; companies are about to optimize their internal processes by monitoringitems they handle with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). However; there is a risk thatsensitive information is disclosed when sharing RFID data with other companies. Therefore;companies are unwilling to share RFID data. At first glance; Secure Multi-Party Computation(SMC) might reconciliate data sharing with the privacy concerns. However; SMC requiresthe collaboration of all parties involved in a protocol. This prevents using SMC for manyapplications based on item-level RFID data collected in supply chains; since some partiesmay be competitors or have conflicting interests. We present protocols for securely andprivately computing item-level metrics using only existing communication links (eg;messages stored on RFID tags) and an oblivious third party. This enables optimizing the …,Proceedings of the third ACM conference on Wireless network security,2010,15
Optimal re-encryption strategy for joins in encrypted databases,Florian Kerschbaum; Martin Härterich; Patrick Grofig; Mathias Kohler; Andreas Schaad; Axel Schröpfer; Walter Tighzert,Abstract In order to perform a join in a deterministically; adjustably encrypted database onehas to re-encrypt at least one column. The problem is to select that column that will result inthe minimum number of re-encryptions even under an unknown schedule of joins. Naivestrategies may perform too many or even infinitely many re-encryptions. We provide twostrategies that allow for a much better performance. In particular the asymptotic behavior is O(n 3/2) resp. O (n log n) re-encryptions for n columns. We show that there can be noalgorithm better than O (n log n). We further extend our result to element-wise re-encryptionsand show experimentally that our algorithm results in the optimal cost in 41% of the cases.,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2013,14
From a barrier to a bridge: data-privacy in deregulated smart grids,Jens Strüker; Florian Kerschbaum,Abstract The introduction of so-called smart meters involves detailed consumption data.While this data plays a key role in integrating volatile renewable energy sources; a sideeffect is that it can reveal sensitive personal information. Concerns and protests led to astopped smart meter rollout yet. In deregulated electricity markets; data-privacy is even moreat risk: The UK; Texas and Ontario decided for a nation-wide communication intermediary inorder to facilitate the exchange of the vast amount of smart meter data. However; thisoperational efficiency is achieved by the fact that an intermediary is a single point of failure.We present an approach based on encryption to secure the intermediary against privacyinvasions and we can show that our prototypical implementation meets even restrictiverequirements for large-scale data handling and processing.

Forecasting run-times of secure two-party computation,Axel Schroepfer; Florian Kerschbaum,Secure computation (SC) are cryptographic protocols that enable multiple parties to performa joint computation while retaining the privacy of their inputs. It is current practice to evaluatethe performance of SC protocols using complexity approximations of computation andcommunication. Due to the disparate complexity measures and constants this approach failsat reliably predicting the performance. We contribute a performance model (PM) forforecasting run-times of secure two-party computations. We show the correctness of our PMby an empirical study on the problem of secure division which is relevant for many real worldSCs; eg; k-means clustering or supply chain optimization. We show that our PM can be usedto make an optimal selection of an algorithm and cryptographic protocol combination; aswell as to determine the implicit security tradeoffs. The predictions of our PM can be used …,Quantitative Evaluation of Systems (QEST); 2011 Eighth International Conference on,2011,14

Approximate two-party privacy-preserving string matching with linear complexity,Martin Beck; Florian Kerschbaum,Consider two parties who want to compare their strings; eg; genomes; but do not want toreveal them to each other. We present a system for privacy-preserving matching of strings;which differs from existing systems by providing a deterministic approximation instead of anexact distance. It is efficient (linear complexity); non-interactive and does not involve a thirdparty which makes it particularly suitable for cloud computing. We extend our protocol; suchthat it only reveals whether there is a match and not the exact distance. Further animplementation of the system is evaluated and compared against current privacy-preservingstring matching algorithms.,Big Data (BigData Congress); 2013 IEEE International Congress on,2013,12
Workflow signatures for business process compliance,Hoon Wei Lim; Florian Kerschbaum; Huaxiong Wang,Interorganizational workflow systems play a fundamental role in business partnerships. Weintroduce and investigate the concept of workflow signatures. Not only can these signaturesbe used to ensure authenticity and protect integrity of workflow data; but also to prove thesequence and logical relationships; such as AND-join and AND-split; of a workflow. Hence;workflow signatures can be electronic evidence useful for auditing; that is provingcompliance of business processes against some regulatory requirements. Furthermore;signing keys can be used to grant permissions to perform tasks. Since the signing keys areissued on-the-fly; authorization to execute a task within a workflow can be controlled andgranted dynamically at runtime.

HardIDX: practical and secure index with SGX,Benny Fuhry; Raad Bahmani; Ferdinand Brasser; Florian Hahn; Florian Kerschbaum; Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi,Abstract Software-based approaches for search over encrypted data are still eitherchallenged by lack of proper; low-leakage encryption or slow performance. Existinghardware-based approaches do not scale well due to hardware limitations and softwaredesigns that are not specifically tailored to the hardware architecture; and are rarely wellanalyzed for their security (eg; the impact of side channels). Additionally; existing hardware-based solutions often have a large code footprint in the trusted environment susceptible tosoftware compromises. In this paper we present HardIDX: a hardware-based approach;leveraging Intel's SGX; for search over encrypted data. It implements only the security criticalcore; ie; the search functionality; in the trusted environment and resorts to untrusted softwarefor the remainder.

Using the example of Singapore's EZ-Link system we show that it is easyto invade a traveller's privacy and obtain his travel records in a real-world system. Then wepropose encrypted bill processing of the travel records preventing any kind of privacybreach.

Privacy-enhanced reputation-feedback methods to reduce feedback extortion in online auctions,Michael T Goodrich; Florian Kerschbaum,Abstract In this paper; we study methods for improving the utility and privacy of reputationscores for online auctions; such as used in eBay; so as to reduce the effectiveness offeedback extortion. The main idea behind our techniques is to escrow reputations scoresuntil appropriate external events occur. Depending on the degree of utility and privacyneeded; these external techniques could depend on the number and type of reputationscores collected. Moreover; if additional privacy protection is needed; then random samplingcan be used with respect reputation scores in such a way that reputation aggregates remainuseful; but individual reputation scores are probabilistically hidden from users. Finally; weshow that if privacy is also desired with respect to the the reputation aggregator; then we canuse zero-knowledge proofs for reputation comparisons.,Proceedings of the first ACM conference on Data and application security and privacy,2011,11

Inference control for privacy-preserving genome matching,Florian Kerschbaum; Martin Beck; Dagmar Schönfeld,Abstract: Privacy is of the utmost importance in genomic matching. Therefore a number ofprivacy-preserving protocols have been presented using secure computation. Nevertheless;none of these protocols prevents inferences from the result. Goodrich has shown that thisresulting information is sufficient for an effective attack on genome databases. In this paperwe present an approach that can detect and mitigate such an attack on encrypted messageswhile still preserving the privacy of both parties. Note that randomization; eg~ usingdifferential privacy; will almost certainly destroy the utility of the matching result.

Adapting privacy-preserving computation to the service provider model,Florian Kerschbaum,There are many applications for Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMC); but practicaladoption is still an issue.

This paper provides SMC in a systemarchitecture for service providers. Furthermore we achieve an interesting performanceimprovement.

A New Way to Think About Secure Computation: Language-based Secure Computation.,Florian Kerschbaum,Abstract. Assume two parties; Alice and Bob; want to compute a joint function; but they wantto keep their inputs private. This problem setting and its solutions are known as securecomputation. General solutions to secure computation require the construction of a binarycircuit for the function to be computed. This paper proposes the concept of languagebasedsecure computation. Instead of constructing a binary circuit program code is directlytranslated into a secure computation protocol. This concept is compared to the approachesfor language-based informationflow security and many connections between the twoapproaches are identified. The major challenge in this translation is the secure translation ofthe program's control-flow without leaking private information via a timing channel.

Practical secure and efficient multiparty linear programming based on problem transformation,Jannik Dreier; Florian Kerschbaum,Cryptographic solutions to privacy-preserving multiparty linear programming are slow. Thismakes them unsuitable for many economically important applications; such as supply chainoptimization; whose size exceeds their practically feasible input range.

Modern encrypted databases where the cryptographic key remains at the client providea solution to this problem. Recent results in cryptography; such order-preserving encryption;and database systems enable the practical use of these systems. We report on our pre-development efforts of implementing such an encrypted database in an in-memory; columnstore database. We highlight some unsolved research challenges: such as access control;infrequent queries and security vs. performance query optimization. Challenges to keymanagement in multi-user environments remain largely unsolved. We give an overview ofthe architecture and performance benchmarks on our prototype which are very …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2013,6
Expression rewriting for optimizing secure computation,Florian Kerschbaum,Abstract In theory secure computation offers a solution for privacy in many collaborativeapplications. However; in practice poor efficiency of the protocols prevents their use. Hand-crafted protocols are more efficient than those implemented in compilers; but they requiresignificantly more development effort in programming and verification. Recently;Kerschbaum introduced an automatic compiler optimization technique for securecomputations that can make compilers as efficient as hand-crafted protocols. Thisoptimization relies on the structure of the secure computation program. The programmer hasto implement the program in such a way; such that the optimization can yield the optimalperformance. In this paper we present an algorithm that rewrites the program--most notablyits expressions--optimizing their efficiency in secure computation protocols. We give a …,Proceedings of the third ACM conference on Data and application security and privacy,2013,6
Encryption-enforced access control for an RFID discovery service,Florian Kerschbaum; Leonardo Weiss Ferreira Chaves,Abstract In this demonstration we present a novel encryption scheme for enforcing accesscontrol in a Discovery Service. A Discovery Service is a piece of software that allows one to"discover" item-level data which is stored in data repositories of different companies. Suchdata can be gathered with the help of Radio Frequency Identification or 2D bar codes. Oursoftware allows the data owner to enforce access control on an item-level by managing thecorresponding keys. Data remains confidential even against the provider of the DiscoveryService. We present three ways of querying data and evaluate them with databasescontaining up to 50 million tuples.,Proceedings of the 17th ACM symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies,2012,6

The communication unit is configured tosend the hidden reference points and distance values to a system.,*,2012,6
secure computation in JavaScript,Axel Schroepfer; Florian Kerschbaum,Abstract Secure computation; eg using Yao's garbled circuit protocol; allows two parties tocompute arbitrary functions without disclosing their inputs. A profitable application of securecomputation is business optimization. It is characterized by a monetary benefit for allparticipants and a high confidentiality of their respective input data. In most instances theconsequences of input disclosure; eg loss of bargaining power; outweigh the benefits ofcollaboration. Therefore these optimizations are currently not performed in industrialpractice. Our demo shows such an optimization as a secure computation. The jointeconomic lot size (JELS) is the optimal order quantity between a buyer and supplier. Weimplemented Yao's protocol in JavaScript; such that it can be executed using two webbrowsers. This has the additional benefit that the software can be offered as a service …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Computer and communications security,2011,6
Computation on randomized data,Florian Kerschbaum,Abstract Cryptographic tools; such as secure computation or homomorphic encryption; arevery computationally expensive. This makes their use for confidentiality protection of client'sdata against an untrusted service provider uneconomical in most applications of cloudcomputing. In this paper we present techniques for randomizing data using light-weightoperations and then securely outsourcing the computation to a server. We discuss how toformally assess the security of our approach and present linear programming as a casestudy.,Workshop on Cryptography and Security in Clouds,2011,6
Improving practical performance on secure and private collaborative linear programming,Rafael Deitos; Florian Kerschbaum,Although information sharing in supply chain management dramatically reduces costs;parties are reluctant to do so; mainly due to fear of information leakage. Solutions based onsecure multi-party computation guarantee privacy and correctness; at an extracommunication and computation cost. Efficiency is a major concern for practical solutions.The best known solution with public indexes selection is due to Li and Atallah. It has thedrawback of requiring a secure permutation on every round of the protocol; which turns to bevery expensive. We therefore; propose a probability-based technique to reduce the numberof secure permutations required by such solution; improving overall practical performance.,Database and Expert Systems Application; 2009.

Average-complexity ideal-security order-preserving encryption,*,Embodiments provide ideal security; order-preserving encryption (OPE) of data of averagecomplexity; thereby allowing processing of the encrypted data (eg at a database server inresponse to received queries). Particular embodiments achieve high encryption efficiency byprocessing plaintext in the order preserved by an existing compression dictionary alreadyavailable to a database. Encryption is based upon use of a binary search tree of n nodes; toconstruct an order-preserving encryption scheme having Ω (n) complexity and even O (n); inthe average case. A probability of computationally intensive updating (which rendersconventional OPE impractical for ideal security) is substantially reduced by leveraging thedemonstrated tendency of a height of the binary search tree to be tightly centered around O(log n). An embodiment utilizing such an encryption scheme is described in the context of …,*,2015,5

Secure sharing of item-level data in the cloud,Florian Kerschbaum; Leonardo Weiss Ferreira Chaves,Companies can optimize their supply chain if they exchange item-level data; ie specific dataabout each item gathered with the help of Radio Frequency Identification or 2D bar codes.However; business critical information might be inferred from this data; eg strategic relationsor best practices. Therefore; companies are reluctant to share item-level data. In this paperwe discuss requirements for an encryption scheme for exchanging item-level data by storingit in a cloud-based data repository. We envision a system that allows the data owner toenforce access control on an item-level. And data should remain confidential even againstthe cloud service provider.,Cloud Computing (CLOUD); 2011 IEEE International Conference on,2011,5
Poly-logarithmic range queries on encrypted data with small leakage,Florian Hahn; Florian Kerschbaum,Abstract Privacy-preserving range queries allow encrypting data while still enabling querieson ciphertexts if their corresponding plaintexts fall within a requested range. This provides adata owner the possibility to outsource data collections to a cloud service provider withoutsacrificing privacy nor losing functionality of filtering this data. However; existing methods forrange queries either leak additional information (like the ordering of the complete data set)or slow down the search process tremendously by requiring to query each ciphertext in thedata collection. We present a novel scheme that only leaks the access pattern whilesupporting amortized poly-logarithmic search time. Our construction is based on the novelidea of enabling the cloud service provider to compare requested range queries. By doingso; the cloud service provider can use the access pattern to speed-up search time for …,Proceedings of the 2016 ACM on Cloud Computing Security Workshop,2016,4
Encrypting analytical web applications,Benny Fuhry; Walter Tighzert; Florian Kerschbaum,Abstract The software-as-a-service (SaaS) market is growing very fast; but still many clientsare concerned about the confidentiality of their data in the cloud. Motivated hackers ormalicious insiders could try to steal the clients' data. Encryption is a potential solution; butsupporting the necessary functionality also in existing applications is difficult. In this paper;we examine encrypting analytical web applications that perform extensive numberprocessing operations in the database. Existing solutions for encrypting data in webapplications poorly support such encryption. We employ a proxy that adjusts the encryptionto the level necessary for the client's usage and also supports additively homomorphicencryption. This proxy is deployed at the client and all encryption keys are stored andmanaged there; while the application is running in the cloud.

Oblivious outsourcing of garbled circuit generation,Florian Kerschbaum,Abstract Yao's garbled circuit technique is often used in outsourced computation. Currentapproaches divide the computation to two or more servers. The assumption is that theservers collaborate in offering the outsourced computation; but do not share data. Thisseems somewhat paradoxical in the current cloud economy. We therefore propose obliviousoutsourcing where one server is unaware that other servers are involved. We present agarbled circuit generation outsourcing scheme built on lattice-based cryptographyimplementing this model. Our scheme does not increase the cost of circuit evaluation; butachieves a speed up of 98%(factor 55) for circuit generation.,Proceedings of the 30th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2015,4

An information-flow type-system for mixed protocol secure computation,Florian Kerschbaum,Abstract There are a number of domain-specific programming languages for securecomputation. Out of those; the ones that are based on generic programming languagessupport mixing different protocol primitives and enable implementing a wider; possibly moreefficient range of protocols. On the one hand; this may result in better protocol performance.On the other hand; this may lead to insecure protocols. In this paper we present a securitytype system that enables mixing protocol primitives in a generic programming language; butalso ensures that well-typed programs are secure in the semi-honest model. Consequently;a compiled protocol must be secure. We show an extension of the L1 language with oursecurity type system and evaluate the implementation of two protocols from the literature.This shows that our type system supports the provably secure implementation even of …,Proceedings of the 8th ACM SIGSAC symposium on Information; computer and communications security,2013,4
k-anonymous Reputation,Sebastian Clauß; Stefan Schiffner; Florian Kerschbaum,Abstract While performing pure e-business transactions such as purchasing software ormusic; customers can act anonymously supported by; eg; anonymous communicationprotocols and anonymous payment protocols. However; it is hard to establish trust relationsamong anonymously acting business partners. Anonymous reputation systems have beenproposed to mitigate this problem. Schiffner et al. recently proved that there is a conflictbetween anonymity and reputation and they established the non-existence of certain privacy-preserving reputation functions. In this paper we argue that this relationship is even moreintricate. First; we present a reputation function that deanonymizes the user; yet providesstrong anonymity (SA) according to their definitions. However; this reputation function has noutility; ie; the submitted ratings have no influence on the resulting reputation values …,Proceedings of the 8th ACM SIGSAC symposium on Information; computer and communications security,2013,4

Towards privacy-preserving XML transformation,Meiko Jensen; Florian Kerschbaum,In composite web services one can only either hide the identities of the participants orprovide end-to-end confidentiality via encryption. For a designer of inter-organizationalbusiness processes this implies that she either needs to reveal her suppliers or force hercustomers to reveal their information. In this paper we present a solution to the encrypteddata modification problem and reconciliate this apparent conflict. Using a generic sender-transformer-recipient example scenario; we illustrate the steps required for applying XMLtransformations to encrypted data; present the cryptographic building blocks; and give anoutlook on advantages and weaknesses of the proposed encryption scheme. Thetransformer is then able to offer composite services without itself learning the content of themessages.,Web Services (ICWS); 2011 IEEE International Conference on,2011,4
Privacy-preserving outsourced profiling,Debmalya Biswas; Stephan Haller; Florian Kerschbaum,Personalized services attract high-value customers. Knowing the preferences and habits ofan individual customer; it is possible to offer to that customer well customized and adaptedservices; matching his needs and desires. This is advantageous for the entity offering theservice (eg; a retailer) as well; as it helps in creating additional sales or improve customerretention. The main unsolved problem today is that the profile of each individual customerwould be necessary in order to create such services; posing severe risks regarding privacyand data protection. This paper proposes efficient encryption schemes that allow profiling tobe outsourced while preserving privacy. The schemes ensure that the customer is always incontrol of his profile data; at the same time making shopping data across multiple retailersavailable to third party service providers to be able to provide targeted services.,Commerce and Enterprise Computing (CEC); 2010 IEEE 12th Conference on,2010,4
Parallelizing secure linear programming,Rafael Deitos; Florian Kerschbaum,Abstract Information sharing in supply chain management can dramatically improve theperformance of the supply chain. Although many such problems can be modeled andefficiently solved using linear programming (LP); security requirements prevent theirimplementation in the traditional way. Companies are simply reluctant to exchange suchsensitive information. Secure multi-party computation can help by realizing protocols withguaranteed security. However; efficiency is a major concern. Parallel computing presents anopportunity to improve performance utilizing inherent parallel secure operations.

Privacy-preserving logical vector clocks using secure computation techniques,Florian Kerschbaum; Julien Vayssiere,Systems of logical clocks are commonly found in distributed systems for establishingcausality between events occurring in concurrent communicating processes. Vector clocksare a popular type of logical clocks which require processes to attach to each message alogical timestamp that contains information about the sender process's view of the state ofthe distributed computation at the time of message sending. Causality between two eventscan then be determined by comparing their two logical timestamps. However; by doing so;processes leak potentially sensitive information about the advancement of their computationand the computations performed by the processes they communicate with. The contributionpresented in this paper is a protocol; based on secure computation techniques; whichpreserves the privacy of each process's local logical clock while being strictly equivalent …,Parallel and Distributed Systems; 2007 International Conference on,2007,4

Privacy-preserving observation in public spaces,Florian Kerschbaum; Hoon Wei Lim,Abstract One method of privacy-preserving accounting or billing in cyber-physical systems;such as electronic toll collection or public transportation ticketing; is to have the user presentan encrypted record of transactions and perform the accounting or billing computationsecurely on them. Honesty of the user is ensured by spot checking the record for someselected surveyed transactions. But how much privacy does that give the user; ie how manytransactions need to be surveyed? It turns out that due to collusion in mass surveillance alltransactions need to be observed; ie this method of spot checking provides no privacy at all.In this paper we present a cryptographic solution to the spot checking problem in cyber-physical systems.

Optimizations for Risk-Aware Secure Supply Chain Master Planning.,Axel Schröpfer; Florian Kerschbaum; Christoph G Schütz; Richard Pibernik,Abstract: Supply chain master planning strives for optimally aligned production;warehousing and transportation decisions across a multiple number of partners. Itsexecution in practice is limited by business partners' reluctance to share their vital businessdata. Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMC) can be used to make such collaborativecomputations privacy-preserving by applying cryptographic techniques. Thus; computationbecomes acceptable in practice; but the performance of SMC remains critical for real world-sized problems. We assess the disclosure risk of the input and output data and then apply aprotection level appropriate for the risk under the assumption that SMC at lower protectionlevels can be performed faster. This speeds up the secure computation and enablessignificant improvements in the supply chain.,J. UCS,2009,3

Leakage quantification of cryptographic operations,Michael Wibmer; Debmalya Biswas; Florian Kerschbaum,Abstract Perfectly secure protocols are often too inefficient performance wise to be used in apractical setting. On the other hand; an insecure (but faster) protocol might be deemedsecure for a particular setting. Recent research has thus focused on precise leakagequantification of a security protocol. In this context; we first give precise leakagequantification of a basic cryptographic primitive; that of multiplicative hiding.

Privacy-preserving multi-objective evolutionary algorithms,Daniel Funke; Florian Kerschbaum,Abstract Existing privacy-preserving evolutionary algorithms are limited to specific problemssecuring only cost function evaluation. This lack of functionality and security prevents theiruse for many security sensitive business optimization problems; such as our use case incollaborative supply chain management. We present a technique to construct privacy-preserving algorithms that address multi-objective problems and secure the entire algorithmincluding survivor selection. We improve performance over Yao's protocol for privacy-preserving algorithms and achieve solution quality only slightly inferior to the multi-objectiveevolutionary algorithm NSGA-II.,International Conference on Parallel Problem Solving from Nature,2010,2

Legally Sustainable Solutions for Privacy Issues in Collaborative Fraud Detection,Ulrich Flegel; Florian Kerschbaum; Philip Miseldine; Ganna Monakova; Richard Wacker; Frank Leymann,Abstract One company by itself cannot detect all instances of fraud or insider attacks. Anexample is the simple case of buyer fraud: a fraudulent buyer colludes with a suppliercreating fake orders for supplies that are never delivered. They circumvent internal controlsin place to prevent this kind of fraud; such as a goods receipt; eg; by ordering servicesinstead of goods. Based on the evidence collected at one company; it is often extremelydifficult to detect such fraud; but if companies collaborate and correlate their evidence; theycould detect that the ordered services have never actually been provided.,*,2010,2
CCSW 2015: The 7th ACM Cloud Computing Security Workshop,Florian Kerschbaum; Cristina Nita-Rotaru; Indrajit Ray,Abstract Notwithstanding the latest buzzwords (grid; cloud; utility computing; SaaS; etc.);large-scale computing and cloud-like deployment are the fastest growing computinginfrastructures today. How exactly they will look like tomorrow is still for the markets todecide; yet one thing has already been identified: clouds have new; untested deployment;associated adversarial models and vulnerabilities and hence a very different threatlandscape. It is essential that our community becomes involved in shaping the future securityof cloud computing.

Efficient secure computation optimization,Raphael Urmoneit; Florian Kerschbaum,Abstract Secure computation has high computational resource requirements during run-time. Secure computation optimization can lower these requirements; but has highcomputational resource requirements during compile-time. This prevents automaticoptimization of most larger secure computations. In this paper we present an efficientoptimization algorithm that does no longer require the use of a theorem prover. For a securecomputation with m statements of which n are branching statements we lower the complexityfrom O (2^(2^ n) m) to O (m^ 5 2^ n). Using an implementation of our algorithm we canextend automatic optimization to further examples such as the AES key schedule.,Proceedings of the First ACM workshop on Language support for privacy-enhancing technologies,2013,1
Toward value-based control of knowledge sharing in networked services design,Ernesto Damiani; Gabriele Gianini; Florian Kerschbaum; Richard Pibernik,The notion of cooperative; service-based processes is a crucial one for achieving highflexibility in designing and deploying inter-organizational business applications. However;inter-organizational business processes are known to be prone to a number of security risks.Research on secure distributed computing has traditionally focused on attacks delivered byoutsiders; but a major source of risk for business processes is hostile or dysfunctionalbehaviour of insiders. In particular; the sharing of knowledge that inevitably takes place incooperative business processes is a major source of risk; as selfish or malicious actors canextract knowledge from the process' information flows they have access to and use it for theirown advantage. This disclosure risk depends on the specific business process and on thevalue of disclosed information; which changes over time. In this work; we outline the …,Prace Naukowe Uniwersytetu Ekonomicznego we Wrocławiu,2009,1
Risk-Aware Secure Supply Chain Master Planning.,Axel Schröpfer; Florian Kerschbaum; Dagmar Sadkowiak; Richard Pibernik,Abstract. Supply chain master planning strives for optimally aligned production;warehousing and transportation decisions across a multiple number of partners. Itsexecution in practice is limited by business partners' reluctance to share their vital businessdata. Secure Multi-Party Computation can be used to make such collaborative computationsprivacy-preserving by applying cryptographic techniques. Thus; computation becomesacceptable in practice but for additional cost of complexity depending on the protection levelchosen. Because not all data to be shared induces the same risk and demand for protection;we assess the risk of data elements individually and then apply an appropriate protection.This speeds up the secure computation and enables significant improvements in the supplychain.,WOSIS,2009,1
Secure Range Queries for Multiple Users,Anselme Tueno; Florian Kerschbaum,Abstract: Order-preserving encryption allows encrypting data; while still enabling efficientrange queries on the encrypted data. Moreover; it does not require any change to thedatabase management system; because comparison operates on ciphertexts as onplaintexts. This makes order-preserving encryption schemes very suitable for dataoutsourcing in cloud computing scenarios. However; all order-preserving encryptionschemes are necessarily symmetric limiting the use case to one client and one server.Imagine a scenario where a Data Owner encrypts its data before outsourcing it to the CloudService Provider and a Data Analyst wants to execute private range queries on this data.This scenario occurs in many cases of collaborative machine learning where data sourceand processor are different entities. Then either the Data Owner must reveal its encryption …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.01138,2018,*
Leakage-Free Order-Preserving Encryption,*,Abstract Embodiments implement leakage-free order-preserving encryption by assigning adistinct ciphertext for each plaintext; including repeated plaintext whose ciphertext israndomly inserted. In order to conceal insertion order; the randomized ciphertexts arecompressed to minimal ciphertext space. A uniform distribution is achieved by rotating abouta modulus on the ciphertexts rather than the plaintexts. The resulting ciphertext distributionhas no leakage from the ciphertexts—even if an adversary has perfect backgroundknowledge on the distribution of plaintexts. The encryption may be further secured evenagainst passive query monitoring attacks by hiding the access pattern using ε; δ-differentialprivacy; such that the adversary observing a sequence of queries will not learn thefrequency of plaintext. The leakage-free order-preserving encryption may be converted …,*,2018,*
Privacy and Integrity Considerations in Hyperconnected Autonomous Vehicles,Stamatis Karnouskos; Florian Kerschbaum,The rapid advances in technology can be witnessed in the emergence of cyber–physicalsystems that pertain to several domains of our society. In transportation; we see theemergence of self-driving vehicles that utilize a multitude of sensors and intelligent learningtechniques to navigate autonomously. Such vehicles are complex cyber–physical systemsthat are mobile and due to their sensor and intrinsic intelligence are able to collect; analyze;and capitalize upon an unprecedented amount of fine-grained data; as well as collaborate inreal time with multiple stakeholders. Although such rich data can play a key role in data-driven economies of scale; this raises questions with respect to privacy-and integrity-dependent scenarios. In this work; the feasibility of ensuring integrity; and hence safety;while preserving privacy in the emerging hyperconnected vehicle scenarios is discussed …,Proceedings of the IEEE,2018,*
Selective access for supply chain management in the cloud,Anselme Tueno; Florian Kerschbaum; Daniel Bernau; Sara Foresti,Object-level tracking along supply chains; enabled by the low-cost and wide availability ofRadio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology; permits companies to collect largeamounts of data (eg; time; location; handling) about the goods they produce. Combining thedata collected by the different companies along a supply chain can provide considerableadvantages to all of them. However; such a sharing sometimes needs to be selective.Indeed; companies may need to keep some information about their business operationssecret. In this paper; we propose a solution that enables selective sharing of data collectedalong a supply chain. Our solution uses the services offered by cloud providers for sharingdata among companies; and relies on selective encryption for enforcing access restrictionsover such data.,Communications and Network Security (CNS); 2017 IEEE Conference on,2017,*
Computation on Encrypted Data using Data Flow Authentication,Andreas Fischer; Benny Fuhry; Florian Kerschbaum; Eric Bodden,Abstract: Encrypting data before sending it to the cloud protects it against hackers andmalicious insiders; but requires the cloud to compute on encrypted data. Trusted (hardware)modules; eg; secure enclaves like Intel's SGX; can very efficiently run entire programs inencrypted memory. However; it already has been demonstrated that software vulnerabilitiesgive an attacker ample opportunity to insert arbitrary code into the program. This code canthen modify the data flow of the program and leak any secret in the program to an observerin the cloud via SGX side-channels. Since any larger program is rife with softwarevulnerabilities; it is not a good idea to outsource entire programs to an SGX enclave. Asecure alternative with a small trusted code base would be fully homomorphic encryption(FHE)--the holy grail of encrypted computation. However; due to its high computational …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.00390,2017,*
An Efficiently Searchable Encrypted Data Structure for Range Queries,Florian Kerschbaum; Anselme Tueno,Abstract: At CCS 2015 Naveed et al. presented first attacks on efficiently searchableencryption; such as deterministic and order-preserving encryption. These plaintext guessingattacks have been further improved in subsequent work; eg by Grubbs et al. in 2016. Suchcryptanalysis is crucially important to sharpen our understanding of the implications ofsecurity models. In this paper we present an efficiently searchable; encrypted data structurethat is provably secure against these and even more powerful chosen plaintext attacks. Ourdata structure supports logarithmic-time search with linear space complexity. The indices ofour data structure can be used to search by standard comparisons and hence allow easyretrofitting to existing database management systems. We implemented our scheme andshow that its search time overhead is only 10 milliseconds compared to non-secure …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.09314,2017,*
Searchable Encryption to Reduce Encryption Degradation in Adjustably Encrypted Databases,Florian Kerschbaum; Martin Härterich,Abstract Processing queries on encrypted data protects sensitive data stored in clouddatabases. CryptDB has introduced the approach of adjustable encryption for suchprocessing. A database column is adjusted to the necessary level of encryption; eg order-preserving; for the set of executed queries; but never reversed. This has the drawback thatlong running cloud databases will eventually transform into only order-preserving encrypteddatabases. In this paper we propose searchable encryption as an alternative in order toreduce this encryption degradation. It maintains security while only marginally impactingperformance when applied only to infrequently used queries for searching. We present abudget-based encryption selection algorithm as part of query planning for making theappropriate choice between searchable and deterministic or order-preserving encryption …,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2017,*

Strain: A Secure Auction for Blockchains,Erik-Oliver Blass; Florian Kerschbaum,We present Strain; a new auction protocol running on top of blockchains and guaranteeingbid confidentiality against fully-malicious parties. As our goal is efficiency and lowblockchain latency; we abstain from using traditional; highly interactive MPC primitives suchas secret shares. Instead for Strain; we design a new maliciouslysecure two-partycomparison mechanism executed between any pair of bids in parallel. Using zero-knowledge proofs; Strain broadcasts the outcome of comparisons on the blockchain in away such that all parties can verify each outcome. The resulting latency is constant in boththe number of parties and the bid length; ie; asymptotically optimal. It is also low in practice;requiring only a total of 4 blocks. Strain also provides typical auction security requirementslike non-retractable bids against fully-malicious adversaries. Finally; it protects against …,*,*,*

Securing RFID-supported Supply Chains,Florian Kerschbaum; Manfred Aigner,Abstract. Modern RFID-supported supply chains envision a seamless sharing of item-leveldata across multiple supply chain participants in the “Internet of Things”. However; manycompanies are reluctant to propagate large amounts of their track and trace information toothers; as they fear the uncontrolled disclosure of vital business intelligence. Without built-insafeguards; such systems thus run the risk of hindering the adoption of efficient supply chainmanagement infrastructures. In this paper we will define the cornerstones of acryptographically sound security architecture for RFID-supported supply chains that willenable efficient logistical management with minimal data disclosure. We propose to replacethe common centralized track and trace approach with an architecture that makes use ofstrong cryptographic primitives and secure storage on the tag and builds on top of those …,*,*,*
Extending Searchable Encryption for Outsourced Data Analytics,Florian Kerschbaum; Alessandro Sorniotti,Abstract. Two sets of privacy requirements need to be fulfilled when a company's accountingdata is audited by an external party: the company needs to safeguard its data; while theauditors do not want to reveal their investigation methods. This problem is usuallyaddressed by physically isolating data and auditors during the course of an audit. Thisapproach however no longer works when auditing is performed remotely. In this paper wepresent an efficient construction for a searchable encryption scheme for outsourcing dataanalytics. In this scheme the data owner needs to encrypt his data only once and ship it inencrypted form to the data analyst. The data analyst can then perform a series of queries forwhich he must ask the data owner for help in translating the constants in the queries. Oursearchable encryption scheme extends previous work by the ability to re-use query …,*,*,*
Optimizations for Risk-Aware Secure Supply Chain Master Planning J.

Itsexecution in practice is limited by business partners' reluctance to share their vital businessdata. Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMC) can be used to make such collaborativecomputations privacy-preserving by applying cryptographic techniques. Thus; computationbecomes acceptable in practice; but the performance of SMC remains critical for real world-sized problems. We assess the disclosure risk of the input and output data and then apply aprotection level appropriate for the risk under the assumption that SMC at lower protectionlevels can be performed faster. This speeds up the secure computation and enablessignificant improvements in the supply chain.,*,*,*
