Social media; like Twitter; has been increasinglyused for exchanging information; opinions and emotions about events that are happeningacross the world. Here we propose a novel visualization design;“Whisper”; for tracing theprocess of information diffusion in social media in real time. Our design highlights threemajor characteristics of diffusion processes in social media: the temporal trend; social-spatial extent; and community response of a topic of interest. Such social; spatiotemporalprocesses are conveyed based on a sunflower metaphor whose seeds are often dispersedfar away. In Whisper; we summarize the collective responses of communities on a giventopic based on how tweets were retweeted by groups of users; through representing thesentiments extracted from the tweets; and tracing the pathways of retweets on a spatial …,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,2012,104
Facetatlas: Multifaceted visualization for rich text corpora,Nan Cao; Jimeng Sun; Yu-Ru Lin; David Gotz; Shixia Liu; Huamin Qu,Documents in rich text corpora usually contain multiple facets of information. For example;an article about a specific disease often consists of different facets such as symptom;treatment; cause; diagnosis; prognosis; and prevention. Thus; documents may have differentrelations based on different facets. Powerful search tools have been developed to helpusers locate lists of individual documents that are most related to specific keywords.However; there is a lack of effective analysis tools that reveal the multifaceted relations ofdocuments within or cross the document clusters. In this paper; we present FacetAtlas; amultifaceted visualization technique for visually analyzing rich text corpora.

Adaptive contextualization: Combating bias during high-dimensional visualization and data selection,David Gotz; Shun Sun; Nan Cao,Abstract Large and high-dimensional real-world datasets are being gathered across a widerange of application disciplines to enable data-driven decision making. Interactive datavisualization can play a critical role in allowing domain experts to select and analyze datafrom these large collections. However; there is a critical mismatch between the very largenumber of dimensions in complex real-world datasets and the much smaller number ofdimensions that can be concurrently visualized using modern techniques. This gap indimensionality can result in high levels of selection bias that go unnoticed by users. The biascan in turn threaten the very validity of any subsequent insights.

For example; the study of ancient documents and books are still a main approachfor us to studying the history and gaining knowledge from our predecessors. The invention ofthe Internet at the end of the last century significantly speed up the production of the textdata. Currently; millions of websites are generating extraordinary amount of online text dataeveryday. For example; Facebook; the world's largest social media platform; with the help ofover 1 billion monthly active users; is producing billions of posting messages everyday. Theexplosion of the data makes seeking information and understanding it difficult. Textvisualization techniques can be helpful for addressing these problems. In particular …,*,2016,5
Untangle map: Visual analysis of probabilistic multi-label data,Nan Cao; Yu-Ru Lin; David Gotz,Data with multiple probabilistic labels are common in many situations. For example; a moviemay be associated with multiple genres with different levels of confidence. Despite theirubiquity; the problem of visualizing probabilistic labels has not been adequately addressed.Existing approaches often either discard the probabilistic information; or map the data to alow-dimensional subspace where their associations with original labels are obscured. In thispaper; we propose a novel visual technique; UnTangle Map; for visualizing probabilisticmulti-labels. In our proposed visualization; data items are placed inside a web of connectedtriangles; with labels assigned to the triangle vertices such that nearby labels are morerelevant to each other. The positions of the data items are determined based on theprobabilistic associations between items and labels.

Is the whole greater than the sum of its parts?,Liangyue Li; Hanghang Tong; Yong Wang; Conglei Shi; Nan Cao; Norbou Buchler,Abstract The PART-WHOLE relationship routinely finds itself in many disciplines; rangingfrom collaborative teams; crowdsourcing; autonomous systems to networked systems. Fromthe algorithmic perspective; the existing work has primarily focused on predicting theoutcomes of the whole and parts; by either separate models or linear joint models; whichassume the outcome of the parts has a linear and independent effect on the outcome of thewhole. In this paper; we propose a joint predictive method named PAROLE tosimultaneously and mutually predict the part and whole outcomes. The proposed methodoffers two distinct advantages over the existing work. First (Model Generality); we formulatejoint PART-WHOLE outcome prediction as a generic optimization problem; which is able toencode a variety of complex relationships between the outcome of the whole and parts …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2017,3
Enhancing team composition in professional networks: Problem definitions and fast solutions,Liangyue Li; Hanghang Tong; Nan Cao; Kate Ehrlich; Yu-Ru Lin; Norbou Buchler,In this paper; we study ways to enhance the composition of teams based on newrequirements in a collaborative environment. We focus on recommending team memberswho can maintain the team's performance by minimizing changes to the team's skills andsocial structure. Our recommendations are based on computing team-level similarity; whichincludes skill similarity; structural similarity as well as the synergy between the two. Currentheuristic approaches are one-dimensional and not comprehensive; as they consider the twoaspects independently. To formalize team-level similarity; we adopt the notion of graphkernel of attributed graphs to encompass the two aspects and their interaction. To tackle thecomputational challenges; we propose a family of fast algorithms by (a) designing effectivepruning strategies; and (b) exploring the smoothness between the existing and the new …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2017,3

Experimental measurement of modulation transfer function of a retina-like sensor,Fan Wang; Fengmei Cao; Tingzhu Bai; Nan Cao; Changju Liu; Guangping Deng,The retina-like sensor is a kind of anthropomorphic visual sensor. It plays an important rolein both biological and machine vision due to its advantages of high resolution in the fovea; awide field-of-view; and minimum pixel count. The space-variant property of the sensormakes it difficult to directly measure its modulation transfer function (MTF). The MTF of aretina-like sensor is measured with the bar-target pattern method. According to the pixelarrangement; the sensor is divided into rings and the MTF of each ring is measured usingspoke targets with different periods. Comparison between the measured MTF and thetheoretical MTF of the sensor showed that they coincide. The differences between them arealso analyzed and discussed. The measured MTF helps to analyze the performance of animaging system containing a retina-like sensor.,Optical Engineering,2014,3

First: Fast interactive attributed subgraph matching,Boxin Du; Si Zhang; Nan Cao; Hanghang Tong,Abstract Attributed subgraph matching is a powerful tool for explorative mining of largeattributed networks. In many applications (eg; network science of teams; intelligenceanalysis; finance informatics); the user might not know what exactly s/he is looking for; andthus require the user to constantly revise the initial query graph based on what s/he findsfrom the current matching results. A major bottleneck in such an interactive matchingscenario is the efficiency; as simply rerunning the matching algorithm on the revised querygraph is computationally prohibitive. In this paper; we propose a family of effective andefficient algorithms (FIRST) to support interactive attributed subgraph matching. There aretwo key ideas behind the proposed methods.

However; training a good CNN model can stillbe a challenging task. In a training process; a CNN model typically learns a large number ofparameters over time; which usually results in different performance. Often; it is difficult toexplore the relationships between the learned parameters and the model performance dueto a large number of parameters and different random initializations.

Discovering rare categories from graph streams,Dawei Zhou; Arun Karthikeyan; Kangyang Wang; Nan Cao; Jingrui He,Abstract Nowadays; massive graph streams are produced from various real-worldapplications; such as financial fraud detection; sensor networks; wireless networks. Incontrast to the high volume of data; it is usually the case that only a small percentage ofnodes within the time-evolving graphs might be of interest to people. Rare categorydetection (RCD) is an important topic in data mining; focusing on identifying the initialexamples from the rare classes in imbalanced data sets. However; most existing techniquesfor RCD are designed for static data sets; thus not suitable for time-evolving data. In thispaper; we introduce a novel setting of RCD on time-evolving graphs. To address thisproblem; we propose two incremental algorithms; SIRD and BIRD; which are constructedupon existing density-based techniques for RCD.

Interactive datavisualization can play a critical role in allowing domain experts to select and analyze datafrom these large collections. However; there is a critical mismatch between the very largenumber of dimensions in complex real-world datasets and the much smaller number ofdimensions that can be concurrently visualized using modern techniques.

Multi-faceted visualization of rich text corpora,*,Methods and apparatus are provided for multi-faceted visualization of rich text corpora. Adata set comprising a plurality of entities; facets and relations is visualized by generating avisualization of a plurality of the facets in the data set; wherein the visualization indicatesconnections along the plurality of the facets in a single view using multi-faceted edges. Theentities are instances of a particular concept; the facets are classes of entities and therelations are connections between pairs of the entities. A compound node comprises arepresentation of a primary entity; surrounded by representations of one or more secondaryentities connected by one or more external relations. The internal relations can berepresented as edges connecting two facet nodes from different compound nodes and anumber of crossings of the edges can be reduced by adjusting a position order of facet …,*,2016,*
Visualizing Document Similarity,Nan Cao; Weiwei Cui,Abstract A large category of text visualization techniques were developed to illustratesimilarities of document files in a corpus. This is the most traditional research direction in thisfield. These techniques produce visualizations in a similar form in which document files arerepresented as points on the display sized by their importance and colored or shaped bytheir semantics (such as topics). The screen distance between any pair of points indicatesthe similarities of the corresponding documents that are captured by different measures indifferent analysis models; following the rule of the closer; the more similar. Two major typesof approaches: projection (ie; dimension reduction)-based methods and semantic-orienteddocument visualizations; are proposed to produce such a document overview; theseapproaches are developed based on different data and analysis models.

Visualizing Document Content,Nan Cao; Weiwei Cui,Abstract Text is primarily made of words and always meant to contain content for informationdelivery. Content analysis is the earliest established method of text analysis (Holsti et al.;The handbook of social psychology; vol 2; pp 596–692; 1968 [55]). Although studiedextensively and systematically by linguists; related disciplines are roughly divided into twocategories; structure and substance; according to their subjects of study (Ansari; Dimensionsin discourse: elementary to essentials. Xlibris Corporation; Bloomington; 2013 [9]). Structureis about the surface characteristics that are visible for a valid text; such as word co-occurrence; text reuse; and grammar structure. On the other hand; substance is the umbrellaterm for all information that needs to be inferred from text; such as fingerprinting; topics; andevents. Various techniques have been proposed to analyze these aspects. In this chapter …,*,2016,*
Data Model,Nan Cao; Weiwei Cui,Abstract In text data; the semantic relationships among keywords; sentences; paragraphs;sections; chapters; and documents are usually implicit. A reader must go through the entirecorpus to capture insights such as relationships among characters in a novel; eventcausalities in news reports; and evolution of topics in research articles. The difficultiesusually arise from the unstructured nature of text data as well as the low informationacquisition efficiency of reading these unstructured texts. Therefore; how to convertunstructured text data into a structured form to facilitate understanding and cognitionbecomes an important problem that has attracted considerable research interest. In thischapter; we introduce the data models that are frequently used in current text visualizationtechniques. We review low-level data structures such as bag of words; the structures at …,*,2016,*
Visualizing Sentiments and Emotions,Nan Cao; Weiwei Cui,Abstract Sentiment analysis; also known as opinion mining; is one of the most important textmining tasks and has been widely used for analyzing; for example; reviews or social mediadata for various of applications; including marketing and customer service.

Understanding Care Plans of Community Acquired Pneumonia Based on Sankey Diagram,David Gotz; Bo Jin; Hongyuan Zha; Linhua Shu; Nan Cao,Abstract A care plan is a sequence of medical interventions formulated for curing a specifieddisease. Doctors usually craft different care plans for different patients based on theirknowledge and experience as well as following the clinical guidelines. An intuitivesummarization of previous successful care plans not only provides doctors a reference ofsuccessful treatment guidelines; but also helps with the detection of anomalous treatmentsand the improvement of existing care plans. However; producing such kind of summarizationis challenging due to the complexity of the data; ie; large; temporal oriented; andmultidimensional. In this paper; we propose a Sankey diagram-based visualization design tovisually summarize care plans based on our medical collaborators' requirements.

Dydruma: A Dynamic Drug Map for Exploring the Associations Among Drug Therapeutic Indications and Side-Effects,Fei Wang; Ping Zhang; Nan Cao; Jianying Hu; Robert Sorrentino,Abstract Inferring potential therapeutic indications and identifying clinically important side-effects are both important and challenging tasks in modern drug development. Previousstudies have utilized drug chemical structures and protein targets to construct predictivemodels for both tasks. According to our study; the drug therapeutic information itself is highlypredictive for side-effects; and drug side-effect information highly predictive of therapeuticindication. This confirms that there exist underlying associations among drug therapeuticindications and side-effects. Exploring these associations can lead to better understandingof the drugs as well as more informed hypotheses for drug repositioning and adverse effectmonitoring. In practice however; it is impractical to check all possible associations using anexhaustive list. In this study; we present Dydruma; a dynamic drug map which encodes …,*,*,*
