Adaptive web search based on user profile constructed without any effort from users,Kazunari Sugiyama; Kenji Hatano; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract Web search engines help users find useful information on the World Wide Web(WWW). However; when the same query is submitted by different users; typical searchengines return the same result regardless of who submitted the query. Generally; each userhas different information needs for his/her query. Therefore; the search result should beadapted to users with different information needs. In this paper; we first propose severalapproaches to adapting search results according to each user's need for relevantinformation without any user effort; and then verify the effectiveness of our proposedapproaches. Experimental results show that search systems that adapt to each user'spreferences can be achieved by constructing user profiles based on modified collaborativefiltering with detailed analysis of user's browsing history in one day.,Proceedings of the 13th international conference on World Wide Web,2004,921
XRel: a path-based approach to storage and retrieval of XML documents using relational databases,Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Toshiyuki Amagasa; Takeyuki Shimura; Shunsuke Uemura,Abstract This article describes XRel; a novel approach for storage and retrieval of XMLdocuments using relational databases. In this approach; an XML document is decomposedinto nodes on the basis of its tree structure and stored in relational tables according to thenode type; with path information from the root to each node. XRel enables us to store XMLdocuments using a fixed relational schema without any information about DTDs and also toutilize indices such as the B+-tree and the R-tree supported by database managementsystems. Thus; XRel does not need any extension of relational databases for storing XMLdocuments. For processing XML queries; we present an algorithm for translating a coresubset of XPath expressions into SQL queries. Finally; we demonstrate the effectiveness ofthis approach through several experiments using actual XML documents.,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,2001,821
The A-tree: An index structure for high-dimensional spaces using relative approximation,Yasushi Sakurai; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura; Haruhiko Kojima,Abstract We propose a novel index structure; A-tree (Approximation tree); for similaritysearch of high-dimensional data. The basic idea of the A-tree is the introduction of VirtualBounding Rectangles (VBRs); which contain and approximate MBRs and data objects.VBRs can be represented rather compactly; and thus affect the tree configuration bothquantitatively and qualitatively. Firstly; since tree nodes can install large number of entries ofVBRs; fanout of nodes becomes large; thus leads to fast search. More importantly; we havea free hand in arranging MBRs and VBRs in tree nodes. In the A-trees; nodes contain entriesof an MBR and its children VBRs. Therefore; by fetching a node of an A-tree; we can obtainthe information of exact position of a parent MBR and approximate position of its children.We have performed experiments using both synthetic and real data sets.

Storage and retrieval of XML documents using object-relational databases,Takeyuki Shimura; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Abstract This paper describes general storage and retrieval methods for XML documentsusing object-relational databases. The storage method decomposes tree structure of XMLdocuments into nodes; and stores them in relational tables according to the node types. Byusing this method; being independent of DTDs or element types; any XML documents canbe stored in databases. Also it is possible to utilize index structures (eg B+ trees; R trees;etc.) which are provided in database management systems. As for retrieval; we show thetransformation of XQL queries into SQL queries. It is possible to realize the storage methodby doing minimal extension to object-relational databases and the retrieval method byadding a preprocessor of a query language. We also performed experiments using XMLdocuments on the plays of Shakespeare; to show the effectiveness of our methods.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,1999,246
FTW: fast similarity search under the time warping distance,Yasushi Sakurai; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract Time-series data naturally arise in countless domains; such as meteorology;astrophysics; geology; multimedia; and economics. Similarity search is very popular; andDTW (Dynamic Time Warping) is one of the two prevailing distance measures. AlthoughDTW incurs a heavy computation cost; it provides scaling along the time axis. In this paper;we propose FTW (Fast search method for dynamic Time Warping); which guarantees nofalse dismissals in similarity query processing. FTW efficiently prunes a significant number ofthe search cost. Experiments on real and synthetic sequence data sets reveals that FTW issignificantly faster than the best existing method; up to 222 times.,Proceedings of the twenty-fourth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2005,239

QRS: A robust numbering scheme for XML documents,Toshiyuki Amagasa; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Update management of XML documents is an increasingly important research issue in XMLdatabases; because contents of XML documents evolve as time goes by. Even though; XMLdatabases should be able to effectively process XML queries as well as updates on thedocuments. We propose a robust node-numbering scheme for XML documents named QRS(quartering-regions scheme). In QRS; reefs (regions expressed by floating-point numbers); avariant of regions; are used for expressing node-numbers. Reefs are almost compatible toregions; and thus they can be used for detecting ancestor-descendant relationship amongnodes for the purpose of efficient query processing. Moreover; reefs can cope with updatesby utilizing gaps between reefs in terms of floating-point numbers. Consequently; we canavoid node renumbering as much as possible.,Data Engineering; 2003.

An XML indexing structure with relative region coordinate,Dao Dinh Kha; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,For most of the index structures for XML data proposed so far; updating is a problem;because an XML element's coordinates are expressed using absolute values. Due to thestructural relationship among the elements in XML documents; we have to re-compute theseabsolute values if the content of the source data is updated. The reconstruction requires theupdating of a large portion of the index files; which causes a serious problem; especiallywhen the XML data content is updated frequently. In this paper; we propose an indexingstructure scheme based on the relative region coordinates that can effectively deal with theupdate problem. The main idea is that we express the coordinates of an XML element basedon the region of its parent element. We present an algorithm to construct a tree-structuredindex in which related coordinates are stored together. In consequence; our indexing …,Data Engineering; 2001.

A data model for temporal XML documents,Toshiyuki Amagasa; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Abstract XML is expected to become the next generation standard language for exchangingdata over the Internet. In general; the contents of XML documents may change as time goesby; and then; it is important to capture entire histories of those documents. In this paper; wepropose a logical data model for representing histories of XML documents. The proposedmodel extends the XPath data model; and is capable of representing change histories ofXML documents. Various alternative approaches to the physical implementation of themodel are also presented.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2000,128
Schema virtualization in object-oriented databases,Katsumi Tanaka; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Kozo Ishihara,A description is given of the concept and implementation techniques of schema virtualizationin object-oriented databases. The objective of schema virtualization is to provide users withmultiple views of a database. First; the notions of virtual classes and virtual schemata; whichare natural extension of views in relational databases; is introduced. Then; procedures toconvert a schema into a virtual one; as well as rules schemata and their conversion shouldsatisfy; are discussed. The key issue of the design of virtual classes and virtual schemata is'regarding procedures as objects'. Closure properties of classes and schemata are alsodiscussed. Finally; several implementation techniques for realizing schema virtualization inSmalltalk-80 are presented.,Data Engineering; 1988. Proceedings. Fourth International Conference on,1988,88
Refinement of TF-IDF schemes for web pages using their hyperlinked neighboring pages,Kazunari Sugiyama; Kenji Hatano; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Abstract In IR (information retrieval) systems based on the vector space model; the TF-IDFscheme is widely used to characterize documents. However; in the case of documents withhyperlink structures such as Web pages; it is necessary to develop a technique forrepresenting the contents of Web pages more accurately by exploiting the contents of theirhyperlinked neighboring pages. In this paper; we first propose several approaches torefining the TF-IDF scheme for a target Web page by using the contents of its hyperlinkedneighboring pages; and then compare the retrieval accuracy of our proposed approaches.Experimental results show that; generally; more accurate feature vectors of a target Webpage can be generated in the case of utilizing the contents of its hyperlinked neighboringpages at levels up to second in the backward direction from the target page.,Proceedings of the fourteenth ACM conference on Hypertext and hypermedia,2003,78
Query processing for distributed databases using generalized semi-joins,Yahiko Kambayashi; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shuzo Yajima,Abstract In distributed database systems; the cost to process a query is mainly determinedby the amount of communication. Semi-join is a very useful tool to reduce the cost of joins insuch systems. There are; however; queries called cyclic ones which cannot be processed bysemi-joins only. In this paper the concept of generalized semi-joins is introduced to solvesuch a problem. To handle an arbitrary cyclic query; first a spanning tree is selected in thecorresponding query graph and then generalized semi-joins are applied in the orderdetermined by the tree. Processing of cyclic queries; however; requires more communicationcost than processing of tree queries; since in the former case we need to transmit attributevalues which are not required in the latter case. A procedure to reduce the communicationcost of such additional data is developed; which will make the generalized semi-join …,Proceedings of the 1982 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,1982,78
Fast mining and forecasting of complex time-stamped events,Yasuko Matsubara; Yasushi Sakurai; Christos Faloutsos; Tomoharu Iwata; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract Given huge collections of time-evolving events such as web-click logs; whichconsist of multiple attributes (eg; URL; userID; times-tamp); how do we find patterns andtrends? How do we go about capturing daily patterns and forecasting future events? Weneed two properties:(a) effectiveness; that is; the patterns should help us understand thedata; discover groups; and enable forecasting; and (b) scalability; that is; the method shouldbe linear with the data size. We introduce TriMine; which performs three-way mining for allthree attributes; namely; URLs; users; and time. Specifically TriMine discovers hidden topics;groups of URLs; and groups of users; simultaneously. Thanks to its concise but effectivesummarization; it makes it possible to accomplish the most challenging and important task;namely; to forecast future events.

The L-index: An indexing structure for efficient subsequence matching in time sequence databases,Yuu Morinaka; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Toshiyuki Amagasa; Shunsuke Uemura,Abstract We propose a novel indexing structure; L-index; for searching similar patterns inlarge time sequences efficiently. L-index is a sequence of line segments which compactlyapproximates the original data sequence. A line segment is used to approximate asubsequence of the original data sequence until the accumulated error exceeds a thresholdvalue. By scanning the L-index; we can quickly find approximate answers of similarityqueries. An important feature of the L-index is that approximate answers are guaranteed toinclude exact answers. it does not produce false dismissal. Our experimental result showsthat the L-index does not require much storage area and process similarity queriesefficiently.,Proc. 5th PacificAisa Conf. on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2001,76
Query term disambiguation for Web cross-language information retrieval using a search engine,Akira Maeda; Fatiha Sadat; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Abstract With the worldwide growth of the Internet; research on Cross-Language InformationRetrieval (CLIR) is being paid much attention. Existing CLIR approaches based on querytranslation require parallel corpora or comparable corpora for the disambiguation oftranslated query terms. However; those natural language resources are not readilyavailable. In this paper; we propose a disambiguation method for dictionary-based querytranslation that is independent of the availability of such scarce language resources; whileachieving adequate retrieval effectiveness by utilizing Web documents as a corpus andusing co-occurrence information between terms within that corpus. In the experiments; ourmethod achieved 97% of manual translation case in terms of the average precision.,Proceedings of the fifth international workshop on on Information retrieval with Asian languages,2000,68
An efficiently updatable index scheme for structured documents,Hirotaka Kanemoto; Hiroyuki Kato; Hiroko Kinutani; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,We propose an efficiently updatable index scheme for XML documents. This index schemeconsists of four types of indices. Content index manages occurrence positions of words;element names; attribute names and attribute values. Local structure index manages logicalstructure of each document. Global structure index summarizes logical structure of documentinstances for a DTD. The last one is called structure meta index; and keeps; for eachelement; the number of local structure indices and global structure indices which include theelement. Using our four types of indices; therefore; a wide range of queries over structureddocuments can be processed efficiently. We compare our indices with existing indices interms of index size; update cost and retrieval cost.,Database and Expert Systems Applications; 1998. Proceedings. Ninth International Workshop on,1998,58
A path-based relational RDF database,Akiyoshi Matono; Toshiyuki Amagasa; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Abstract We propose a path-based scheme for storage and retrieval of RDF data using arelational database. The Semantic Web is much anticipated as the next-generation webwhere high-level processing of web resources are enabled by underlying metadatadescribed in RDF format. A typical application of RDF is to describe ontologies ordictionaries; but in such applications; the size of RDF data is large. As large-size RDF dataare emerging and their number is increasing; RDF databases that can manage large-sizeRDF data are becoming ever more important. To date; some RDF databases have alreadybeen proposed; however; they have critical problems: the performance of path queries isinsufficient and they cannot discriminate between schema data and instance data. In thispaper; as a solution to these problems; we propose a path-based relation RDF database …,Proceedings of the 16th Australasian database conference-Volume 39,2005,56
An indexing scheme for RDF and RDF schema based on suffix arrays,Akiyoshi Matono; Toshiyuki Amagasa; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Abstract The Semantic Web is a candidate for the next generation of the World Wide Web. Itis anticipated that the number of metadata written in RDF (Resource Description Framework)and RDF Schema will increase as the Semantic Web becomes popular. In such a situation;demand for querying metadata described with RDF and RDF Schema will also increase;and therefore effective query retrieval of RDF data is important. To this end; we propose anindexing scheme for RDF and RDF Schema. In our (proposed) scheme; we first extract fourkinds of DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) from an RDF data; and extract all path expressionsfrom the DAGs. Then; we generate four kinds of suffix arrays based on the path expressions.Using the indices; we can achieve efficient processing of query retrievals on RDF dataincluding schematic information defined by RDF Schema (for example; classes and/or …,Proceedings of the First International Conference on Semantic Web and Databases,2003,55
Query processing utilizing dependencies and horizontal decomposition,Yahiko Kambayashi; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract Since join operations are expensive; usually join scheduling is very important forquery processing. In this paper we will discuss new procedures to handle cyclic queriesutilizing dependencies and horizontal decompositions. There are three known proceduresfor cyclic query processing:(1) Relation merging;(2) Tuple-wise processing;(3) Attributeaddition. As join operations are applied to relations which are processed by selectionoperations; the number of tuples is usually less than the original relation and thus there aresituations in which temporary FDs are satisfied. Such FDs can be used to simplify the givenquery. To convert a given cyclic query into a tree; some relations must satisfy a set of FDs.This can be attained by horizontal decomposition. Tuple-wise processing and attributeaddition are shown to be special cases of the FD-based procedure. We have also …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1983,41

Behavior analysis of object-oriented databases: Method structure; execution trees; and reachability,Richard Hull; Katsumi Tanaka; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Object-oriented databases (OODBs) have been receiving much attention in the last fewyears. These database systems combine features of semantic models [HK87] and of theobject-oriented paradigm of programming languages [GR83]. Several research and even commercialOODB systems have already been dew;loped [BCG+87; AH87; LRV88; PSM87; FBC+87].However; there is currently a lack of a workable; flexible formalism for theoretical investigationsof fundamental issues of OODBs. This paper proposes such a formalism; and uses it to studythe basic issues of non~ermination; type-errors; and reach abilily. The primary features of OODBcan be roughly divided into the structural (or static) and behavioral (or dynamic) ones asfollows … • structural aspects - direct representation of real-world objects • object iden ti.ty •attributes (also called "instance variables") - explicit introduction of semantic constructs …,International Conference on Foundations of Data Organization and Algorithms,1989,36
Realizing temporal XML repositories using temporal relational databases,Toshiyuki Amagasa; Masatoshi Yoshikawat; Shunsuke Uemura,This paper addresses development of general storage and retrieval methods for changes ofXML documents. In this approach; histories of XML documents are modeled by the TXPathdata model; which is a temporal extension of the XPath data model. Given an XMLdocument; changes of the document are modeled by the TXPath data model; and it is thenmapped into valid-time relational tables of temporal relational databases. We show thefundamental operations for XML documents; which are based on DOM (Document ObjectModel); and also show how the operations are mapped into those on valid-time relations.Finally; we can retrieve changes of XML documents using SQL.,Cooperative Database Systems for Advanced Applications; 2001.

On the equivalence of database restructurings involving object identifiers,Richard Hull; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract: The equivalence problem is studied for programs specifying queries and databaserestructurings in models using object identity. We use the family of ILOG langauges; whichcaptures essential features of several data restructuring languages in the theoretical andapplied literature;~ OG uses a mechanism based on Skolem frmct ors for 'inventing” objectidentifiers(OIDS). Two notions of equivalence are articulated: under ezposed equivalencethe Skolem terms forming new OIDS are exposed; under obscured equivalence these termsare “replaced” with “new”; uninterpreted OD) S. In general; eg; if either negation or recursionis present; both forms of equivalence are undecidable. In the case of nrecILO G; which canbe viewed as unions of conjunctive queries with OID creation; exposed equivalence isdecidable.

A mapping scheme of xml documents into relational databases using schema-based path identi. ers,Kei Fujimoto; Dao Dinh Kha; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Toshiyuki Amagasa,In this paper; we propose a mapping scheme of XML documents into relational databases.The scheme enables us to store; retrieve and update XML documents efficiently. Whenstoring XML documents in relational databases; XML tree structures must be preservedexplicitly. To this end; a label is assigned to nodes in the XML tree. In general; documentretrieval and update performance is affected by node labeling schemes. We use SPIDER(Schema based Path IDentifiER); a labeling scheme for XML documents utilizing DTDs thatmakes retrieval and update more efficient. SPIDER only identifies paths from root node to anode. Thus; multiple nodes appearing in the same path cannot be distinguished by onlyusing SPIDER. We introduced Sibling Dewey Order to identify such nodes. Generally; whena new node is inserted into XML documents; some other nodes need to be relabeled to …,Web Information Retrieval and Integration; 2005. WIRI'05. Proceedings.

A two-stages translation model is proposed for theacquisition of bilingual terminology from comparable corpora; disambiguation and selectionof best translation alternatives according to their linguistics-based knowledge. Differentrescoring techniques are proposed and evaluated in order to select best phrasal translationalternatives.

The effectiveness of latent semantic analysis for building up a bottom-up taxonomy from folksonomy tags,Takeharu Eda; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Toshio Uchiyama; Tadasu Uchiyama,Abstract In this paper; we evaluate the effectiveness of a semantic smoothing technique toorganize folksonomy tags. Folksonomy tags have no explicit relations and vary becausethey form uncontrolled vocabulary. We discriminates so-called subjective tags like “cool” and“fun” from folksonomy tags without any extra knowledge other than folksonomy triples anduse the level of tag generalization to form the objective tags into a hierarchy. We verify thatentropy of folksonomy tags is an effective measure for discriminating subjective folksonomytags. Our hierarchical tag allocation method guarantees the number of children nodes andincreases the number of available paths to a target node compared to an existing treeallocation method for folksonomy tags.,World Wide Web,2009,29
Spatial indexing of high-dimensional data based on relative approximation,Yasushi Sakurai; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura; Haruhiko Kojima,Abstract. We propose a novel index structure; the A-tree (approximation tree); for similaritysearches in high-dimensional data. The basic idea of the A-tree is the introduction of virtualbounding rectangles (VBRs) which contain and approximate MBRs or data objects. VBRscan be represented quite compactly and thus affect the tree configuration both quantitativelyand qualitatively. First; since tree nodes can contain a large number of VBR entries; fanoutbecomes large; which increases search speed. More importantly; we have a free hand inarranging MBRs and VBRs in the tree nodes. Each A-tree node contains an MBR and itschildren VBRs. Therefore; by fetching an A-tree node; we can obtain information on theexact position of a parent MBR and the approximate position of its children.

A structural numbering scheme for XML data,Dao Dinh Kha; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Abstract Identifier generation is a common but crucial task in many XML applications. Inaddition; the structural information of XML data is essential to evaluate the XML queries. Inorder to meet both these requirements; several numbering schemes; including the powerfulUID technique; have been proposed. In this paper; we introduce a new numbering schemebased on the UID techniques called multilevel recursive UID (rUID). The proposed rUID isrobust; scalable and hierarchical. rUID features identifier generation by level and takes intoaccount the XML tree topology. rUID not only enables the computation of the parent node'sidentifier from the child node's identifier; as in the original UID; but also deals effectively withXML structural update and can be applied to arbitrarily large XML documents. In addition;we investigate the effectiveness of rUID in representing the XPath axes and query …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2002,27

A framework for sharing personal annotations on web resources using XML,Takeshi Sannomiya; Toshiyuki Amagasa; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Abstract In this paper; we propose WISPA (Web Indicator by Sharing Personal Annotations)Framework; which aims at mining useful information from communities on the World WideWeb with sharing personal annotations. In WISPA; annotations assigned to web pages onWWW are highly respected; because personal annotations contain each users' opinions orimpressions to web pages; and those annotations can be used as essential materials forjudging whether an information is important or not. Concretely; the process of WISPAproceeds as follows: First; users individually write personal annotations concerning certainweb pages. Then; the system restructures and merges those annotations according to users'interests; and they browse others' useful annotations. As a consequence; new personalannotations are brought out as feedbacks. XML technologies are used for the …,Australian Computer Science Communications,2001,24
Mutual evaluation of editors and texts for assessing quality of Wikipedia articles,Yu Suzuki; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract In this paper; we propose a method to identify good quality Wikipedia articles bymutually evaluating editors and texts. A major approach for assessing article quality is a textsurvival ratio based approach. In this approach; when a text survives beyond multiple edits;the text is assessed as good quality. This approach assumes that poor quality texts aredeleted by editors with high possibility. However; many vandals delete good quality textsfrequently; then the survival ratios of good quality texts are improperly decreased byvandals. As a result; many good quality texts are unfairly assessed as poor quality. In ourmethod; we consider editor quality for calculating text quality; and decrease the impacts ontext qualities by the vandals who has low quality. Using this improvement; the accuracy ofthe text quality should be improved. However; an inherent problem of this idea is that the …,Proceedings of the Eighth Annual International Symposium on Wikis and Open Collaboration,2012,21

Information retrieval system for XML documents,Kenji Hatano; Hiroko Kinutani; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Abstract In the research field of document information retrieval; the unit of retrieval resultsreturned by IR systems is a whole document or a document fragment; like a paragraph inpassage retrieval. IR systems based on the vector space model compute feature vectors ofthe units and calculate the similarities between the units and the query. However; the unit ofretrieval results are not suitable for document information retrieval since they are notcongruent with the information which users are searching for. Therefore; the unit of retrievalresults should be a portion of the XML document; such as a chapter; section; or subsection.That is; we think the most important concern of document information retrieval is to define theunit of retrieval results; that is meaningful for users. It is easy to construct the appropriateportion of XML documents as retrieval results because XML is a standard document …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2002,18
Fast and exact monitoring of co-evolving data streams,Yasuko Matsubara; Yasushi Sakurai; Naonori Ueda; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Given a huge stream of multiple co-evolving sequences; such as motion capture and web-click logs; how can we find meaningful patterns and spot anomalies? Our aim is to monitordata streams statistically; and find sub sequences that have the characteristics of a givenhidden Markov model (HMM). For example; consider an online web-click stream; wheremassive amounts of access logs of millions of users are continuously generated everysecond. So how can we find meaningful building blocks and typical access patterns such asweekday/weekend patterns; and also; detect anomalies and intrusions? In this paper; wepropose Stream Scan; a fast and exact algorithm for monitoring multiple co-evolving datastreams. Our method has the following advantages:(a) it is effective; leading to noveldiscoveries and surprising outliers;(b) it is exact; and we theoretically prove that Stream …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2014 IEEE International Conference on,2014,17
Scalable algorithms for distribution search,Yasuko Matsubara; Yasushi Sakurai; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Distribution data naturally arise in countless domains; such as meteorology; biology;geology; industry and economics. However; relatively little attention has been paid to datamining for large distribution sets. Given n distributions of multiple categories and a querydistribution Q; we want to find similar clouds (ie; distributions); to discover patterns; rules andoutlier clouds. For example; consider the numerical case of sales of items; where; for eachitem sold; we record the unit price and quantity; then; each customer is represented as adistribution of 2-d points (one for each item he/she bought). We want to find similar users; eg;for market segmentation; anomaly/fraud detection. We propose to address this problem andpresent D-Search; which includes fast and effective algorithms for similarity search in largedistribution datasets.

Risk evaluation for personal identity management based on privacy attribute ontology,Mizuho Iwaihara; Kohei Murakami; Gail-Joon Ahn; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract Identity providers are becoming popular for distributed authentication anddistributed identity management. Users' privacy attributes are stored at an identity providerand they are released to a service provider upon user's consent. Since a broad range ofprivacy information of different sensitiveness can be exchanged in advanced web services; itis necessary to assist users by presenting potential risk on financial and personalitydamage; before releasing privacy attributes. In this paper; we present a model of privacyattribute ontology and risk evaluation method on this ontology. Then we formalize severalmatching problems which optimize similarity scores of matching solutions under severaldifferent types of risk constraints. We show sophisticated polynomial-time algorithms forsolving these optimization problems.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2008,17

However; for documents having ahyperlink structure such as Web pages; the Web page contents can be characterized moreaccurately by using the contents of hyperlinked neighboring pages.

Topic and viewpoint extraction for diversity and bias analysis of news contents,Qiang Ma; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract News content is one kind of popular and valuable information on the Web. Sincenews agencies have different viewpoints and collect different news materials; theirperspectives on news contents may be diverse (biased). In such cases; it is important toindicate this bias and diversity to newsreaders. In this paper; we propose a system calledTVBanc (T opic and V iewpoint based B ias A nalysis of N ews C ontent) to analyze diversityand bias in Web-news content based on comparisons of topics and viewpoints. The topicand viewpoint of a news item are represented by using a novel notion called a contentstructure consisting touple of subject; aspect and state terms. Given a news item; TVBancfacilitates bias analysis in three steps: first; TVBanc extracts the topic and viewpoint of thatnews item based on its content structure. Second; TVBanc searches for related news …,*,2009,15
A method of improving feature vector for Web pages reflecting the contents of their out-linked pages,Kazunari Sugiyama; Kenji Hatano; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Abstract TF-IDF schemes are popular for generating the feature vectors of documents. Theseschemes are proposed for characterizing one document. Therefore; in order tocharacterizeWeb pages using tf-idf schemes; the feature vectors of the Web pages shouldbe reflected by the contents of Web pages linked with other pages via hyperlinks. In thispaper; we propose three methods of generating feature vectors for linked documents suchasWeb pages. Moreover; in order to verify the effectiveness of our proposed methods; wecompare our methods with current search engines and confirm their retrieval accuracy usingrecall precision curves.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2002,15
Similarity search for adaptive ellipsoid queries using spatial transformation,Yasushi Sakurai; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Ryoji Kataoka; Shunsuke Uemura,Abstract Similarity retrieval mechanisms should utilize generalized quadratic form distancefunctions as well as the Euclidean distance function since ellipsoid queries parameters mayvary with the user and situation. In this paper; we present the spatial transformationtechnique that yields a new search method for adaptive ellipsoid queries with quadratic formdistance functions. The basic idea is to transform the bounding rectangles in the originalspace; wherein distance from a query point is measured by quadratic form distancefunctions; into spatial objects in a new space wherein distance is measured by Euclideandistance functions. Our method significantly reduces CPU cost due to the distanceapproximation by the spatial transformation; exact distance evaluations are avoided for mostof the accessed bounding rectangles in the index structures. We also present the multiple …,VLDB,2001,15
Differentially private real-time data release over infinite trajectory streams,Yang Cao; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Recent emerging mobile and wearable technologies make it easy to collect personalspatiotemporal data such as activity trajectories in daily life. Releasing real-time statisticsover trajectory streams produced by crowds of people is expected to be valuable for bothacademia and business; answering questions such as" How many people are in CentralStation now?" However; analyzing these raw data will entail risks of compromising individualprivacy. ϵ-Differential Privacy has emerged as a de facto standard for private statisticspublishing because of its guarantee of being rigorous and mathematically provable. Sinceuser trajectories will be generated infinitely; it is difficult to protect every trajectory under ϵ-differential privacy. To this end; we propose a flexible privacy model of ℓ-trajectory privacy toensure every length of ℓ trajectories under protection of ϵ-differential privacy. Then we …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2015 16th IEEE International Conference on,2015,14
Analyzing the properties of XML fragments decomposed from the INEX document collection,Kenji Hatano; Hiroko Kinutani; Toshiyuki Amagasa; Yasuhiro Mori; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Abstract In current keyword-based XML fragment retrieval systems; various granules of XMLfragments are returned as retrieval results. The number of the XML fragments is huge; so thisadversely affects the index construction time and query processing time of the XML fragmentretrieval systems if they cannot extract only the answer XML fragments with certainty. In thispaper; we propose a method for determining XML fragments that are appropriate in keyword-based XML fragment retrieval. This would help to improve overall performance of XMLfragment retrieval systems. The proposed method utilizes and analyzes statisticalinformation of XML fragments based on a technique of the dynamics of terminology inquantitative linguistics. Moreover; our keyword-based XML fragment retrieval system runs ona relational database system. In this paper; we briefly explain the implementation of our …,International Workshop of the Initiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval,2004,14
User-Oriented Adaptive Web Information Retrieval Based on Implicit Observations,Kazunari Sugiyama; Kenji Hatano; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Abstract Web search engines help users find useful information on the WWW. However;when the same query is submitted by different users; typical search engines return the sameresult regardless of who submitted the query. Generally; each user has different informationneeds for his/her query. Therefore; the search result should be adapted to users withdifferent information needs. In this paper; we first propose several approaches to adaptingsearch results according to each user's need for relevant information without any user effort.Experimental results show that search systems that adapt to a user's preferences can beachieved by constructing user profiles based on modified collaborative filtering.,Asia-Pacific Web Conference,2004,14

Query expansion techniques for the CLEF bilingual track,Fatiha Sadat; Akira Maeda; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Abstract This paper evaluates the effectiveness of query translation and disambiguation aswell as expansion techniques on the CLEF Collections; using the SMART InformationRetrieval System. We focus on the query translation; disambiguation and methods used toimprove the effectiveness of information retrieval. A dictionary-based method in combinationwith a statistics-based method is used to avoid the problem of translation ambiguity. Inaddition; two expansion strategies are tested to see whether they improve the effectivenessof information retrieval: expansion via relevance feedback before and after translation aswell as expansion via domain feedback after translation. This method achieved 85.30% ofthe monolingual counterpart; in terms of average precision.,Workshop of the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum for European Languages,2001,14
Temporal versioning of XML documents,Vilas Wuwongse; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Toshiyuki Amagasa,Abstract A data model supporting the unification of the management of temporal XMLdocument databases and version control; ie; a Temporal Version Data Model (TVDM); isproposed. TVDM is temporally change-centric and represents the change between twoconsecutive versions by means of temporal delta (tDelta). A tDelta employs a temporal XMLexpression (tXex) which is an extension of ordinary XML elements by incorporation intothem temporal as well as ordinary variables. In addition to valid time; TVDM introducesversion time and associates it with each version. All versions including the base or thecurrent one can be uniformly represented by tDeltas. A technique to implement TVDM is alsopresented.,International Conference on Asian Digital Libraries,2004,13

Amalgamating SGML documents and databases,Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Osamu Ichikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Abstract We propose a uniform and flexible mechanism to make reference links from SGMLdocuments to database objects. In addition to typical document logical structures such assections and paragraphs; our mechanism allows arbitrary character strings in documents assource of these links. By using this mechanism; SGML attributes and their values of marked-up words can be transparently stored as database attributes; and we can establishhyperlinks between keywords in documents; which reflect relationships between thecorresponding database objects. Also; we present a query language to retrieve SGMLdocuments which are coupled with databases in this manner. The query language does notassume a particular database schema; instead; it utilizes DTD graphs; representing elementstructures of DTDs; as virtual schemas.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,1996,13
Security of social information from query analysis in daas,Junpei Kawamoto; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract Databases as a Service (DaaS) are recently in the spotlight as an essentialcomponent of the cloud computing framework. We can more easily develop applications tofacilitate users' collaboration than without DaaS. Unfortunately; DaaS brings a new risk ofdata compromise because most data are currently stored and managed by the serviceprovider. Securing users' information; the data are generally encrypted at a trusted client.Although encryption ensures that no one can sneak a look at the data; malicious users stillhave opportunities to take users' relational information. The relational information; which wename social information as opposed to personal information; has not been adequatelyexamined; but it is becoming important because of improvement of social analysis. Asdescribed herein; we first introduce an attack model of obtaining social information from …,Proceedings of the 2009 EDBT/ICDT Workshops,2009,12
Identifying result subdocuments of XML search conditions,Hiroko Kinutani; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,XML is becoming widely used as a standard data format on the Web. Unlike SGML; XMLdocuments do not require having their schemas. Since design of schemas of XMLdocuments is not an easy task; a significant number of XML documents will be simply well-formed. We focus on miscellaneous well-formed XML documents with no common schemas.We articulate issues related to query processing of those well-formed XML documents usingstandard data formats or vocabularies as namespaces. We believe that an end-user's typicalqueries against XML databases will be very terse as found in current HTML searchingengines. However; unlike HTML search engines; XML database systems should returnappropriate XML subdocuments as a granule of query results. The authors formulate a classof queries; which is a counterpart of a simple class of queries in current HTML search …,Digital Libraries: Research and Practice; 2000 Kyoto; International Conference on.,2000,12
Towards abstracting complex database objects: Generalization; reduction and unification of set-type objects,Katsumi Tanaka; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract Representing and manipulating complex (database) objects are important issues inthe semantic database models and object-oriented database models; most of which have arich expressive power for complex objects. In this paper; we will focus on the manipulation ofcomplex objects; and introduce the notions and the operations for abstracting complexobjects. We introduce the notion of" element-based" generalization relationships betweencomplex objects; and two new abstraction operators: reduction and unification. Theiralgebraic properties are then formally investigated especially for" set-type" complex objects.,International Conference on Database Theory,1988,12
Assessing quality score of Wikipedia article using mutual evaluation of editors and texts,Yu Suzuki; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract In this paper; we propose a method for assessing quality scores of Wikipediaarticles by mutually evaluating editors and texts. Survival ratio based approach is a majorapproach to assessing article quality. In this approach; when a text survives beyond multipleedits; the text is assessed as good quality; because poor quality texts have a high probabilityof being deleted by editors. However; many vandals; low quality editors; delete good qualitytexts frequently; which improperly decreases the survival ratios of good quality texts. As aresult; many good quality texts are unfairly assessed as poor quality. In our method; weconsider editor quality score for calculating text quality score; and decrease the impact ontext quality by vandals. Using this improvement; the accuracy of the text quality score shouldbe improved. However; an inherent problem with this idea is that the editor quality scores …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Information & Knowledge Management,2013,11
Trip tweets search by considering spatio-temporal continuity of user behavior,Keisuke Hasegawa; Qiang Ma; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract A large amount of tweets about user experiences such as trips appear on Twitter.These tweets are fragmented information and not easy to share with other people as awhole experience. In this paper; we propose a novel method to find and organize suchfragmented tweets at the level of user experiences. The notable feature of our method is thatwe find and organize tweets related to a certain trip experience by considering the spatio-temporal continuity of user-behavior of traveling. First; we construct a co-occurrencedictionary by considering the spatio-temporal continuity; ie; the co-occurrence ratio of twoterms is varying in time scopes and regions. Then; we use such dictionary to calculate therelatedness of a tweet to the trip experience from three aspects: content relatedness;temporal relatedness; and context relatedness.

Kikori-KS: An effective and efficient keyword search system for digital libraries in XML,Toshiyuki Shimizu; Norimasa Terada; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract Identifying meaningful document fragments is a major advantage achieved byencoding documents in XML. In scholarly articles; such document fragments includesections; subsections and paragraphs. XML information retrieval systems need to searchdocument fragments relevant to queries from a set of XML documents in a digital library. Wepresent Kikori-KS; an effective and efficient XML information retrieval system for scholarticarticles. Kikori-KS accepts a set of keywords as a query. This form of query is simple yetuseful because users are not required to understand XML query languages or XML schema.To meet practical demands for searching relevant fragments in scholartic articles; we havedeveloped a user-friendly interface for displaying search results. Kikori-KS was implementedon top of a relational XML database system developed by our group. By carefully …,International Conference on Asian Digital Libraries,2006,11
A system for retrieval and digest creation of video data based on geographic objects,Takamasa Ueda; Toshiyuki Amagasa; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Abstract With the advent of wearable cameras attached with wearable computers; we canrecord our daily lives as a large amount of video data. As a consequence; automatic creationof indexes on such video data is becoming important to support query retrieval or digestcreation on them. This is because it is unrealistic to create indexes on long-sustained videodata by hand. To cope with this problem; we propose a method to automatically create indexon such video data on the basis of geographic objects. In this scheme; users wear awearable computer; a GPS receiver; and a wearable video camera with gyroscope to recordvarious kinds of context information as well as video data. The system then makes analysisof those data; and automatically creates indexes of the video data. To this end; we proposetwo kinds of weighting schemes for geographic objects; namely; distance-and direction …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2002,11
Anaba: An obscure sightseeing spots discovering system,Chenyi Zhuang; Qiang Ma; Xuefeng Liang; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Discovering and recommending points of interest (POI) are drawing more attention to meetthe increasing demand from personalized tours. Unlike conventional systems focusing onpopular sightseeing locations; we develop a system; Anaba; to discover the obscuresightseeing spots that are less well-known while still worth visiting. By analyzing geo-taggedimages on image hosting websites (Flickr; etc.); Anaba discovers and ranks sightseeingspots based on their obscurity levels and scenery quality. Anaba first selects obscurecandidates in accordance with the asymmetry between visitors who are familiar with a targetarea and those who are not. Then; it evaluates the scenery quality of each candidate byconsidering both social appreciation and the content of images shot around there.

Qualityrank: assessing quality of wikipedia articles by mutually evaluating editors and texts,Yu Suzuki; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract In this paper; we propose a method to identify high-quality Wikipedia articles bymutually evaluating editors and texts. A major approach for assessing articles using edithistory is a text survival ratio based approach. However; the problem is that many high-quality articles are identified as low quality; because many vandals delete high-quality texts;then the survival ratios of high-quality texts are decreased by vandals. Our approach'sstrongest point is its resistance to vandalism. Using our method; if we calculate text qualityvalues using editor quality values; vandals do not affect any quality values of the othereditors; then the accuracy of text quality values should improve. However; the problem is thateditor quality values are calculated by text quality values; and text quality values arecalculated by editor quality values. To solve this problem; we mutually calculate editor …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM conference on Hypertext and social media,2012,10
News bias analysis based on stakeholder mining,Tatsuya Ogawa; Masatoshi YOSHIKAWA,SUMMARY In this paper; we propose a novel stakeholder mining mechanism for analyzing biasin news articles by comparing descriptions of stakeholders. Our mechanism is based on the presumptionthat interests often induce bias of news agencies. As we use the term; a “stakeholder” is a participantin an event described in a news article who should have some relationships with other participantsin the article. Our approach attempts to elucidate bias of articles from three aspects:stakeholders; interests of stakeholders; and the descriptive polarity of each stakeholder. Miningof stakeholders and their interests is achieved by analysis of sentence structure and the useof RelationshipWordNet; a lexical resource that we developed. For analyzing polarities of stakeholderdescriptions; we propose an opinion mining method based on the lexical resourceSentiWordNet. As a result of analysis; we construct a relations graph of stakeholders to …,IEICE transactions on information and systems,2011,10
Signaling emotion in tagclouds,Takeharu Eda; Toshio Uchiyama; Tadasu Uchiyama; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract In order to create more attractive tagclouds that get people interested in taggedcontent; we propose a simple but novel tagcloud where font size is determined by tag'sentropy value; not the popularity to its content. Our method raises users' emotional interest inthe content by emphasizing more emotional tags. Our initial experiments show thatemotional tagclouds attract more attention than normal tagclouds at first look; thus they willenhance the role of tagcloud as a social signaller.,Proceedings of the 18th international conference on World wide web,2009,10
Locally expandable allocation of folksonomy tags in a directed acyclic graph,Takeharu Eda; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Masashi Yamamuro,Abstract We propose a new classification system based on an analysis of folksonomy data.To find valuable resources from current social bookmark services; users need to specifysearch terms or tags; or to discover people with similar interests. Our system uses semanticrelationships extracted from the co-occurrences of folksonomy data using PLSI and allocatesfolksonomy tags in a directed acyclic graph. Compared to the hierarchical allocation methodof a tree; our method guarantees the number of children nodes and increases the number ofavailable paths to an objective node; enabling users to navigate the resources using tags.,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2008,10

Full-text and structural indexing of XML documents on B+-Tree,Toshiyuki Shimizu; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,XML query processing is one of the most active areas of database research. Although themain focus of past research has been the processing of structural XML queries; there aregrowing demands for a full-text search for XML documents. In this paper; we propose XICS(XML Indices for Content and Structural search); which aims at high-speed processing ofboth full-text and structural queries in XML documents. An important design principle of ourindices is the use of a B+-tree. To represent the structural information of XML trees; eachnode in the XML tree is labeled with an identifier. The identifier contains an integer numberrepresenting the path information from the root node. XICS consist of two types of indices;the COB-tree (COntent B+-tree) and the STB-tree (STructure B+-tree). The search keys of theCOB-tree are a pair of text fragments in the XML document and the identifiers of the leaf …,IEICE TRANSACTIONS on Information and Systems,2006,10
Implementation of a high-speed and high-precision XML information retrieval system on relational databases,Kei Fujimoto; Toshiyuki Shimizu; Norimasa Terada; Kenji Hatano; Yu Suzuki; Toshiyuki Amagasa; Hiroko Kinutani; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract This paper describes an XML information retrieval system that we have developed.It is based on a vector space model; and implemented on top of XRel; a relational XMLdatabase system that has been developed in our research group. When a query isprocessed; a large number of fragments are retrieved; because a single XML documentusually contains many XML fragments. Keeping all XML fragments degrades retrievalprecision and increases query processing time; because some XML fragments are notappropriate as a query target. In existing methods; retrieval targets are manually selected byhuman experts when an XML collection is stored in the system. Such manual selection is notfeasible when many kinds of XML documents are stored in the system. To cope with theproblem we propose a method for automatically selecting document-centric fragments by …,International Workshop of the Initiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval,2005,10

We explore a bi-directional extraction of bilingual terminology primarily from comparable corpora. Acombined statistics-based and linguistics-based model to select best translation candidatesto phrasal translation is proposed.

Cross-language information retrieval based on category matching between language versions of a web directory,Fuminori Kimura; Akira Maeda; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Abstract Since the Web consists of documents in various domains or genres; the method forCross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) of Web documents should be independent ofa particular domain. In this paper; we propose a CLIR method which employs a Webdirectory provided in multiple language versions (such as Yahoo!). In the proposed method;feature terms are first extracted from Web documents for each category in the source and thetarget languages. Then; one or more corresponding categories in another language aredetermined beforehand by comparing similarities between categories across languages.Using these category pairs; we intend to resolve ambiguities of simple dictionary translationby narrowing the categories to be retrieved in the target language.,Proceedings of the sixth international workshop on Information retrieval with Asian languages-Volume 11,2003,10
Discovering obscure sightseeing spots by analysis of geo-tagged social images,Chenyi Zhuang; Qiang Ma; Xuefeng Liang; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract In contrast to conventional studies of discovering hot spots; by analyzing geo-tagged images on Flickr; we introduce novel methods to discover obscure sightseeing spotsthat are less well-known while still worth visiting. To this end; we face two new challengesthat the classical authority analysis based methods do not encounter: how to discover andrank spots on the basis of 1) popularity (obscurity level) and 2) scenery quality. For the firstchallenge; we estimate the obscurity level of a spot in accordance with the visitingasymmetry between photographers who are familiar with a target city and those who are not.For the second challenge; the behavior of both viewers who browsed the images andphotographers are analyzed per each spot. We also develop an application system to helpusers to explore sightseeing spots with different geographical granularities.

Quantifying differential privacy under temporal correlations,Yang Cao; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Yonghui Xiao; Li Xiong,Differential Privacy (DP) has received increasing attention as a rigorous privacy framework.Many existing studies employ traditional DP mechanisms (eg; the Laplace mechanism) asprimitives; which assume that the data are independent; or that adversaries do not haveknowledge of the data correlations. However; continuous generated data in the real worldtend to be temporally correlated; and such correlations can be acquired by adversaries. Inthis paper; we investigate the potential privacy loss of a traditional DP mechanism undertemporal correlations in the context of continuous data release. First; we model the temporalcorrelations using Markov model and analyze the privacy leakage of a DP mechanism whenadversaries have knowledge of such temporal correlations. Our analysis reveals that theprivacy loss of a DP mechanism may accumulate and increase over time. We call it …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on,2017,8
Your neighbors are my spies: Location and other privacy concerns in GLBT-focused location-based dating applications,Nguyen Phong Hoang; Yasuhito Asano; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Trilateration is one of the well-known threat models to the user's location privacy in location-based apps; especially those contain highly sensitive information such as dating apps. Thethreat model mainly bases on the publicly shown distance from a targeted victim to theadversary to pinpoint the victim's location. As a countermeasure; most of location-basedapps have already implemented the “hide distance” function; or added noise to the publiclyshown distance in order to protect their user's location privacy. The effectiveness of suchapproaches however is still questionable. Therefore; in this paper; we investigate how thepopular location-based dating apps are currently protecting their user's privacy by testingthree popular GLBT-focused apps: Grindr; Jack'd; and Hornet. We found that Jack'd has themost privacy issues among the three apps. As one of our findings; we also show how the …,Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT); 2017 19th International Conference on,2017,8
Incremental construction of causal network from news articles,Hiroshi Ishii; Qiang Ma; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,抄録 We propose a novel method for the incremental construction of causal networks toclarify the relationships among news events. We propose the Topic-Event Causal (TEC)model as a causal network model and an incremental constructing method based on it. Inthe TEC model; a causal relation is expressed using a directed graph and a vertexrepresenting an event. A vertex contains structured keywords consisting of topic keywordsand an SVO tuple. An SVO tuple; which consists of a tuple of subject; verb and objectkeywords represent the details of the event. To obtain a chain of causal relations; verticesrepresenting a similar event need to be detected. We reduce the time taken to detect themby restricting the calculation to topics using topic keywords. We detect them on a conceptlevel. We propose an identification method that identifies the sense of the keywords and …,Journal of information processing,2012,8
XSemantic: An extension of LCA based XML semantic search,Umaporn Supasitthimethee; Toshiyuki Shimizu; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Kriengkrai Porkaew,One of the most convenient ways to query XML data is a keyword search because it doesnot require any knowledge of XML structure or learning a new user interface. However; thekeyword search is ambiguous. The users may use different terms to search for the sameinformation. Furthermore; it is difficult for a system to decide which node is likely to bechosen as a return node and how much information should be included in the result. Toaddress these challenges; we propose an XML semantic search based on keywords calledXSemantic. On the one hand; we give three definitions to complete in terms of semantics.Firstly; the semantic term expansion; our system is robust from the ambiguous keywords byusing the domain ontology. Secondly; to return semantic meaningful answers; weautomatically infer the return information from the user queries and take advantage of the …,IEICE TRANSACTIONS on Information and Systems,2009,8
A Generalized Flow-Based Method for Analysis of Implicit Relationships on Wikipedia,Xinpeng Zhang; Yasuhito Asano; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,We focus on measuring relationships between pairs of objects in Wikipedia whose pagescan be regarded as individual objects. Two kinds of relationships between two objects exist:in Wikipedia; an explicit relationship is represented by a single link between the two pagesfor the objects; and an implicit relationship is represented by a link structure containing thetwo pages. Some of the previously proposed methods for measuring relationships arecohesion-based methods; which underestimate objects having high degrees; although suchobjects could be important in constituting relationships in Wikipedia. The other methods areinadequate for measuring implicit relationships because they use only one or two of thefollowing three important factors: distance; connectivity; and cocitation. We propose a newmethod using a generalized maximum flow which reflects all the three factors and does …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2013,7
Mining and explaining relationships in wikipedia,Xinpeng Zhang; Yasuhito Asano; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract Mining and explaining relationships between objects are challenging tasks in thefield of knowledge search. We propose a new approach for the tasks using disjoint pathsformed by links in Wikipedia. To realizing this approach; we propose a naive and ageneralized flow based method; and a technique of avoiding flow confluences for forcing ageneralized flow to be disjoint as possible. We also apply the approach to classification ofrelationships. Our experiments reveal that the generalized flow based method can minemany disjoint paths important for a relationship; and the classification is effective forexplaining relationships.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2010,7
A cross-media method of stakeholder extraction for news contents analysis,Ling Xu; Qiang Ma; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract We are studying contents analysis of multimedia news as a solution to the issue ofbias; which multimedia news; as a reflection of the real world; is also facing. For the contentsanalysis; we use a stakeholder model representing descriptions of different stakeholders;which are defined as the main participants in an event. In this paper; we propose a methodof detecting stakeholders as the core component of the stakeholder-oriented analysis. In ourwork; a stakeholder is assumed to appear in the video clips and be mentioned in the closedcaptions frequently. Given a series of video clips and their closed captions reporting thesame event; we extract stakeholder candidates from both textual and visual descriptions.After that; we calculate the degree of exposure for each candidate to identify stakeholders.We also present experimental results that validate our method.,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2010,7
Time graph pattern mining for Web analysis and information retrieval,Taihei Oshino; Yasuhito Asano; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract Graph patterns on the web are characteristic substructures of web graphs. Graphpatterns have played important roles in web analysis and information retrieval. However;temporal characteristics of the web have not been estimated sufficiently in previouslyproposed graph patterns. We first propose time graph patterns; and then; we mine thepatterns representing topics that are discussed extensively on the web. Conductingexperiments using those mined patterns; we finally ascertain that time graph pattern opens anovel way for information retrieval and web analysis reflecting temporal characteristics.,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2010,7
Dynamic range labeling for XML trees,Takeharu Eda; Yasushi Sakurai; Toshiyuki Amagasa; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura; Takashi Honishi,Abstract Structural joins based on range labeling schemes are considered as one of themost important topics in studies on XML query processing. When an XML data set isupdated; however; the nodes have to be relabeled in order to keep their order relationship.Costly bulk node relabeling should be avoided to allow for continuous processing of queriesfor dynamic XML trees that are updated often. In this paper; we propose two dynamic nodelabeling schemes to avoid “gap shortfalls”. One is simple local relabeling scheme and theother is more sophisticated in that it uses approximate histograms that keep the statistics ofthe update operations. These two techniques allow node labels to be managed dynamicallyand locally. Experiments show that they can avoid bulk relabeling while still permittingupdate operations.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2004,7
Adaptive Web search based on user’s implicit preference,Kazunari Sugiyama; Kenji Hatano; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,† Nara Institute of Science and Technology 8916–5 Takayama; Ikoma; Nara 630–0192; Japan†† Nagoya University Furo; Chikusa; Nagoya; Aichi 464–8601; Japan Abstract Web search engineshelp users find useful information on the World Wide Web (WWW). However; when the samequery is submitted by different users; typical search engines return the same result regardlessof who submitted the query. Generally; each user has different information needs for his/herquery. Therefore; the search results should be adapted to users with different informationneeds. In this paper; we first propose several approaches to adapting search results accordingto each user's need for relevant information without any user effort; and then verify the effectivenessof our proposed approaches. Ex- perimental results show that search systems that adapt to eachuser's preferences can be achieved by constructing user profiles based on modified …,DEWS2004,2004,7
Extraction of partial XML documents using IR-based structure and contents analysis,Kenji Hatano; Hiroko Kinutani; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Abstract As Internet technologies develop; XML is becoming widely used as a standarddata/document format. Although the use of XML documents has attracted public attention;the application of IR technologies in XML document retrieval is still in its premature stage.We foresee that typical XML queries for end-users will be very terse; like those used withcurrent Web search engines. Therefore; an XML search engine should be able to searchappropriate retrieval results using only a few keywords. In this paper; we introduce a notionof context nodes. Context nodes are used to automatically extract coherent partialdocuments without the knowledge of XML document structures. This method is usefulbecause it does not require domain analysts to analyze DTDs and specify candidate partialdocuments beforehand. We use the term “context search” to represent search methods …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2001,7
On data restructuring and merging with object identity,Richard Hull; Surjatini Widjojo; Dave Wile; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Object identity; a powerful abstraction used in databases and other fields; correspondsclosely to mechanisms which humans use to organize their perceptions and understandingof the physical and conceptual worlds that we live in. The emergence of semantic and object-oriented database models is now making it possible for database designers and users toutilize this abstraction in an explicit manner. The use of object identity in these models hasplaced a spotlight on a number of interesting; fundamental problems in data modeling; andat the same time provides the basis for resolving them. The WorldBasé project WHW89]; anongoing project at USC/Information Sciences Institute; is focused on the development ofnovel architectures and techniques for supporting simultaneous access to heterogeneousdatabases.

How the web can help wikipedia: a study on information complementation of wikipedia by the web,Damien Eklou; Yasuhito Asano; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract With the huge amount of data on the Web; looking for desired information can be atime consuming task. Wikipedia is a very helpful tool as it is the largest most popular generalreference site on the internet. Most search engines rank Wikipedia pages among the toplisted results. However; because many articles on Wikipedia are manually updated by users;there are several articles that lack information and need to be upgraded. Those lackinginformation can sometimes be found on the web. Uprooting this information from the web willinvolve a time consuming process of reading; analyzing and summarizing the information forthe user. In order to support the user search process and help Wikipedia contributors in theupdating process of articles; we propose a method of finding valuable complementaryinformation on the web. Experiments showed that our method was quite effective in …,Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Ubiquitous Information Management and Communication,2012,6
D-Search: an efficient and exact search algorithm for large distribution sets,Yasuko Matsubara; Yasushi Sakurai; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract Distribution data naturally arise in countless domains; such as meteorology;biology; geology; industry and economics. However; relatively little attention has been paidto data mining for large distribution sets. Given n distributions of multiple categories and aquery distribution Q; we want to find similar clouds (ie; distributions) to discover patterns;rules and outlier clouds. For example; consider the numerical case of sales of items; where;for each item sold; we record the unit price and quantity; then; each customer is representedas a distribution of 2-d points (one for each item he/she bought). We want to find similarusers; eg; for market segmentation or anomaly/fraud detection. We propose to address thisproblem and present D-Search; which includes fast and effective algorithms for similaritysearch in large distribution datasets.

Private range query by perturbation and matrix based encryption,Junpei Kawamoto; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,In this paper; we propose a novel approach for private query; IPP (inner product predicate)method. Private query is a query processing protocol to obtain requesting tuples withoutexposing any information about what users request to third persons including serviceproviders. Existing works about private query such as PIR; which ensure informationtheoretic safety; have severe restriction because they do not support range queries nor allowtuples having a same value in queried attributes. Our IPP method; on the other hands;focuses range queries mainly and it allows tuples having a same value in any attributes. IPPmethod employs a query transform by trusted clients (QT) scheme and proposestransformation algorithms which make the correlation between plain queries andtransformed queries and the correlation between plain attribute values and transformed …,Digital Information Management (ICDIM); 2011 Sixth International Conference on,2011,6
Causal network construction to support understanding of news,Hiroshi Ishii; Qiang Ma; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,To support understanding of news; we propose a novel TEC model (Topic-Event Causalrelation model) and describe the method to construct a Causal Network in the TEC model.The model includes two types of keywords to represent casual relations: topic keywords;which describe topics; and event keywords; which describe events. In the TEC model;causal relations are represented by an edge-labeled directed graph. A source vertexrepresents the cause of an event; and a destination vertex represents the result of that event.Each vertex contains event keywords and topic keywords and an importance score for eachkeyword. The edge label is the importance score of that causal relation. To construct acausal network; we extract causal relations from articles based onclue phrases'; mergesimilar event vertices and reduce the size of the causal network based on the importance …,System Sciences (HICSS); 2010 43rd Hawaii International Conference on,2010,6
Extending RBAC for large enterprises and its quantitative risk evaluation,Seiichi Kondo; Mizuho Iwaihara; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Masashi Torato,Abstract Systems and security products based on the RBAC model have been widelyintroduced to enterprises. Especially; the demands on enforcement of enterprise-levelsecurity policies and total identity management are rapidly growing. The RBAC model needsto be extended to deal with various circumstances of large enterprises; such asgeographical distribution and heterogeneous environments including physical accesscontrol. In this paper; we introduce a new RBAC model; suitable for single sign-on systems.This model optimizes evaluation of rule-based RBAC so that total operation costs andproductivity can be improved. Furthermore; to select most cost-effective RBAC extensions forenterprise-wide requirements; we propose a quantitative risk evaluation method based onfault trees.

A relative cost model for XQuery,Soichiro Hidaka; Hiroyuki Kato; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract XQuery is a functional query language for XML. We propose a relative XQuery costmodel that is able to estimate the performance gain during source level transformation. Thisresearch facilitates the evaluation of various rewriting techniques without introducing realengines. The cost model consists of simple recursive functions based on functionallanguage constructs. They are determined using formal semantics and other known efficientalgorithms. Analytic comparison of costs between expressions before and aftertransformation is possible in an engine-independent manner. The relativity of the modelallows uninterpreted components within; which do not affect the mathematical proof of thecomparison. Moreover; it can be tailored to reflect engine specific evaluation strategies suchas the order of evaluation of operands.,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2007,6
An XQuery cost model in relative form,Soichiro Hidaka; Hiroyuki Kato; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract. We propose an XQuery cost model that is able to estimate the performance gain ofsource-level transformation. The cost of major language constructs; including FLWOR;quantified; path; element construction; and predicate expressions are captured. Theevaluation of optimization using existing real engines suffer from problems; such as lack ofapplicability to other engines; instability that comes from evolution; difficulties in reproductionas a result of difficulties in acquisition; as well as unsuitability for evaluation of theoptimization based on a static analysis in the absence of run-time information. This researchis a first attempt to provide a virtual engine to facilitate the evaluation of various optimizationtechniques without introducing real engines. The cost model consists of simple recursivefunctions based on functional language constructs. They are determined using formal …,*,2005,6
Full-text and structural XML indexing on B+-tree,Toshiyuki Shimizu; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract XML query processing is one of the most active areas of database research.Although the main focus of past research has been the processing of structural XML queries;there are growing demands for a full-text search for XML documents. In this paper; wepropose XICS (XML Indices for Content and Structural search); novel indices built on a B+-tree; for the fast processing of queries that involve structural and fulltext searches of XMLdocuments. To represent the structural information of XML trees; each node in the XML treeis labeled with an identifier. The identifier contains an integer number representing the pathinformation from the root node. XICS consist of two types of indices; the COB-tree (COntentB+-tree) and the STB-tree (STructure B+-tree). The search keys of the COB-tree are a pair oftext fragments in the XML document and the identifiers of the leaf nodes that contain the …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2005,6
An efficient pathway search using an indexing scheme for RDF,Akiyoshi Matono; Toshiyuki Amagasa; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Most chemical reaction mechanisms in living organism are translated from a compound(substrate) to a compound (product) by an enzyme acting as the initiator. Such a series ofreactions is generally called a pathway. It is important to comparison and analyze pathwaysin order to understand the process of creating compounds and the evolutive relevancebetween organisms. The pathway data needs to be efficiently processed because theamount of known pathways is increasing due to the development of the technology forgenome data. Some of pathway databases are constructed to manage the pathway data (egKEGG [2]). However; as far as we know; all of the pathway databases are constructed onrelational databases or XML databases; and thus the storage model is not based on thestructure of pathway data. The structure of pathway data cannot be easily represented by …,Genome Informatics,2003,6
Cross-language information retrieval via dictionary-based and statistics-based methods,Fatiha Sadat; Akira Maeda; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,As Internet resources become accessible to more and more countries; there is a need todevelop methods for Cross Language Information Retrieval for different languages. In thispaper; we focus on dictionary-based approach by using a bilingual dictionary; with acombination to statistics-based methods to avoid the problem of ambiguity. Interactivefeedback loops are integrated; in the task of query expansion before and after thedisambiguation of the translated candidates. In this study; we propose three sorts of queryexpansions to improve the effectiveness of information retrieval and to dramatically reducethe errors such an approach normally makes: an Interactive Relevance Feedback; a DomainFeedback and a Similarity Thesaurus. We applied these methods to an English-FrenchCross-Language Information Retrieval. In terms of average precision; a 91.95% and …,Communications; Computers and signal Processing; 2001.

Classifying Twitter users based on user profile and followers distribution,Liang Yan; Qiang Ma; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract We propose methods to classify Twitter users into open accounts and closedaccounts. Open accounts (shop accounts; etc.) are the accounts who publish information togeneral public and their intentions is to promotion products; services or themselves. On theother hand; closed accounts tweet information on their daily lives or use Twitter as acommunication tool with their friends. To distinguish these two different kinds of Twitter userscan help us to search for local and daily information on Twitter. We classify Twitter accountsbased on user profiles and followers distributions. The features of profile of open accountsinclude clue keywords; telephone number; detailed address; and so on. Follower distributionis another notable feature: most open accounts have followers from variety community. Theexperimental results validate our methods.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2013,5
Analysis of implicit relations on Wikipedia: Measuring strength through mining elucidatory objects,Xinpeng Zhang; Yasuhito Asano; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract We focus on measuring relations between pairs of objects in Wikipedia whosepages can be regarded as individual objects. Two kinds of relations between two objectsexist: in Wikipedia; an explicit relation is represented by a single link between the two pagesfor the objects; and an implicit relation is represented by a link structure containing the twopages. Previously proposed methods are inadequate for measuring implicit relationsbecause they use only one or two of the following three important factors: distance;connectivity; and co-citation. We propose a new method reflecting all the three factors byusing a generalized maximum flow. We confirm that our method can measure the strength ofa relation more appropriately than these previously proposed methods do. Anotherremarkable aspect of our method is mining elucidatory objects; that is; objects constituting …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,5
Metadata management for integration and analysis of earth observation data,Akira Takahashi; Masashi Tatedoko; Hiroko Kinutani; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract Earth observation technologies have developed rapidly during the last decades.Substantial amounts of earth observation data have been acquired and stored among theliterature and databases of various research fields such as climatology; oceanography;agriculture; and ecology. Analysis and integration of such data might produce valuable dataproducts to promote understanding of the global environment; and to solve globalenvironmental issues. However; most institutions store and manage their Earth observationdata in their own manner; with little metadata. Scientists have to struggle hard to search forvaluable data from data out of their research domain and seek their usage. In this paper weintroduce a conceptual model for earth observation data.

XML Information Retrieval Considering Physical Page Layout of Logical Elements.,Toshiyuki Shimizu; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,ABSTRACT XML information retrieval (XML-IR) systems utilize the logical structure of XMLdocuments for retrieving relevant elements. From a practical point of view; displaying thesearch results of XML-IR systems is important to achieve. When we search XML documentsthat are constructed by marking up documents originally composed of pages; such asscholarly articles or books; we would like result elements to be overlaid on the physicallayout of pages in the user interfaces. We propose such a displaying method for keywordsearches on XML documents of scholarly articles and ranking methods based on page units.We also need a new ranking method different from those used in simple element rankingbecause multiple result elements may be in the same page. We propose a ranking methodconsidering the benefit that we obtain from the result elements and the reading effort that …,WebDB,2007,5
XML query processing using a schema-based numbering scheme,Dao Dinh Kha; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract Establishing the hierarchical order among XML elements is an essential function ofXML query processing techniques. Although most XML documents have an associated DTDor XML schema; the document structure information has not been utilized efficiently in queryprocessing techniques proposed so far. In this paper; we propose a novel technique thatuses DTD or XML schema to improve the disk I/O complexity of XML query processing. Wepresent a schema-based numbering scheme called SPIDER that incorporates both structureinformation and tag names extracted from the document structure descriptions. Given the tagname and the identifier of an element; SPIDER can determine the tag names and theidentifiers of the ancestor elements without disk I/O. Based on SPIDER; we designed amechanism called VirtualJoin that significantly reduces disk I/O workload for processing …,International XML Database Symposium,2004,5

Differentially private real-time data publishing over infinite trajectory streams,Yang Cao; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Recent emerging mobile and wearable technologies make it easy to collect personalspatiotemporal data such as activity trajectories in daily life. Publishing real-time statisticsover trajectory streams produced by crowds of people is expected to be valuable for bothacademia and business; answering questions such as “How many people are in KyotoStation now?” However; analyzing these raw data will entail risks of compromising individualprivacy. ε-Differential Privacy has emerged as a well-known standard for private statisticspublishing because of its guarantee of being rigorous and mathematically provable.However; since user trajectories will be generated infinitely; it is difficult to protect everytrajectory under ε-differential privacy. On the other hand; in real life; not all users require thesame level of privacy. To this end; we propose a flexible privacy model of l-trajectory …,IEICE TRANSACTIONS on Information and Systems,2016,4

Credibility-oriented ranking of multimedia news based on a material-opinion model,Ling Xu; Qiang Ma; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract To detect subjective intentions in a multimedia news item and help users avoid themisleading; we propose a Material-Opinion model for ranking the multimedia news with acredibility score. In the model; material is the visual description of the video news. Opinionconsists of the subjective words extracted from the surrounding text (or closed captions) ofthat video news. After extracting materials and opinions from multimedia news items; wecompare any two news items to compute their material and opinion dissimilarities;respectively. By considering the support relationship between material and opinion; wecompute a credibility score for each multimedia news item. Intuitively; the credibility score ofa video news item consists of material and opinion credibility scores.

Propagation of multi-granularity annotations,Ryo Aoto; Toshiyuki Shimizu; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract Data origin or processing information and the metadata that is useful inunderstanding data can be associated with data by using annotation. Provenanceknowledge preserved by annotation is managed by continuously propagating theannotations through the workflow. Models for explicitly associating annotations are generallyused for annotation-based provenance management; and techniques for propagatingannotations have been proposed. There is also a model for implicitly associatingannotations–the annotations are associated with data with arbitrary granularity by usingqueries. We call the implicit model “multi-granularity annotation” model. Multi-granularityannotation enables flexible association of information. However; no provenancemanagement methods using multi-granularity annotations have been reported. We have …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2011,4
An incremental method for causal network construction,Hiroshi Ishii; Qiang Ma; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract We propose a novel method of constructing causal networks to clarify therelationships among events. Since events and their relationships continually change; ourmethod works in an incremental manner. There are two problems in the conventionalmethods of constructing causal networks that use keywords representing events: 1) similarevents detection to network construction is a time-consuming task; and 2) because themerge operation depends on appearing order of events there is a consistency issue in theincremental construction. In this paper; as the representation model; we propose a Topic-Event Causal network model (TEC model) in which the topic and details of an event areseparately represented by using structured keywords. We cluster events by using the topickeyword and then detect similar events per each cluster. This fashion will reduce the …,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2010,4
Analysis of news agencies’ descriptive features of people and organizations,Shin Ishida; Qiang Ma; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract News agencies report news from different viewpoints and with different writingstyles. We propose a method to extract characteristic descriptions of a news agency writtenabout people and organizations. To extract the characteristic descriptions of a given personor organization; we analyze words which appear in the same sentence on the basis of theirSVO roles. We then extract a description that is often used by the news agency but notcommonly used by the others. The experimental results show that our method can elucidatethe different features of each agency's writing style.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2009,4
A ranking scheme for XML information retrieval based on benefit and reading effort,Toshiyuki Shimizu; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract XML information retrieval (XML-IR) systems search for relevant document fragmentsin XML documents for given queries. In top-k search; users control the size of output by aninteger k. In XML-IR; however; each output element varies widely in size. Consequently; totaloutput size of top-k elements is uncontrollable by simply giving an integer k. In addition;search results may have nesting elements. If a system orders result elements simply by theirrelevance; we may browse the same content more than once due to the nestings. To handlethese problems; we propose a new ranking method that enables us to browse search resultsof XML-IR systems efficiently by introducing the concepts of benefit and reading effort. Wealso propose an evaluation metrics based on benefit and reading effort; and compared themetrics with existing XML-IR metrics by experiments.,International Conference on Asian Digital Libraries,2007,4
A structural numbering scheme for processing queries by structure and keyword on XML data,Dao Dinh Kha; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Generating the identifiers of XML nodes is a crucial task in XML applications. On the otherhand; the structural information of XML data is essential to evaluate the XML queries.Several numbering schemes have been proposed so far to express the structuralinformation using the identifiers of XML nodes. In this paper; we introduce a new numberingscheme called recursive UID (rUID) that has been designed to be robust in structural updateand applicable to arbitrarily large XML documents. We investigate the applications of rUID toXML query processing in a system called SKEYRUS; which enables the integrated structure-keyword searches on XML data. Experimental results of the performance of SKEYRUS arealso reported.,IEICE TRANSACTIONS on Information and Systems,2004,4
Integrating periodic data sequences based on freshness and synchronousness,Koichi Munakata; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Presents frameworks for acquiring data from servers that broadcast data periodically atconstant intervals. We assume that different servers broadcast data for different periods atdifferent intervals; and our focus is on choosing a fresh and synchronous combination ofdata; each obtained from a different server. We define an evaluation function to determinewhich data combination to use; taking into account both the freshness and thesynchronousness of the data. Then we present a data acquisition framework for consecutivequeries. For efficiency; the points of time that give the optimum data combinations are pre-computed. We show the pre-computation results can also be used for interactive querieswhich enable application programs to set limits on the data synchronousness and responsetime.,Research Issues in Data Engineering; 2000.

A query optimization for XML document views constructed by aggregations,Hiroyuki Kato; Kcizo Oyama; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,We propose an optimization method for queries over XML views; especially documentviews. We focus on XML document views; particularly those constructed by an aggregationpeculiar to structured documents. The prominent feature of aggregation leads to thedevelopment of a novel optimization technique for the query. The point of our optimization isthat a traditional optimization method of database queries; called" pushing selections"; isapplied into a predicate peculiar to text retrieval. When pushing the predicate is applied tooptimize a query over XML document views constructed by the aggregation; the feature ofaggregation requires rewriting not only the predicate but also the whole query. We showhow input queries over the XML views are rewritten.,Database Applications in Non-Traditional Environments; 1999.(DANTE'99) Proceedings. 1999 International Symposium on,1999,4

SNS user classification and its application to obscure POI discovery,Chenyi Zhuang; Qiang Ma; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract Technologies are increasingly taking advantage of the explosion of social media(eg; web searches; ad targeting; personalized geo-social recommendations; urbancomputing). Estimating the characteristics of users; or user profiling; is one of the keychallenges for such technologies. This paper focuses on the important problem ofautomatically estimating social networking service (SNS) user authority with a given city;which can significantly improve location-based services and systems. The “authority” in ourwork measures a user's familiarity with a particular city. By analyzing users' social; temporal;and spatial behavior; we respectively propose and compare three models for user authority:a social-network-driven model; time-driven model; and location-driven model. Furthermore;we discuss the integration of these three models. Finally; by using these user-profiling …,Multimedia Tools and Applications,2017,3

For chronic diseases; longitudinal analysisof medication history plays a key role in reaching this goal. However; raw medication data inEMR are not suitable for longitudinal analysis for several reasons. First; many prescriptionshave a short duration. Second; the prescription duration may have a gap or overlap withother prescription durations. Additionally; for diabetes cases; physicians must wait for acertain period to observe the effectiveness of the medication. However; the existing methodsdo not address these conditions. To tackle these issues; we propose a set of rules formedication episode reconstruction.

It is possible toanswer the question by searching knowledge about the relation between global warmingand agriculture. As exemplified by this question; strong demands exist for searchingrelations between objects. However; methods or systems for searching relations are not wellstudied. In this paper; we propose a relation search system named “Enishi.” Enishi suppliesa wealth of diverse multimedia information for deep understanding of relations between twoobjects by complementarily utilizing knowledge from Wikipedia and the Web. Enishi firstmines elucidatory objects constituting relations between two objects from Wikipedia. Wethen propose new approaches for Enishi to search more multimedia information aboutrelations on the Web using elucidatory objects.

Development of an XML information retrieval system for queries on contents and structures,Toshiyuki Shimizu; Norimasa Terada; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,We have developed an XML information retrieval system which can process queries bykeywords or queries by combination of keywords and structural conditions. Queries bykeywords are simple yet useful because users are not required to understand XML querylanguages or XML schema. While issuing queries by combination of keywords and structuralconditions requires users to understand query languages and the underlying XML schema;we can restrict the target document fragments and the search conditions using structures inXML. The system was implemented on top of a relational XML database system developedby our group. The system can process both types of queries under a common relationalschema. By carefully designing the database schema; the system handles a huge number ofdocument fragments efficiently. For queries by keywords; we have developed a user …,Informatics Research for Development of Knowledge Society Infrastructure; 2007. ICKS 2007. Second International Conference on,2007,3
A study on efficient access control for xml ducuments,Naotake Kitagawa; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,In access control for XML (Extensible Markup Language) documents; the security level forparticular XML nodes differs depending on the user's id or role. In this paper; we introducePolicy Tables for each roles; and discuss optimization of these tables. In general; there is atrade-off between the power of policy description and the time required for an accessdecision. We discuss two approaches to the reduction of time for the access decision. Thefirst is the creation of the Policy Tables beforehand. The second approach is a simplificationof the Policy Tables by exploiting the consecutive property of the decision result for XMLelements.,Data Engineering Workshops; 2005. 21st International Conference on,2005,3

Virtual joins for XML data,Dao Dinh Kha; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Abstract Establishing the hierarchical order among the XML elements is an essentialfunction of the XML query processing techniques and there are a number of proposals forthe task. Although most of XML documents have associated DTD or XML schema; the priorquery processing techniques have not utilized the document structure information efficiently.Each of prior techniques has an advantage in processing only a type of queries and it isdifficult to incorporate them to complement each other. In this study; we propose a novelXML query processing method that uses DTD or XML schema to improve the I/O complexityof XML query processing. We design a Structure-based Coding for XML data (SCX) thatincorporates both structure and tag name information extracted from the document structuredescriptions.

A scheme for managing metadata about video data recorded by wearable cameras,Toshiyuki Amagasa; Kiyohiro Hyo; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Abstract This paper propose “MPEG-7 Publishing;” a novel approach to publish MPEG-7descriptions from video data and accompanying supplemental data. Our approach allowsusers to specify how the scenes are computed using supplemental data. Given a user'srequest; our approach automatically generates corresponding MPEG-7 descriptionscontaining computed scenes that are generated using supplemental data. In this way; MPEG-7 publishing can facilitate automatic generation of metadata that flexibly meet users'demand. In this paper; we apply the MPEG-7 publishing to a wearable computingenvironment. Concretely; we use various kinds of users' context data; such as location;direction; altitude; voice annotation; and miscellaneous electronic data; as supplementaldata; and show how we can generate MPEG-7 descriptions out of supplemental data.

A System for Integration of Heterogeneous Biological XML Data,Noboru Matoba; Junko Tanoue; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Biological data exists all over the world as various web services; which provide biologistswith many useful information. However; when users actually make use of them; they need toaccess each web service (database) one by one. If they want to compare many differentkinds of data; they have to do cumbersome tasks. Furthermore; there are many otherproblems which make such comparison difficult: firstly; from a viewpoint of biological data:(1)data is omnipresent all over the world;(2) the vocabulary is not unified; and secondly; fromweb services (database):(1) each database has its own user interface and schema;(2) datais updated frequently;(3) the required knowledge about the data currently supported and theoperation method of the service itself differs from system to system.

How to balance privacy and money through pricing mechanism in personal data market,Rachana Nget; Yang Cao; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract: A personal data market is a platform including three participants: data owners(individuals); data buyers and market maker. Data owners who provide personal data arecompensated according to their privacy loss. Data buyers can submit a query and pay for theresult according to their desired accuracy. Market maker coordinates between data ownerand buyer. This framework has been previously studied based on differential privacy.However; the previous study assumes data owners can accept any level of privacy loss anddata buyers can conduct the transaction without regard to the financial budget. In this paper;we propose a practical personal data trading framework that is able to strike a balancebetween money and privacy. In order to gain insights on user preferences; we firstconducted an online survey on human attitude to-ward privacy and interest in personal …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.02982,2017,2
Mutually beneficial confluent routing,Xinpeng Zhang; Yasuhito Asano; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,We investigate a new multi-user routing problem: mutually beneficial confluent routing(MCR). In the MCR; every user has his/her own source and destination; confluences of userroutes occur so that users can mutually benefit from travelling together on the confluences.The idea of gaining benefit from travelling together is valuable in various practicalapplications; such as ride sharing; delivery routing; and pedestrian navigation. We formulatethe MCR as a new combinatorial optimization problem on road networks. The MCR is moregeneral and complex than single vehicle routing problems; ride-sharing problems; and theSteiner tree problem. We propose exact and efficient algorithms for the MCR for the settingof two or three users. The setting is reasonable for various practical applications. The keyideas of our algorithms are to use “confluence patterns” of the optimal solutions and …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,2
Course Content Analysis: An Initiative Step toward Learning Object Recommendation Systems for MOOC Learners.,Yiling Dai; Yasuhito Asano; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,ABSTRACT With the accelerating development of open education; lowcost online learningresources; such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs); are reaching a wide audiencearound the world. However; when faced with these appealing but overwhelming learningresources; learners are prone making rash learning decisions; which may be eitherexcessive or insufficient to their learning capacities. To avoid the mismatch betweenlearners and learning objects; we propose a supporting system that recommends apersonalized path of learning objects for a given learner. In realizing this system; a domainknowledge structure is necessary to connect learners' information and learning objects. Asan initiative step; we employ the Labeled Latent Dirichlet Allocation method to predict howthe content of a course is distributed over different categories in the domain. We conduct …,EDM,2016,2

Mining and explaining relationships in Wikipedia,Xinpeng Zhang; Yasuhito Asano; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Mining and explaining relationships between concepts are challenging tasks in the field ofknowledge search. We propose a new approach for the tasks using disjoint paths formed bylinks in Wikipedia. Disjoint paths are easy to understand and do not contain redundantinformation. To achieve this approach; we propose a naive method; as well as a generalizedflow based method; and a technique for mining more disjoint paths using the generalizedflow based method. We also apply the approach to classification of relationships. Ourexperiments reveal that the generalized flow based method can mine many disjoint pathsimportant for understanding a relationship; and the classification is effective for explainingrelationships.,IEICE TRANSACTIONS on Information and Systems,2012,2
How can the Web help Wikipedia? a study of information complementation of Wikipedia by the Web,Damien Eklou; Yasuhito Asano; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract: With the huge amount of data on the Web; looking for desired information can be atime-consuming task. Wikipedia is a helpful tool because it is the largest; most-populargeneral reference site on the Internet. Most search engines rank Wikipedia pages amongthe top listed results. However; because many articles on Wikipedia are manually updatedby users; several articles lack information and must be upgraded. That necessaryinformation for updates can sometimes be found on the Web. Uprooting this information fromthe Web involves a time-consuming process of reading; analyzing and summarizing theinformation for the user. To support the user search process and to help Wikipediacontributors in the updating process of articles; we propose a method of finding valuablecomplementary information related to the Web.

Alternative query generation for XML keyword search and its optimization,Tetsutaro Motomura; Toshiyuki Shimizu; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract Much work has been done in XML keyword search since users can obtain variousinformation from XML databases without specific knowledge of the database schema and/orthe knowledge about the query languages. Moreover; certain researches have suggestedmethods of returning some information that would help users understand search results. Inthis paper; we define alternative queries; which can be considered as different aspects ofXML keyword search results. In XML keyword search; a keyword may match an unexpectedtext value or element name; then incorrect results that do not correspond to the users' searchintentions may be retrieved. When we generate alternative queries; it does not seem usefulto generate alternative queries for all the results since they include several results retrievedby several interpretations. Thus; we propose a method of generating alternative queries …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2011,2
Towards improving wikipedia as an image-rich encyclopaedia through analyzing appropriateness of images for an article,Xinpeng Zhang; Yasuhito Asano; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract In Wikipedia; knowledge related to an object is gathered into a single article that ismainly composed of text and images. We observed that some Wikipedia images areinappropriate for addition to some Wikipedia articles. In this paper; we propose a RCT modelfor analyzing the appropriateness of images for Wikipedia articles. The model assumes thatan image appearing in article s indicates relations related to s. The model then examines theappropriateness of an image through analyzing relations indicated by the image. We alsopropose a system which examining Wikipedia images using the RCT model. The systemalso searches images on the Web which could serve as references for users to addappropriate images or text to edit high-quality and image-rich Wikipedia articles.

Analysis of news agencies' descriptive feature by using SVO structure,Shin Ishida; Qiang Ma; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,In some sense; news is probably never free from the agencies' subjective valuation andexternal forces such as owners and advertisers. As a result; the perspective of news contentmay be biased. To clarify such a bias; we propose a novel method to extract characteristicdescriptions on a certain entity (person; location; organization; etc.) in articles of a newsagency. For a given entity; a description is one tuple (called SVO tuple) that consists ofthatentity and the other words or phrases appearing in the same sentence on the basis of theirSVO (Subject (S); Verb (V) and Object (O)) roles. By computing the frequency and inverseagency frequency of each description; we extract the characteristic description on a certainentity. Intuitively; a SVO tuple; which is often used by the news agency but not commonlyused by the others; has high probability of being of a characteristic description.

How to store and query large amount of RDF data becomes an important issue of theSemantic Web. In this paper; we first discuss the usage of Concise Bounded Description(CBD). As an improvement; we define Dynamic Concise Bounded Description (DCBD)which isa general and dynamic version of CBD. We also propose a query language for RDFcalled DCBDQuery. DCBDQuery is used for constituting DCBD and finding meaningfulreachable path or shortest path with respect to DCBD. Then we discuss an alternativeapproach for storing RDF data into Relational Database; called Updated Schema-awareRepresentation. We store RDF data into database using this representation; and then creategraph in main memory from internal link statements.

Rewriting XQuery by child-path folding,Hiroyuki Kato; Soichiro Hidaka; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,ABSTRACT An XQuery optimization by rewriting based on a partial evaluation using foldingexpressions is proposed. It consists of two parts: one is the main algorithm; which is arecursive algorithm based on an inductive definition of XQuery expressions. The other isinvoked by the main algorithm with an expression whose subexpressions are already foldedas its input; and it applies the expression-specific folding function. The main contributions ofthis paper is to propose an algorithm of an expression-specific folding called “child-pathfolding”. For a given query to the child axis over an element constructed by another XQuery;that is; a composite XQuery; this folding eliminates redundant element constructionoperators and expressions. These kinds of queries are typical in Global-As-View approachto data integration systems. We also show that all redundant element construction …,Progress in Infromatics,2007,2
A relevant score normalization method using shannon’s information measure,Yu Suzuki; Kenji Hatano; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura; Kyoji Kawagoe,Abstract Given the ranked lists of images with relevance scores returned by multiple imageretrieval subsystems in response to a given query; the problem of combined retrieval systemis how to combine these lists equivalently. In this paper; we propose a novel relevance scorenormalization method based on Shannon's information measure. Generally; the number ofrelevant images is exceedingly smaller than that of the entire retrieval targets. Therefore; wesuppose that if the subsystems can clearly identify which retrieval targets are relevant; thesubsystems should calculate high relevance scores to a few retrieval targets. In short; wecan calculate the sureness of the IR subsystem using the distribution of the relevancescores. Then; we calculate the sureness of the IR subsystems using Shannon's informationmeasure; and calculate the normalized relevance scores using the sureness of the IR …,International Conference on Asian Digital Libraries,2005,2

To construct the hierarchical structure of the directories; the technique finds Webpages with a super-sub relation; which are connected by hyperlinks; and replaces therelation with a super-sub hierarchical relation between directories. The technique constructshierarchical directories by iterating the integration of directories. As a result of an experimentusing five Web sites; it was possible to construct hierarchical directories containing Webpages from several sites.,Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Engineering; 2005.

In this paper; we describe SKEYRUS; a system; whichenables the integrated structure-keyword searches on XML data using the rUID numberingscheme. rUID has been designed to be robust in structural update and applicable toarbitrarily large XML documents. SKEYRUS accepts XPath expressions containing word-containment predicates as the input; therefore the query expressiveness is significantlyextended. The structural feature and the ability to generate XPath axes of rUID are exploitedin query processing. Preliminary performance results of SKEYRUS were also reported.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2002,2

The subspace coding method: a new indexing scheme for high-dimensional data,Yasushi Sakurai; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura; Haruhiko Kojima,ABSTRACT This paper presents a new indexing scheme; the Subspace Coding Method(SCM); that offers high performance similarity retrieval. It is based on an analysis of the twosuperior access methods proposed so far: the SR-tree and the VA-File. Our experimentaltest by real data provides that the SR-tree offers better performance. However; asdimensionality increases; the large volume of entries in non-leaf nodes degrades the searchperformance. Based on the analysis; we introduce the SCM; a new indexing schemeapplicable to any tree index employing MBR (Minimum Bounding Rectangle) and/or MBS(Minimum Bounding Sphere). The basic idea of the SCM is the introduction of VirtualBounding Rectangle (VBR) and Virtual Bounding quasiSphere (VBS); which contain andapproximate MBR and MBS; respectively.

Evaluation with Confusable Ground Truth,Jiyi Li; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract Subjective judgment with human rating has been an important way of constructingground truth for the evaluation in the research areas including information retrieval.Researchers aggregate the ratings of an instance into a single score by statistical measuresor label aggregation methods to evaluate the proposed approaches and baselines.However; the rating distributions of instances are diverse even if the aggregated scores aresame. We define a term of confusability which represents how confusable the reviewers areon the instances. We find that confusability has prominent influence on the evaluation resultswith a exploration study. We thus propose a novel evaluation solution with several effectiveconfusability measures and confusability aware evaluation methods. They can be used as asupplementary to existing rating aggregation methods and evaluation methods.,Asia Information Retrieval Symposium,2016,1
Enrichment of academic search engine results pages by citation-based graphs,Shuhei Shogen; Toshiyuki Shimizu; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract Researchers' readings of academic papers make their research more sophisticatedand objective.

Ranking Recipes According to Classicality towards Understanding Evolution of Food Preference,Yichen Wen; Yasuhito Asano; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Food evolution has been a revealing indicator of human beings' living activities. Knowinghow food and people's food preferences evolve helps us to elucidate important aspects ofhuman society; culture; and history. Before; an individual researcher was able to trackchanges of food by manual investigation of recipes in books or among people. Propagationof information among common people was slow; usually limited to being narrow andregional. Today; people can upload their own recipes easily to recipe sites such asCookPad in Japan. Information related to food has increased rapidly. Therefore; trackingfood evolution has become impossible without computer-based data analysis.

Therefore; a pedestrian navigation system is required torecommend a less stressful route for a user by estimating such environmental factors.Towards realizing such a system; we firstly collect vital sign; spatiotemporal andenvironmental data from pedestrians; and secondly analyze the relation between them; andthen propose models for estimating the personal stress of a pedestrian. As our vital signdata; we calculate the stress of each pedestrian from the RR interval data obtained by aheart rate sensor. Our spatiotemporal data includes the walking speed of pedestrians androad grade calculated from GPS sensor data.

Causal Analysis for Supporting Users' Understanding of Investment Trusts,Yuki Awano; Qiang Ma; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract While many governments have introduced financial schemes to encourage peopleto invest; it is difficult to understand investment trusts and decide which one to buy. Toaddress that difficulty of understanding; a method for extracting causalities from monthlyreports of investment trusts and visualizing them to support a potential investor'sunderstanding of a trust is proposed. First; CRF is used to extract causalities from monthlyreports. Note that features of financial reports other than linguistic features are alsoconsidered. Next; a causal network is constructed and visualized in consideration of thedegrees of influence; frequency; and newness of the extracted causalities. The LOD controlmethod is then applied to present causalities in consideration of the granularity of eventsappearing in the causal network.

In such metadata; keyword information isimportant. Controlled keywords such as GCMD Science Keyword are used for metadata.However; selection of suitable keywords is not easy. We propose methods to suggestkeywords from summary texts of datasets. We considered simple string matching andinferring by Labeled LDA; and apply them to the actual earth science metadata.,Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC); 2013 IEEE 37th Annual,2013,1

Improving Folksonomy Tag Quality of Social Image Hosting Website,Jiyi Li; Qiang Ma; Yasuhito Asano; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract Social image hosting websites such as Flickr provide services to users for sharingtheir images. Users can upload and tag their images or search for images by usingkeywords which describe image semantics. However various low quality tags in the usergenerated folksonomy tags have negative influence on the image search results and userexperience. To improve tag quality; we propose three approaches with one framework toautomatically generate new tags; and rank the new tags as well as the existing raw tags; forboth untagged and tagged images. The approaches utilize and integrate both textual andvisual information; and analyze intra-and inter-probabilistic relationships among images andtags based on a graph model. The experiments based on the dataset constructed from Flickrillustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approaches.,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2012,1
Ranking content-based social images search results with social tags,Jiyi Li; Qiang Ma; Yasuhito Asano; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract With the recent rapid growth of social image hosting websites; such as Flickr; it iseasier to construct a large database with tagged images. Social tags have been proven tobe effective for providing keyword-based image retrieval and widely used on these websites;but whether they are beneficial for improving content-based image retrieval has not beenwell investigated in previous work. In this paper; we investigate whether and how social tagscan be used for improving content-based image search results. We propose anunsupervised approach for automatic ranking without user interactions. It propagates visualand textual information on an image-tag relationship graph with a mutual reinforcementprocess. We conduct experiments showing that our approach can successfully use socialtags for ranking and improving content-based social image search results; and performs …,Asia Information Retrieval Symposium,2011,1
Discovering Inconsistency in Multimedia News Based on a Material-Opinion Model,Ling Xu; Takayuki Yumoto; Shinya Aoki; Qiang Ma; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,The advantages of the multimedia make the video news presented believable andimpressed to the viewers when the personal opinions and ideological perspectives hiddenin the contents still cause the effect. To reduce the risk of the misleading; based on aMaterial-Opinion model; we propose a method of detecting the inconsistent news itemsreporting the same event when the viewer is watching one of them. In the Material-OpinionModel; main participants filmed as the materials are presented to the viewer through thevideo stream; which is used to support the arguments put forward. Based on this model;given a series of multimedia news items reporting a same event; we explore inconsistencybetween any two of them by computing their dissimilarities of materials and of opinions.Material-dissimilarity is based on the appearance of the main participants in the video …,System Sciences (HICSS); 2011 44th Hawaii International Conference on,2011,1

Mining useful time graph patterns on extensively discussed topics on the Web,Taihei Oshino; Yasuhito Asano; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract Temporal characteristics of the web have been analyzed widely in recent years; butgraph patterns have served important roles for analyzing the web's structural characteristics.Although temporal characteristics of the web have not been estimated in previous patterns;we specifically examine a novel kind of pattern; time graph patterns; estimating time-seriesdata including the creation times of pages and links. We find useful time graph patternsrepresenting the process by which a topic is discussed extensively during a short periodwithout manual investigations of web graphs. We have also analyzed the patterns and theweb pages corresponding to the patterns. Three characteristic pages are contained in thepatterns. Additionally; we have succeeded in finding a subgraph matching a mined pattern.We observed that the subgraph corresponds to an extensively discussed topic.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,1
Meaningful Interrelated Object Tree for XML Keyword Search,Umaporn Supasitthimethee; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Toshiyuki Shimizu; Kriengkrai Porkaew,In the research field of XML retrieval with keyword-based approach; a variant of LowestCommon Ancestors (LCAs) have been widely accepted to provide how keywords areconnected by ancestor relationship. However; returning a whole subtree or a partial subtreebased on LCA nodes is insufficient for identifying how subtrees are conceptually relatedunder different tree structure such as ID/IDREF. On the other hand; storing XML documentsin the graph model can define richer relationships that the tree model cannot but the cost ofenumerating result is very high. In this paper; we propose a novel Smallest Lowest ObjectTree (SLOT) which keywords are connected through physical connections. In addition; tocapture conceptual connections; we also propose the Smallest Interrelated Object Tree(SIOT) which extends ID/IDREF relationships based on SLOT.

Visualized elucidations of ranking by exploiting object relations,Xinpeng Zhang; Yasuhito Asano; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,For understanding human activity; a useful approach is to rank people according to thestrength of their relations to a specified person. Similarly; rankings of objects based on sucha relation are used in several fields. Several methods have been proposed for computingthe strength of a relation between two objects. These methods do not present a reason whyan object has a stronger relation to a specified object than another object has. Therefore; it isdifficult for a user to understand a ranking obtained using these methods. On the other hand;the authors recently proposed a method for computing the strength of a relation throughmining objects to elucidate the relation. We propose a ranking tool based on this method toafford a better understanding of a ranking.

A New Ranking Scheme and Result Representation for XML Information Retrieval Based on Benefit and Reading Effort,Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Toshiyuki Shimizu,Elements of XML documents greatly vary in size and may nest each other. XML informationretrieval (XML-IR) systems are required to take these nature of XML documents intoconsideration. Because of these natures; top-k search is not suitable for XML-IR. Weintroduce new concepts of benefit and reading effort of elements. By using these concepts;we propose a new dynamic ranking method that enables us to browse search results of XML-IR systems efficiently. We also study how to display the search results of XML-IR systems. IfXML document was original composed of paper image pages; such as scholarly articles orbooks; it would be natural to display result elements by overlaying them on the physicallayout of pages in the user interfaces. We propose methods for displaying the result of XMLsearch of scholarly articles and ranking methods based on page units.,Informatics Education and Research for Knowledge-Circulating Society; 2008.

Ranking and Presenting Search Results in an RDB-based XML Search Engine,Kenji Hatano; Toshiyuki Shimizu; Jun Miyazaki; Yu Suzuki; Hiroko Kinutani; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract. Conventional ranking methods for document search have considered content ofdocuments to rank a search result. They have attained some positive results in the researcharea of document search; however; it has been said that content of not only documents butalso queries should be utilized if users want to get a search result accurately. This factapplies to XML search engines. In this paper; therefore; we propose a ranking method forXML search considering content-and-structure conditions of both XML documents andqueries. We also propose a method for presenting a search result for XML search; becauseit is very important for users to grasp and understand the entire search result; too. Weimplemented our ranking method on top of XRel; a relational database system for XMLdocuments; and found that our proposal allows users to search XML fragments more …,Pre-Proceedings of INEX 2007 Workshop,2007,1

An information filtering system for portable computers,Yu Suzuki; K Hatano; M Takano; M Yoshikawa; S Uemura,Currently; we have many occasions to use portable computers such as personal dataassistants (PDAs) and cellular phones. The wireless communication techniques haveevolved rapidly; so that we can gather the necessary information from the Internet using theportable computers anytime and anywhere. However; browsing the information takes muchtune because we usually have to obtain the information from the Internet using the portablecomputers having a low data transmission speed. In this paper; we propose an informationcaching algorithm for portable computers. Our method preferentially caches the files; thesize of which is large; and is different from current web caching techniques.,Communications; Computers and signal Processing; 2003.

Cross-language information retrieval using multiple resources and combinations for query expansion,Fatiha Sadat; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Abstract As Internet resources become accessible to more and more countries; there is aneed to develop efficient methods for information retrieval across languages. In the presentpaper; we focus on query expansion techniques to improve the effectiveness of aninformation retrieval. A combination to a dictionary-based translation and statistical-baseddisambiguation is indispensable to overcome translation's ambiguity. We propose a modelusing multiple sources for query reformulation and expansion to select expansion terms andretrieve information needed by a user. Relevance feedback; thesaurus-based expansion; aswell as a new feedback strategy; based on the extraction of domain keywords to expanduser's query; are introduced and evaluated.

Processing XML queries on structure and keyword in SKEYRUS,Dao Dinh Kha; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Abstract Applying numbering schemes to simulate the structure of XML data is a promisingtechnique for XML query processing. In this paper; we describe SKEYRUS; a system; whichenables the integrated structure-keyword searches on XML data using the rUID numberingscheme. rUID has been designed to be robust in structural update and applicable toarbitrarily large XML documents. SKEYRUS accepts XPath expressions containing word-containment predicates as the input; therefore the query expressiveness is significantlyextended. The structural feature and the ability to generate XPath axes of rUID are exploitedin query processing. Preliminary performance results of SKEYRUS were also reported.,*,2002,1

Spatial indexing by virtual bounding rectangles for high-dimensional data,Yasushi Sakurai; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Abstract This chapter presents a new indexing scheme; the Subspace Coding Method(SCM); that offers high performance similarity retrieval. Indices in the R-tree family generatetree structure using MBRs (Minimum bounding rectangles) or MBSs (Minimum boundingspheres). Our proposed method is based on tree structure indices using MBRs (ie the R-tree; the R*-tree; the X-tree and so on); and newly introduced the notion of VBR (VirtualBounding Rectangle). VBRs are rectangles which contain and approximate MBRs.Importantly; the notion of VBR is orthogonal to any other method in the field of spatial searchand is introduced into any spatial indices using MBRs. Furthermore; we have introduced theSubspace Coding Method; which can compactly represent VBRs in tree structures; using itsrelative position within the parent VBR.

On synchronous properties of periodically generated data sequences,Koichi Munakata; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,We address the problem of choosing synchronous data combinations from periodicallygenerated data sequences (PGDAs). In real time systems; PGDAs play a major role. Whenintegrating PGDAs generated from various information sources; we face the problem ofchoosing which data combinations to use; since different PGDAs; in general; have differentdata generation intervals. A data combination is defined as a set of data each obtained fromdistinct PGDAs. As a criterion for choosing a data combination; we propose a novel notion ofsynchronousness of data combinations. We present two theorems for calculating upperbounds of the synchronousness of data combinations; given a set of PGDAs: one for PGDAswith the same periodic interval and the other for PGDAs with different periodic intervals.These theorems give the synchronousness upper bounds that guarantee to find the data …,Database Applications in Non-Traditional Environments; 1999.(DANTE'99) Proceedings. 1999 International Symposium on,1999,1

Object Identity and Query Equivalence,Richard Hull; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract The equivalence problem is studied for programs specifying queries and databaserestructurings in models using object identity. We use the family of ILOG langauges; whichcaptures essential features of several data restructuring languages in the theoretical andapplied literature. ILOG uses a mechanism based on Skolem functors for “inventing” or“creating” object identifiers (OIDs). Two notions of equivalence are articulated: underexposed equivalence the Skolem terms forming created OIDs are exposed; under obscuredequivalence these terms are “replaced” with “new'; uninterpreted OIDs. In general; eg; ifeither negation or recursion is present; both forms of equivalence are undecidable. In thecase of nrecILOG; which can be viewed as unions of conjunctive queries with OID creation;exposed equivalence is decidable. The decidability of obscured equivalence for …,*,1992,1

Medication Pattern Mining Considering Unbiased Frequent Use by Doctors,Yuji Morita; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Noboru Kada; Akihiro Hamasaki; Osamu Sugiyama; Kazuya Okamoto; Tomohiro Kuroda,Abstract Background: Many previous studies on mining prescription sequences are basedonly on frequency information; such as the number of prescriptions and the total number ofpatients issued the prescription. However; in cases where a very small number of doctorsissue a prescription representative of a certain medication pattern to many patients manytimes; the prescribing intention of this very small number of doctors has a great influence onpattern extraction; which introduces bias into the final extracted frequent prescriptionsequence pattern. Objectives: We attempt to extract frequent prescription sequences frommore diverse perspectives by considering factors other than frequency information to ensurehighly reliable medication patterns. Methods: We propose the concept of unbiased frequentuse by doctors as a factor in addition to frequency information based on the hypothesis …,EJBI,2018,*
Medication Episode Construction Framework for Retrospective Database Analyses of Patients with Chronic Diseases,Purnomo Husnul Khotimah; Yuichi Sugiyama; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Akihiro Hamasaki; Osamu Sugiyama; Kazuya Okamoto; Tomohiro Kuroda,Objective: For chronic diseases; medical history reconstruction is essential for retrospectivedatabase analyses. One important aspect is determining which prescriptions belong to thesame episode. However; a standard framework for this task is still lacking; particularly formultitherapy datasets. This paper presents a medication episode construction framework forthe medical history of patients with chronic diseases. Methods: Allen's relaxed temporalrelations (ie; temporal relations with time constraints relaxed by±ε) is used to define theconsecutive prescription relations considering the patients' behavior. For example; patientsoccasionally arrive earlier or later than their appointment. Results: ε influences thegeneration of stable periods (ie; periods of time; at least 3 months; in which a medication iscontinuously taken by a patient).

Quantifying Differential Privacy in Continuous Data Release under Temporal Correlations,Yang Cao; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Yonghui Xiao; Li Xiong,Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) has received increasing attention as a rigorous privacyframework. Many existing studies employ traditional DP mechanisms (eg; the Laplacemechanism) as primitives to continuously release private data for protecting privacy at eachtime point (ie; event-level privacy); which assume that the data at different time points areindependent; or that adversaries do not have knowledge of correlation between data.However; continuously generated data tend to be temporally correlated; and suchcorrelations can be acquired by adversaries. In this paper; we investigate the potentialprivacy loss of a traditional DP mechanism under temporal correlations. First; we analyze theprivacy leakage of a DP mechanism when adversaries have knowledge of such temporalcorrelations. Our analysis reveals that; the event-level privacy loss of a DP mechanism …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.11436,2017,*
Flexible and Fast Similarity Search for Enriched Trajectories,Hideaki Ohashi; Toshiyuki Shimizu; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,In this study; we focus on a method to search for similar trajectories.

Comparing frequent patterns: A study case of Apriori and singleton implementations in a diabetes type 2 data set,Purnomo Husnul Khotimah; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Akihiro Hamasaki; Osamu Sugiyama; Kazuya Okamoto; Tomohiro Kuroda,Frequent sequential pattern (FSP) mining has become an effective tool to explore the patternsequence occurrences in many fields. The methods developed in FSP is mainly based onApriori algorithm. This algorithm looks for frequent sequence of itemset which need not to beconsecutive. In addition; the itemset that supports the cardinality of a frequent sequence canbe a partial itemset. However; in the case of medication for diabetes type 2; the selection ofpatient medication is considered essential. A combination of medications represents theclinical conditions of the patients. Therefore; we considered a medication combination asone full item sets (ie; singleton). We are interested in the transition events from onemedication episode to the next. As such; we consider consecutive sequence of singleton.This paper studies the result characteristic of Apriori-based FSP and singleton mining …,Computer; Control; Informatics and its Applications (IC3INA); 2016 International Conference on,2016,*

A Dynamic-Static Approach of Model Fusion for Document Similarity Computation,Jiyi Li; Yasuhito Asano; Toshiyuki Shimizu; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract The semantic similarity of text document pairs can be used for valuableapplications. There are various existing basic models proposed for representing documentcontent and computing document similarity. Each basic model performs difference indifferent scenarios. Existing model selection or fusion approaches generate improvedmodels based on these basic models on the granularity of document collection. Theseimproved models are static for all document pairs and may be only proper for some of thedocument pairs. We propose a dynamic idea of model fusion; and an approach based on aDynamic-Static Fusion Model (DSFM) on the granularity of document pairs; which isdynamic for each document pair. The dynamic module in DSFM learns to rank the basicmodels to predict the best basic model for a given document pair. We propose a model …,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2015,*

Document similarity computation by combining multiple representation models,Jiyi Li; Toshiyuki Shimizu; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Evaluating semantic similarity of text document pairs is an active research topic. Variousmodels of document representation have been proposed. Each kind of representation modelconcentrates on a different kind of information from other kind of models. However; it isdifficult for a single model to perform well in all scenarios because of the variety of textualdocuments. Leveraging these models to complement each other is possible to improve theperformance. In this paper; we first make an analysis on the relations among documentsemantic similarity; human ratings and model performance. Based on the observations; wepropose a rational solution of selecting different representation models and fusing theresults of these models to compute document similarity for a given document collection.

Entity-oriented Materials and Opinions Extraction from News Articles,Ling Xu Keisuke Kiritoshi Qiang Ma; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,In modern life; news and information affect almost every aspects of life. Online news articlesor TV news work hard on passing information; arousing user interest as well as deliveringmessages and spreading even manipulating mass viewpoints. Unfortunately; because of thelack of the ground truth and distributed user opinions; it is difficult and inappropriate tofiltering all the perspectives hidden in the text for bias issues. There are lots of researches onopinion mining or sentiment analysis [1]. However; for the rich contents; long articles;complex reference; redundancy; entertaining and modern news articles; it requires intensivemethods for analyzing the complex news contents.

Towards Support for Understanding Classical Music: Alignment of Content Descriptions on the Web.,Taku Kuribayashi; Yasuhito Asano; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,ABSTRACT Supporting the understanding of classical music is an important topic thatinvolves various research fields such as text analysis and acoustics analysis. Contentdescriptions are explanations of classical music compositions that help a person tounderstand technical aspects of the music. Recently; Kuribayashi et al. proposed a methodfor obtaining content descriptions from the web. However; the content descriptions on asingle page frequently explain a specific part of a composition only. Therefore; a person whowants to fully understand the composition suffers from a time-consuming task; which seemsalmost impossible for a novice of classical music. To integrate the content descriptionsobtained from multiple pages; we propose a method for aligning each pair of paragraphs ofsuch descriptions.

However; it is hard to associatecorresponding parts which have been heavily modified only using similarity in their content.We propose a method of aligning documents considering not only content information butalso structural information in documents. Our method consists of three steps; baselinealignment considering document order; merging; and swapping. We used papers whichhave been presented at a domestic conference and an international conference; thenobtained their alignments by using several methods in our evaluation experiments.

Linkage of compound objects for supporting maintenance of large-scale web sites,Yuya Hirano; Qiang Ma; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract Departments of organizations such as companies and universities tend to publishvarious information on their own Web sites. For example; descriptions of the members of acertain laboratory at a university may appear on the laboratory's Web site; the department'sWeb site; and so on. However; inconsistencies may occur between descriptions on thesesites if their update timings and management policies are different. It is not easy to find suchinconsistencies on large-scale Web sites; and the maintenance costs of doing so are huge.Record linkage techniques; which determine if two entities represented as relational recordsare approximately the same; have been developed as ways of identifying whether twoentities are approximately the same.

Greedy Approximation Algorithms for Generalized Maximum Flow Problem towards Relation Extraction in Information Networks,Yusuke Nojima; Yasuhito Asano; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract Generalized maximum flow problem is a generalization of the traditional maximumflow problem; where each edge e has gain factor γ (e). When f (e) units of flow enter edgee=(u; v) at u; then γ (e) f (e) units of flow arrive at v. Since relation extraction; which is animportant application of the problem; uses large networks such as Wikipedia and DBLP; thecomputation time to solve the problem is important. However; conventional algorithms for theproblem are expensive and do not scale to large graph. Therefore; we proposeapproximation algorithms based on greedy augmentation and a heuristic initial flowcalculation. The experimental result shows that our algorithms are two orders of magnitudefaster than a conventional algorithm.,*,2013,*

Extraction of Characteristic Description for Analyzing News Agencies.,Shin Ishida; Qiang Ma; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,ABSTRACT: News agencies report news from different viewpoints and with different writingstyles and these differences often ap pear in their article descriptions. We propose a methodto extract characteristic descriptions on certain entities (per sons; locations; organizations;etc.) in news agency articles. For a given entity; a description is one tuple (called an SVOtuple) consisting of that entity and other words or phrases appearing in the same sentenceon the basis of their SVO (Subject (S); Verb (V) and Object (O)) roles. We extractcharacteristic descriptions of entities by computing the fre quency and inverse agencyfrequency of each description. By arranging characteristic descriptions chronologically; wewere able to ascertain the left-or right-leanings of news agencies and how those leaningsvaried with the passage of time.,JDIM,2010,*

It is necessary to addversion axes to XPath in order to trace version histories of fine-grained subdocuments ofXML. Although research has been done on the containment and equivalence problems forXPath; which is a basic property of optimizing queries; there has been no research in thecase for XPath extended with version axes. In this paper; we will propose query rewritingrules which can exchange between document axes and version axes; and prove that theyare preserving query semantics. The rewriting rules enable us to swap path subexpressionsbetween document axes and version axes to optimize queries.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2009,*

Efficient Similarity Search on Distribution Data,Yasuko Matsubara; Yasushi Sakurai; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,ABSTRACT Distribution data naturally arise in countless domains; such as meteorology;biology; geology; industry and economics. However; relatively little attention has been paidto data mining for large distribution sets. Given n distributions of multiple categories and aquery distribution Q; we want to find similar clouds (ie; distributions); to discover patterns;rules and outlier clouds. We propose to address this problem and present D-Search; anefficient algorithm for similarity search in large distribution datasets. Our main contributionsare (1) approximate KL divergence; which can speed up cloud-similarity computations byusing SVD coefficients;(2) multi-step sequential scan; which efficiently prunes a significantnumber of search candidates and leads to a direct reduction in the search cost. We alsointroduce an extended version of D-Search:(3) time-series distribution mining; which uses …,*,2009,*
Ranking people based on metadata analysis of search results,Qiang Ma; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract Person search is one of the most popular search types on the Web. Most of theconventional technologies for person search focused on mapping the person name to aspecific person (ie referents). In contrast; in this paper; we propose a novel ranking measurecalled famousness for person search. We use the notion of famousness for ranking peopleaccording to how well-known they are. Intuitively; famousness score is computed byanalyzing the metadata of search results returned by a search engine. The metadata used inour method include URL; snippet; and the number of search results. To compute thefamousness score of a person; first; we cluster the search results by using their metadata.Second; we compute the deviations in the size and number of such clusters. If the relatedWeb pages of a person can be grouped into many large clusters of similar size; it looks …,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2008,*
Person Retrieval on XML Documents by Coreference Analysis Utilizing Structural Features,Yumi Yonei; Mizuho Iwaihara; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract Keyword retrieval of the present day exploits frequencies and positions of searchkeywords in target documents. As for retrieval by two or more keywords; semantic relationbetween keywords is important. For retrieving information about a person; it is common tosearch by a pair of keywords consisting of person's name and his/her attribute of the interest.By using dependency analysis and coreference analysis; correct occurrences of pairs ofperson and his/her attributes can be retrieved. However; existing natural language analysisdoes not consider the factor that logical structures of the documents strongly influenceprobabilistic patterns of coreference. In this paper; we propose a new way of person retrievalby computing a maximum entropy model from linguistic features and structural features;where structural features are learned from probabilistic distribution of coreference over …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2008,*

An Extension of LCA Based XML Keyword Search,Umaporn Supasitthimethee; Toshiyuki Shimizu; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Kriengkrai Porkaew,One of the most convenient ways to query XML data is a keyword search because it doesnot require any knowledge about XML structure and without the need to learn a new userinterface. However; keyword search interface is very flexible. It is hard for a system to decidewhich node is likely to be chosen as a return node and how much information should beincluded in the result. To address this challenge; we propose an extension of LCA basedXML keyword search. First; to determine a return node; we provide a query syntax that theusers can tell the system which node they are really interested in. In case that the users donot explicitly specify return information; our system will automatically analyze and chooseappropriate return nodes by inferring from user keywords. Second; to return a meaningfulresult; we investigate the problem of the return information in the LCA and the proximity …,Information-Explosion and Next Generation Search; 2008. INGS'08.

Acquisition of visited locative nouns from blogs by using surface features of blogs and case frames,Takuya Kobayashi; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract Extraction of reputation information from blog content has recently been emergingas an important research topic. In case of reputation about planimetrical features such asfacilities or restaurants; documents not based on actual visits are unsuitable as the extractedobjects for reputation information. This paper proposes a method of acquiring visited locativenouns from blog documents by using their surface features and case frames. We expect thatthe extraction of information from blogs with a higher degree of certainty will be possible byapplying this method before extracting reputation information.,Proceedings of the 2nd international conference on Ubiquitous information management and communication,2008,*
A More Optimizer-Friendly Treatment of XQuery Store in the Presence of Side-Effects,Soichiro Hidaka; Hiroyuki Kato; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,XQuery is a functional query language for XML in which generally no order for theevaluation of sub-expressions is assumed. However; there are in fact several sources ofside effects; including a subtle one caused by element constructing in the current version;data manipulation outside of the language by user-code via API; and possible future updateextensions. They prevent an implementation from optimization by reordering the executionor parallel processing. In this paper; two approaches are proposed to tackle these obstacles.One is to reconsider the treatment of the store; and the other is to introduce a way to identifythe portions where the updates actually take place. We believe these propositions will helpthe implementations perform safer optimizations.,Information Technology Convergence; 2007. ISITC 2007. International Symposium on,2007,*

Online ISSN: 1349-8606 Progress in Informatics,Hiroyuki KATO; Soichiro HIDAKA; Masatoshi YOSHIKAWA,Abstract: An XQuery optimization by rewriting based on a partial evaluation using foldingexpressions is proposed. It consists of two parts: one is the main algorithm; which is arecursive algorithm based on an inductive definition of XQuery expressions. The other isinvoked by the main algorithm with an expression whose subexpressions are already foldedas its input; and it applies the expression-specific folding function. The main contributions ofthis paper is to propose an algorithm of an expression-specific folding called “child-pathfolding”. For a given query to the child axis over an element constructed by another XQuery;that is; a composite XQuery; this folding eliminates redundant element constructionoperators and expressions. These kinds of queries are typical in Global-As-View approachto data integration systems. We also show that all redundant element construction …,Progress in Informatics,2007,*

Silicon/nitrogen content ratio in matured stage of rice straws hadpositive correlation with number of grains/nitrogen ratio and ripening ratio; and it hadnegative correlation with nitrogen content in rice grains. Three methods for measuringavailable silicon of paddy soil; ie the acetate buffer method; the submerged soil incubationmethod and the phosphate buffer method were investigated; and the amounts of availablesilicon determined by these methods correlated logarithmic curvelinearly with silicon contentin matured stage of straw. No correlation was observed between the amounts of availablesilicon from these three methods and nitrogen content of rice grains.,Kinki Chugoku Shikoku Agricultural Research (Japan),2007,*

An efficient schema-based technique for querying XML data,Dao Dinh Kha; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,As data integration over the Web has become an increasing demand; there is a growingdesire to use XML as a standard format for data exchange. For sharing their grammarsefficiently; most of the XML documents in use are associated with a document structuredescription; such as DTD or XML schema. However; the document structure information isnot utilized efficiently in previously proposed techniques of XML query processing. In thispaper; we present a novel technique that reduces the disk I/O complexity of XML queryprocessing. We design a schema-based numbering scheme called SPAR that incorporatesboth structure information and tag names extracted from DTD or XML schema. Based onSPAR; we develop a mechanism called VirtualJoin that significantly reduces disk I/Oworkload for processing XML queries.

The proposed technique; which is based on spatial transformationconcepts; can effectively support queries based on an ellipsoid distance function. Althoughtechniques for processing ellipsoid queries by using a multidimensional index structurehave previously been proposed; these techniques require a great deal of time to computethe distance between a query point and the bounding rectangle; which results in higher CPUcosts than disk access costs.

XML Content Update Using Relative Region Coordinates,Dao Dinh Kha; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Among several methods of storing XML documents; a straightforward yet efficient method isto store a string representation of the XML document. An XML node is usually representedby a region coordinate; which is a pair of integers expressing the start and end positions ofthe substring corresponding to the node. This approach; however; has the drawback that achange of a node's region coordinate causes change of the region coordinates of manyother elements. This recomputation normally degrades the performance of XMLapplications; especially when content is updated frequently. In this paper; we propose theRelative Region Coordinate (RRC) technique to effectively reduce the cost of recomputation.The main idea is to express the coordinate of an XML element in the region of its parentelement.

Sinceno result on the comparison between the SR-tree and the VA-File is available; we haveperformed experiments comparing these two access methods. The experiments reveal thatthese methods each have their problems. The SR-tree offers better performance fornonuniformly distributed data sets.

Broadcasting geographic information with levels-of-details to moving objects,Y Luo; T Amagasa; S Uemura; M Yoshikawa,In recent years; broadcast data delivery has been studied well with the spread of mobileterminals. In order to realize efficient data distribution; we have proposed a technique togroup moving objects with respect to not only their positions; but also their direction andspeeds. This paper aims at further improvements in the efficiency of information distributionby introducing the concept of LoD (levels of details) into broadcast data. Specifically; thegeographic data are distributed with distinct granularities depending on distances betweenthe data and moving objects. This is realized with the combination of source data written inXML and accompanying transformation scripts that extract coarse data from the source data.The proposed scheme makes it possible to lower the amount of transmitted data.Furthermore; we propose two algorithms for scheduling broadcast geographic data; One …,Communications; Computers and signal Processing; 2003.

Graphical Representation of Gene Ontology in Scalable Vector Graphics,Junko Tanoue; Noboru Matoba; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Graphical representation is important because it helps humans to understand complexinformation or concepts. A good example of graphical representation in biology is pathwaychart. If consisting reaction paths were described only in text; understanding a wholepathway would be very difficult. Many genome databases on the Web use graphicalrepresentation in user interface. When images are used as a user interface; interactivity suchas switching or zooming images on request is often needed. Common ways to provide suchfunctions have been the use of clickable maps; Java applet and Java Script; etc. However;when using GIF/JPEG/PNG images; several limitations exist. Those images are static so thatmodifying their properties on client-side is not possible. Also; sometimes all image files mustbe prepared in advance because dynamically generating raster images is not a simple …,Genome Informatics,2001,*

They describe physicalstorage methods for how to break down and manage documents and management methodsusing types other than character strings in a subdocument in an internal representation of adatabase of a structured document. In addition; the authors propose a database model forstructured documents with links at the object level between text strings in the document andthe semantic data (referred to herein as annotation data) in the database expressed by textstrings as well as queries to such databases. The conceptual model for text with links at theobject level is composed of two layers; the notation layer which holds the notation characterstrings and the reference layer which stores the semantic data that represent the partial …,Systems and Computers in Japan,2000,*

The 1990 MB: The first Mars Trojan,Kimmo A Innanen; Seppo Mikkola; Edward Bowell; Karri Muinonen; Eugene M Shoemaker,Abstract: Asteroid 1990 MB was discovered by DH Levy and HE Holt during the course ofthe Mars and Earth Crossing Asteroid and Comet Survey. An orbit based on a 9 day arc andthe asteroid's location near Mars' L5 (trailing Lagrangean) longitude led E. Boswell tospeculate that it might be in 1: 1 resonance with Mars; analogous to the Trojan asteroids ofJupiter. Subsequent observations strengthened the possibility; and later calculationsconfirmed it. Thus 1990 MB is the first known asteroid in 1: 1 resonance with a planet otherthan Jupiter. The existence of 1990 MB (a small body most likely between 2 and 4 km indiameter) provides remarkable confirmation of computer simulations. These self consistent n-body simulations demonstrated this sort of stability for Trojans of all the terrestrial planetsover at least a 2 million year time base.

A Computer Communication Control Technique for Virtualization of Netvvork Memory Resources and lts lmplementation,Goto Koichi; KosAKU INAGAKI; MASARU TsUKAMOTO; A MASATosHI YosIKAw,This paper presents the attempt we have made in linking two minicomputers; the PDP 11/40and MELCOM 70/35. The main purpose of the link is to enhance the power of the PDP 11/40as a stand-alone machine by virtue of the utilization of memory resources of the MELCOM70/35. The technique we employed was to virtualize memory resources of bothminicomputers and to reconstruct new memory hierarchy on the link of them. We consideredany kind of hardware level information transfers in a system to be “communication” anddeveloped a processor to control such communication as extensively and uniformly aspossible. This processor is called the communication control unit (CCU) in this sense. TheCCU constructs virtualized memory resources on a network of heterogeneous computers;creating a new physical view of extended memory resources.

PROCESSING INEQUALITY QUERIES,Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract Bernstein and Goodman showed that natural inequality(NI) queries can beprocessed efficiently by semi-joins; if there are no multiple inequality join edges; nor cycleswith one or zero doublet. In this paper procedures to hand1 e these cases efficiently aregiven. Multiple inequality join edges can be processed by multi-attribute inequality semi-joins. Two procedures based on generalized semi-joins for cyclic NI queries (with one orzero doublet) are developed. Semi-join is a useful operation to reduce the processing cost indistributed databases and database machines [BERNCBlOl][BERNG81111. Its processingpower; however; is limited because not all queries can be solved using semi-joins only.When queries consisting of natural joins of relations (called NJ (Natural Join) queries) areconsidered; queries in the class called tree queries can be solved using semi-joins only …,*,*,*

Although they are not domain-specific; they containlimited information and have limitations on the usage scopes and domains. For example;they do not hold the information about the domain-specific commonsense relations betweenconcepts like “horse” and “farm” or “ocean” and “atmosphere” which intuitively have closerelations on semantics in the domains of image description or earth observation datadescription. Such semantic knowledge are useful in the corresponding domains for variousapplications such as annotation; recommendation; search; suggestion and so on.

On Some Methods for Improving Feature Vectors for Web Pages and their Retrieval Accuracy,Kazunari SUGIYAMA; Kenji HATANO; Masatoshi YOSHIKAWA,Abstract In IR (information retrieval) systems based on the vector space model; the tf-idfscheme is widely used to characterize documents. However; in the case of documents withhyperlink structures such as Web pages; it is necessary to develop a technique forrepresenting the contents of Web pages more accurately by exploiting that of theirhyperlinked neighboring pages. In this paper; we first propose some methods for improvingthe tf-idf scheme for a target Web page by using the contents of its hyperlinked neighboringpages; and then compare retrieval accuracy of our proposed methods. Experimental resultsshow that more accurate feature vectors of a target Web page can be generated in the caseof utilizing the contents of its hyperlinked neighboring pages at levels up to second in thebackward direction from the target page.,*,*,*

A Cross-linguistic Study on Bilingual Terminology Acquisition from Comparable Corpora applicable to Figurative languages,Fatiha SADAT; Masatoshi YOSHIKAWA; Shunsuke UEMURA,Abstract The present paper describes an approach to bilingual lexicon extraction fromcomparable news articles and evaluations on Cross-Language Information Retrieval. Ourgoal is to learn translation lexicons using scarce resources; ie resources available on theInternet. News articles are exploited for bilingual terminology acquisition. A combinedtranslation model involving the corpora-based model; readily available bilingual dictionariesand transliteration of the special phonetic alphabet of foreign words and loanwords (hereJapanese katakana); is proposed. Evaluations using large-scale test collection on Japanese-English and SMART retrieval system revealed the proposed combination of comparablecorpora; bilingual dictionaries; and transliteration to be highly effective in Cross-LanguageInformation Retrieval.,*,*,*

Legal Document Summarization using Judicial Precedent Corpus,Shinji Banno; Shigeki Matsubara; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract Recently; a lot of judgments have been saved as electronic documents in the fieldof Law. In order to utilize them effectively; the summary of the trial needs to be given to theoriginal judgment data. However; the huge work for summarization is done with the help;and therefore the burden for making the summary is very large. This paper proposes amethod for summarizing a judgment automatically. The summary is created by applyingSVM to a judgment and extracting important sentences. Our method consists of threestages:(1) acquisition of the features from a judicial precedent corpus;(2) extraction of theimportant sentences by SVM; and (3) selection of the sentences as the summary fromextracted sentences. As features of SVM; we use both the morphological information and theinformation peculiar to a judgment. We made an experiment using a judicial precedent …,*,*,*
Integration of Knowledge on Wikipedia and Other Web Resources,Eklou Damien; Yasuhito Asano; Masatoshi Yoshikawa,Abstract: Looking for desired information on the web can be a time consuming task. In thisprocess Wikipedia constitutes a very helpful tool as it is the largest and most popular generalreference site on the internet. Most search engines actually rank Wikipedia pages amongthe top listed results. However due to the nature of Wikipedia which is manually updated byusers; it is virtually impossible to have all the valuable information related to a subjectcovered in a single article. In order to support the user search experience; we propose amethod for finding valuable information not included in Wikipedia from other web resources.,*,*,*
Exploiting Comparable Corpora for Bilingual Terminology Acquisition in Cross-Language Information Retrieval,Fatiha Sadat; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Shunsuke Uemura,Large text corpora represent a crucial resource for the acquisition of bilingual terminologythat will enrich multilingual lexicons and help cross the language barrier for informationretrieval. Moreover; in recent years non-aligned comparable corpora have been an object ofstudies and research related to natural language processing and information retrieval [1; 4;6; 8]; because of their availability and easy accessibility through the World Wide Web. In thepresent paper; we are concerned by exploiting collections of news articles for bilingualterminology acquisition in order to enhance Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR).Although evaluations were conducted on Japanese-English language pair using NTCIR testcollection on CLIR; the proposed approach is common across different languages.,*,*,*

DCBDQuery–Query Language for RDF,Xinpeng ZHANG; Masatoshi YOSHIKAWA,Abstract Along with the development of Semantic Web; available RDF data are increasing ata fast pace. How to store and query large amount of RDF data becomes an important issueof the Semantic Web. In this paper; we first discuss the usage of Concise BoundedDescription (CBD). As an improvement; we define Dynamic Concise Bounded Description(DCBD) which is a general and dynamic version of CBD. We also propose a query languagefor RDF called DCBDQuery. DCBDQuery is used for constituting DCBD and findingmeaningful reachable path or shortest path with respect to DCBD. Then we discuss analternative approach for storing RDF data into Relational Database; called Updated Schema-aware Representation. We store RDF data into database using this representation; and thencreate graph in main memory from internal link statements. The DCBDQuery query …,*,*,*
