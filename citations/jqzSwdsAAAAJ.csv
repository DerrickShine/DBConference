Undulatory swimming in sand: Subsurface locomotion of the sandfish lizard,Ryan D Maladen; Yang Ding; Chen Li; Daniel I Goldman,The desert-dwelling sandfish (Scincus scincus) moves within dry sand; a material thatdisplays solid and fluidlike behavior. High-speed x-ray imaging shows that below thesurface; the lizard no longer uses limbs for propulsion but generates thrust to overcome dragby propagating an undulatory traveling wave down the body. Although viscoushydrodynamics can predict swimming speed in fluids such as water; an equivalent theory forgranular drag is not available. To predict sandfish swimming speed; we developed anempirical model by measuring granular drag force on a small cylinder oriented at differentangles relative to the displacement direction and summing these forces over the animalmovement profile. The agreement between model and experiment implies that thenoninertial swimming occurs in a frictional fluid.,Science,2009,217
A Terradynamics of Legged Locomotion on Granular Media,Chen Li; Tingnan Zhang; Daniel I. Goldman,The theories of aero-and hydrodynamics predict animal movement and device design in airand water through the computation of lift; drag; and thrust forces. Although models ofterrestrial legged locomotion have focused on interactions with solid ground; many animalsmove on substrates that flow in response to intrusion. However; locomotor-groundinteraction models on such flowable ground are often unavailable. We developed a forcemodel for arbitrarily-shaped legs and bodies moving freely in granular media; and used this“terradynamics” to predict a small legged robot's locomotion on granular media usingvarious leg shapes and stride frequencies. Our study reveals a complex but genericdependence of stresses in granular media on intruder depth; orientation; and movementdirection and gives insight into the effects of leg morphology and kinematics on …,Science,2013,137
Sensitive dependence of the motion of a legged robot on granular media,Chen Li; Paul B Umbanhowar; Haldun Komsuoglu; Daniel E Koditschek; Daniel I Goldman,Abstract Legged locomotion on flowing ground (eg; granular media) is unlike locomotion onhard ground because feet experience both solid-and fluid-like forces during surfacepenetration. Recent bioinspired legged robots display speed relative to body size on hardground comparable with high-performing organisms like cockroaches but suffer significantperformance loss on flowing materials like sand. In laboratory experiments; we study theperformance (speed) of a small (2.3 kg) 6-legged robot; SandBot; as it runs on a bed ofgranular media (1-mm poppy seeds).

The effect of limb kinematics on the speed of a legged robot on granular media,C Li; PB Umbanhowar; H Komsuoglu; DI Goldman,Abstract Achieving effective locomotion on diverse terrestrial substrates can require subtlechanges of limb kinematics. Biologically inspired legged robots (physical models oforganisms) have shown impressive mobility on hard ground but suffer performance loss onunconsolidated granular materials like sand. Because comprehensive limb–groundinteraction models are lacking; optimal gaits on complex yielding terrain have beendetermined empirically. To develop predictive models for legged devices and to providehypotheses for biological locomotors; we systematically study the performance of SandBot; asmall legged robot; on granular media as a function of gait parameters. High performanceoccurs only in a small region of parameter space.

Terradynamically streamlined shapes in animals and robots enhance traversability through densely cluttered terrain,Chen Li; Andrew O Pullin; Duncan W Haldane; Han K Lam; Ronald S Fearing; Robert J Full,Abstract Many animals; modern aircraft; and underwater vehicles use fusiform; streamlinedbody shapes that reduce fluid dynamic drag to achieve fast and effective locomotion in airand water. Similarly; numerous small terrestrial animals move through cluttered terrainwhere three-dimensional; multi-component obstacles like grass; shrubs; vines; and leaf litteralso resist motion; but it is unknown whether their body shape plays a major role in traversal.Few ground vehicles or terrestrial robots have used body shape to more effectively traverseenvironments such as cluttered terrain. Here; we challenged forest-floor-dwelling discoidcockroaches (Blaberus discoidalis) possessing a thin; rounded body to traverse tall;narrowly spaced; vertical; grass-like compliant beams.

The SCM process was developed as a way to fabricate mechanisms formicroscale robots [4; 5]. Traditional machine elements such as bushings or bearings do notscale down well in size; and greatly increase cost with higher precision. The SCM processreplaces these components with flexural hinges that approximate revolute joints (see Fig. 2).SCM structures are produced using planar laser cutting processes. The process wasintroduced with cardboard by Hoover and Fearing [6] and composite materials in Wood etal.[7].

To revealhow the robot achieves this performance; we used high-speed imaging to capture itskinematics; and developed a numerical multi-body simulation of the robot coupled to anexperimentally validated simulation of the granular medium. Average speeds measured inexperiment and simulation agreed well; and increased nonlinearly with stride frequency;reflecting a change in propulsion mode.

These terrains can befilled with 3D; multi-component obstacles. Here; we study cockroaches (Blaberusdiscoidalis) moving through grass-like vertical compliant beams during escape. We createdan apparatus to control and vary geometric parameters and mechanical properties of modelgrass including height; width; thickness; lateral and fore-aft spacings; angle; number oflayers; stiffness; and damping. We observed a suite of novel locomotor behaviors notpreviously described on simpler 2D ground. When model grass height was> 2× body lengthand lateral spacing was< 0.5× body width; the animal primarily (probability P= 50%) rolledits body onto its side to rapidly (time t= 2.1 s) maneuver through the gaps between modelgrass.

However; we know littleabout the performance limits of large bump traversal and how body-terrain interaction affectstraversal. To address these; we challenged the discoid cockroach and an open-loop six-legged robot to dynamically run into a large bump of varying height to discover the maximaltraversal performance; and studied how locomotor modes and traversal performance areaffected by body-terrain interaction. Remarkably; during rapid running; both the animal andthe robot were capable of dynamically traversing a bump much higher than its hip height (upto 4 times the hip height for the animal and 3 times for the robot; respectively) at traversal …,Bioinspiration & Biomimetics,2018,1
Dynamic traversal of large gaps by insects and legged robots reveals a template,Sean W. Gart; Changxin Yan; Ratan Othayoth; Zhiyi Ren; Chen Li,Abstract It is well known that animals can use neural and sensory feedback via vision; tactilesensing; and echolocation to negotiate obstacles. Similarly; most robots use deliberate orreactive planning to avoid obstacles; which relies on prior knowledge or high-fidelity sensingof the environment. However; during dynamic locomotion in complex; novel; 3D terrains;such as a forest floor and building rubble; sensing and planning suffer bandwidth limitationand large noise and are sometimes even impossible. Here; we study rapid locomotion overa large gap—a simple; ubiquitous obstacle—to begin to discover the general principles ofthe dynamic traversal of large 3D obstacles.

Biological; robotic; and physics studies to discover principles of legged locomotion on granular media,Chen Li,Abstract Terrestrial animals encounter natural surfaces which comprise materials that canyield and flow such as sand; rubble; and debris; yet appear to nimbly walk; run; crawl; orclimb across them with great ease. In contrast; man-made devices on wheels and treadssuffer large performance loss on these surfaces. Legged locomotion thus provides anexcellent source of inspiration for creating devices of increased locomotor capabilities onnatural surfaces. While principles of legged locomotion on solid ground have beendiscovered; the mechanisms by which legged animals move on yielding/flowing surfacesremain poorly understood; largely due to the lack of fundamental understanding of thecomplex interactions of body/limbs with these substrates on the level of the Navier-StokesEquations for fluids.

Snake robot’s poor 3-D obstacle traversal reveals snake’s better stability mechanisms,Qiyuan Fu; Thomas Mitchel; Nansong Yi; Sean Gart; Chen Li,Snakes must often move through complex 3-D terrains like rocks and felled trees with large heightchanges and wide gaps.

Induced vibrations increase performance of a winged self-righting robot,Ratan Othayoth; Qihan Xuan; Chen Li,Abstract When upside down; cockroaches can open their wings to dynamically self-right.

We foundthat the robot was able to traverse bumps as large as 1 hip height and gaps as wide as 0.5body length. For the bump; the robot often climbed over to traverse when initial body yawwas small; but was often deflected laterally and failed to traverse when initial body yaw waslarge.

A resistive force model for complex intrusion in granular media,Tingnan Zhang; Chen Li; Daniel Goldman,Abstract Intrusion forces in granular media (GM) are best understood for simple shapes (likedisks and rods) undergoing vertical penetration and horizontal drag.

We divide anintruder of complex geometry into small segments and approximate segmental forces bymeasuring forces on small flat plates in experiments. Both lift and drag forces on the platesare proportional to penetration depth; and depend sensitively on the angle of attack and thedirection of motion. Summation of segmental forces over the intruder predicts the net forceson a c-leg; a flat leg; and a reversed c-leg rotated into GM about a fixed axle.

Impact and intrusion of the foot of a lizard running rapidly on sand,Chen Li; Tonia Hsieh; Paul Umbanhowar; Daniel Goldman,Abstract The desert-dwelling zebra-tailed lizard (Callisaurus draconoides; 10 cm; 10 g) runsrapidly (~ 10 BL/s) on granular media (GM) like sand and gravel. On loosely packed GM; itslarge hind feet penetrate into the substrate during each step. Based on above-groundobservation; a previous study (Li et al.; JEB 2012) hypothesized that the hind foot rotated inthe vertical plane subsurface to generate lift. To explain the observed center-of-massdynamics; the model assumed that ground reaction force was dominated by speed-independent frictional drag.

Lightweight robot locomotion on granular media,Tingnan Zhang; Feifei Qian; Jeffrey Shen; Chen Li; Aaron Hoover; Paul Birkmeyer; Ronald Fearing; Daniel Goldman,Abstract We present an experimental and computer simulation study of a small; light-weight;biologically inspired robot running on a model granular medium (GM); 3 mm diameter glassparticles. The six-legged RoACH robot (10 cm long; 25 grams) utilizes an alternating tripodgait to run at speeds up to 25 cm/sec. Forward speed increases with increasing limbfrequency 0< f< 12 Hz. An experimentally validated discrete element method (DEM)simulation of the device captures the observed mechanics. Observation from high speedvideo and simulation reveals that at low f; there is little slip of the limb through the GM; andforward speed is set by step length. At higher f; limbs slip continuously through the GM andfluidize the surrounding material. In this regime; speed is dominated by fluid-like thrustforces.,Bulletin of the American Physical Society 56,2011,*

Force generation during rotational intrusion into granular media,Chen Li; Yang Ding; Paul Umbanhowar; Daniel Goldman,Abstract When legged locomotors move on granular media their limbs intrude into thesubstrate along paths more complicated than simple vertical or horizontal trajectories. Toinvestigate force generation for paths more representative of typical limb-ground interaction;we rotated simple objects (plate; sphere; rod; c-shaped leg) into granular media andmeasured the resulting resistive force; F; as a function of the angle;; from maximumpenetration depth. For all objects; greatest F occurs not at maximum depth (theta= 0) asexpected from the linear dependence of force on depth for vertical penetration; butsubstantially earlier (theta-15^ o-30^ o). The location and magnitude of maximum F dependon intruder geometry. For plate and rod; F is primarily opposite displacement; while forsphere and c-shaped leg F has a substantial inward radial component and is significantly …,APS Division of Fluid Dynamics Meeting Abstracts,2010,*

Resistive force theory for sand swimming,Yang Ding; Ryan Maladen; Chen Li; Daniel Goldman,footnotetextMaladen et. al; Science; 325; 314; 2009 that predicts the ratio of forward speedto wave speed (wave efficiency; eta) of the sandfish lizard as it swims in granular media ofvarying volume fraction phi using a sinusoidal traveling wave body motion. In experiment eta0.5 independent of phi and is intermediate between eta 0.2 for low Re Newtonian fluidundulatory swimmers like nematodes and eta 0.9 for undulatory locomotion on a deformablesurface. To predict eta in granular media; we developed a resistive force model whichbalances thrust and drag force over the animal profile. We approximate the drag forces bymeasuring the force on a cylinder (a``segment''of the sandfish) oriented at different anglesrelative to the displacement direction. The model correctly predicts that eta is independent ofphi because the ratio of thrust to drag is independent of phi. The thrust component of the …,APS Division of Fluid Dynamics Meeting Abstracts,2009,*

Undulatory swimming of a sandfish lizard in granular media,Daniel Goldman; Ryan Maladen; Chen Li; Yang Ding,Abstract We study the locomotion of the desert dwelling sandfish lizard (Scincus scincus) asit dives into and swims beneath the surface of sand (300 mum glass beads). Above thesurface; the animal uses a diagonal gait to move rapidly across the sand. High speed x-rayimaging reveals that once subsurface the animal no longer uses limbs for propulsion butinstead folds the limbs against the body and generates thrust using a large amplitudeundulatory motion consisting of a traveling wave with frequency f that propagates down thebody with one wave period. The forward swimming speed v (maximum 10 cm/sec) increaseswith increasing f. We measure v versus f as a function of packing fraction of the material phi.To predict v as a function of f and phi; we model the animal as a series of elements; eachwhich produces thrust and experiences drag along its surface. We measure thrust and …,APS March Meeting Abstracts,2009,*
