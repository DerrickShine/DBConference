Visualizing the signatures of social roles in online discussion groups,Howard T Welser; Eric Gleave; Danyel Fisher; Marc Smith,Abstract: Social roles in online discussion forums can be described by patternedcharacteristics of communication between network members which we conceive of as'structural signatures.'This paper uses visualization methods to reveal these structuralsignatures and regression analysis to confirm the relationship between these signatures andtheir associated roles in Usenet newsgroups. Our analysis focuses on distinguishing thesignatures of one role from others; the role of “answer people." Answer people areindividuals whose dominant behavior is to respond to questions posed by other users. Wefound that answer people predominantly contribute one or a few messages to discussionsinitiated by others; are disproportionately tied to relative isolates; have few intense ties andhave few triangles in their local networks. OLS regression shows that these signatures …,Journal of social structure,2007,418
Animated exploration of dynamic graphs with radial layout,Ka-Ping Yee; Danyel Fisher; Rachna Dhamija; Marti Hearst,Abstract We describe a new animation technique for supporting interactive exploration of agraph. We use the wellknown radial tree layout method; in which the view is determined bythe selection of a focus node. Our main contribution is a method for animating the transitionto a new layout when a new focus node is selected. In order to keep the transition easy tofollow; the animation linearly interpolates the polar coordinates of the nodes; while enforcingordering and orientation constraints. We apply this technique to visualizations of socialnetworks and of the Gnutella file-sharing network; and discuss the results from our informalusability tests.,Information Visualization; 2001.

Analysis and visualization of network data using JUNG,Joshua O’Madadhain; Danyel Fisher; Padhraic Smyth; Scott White; Yan-Biao Boey,Abstract The JUNG (Java Universal Network/Graph) Framework is a free; open-sourcesoftware library that provides a common and extendible language for the manipulation;analysis; and visualization of data that can be represented as a graph or network. It is writtenin the Java programming language; allowing JUNG-based applications to make use of theextensive built-in capabilities of the Java Application Programming Interface (API); as well asthose of other existing third-party Java libraries. We describe the design; and some details ofthe implementation; of the JUNG architecture; and provide illustrative examples of its use.,Journal of Statistical Software,2005,327
Effectiveness of animation in trend visualization,George Robertson; Roland Fernandez; Danyel Fisher; Bongshin Lee; John Stasko,Animation has been used to show trends in multi-dimensional data. This technique hasrecently gained new prominence for presentations; most notably with GapminderTrendalyzer. In Trendalyzer; animation together with interesting data and an engagingpresenter helps the audience understand the results of an analysis of the data. It is less clearwhether trend animation is effective for analysis. This paper proposes two alternative trendvisualizations that use static depictions of trends: one which shows traces of all trendsoverlaid simultaneously in one display and a second that uses a small multiples display toshow the trend traces side-by-side. The paper evaluates the three visualizations for bothanalysis and presentation. Results indicate that trend animation can be challenging to useeven for presentations; while it is the fastest technique for presentation and participants …,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,2008,284
You are who you talk to: Detecting roles in usenet newsgroups,Danyel Fisher; Marc Smith; Howard T Welser,Understanding the social roles of the members a group can help to understand the socialcontext of the group. We present a method of applying social network analysis to support thetask of characterizing authors in Usenet newsgroups. We compute and visualize networkscreated by patterns of replies for each author in selected newsgroups and find that second-degree ego-centric networks give us clear distinctions between different types of authorsand newsgroups. Results show that newsgroups vary in terms of the populations ofparticipants and the roles that they play. Newsgroups can be characterized by populationsthat include question and answer newsgroups; conversational newsgroups; social supportnewsgroups; and flame newsgroups. This approach has applications for both researchersseeking to characterize different types of social cyberspaces as well as participants …,System Sciences; 2006. HICSS'06.

Picturing Usenet: Mapping computer-mediated collective action,Tammara Combs Turner; Marc A Smith; Danyel Fisher; Howard T Welser,Abstract Usenet is a complex socio-technical phenomenon; containing vast quantities ofinformation. The sheer scope and complexity make it a challenge to understand the manydimensions across which people and communication are interlinked. In this work; wepresent visualizations of several aspects and scales of Usenet that combine to highlight therange of variation found in newsgroups. We examine variations within hierarchies;newsgroups; authors; and social networks. We find a remarkable diversity; with clearvariations that mark starting points for mapping the broad sweep of behavior found in thisand other social cyberspaces. Our findings provide the basis for initial recommendations forthose cultivating; managing; contributing; or consuming collectively constructedconversational content.,Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication,2005,213
Interactions with big data analytics,Danyel Fisher; Rob DeLine; Mary Czerwinski; Steven Drucker,CoVer STorY experiments on the Web [1].

Revisiting Whittaker & Sidner's email overload ten years later,Danyel Fisher; AJ Brush; Eric Gleave; Marc A Smith,Abstract Ten years ago; Whittaker and Sidner [8] published research on email overload;coining a term that would drive a research area that continues today. We examine a sampleof 600 mailboxes collected at a high-tech company to compare how users organize theiremail now to 1996. While inboxes are roughly the same size as in 1996; our population'semail archives have grown tenfold. We see little evidence of distinct strategies for handlingemail; most of our users fall into a middle ground. There remains a need for futureinnovations to help people manage growing archives of email and large inboxes.,Proceedings of the 2006 20th anniversary conference on Computer supported cooperative work,2006,157
Hotmap: Looking at geographic attention,Danyel Fisher,Understanding how people use online maps allows data acquisition teams to concentratetheir efforts on the portions of the map that are most seen by users. Online maps representvast databases; and so it is insufficient to simply look at a list of the most-accessed URLs.Hotmap takes advantage of the design of a mapping system's imagery pyramid to superposea heatmap of the log files over the original maps. Users' behavior within the system can beobserved and interpreted. This paper discusses the imagery acquisition task that motivatedHotmap; and presents several examples of information that Hotmap makes visible. Wediscuss the design choices behind Hotmap; including logarithmic color schemes; low-saturation background images; and tuning images to explore both infrequently-viewed andfrequently-viewed spaces.,Visualization and Computer Graphics; IEEE Transactions on,2007,142
Visual snippets: summarizing web pages for search and revisitation,Jaime Teevan; Edward Cutrell; Danyel Fisher; Steven M Drucker; Gonzalo Ramos; Paul André; Chang Hu,Abstract People regularly interact with different representations of Web pages. A personlooking for new information may initially find a Web page represented as a short snippetrendered by a search engine. When he wants to return to the same page the next day; thepage may instead be represented by a link in his browser history. Previous research hasexplored how to best represent Web pages in support of specific task types; but; as we findin this paper; consistency in representation across tasks is also important. We explore howdifferent representations are used in a variety of contexts and present a compactrepresentation that supports both the identification of new; relevant Web pages and the re-finding of previously viewed pages.,Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2009,133

Specifically; we track thousands of blogs and the news articles they cite;collapsing news articles that have highly overlapping content. We then tag each article withthe number of blogs citing it; the political orientation of those blogs; and the level ofemotional charge expressed in the blog posts that link to the news article. We summarizeand present the results to the user via a novel visualization which displays this contextual …,ICWSM,2008,122
Trust me; I'm partially right: incremental visualization lets analysts explore large datasets faster,Danyel Fisher; Igor Popov; Steven Drucker; m. c. Schraefel,Abstract Queries over large scale (petabyte) data bases often mean waiting overnight for aresult to come back. Scale costs time. Such time also means that potential avenues ofexploration are ignored because the costs are perceived to be too high to run or evenpropose them. With sampleAction we have explored whether interaction techniques topresent query results running over only incremental samples can be presented assufficiently trustworthy for analysts both to make closer to real time decisions about theirqueries and to be more exploratory in their questions of the data. Our work with three teamsof analysts suggests that we can indeed accelerate and open up the query process withsuch incremental visualizations.,Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2012,119
Collaborative Brushing and Linking for Co‐located Visual Analytics of Document Collections,Petra Isenberg; Danyel Fisher,Abstract Many real-world analysis tasks can benefit from the combined efforts of a group ofpeople. Past research has shown that to design visualizations for collaborative visualanalytics tasks; we need to support both individual as well as joint analysis activities. Wepresent Cambiera; a tabletop visual analytics tool that supports individual and collaborativeinformation foraging activities in large text document collections. We define collaborativebrushing and linking as an awareness mechanism that enables analysts to follow their ownhypotheses during collaborative sessions while still remaining aware of the group'sactivities. With Cambiera; users are able to collaboratively search through documents;maintaining awareness of each others' work and building on each others' findings.,Computer Graphics Forum,2009,118
Understanding multi-touch manipulation for surface computing,Chris North; Tim Dwyer; Bongshin Lee; Danyel Fisher; Petra Isenberg; George Robertson; Kori Inkpen,Abstract Two-handed; multi-touch surface computing provides a scope for interactions thatare closer analogues to physical interactions than classical windowed interfaces. Thedesign of natural and intuitive gestures is a difficult problem as we do not know how userswill approach a new multi-touch interface and which gestures they will attempt to use. In thispaper we study whether familiarity with other environments influences how users approachinteraction with a multi-touch surface computer as well as how efficiently those userscomplete a simple task. Inspired by the need for object manipulation in informationvisualization applications; we asked users to carry out an object sorting task on a physicaltable; on a tabletop display; and on a desktop computer with a mouse. To compare users'gestures we produced a vocabulary of manipulation techniques that users apply in the …,IFIP Conference on Human-Computer Interaction,2009,106
Using egocentric networks to understand communication,Danyel Fisher,Social-network analysis generally helps researchers understand how groups of peopleinteract. In this article the author uses small-scale egocentric social networks; based onvolitional; explicit connections; to understand how people manage their personal and groupcommunications. Two research projects using this approach show that such networks cangive researchers important insight into the people who communicate online. Soylent; aproject based on email; shows several common patterns in social interaction. The Rolesproject; based on Usenet newsgroups; suggests that various online social spaces canbehave very differently from each other.,IEEE Internet Computing,2005,99
Ordering personal information using social metadata,*,A unique system; method; and user interface that facilitate ordering personal items based onpast personal interaction between a user and the user's correspondents are provided. Inparticular; the system provides alternative views of information; such as messages; that isorganized around people using an ordering based on the history of communication betweenthe recipient and sender. Social metrics can be calculated based on social metadataassociated with the messages; for example. Metrics can be used to configure how or whichmessages are viewed and their order in one or more pane views. Each pane view canpresent different orderings of messages—which are displayed by the recipient or sender ofthe message. So for instance; instead of viewing messages in chronological receipt date;they can be viewed by the message's sender and ordered by the number of messages …,*,2010,98

Or do “audiences” for online discussion tend to fragment into ideological echochambers? In the wilds of threaded discussion on the internet (as opposed to deliberativepolls; moderated discussions; and other designed venues of deliberation); networks ofpolitical discourse emerge from billions of individual choices by millions of individual citizensabout what to discuss online; where to discuss it; and with whom.

Friends; foes; and fringe: norms and structure in political discussion networks,John W Kelly; Danyel Fisher; Marc Smith,Abstract Online discussion groups have a network structure that emerges from theinteractions of thousands of participants; writing in thousands of topical threads. Thisstructure varies greatly according to the type of discussion group; such as technical; fan orsupport. Political groups have their own distinctive structure; organized around ideologicallypolarized clusters of participants. Whereas in some other groups; individuals whovehemently disagree with the mainstream might be ignored or ostracized; in political groupsmost participants preferentially interact with" opponents" and ignore" friends." And yet; thereis a type of opponent whose ideas are so far from the field of debate as to be ignored bymost or nearly all other participants. This difference is starkly apparent in network diagramsof discussion groups.

TouchViz: a case study comparing two interfaces for data analytics on tablets,Steven M Drucker; Danyel Fisher; Ramik Sadana; Jessica Herron,Abstract As more applications move from the desktop to touch devices like tablets; designersmust wrestle with the costs of porting a design with as little revision of the UI as possible fromone device to the other; or of optimizing the interaction per device. We consider the tradeoffsbetween two versions of a UI for working with data on a touch tablet. One interface is basedon using the conventional desktop metaphor (WIMP) with a control panel; push buttons; andcheckboxes--where the mouse click is effectively replaced by a finger tap. The otherinterface (which we call FLUID) eliminates the control panel and focuses touch actions onthe data visualization itself. We describe our design process and evaluation of eachinterface.

Structured labeling for facilitating concept evolution in machine learning,Todd Kulesza; Saleema Amershi; Rich Caruana; Danyel Fisher; Denis Charles,Abstract Labeling data is a seemingly simple task required for training many machinelearning systems; but is actually fraught with problems. This paper introduces the notion ofconcept evolution; the changing nature of a person's underlying concept (the abstract notionof the target class a person is labeling for; eg; spam email; travel related web pages) whichcan result in inconsistent labels and thus be detrimental to machine learning. We introducetwo structured labeling solutions; a novel technique we propose for helping people defineand refine their concept in a consistent manner as they label. Through a series of fiveexperiments; including a controlled lab study; we illustrate the impact and dynamics ofconcept evolution in practice and show that structured labeling helps people label moreconsistently in the presence of concept evolution than traditional labeling.,Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2014,40

Many visualizers are beginning to think abouthow to make their visualizations more compelling with animation. There are many goodguides on how to make static visualizations more effective; and many applications supportinteractivity well. But animated visualization is still a new area; there is little consensus onwhat makes for a good animation. The intuition behind animation seems clear enough: if atwo-dimensional image is good; then a moving image should be better. Movement isfamiliar: we are accustomed to both moving through the real world and seeing things in itmove smoothly.

The recommendations arebased on a learning model that adapts over time–as the user adds more items to a cluster;the system's model improves and the recommendations become more relevant. Thirty-twosubjects used iCluster to sort hundreds of data items both with and withoutrecommendations; we found that recommendations allow users to sort items more rapidly. Apool of 161 raters then assessed the quality of the resulting clusters; finding that clusters …,IFIP Conference on Human-Computer Interaction,2011,34
Visual summarization of web pages,*,A visual summarization of a web page is generated. This generally involves identifying atleast one of; an image that is exemplary of the page content; text that is exemplary of thepage content; and a logo associated with the web page. The exemplary image and logo; ifidentified; are scaled to prescribed sizes. The exemplary image can act as a backgroundimage for the summarization; or a scaled version of the at least a portion of the web pagecan act as the background image. In the latter; if an exemplary image was identified; it isoverlaid onto the background image at a prescribed location. In either case; if a logo wasidentified; it is also overlaid onto the background image at a prescribed location. Ifexemplary text was identified; a text area in the background image is identified and at leastsome of the exemplary text is inserted.,*,2010,32
Stat!: An interactive analytics environment for big data,Mike Barnett; Badrish Chandramouli; Robert DeLine; Steven Drucker; Danyel Fisher; Jonathan Goldstein; Patrick Morrison; John Platt,Abstract Exploratory analysis on big data requires us to rethink data management across theentire stack--from the underlying data processing techniques to the user experience. Wedemonstrate Stat!--a visualization and analytics environment that allows users to rapidlyexperiment with exploratory queries over big data. Data scientists can use Stat! to quicklyrefine to the correct query; while getting immediate feedback after processing a fraction ofthe data. Stat! can work with multiple processing engines in the backend; in this demo; weuse Stat! with the Microsoft StreamInsight streaming engine. StreamInsight is used togenerate incremental early results to queries and refine these results as more data isprocessed. Stat! allows data scientists to explore data; dynamically compose multiplequeries to generate streams of partial results; and display partial results in both textual …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,30
Bifocal view: a novel calendar user interface,*,The claimed subject matter provides a system and/or a method that facilitates creating acalendar that enables optimized awareness of at least one event. An interface componentcan receive data related to an event. An enhanced scheduler component can create acalendar that enables a bifocal calendar view to display an event correlated to a first datewith a first time-scale and an event correlated to a second date with a second time-scale.,*,2011,30
POPULARITY BASED GEOGRAPHICAL NAVIGATION,*,Typically; users click or otherwise show interest in a particular geographic region on a mapto indicate their desire to center and/or zoom in on that location. However; it is more likelythat a user has a higher interest in popular points of interest in a region than with a point ofselection on a map. By employing popularity map data; the map navigation can be biasedtowards popular points of interest relative to a user's selection. This allows users to moreeffectively navigate through maps; rather than through trial and error selections based solelyon geography. Some instances utilize weighting of popularity points to determine an offsetdistance from a user's selection. Other instances can employ a most popular point nearest auser's selection as a bias point. Included popularity points for biasing can be determinedbased on a percentage of a visualized map image presented to a user.,*,2006,30
Flexible visualization for services,*,Techniques are described for generating a user interface for visualizing a cloud servicebased on status and performance data of the cloud service obtained from data stores. Aconfiguration file including declarative code may declare particular queries tostatus/performance data sources. The configuration file may also declare particular queriesto topology data sources to obtain topology information. In accordance with the obtainedinformation; objects representing the cloud service may be displayed. The objectscorrespond to particular hardware and software components; or logical grouping thereof;that are identified by the topology information.,*,2012,28
Method; system and program product for representing a perceptual organization of an image,*,Under the present invention; an image is progressively blurred to yield a set of (progressive)scaling levels. Once blurred; the edges of the image are detected so that each imagesegment can be identified on each scaling level. Once the segments are identified; likesegments (ie; segments having a like edge/Gaussian operator) on successive scaling levelsare linked to yield a lattice structure that represents the perceptual organization of the image.,*,2009,28

Leveraging the crowd: how 48;000 users helped improve Lync performance,Robert Musson; Jacqueline Richards; Danyel Fisher; Christian Bird; Brian Bussone; Sandipan Ganguly,Performance is a critical component of customer satisfaction with network-basedapplications. Unfortunately; accurately evaluating the performance of collaborative softwarethat operates in extremely heterogeneous environments is difficult with traditionaltechniques such as modeling workloads or testing in controlled environments. To evaluateperformance of an application in the wild during development; the authors deployed earlyversions of the software; collecting performance data from application users for key usagescenarios. The analysis package they used produces visualizations to help developmentteams identify and prioritize performance issues by focusing on performance early in thedevelopment cycle; evaluating progress; identifying defects; and estimating timelines.,IEEE software,2013,27
Incremental; approximate database queries and uncertainty for exploratory visualization,Danyel Fisher,Exploratory data visualization calls for iterative analyses; but very large databases are oftenfar too slow to allow interactive exploration. Incremental; approximate database queriesexchange precision for speed: by sampling from the full database; the system can resolvequeries rapidly. As the sample gets broader; the precision increases at the cost of time. Asthe precision of the sample value can be estimated; we can represent the range of possiblevalues. This range may be visually represented using uncertainty visualization techniques.This paper outlines the current literature in both incremental approximate queries and inuncertainty visualization. The two fields mesh well: incremental techniques can collect datain interactive time; and uncertainty techniques can show bounded error.,Large Data Analysis and Visualization (LDAV); 2011 IEEE Symposium on,2011,27
Reflections on how designers design with data,Alex Bigelow; Steven Drucker; Danyel Fisher; Miriah Meyer,Abstract In recent years many popular data visualizations have emerged that are createdlargely by designers whose main area of expertise is not computer science. Designersgenerate these visualizations using a handful of design tools and environments. To betterinform the development of tools intended for designers working with data; we set out tounderstand designers' challenges and perspectives. We interviewed professional designers;conducted observations of designers working with data in the lab; and observed designersworking with data in team settings in the wild. A set of patterns emerged from theseobservations from which we extract a number of themes that provide a new perspective ondesign considerations for visualization tool creators; as well as on known engineeringproblems.,Proceedings of the 2014 International Working Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces,2014,26
Computer Mediated Communication Among Teams: What are “Teams” and How are They “Virtual”?,Erin Bradner,Abstract This chapter is concerned with computer-mediated communication among virtualteams. A focus on social factors in small-group interaction is required to adequately answerthe question: what is a “virtual team” and how can it be said to be “virtual?” Understandingthe role of social factors in small-group interaction is important since governments andcorporations around the world are increasing their reliance on information technology as asurrogate for face-to-face interaction among distributed teams. Work in this area isparticularly timely since; as “virtual teaming” has been on the rise; research in small groupshas declined (Gladstein; 1984; Ilgen; 1999). A survey of social science research on smallgroups will conceivably help software designers design “group friendly” electronicenvironments for virtual teams. It is the first step towards knowing; for example; when a 3D …,*,2003,26

A model of multi-scale perceptual organization in information graphics,Martin Wattenberg; Danyel Fisher,We propose a new method for assessing the perceptual organization of informationgraphics; based on the premise that the visual structure of an image should match thestructure of the data it is intended to convey. The core of our method is a new formal modelof one type of perceptual structure; based on classical machine vision techniques foranalyzing an image at multiple resolutions. The model takes as input an arbitrary grayscaleimage and returns a lattice structure describing the visual organization of the image.

Providing context for web articles,*,An overwhelming number of articles are available everyday via the internet. Unfortunately; itis impossible to peruse more than a handful; and it is difficult to ascertain an article's socialcontext. The techniques disclosed herein address this problem by harnessing implicit andexplicit contextual information from social media. By extracting text surrounding a hyperlinkto an article in a post and assessing the article as a function of content surrounding thehyperlink; an article's social context is determined and presented. Additionally; articles thatare sufficiently similar in content may be grouped to establish a many-to-one relationshipbetween posts and an article; creating a more accurate assessment.,*,2014,24

Selected human factors issues in information visualization,George Robertson; Mary Czerwinski; Danyel Fisher; Bongshin Lee,Information visualization is the art and science of representing abstract information in avisual form that enables human users to gain insight through their perceptual and cognitivecapabilities. In this chapter; we examine some key human factors aspects of informationvisualizations. We begin with an overview of major information visualization principles andtechniques; with background on human factors issues that drove the development of thoseprinciples and techniques. Next; we look at how human capabilities are best used byvisualization; focusing on the use of animation in visualizations. Then we look at theemerging area of large display visualization; examining how visualization changes when auser cannot easily see the entire visualization in detail. We then discuss evaluation ofinformation visualizations; discussing aspects of utility and usability. We conclude by …,Reviews of human factors and ergonomics,2009,22
Visualization tool for system tracing infrastructure events,*,A system and method for identifying a root cause of a wait in a computer system areprovided. Given the identity of a thread of interest and time window; a longest wait period forthe thread of interest within the time window is identified. The longest wait period is used asa starting node to generate a ready tree by walking backwards through the data in a systemtrace to construct a tree of readying events that ready threads for running on a processor. Apotentially anomalous chain of events is automatically identified and highlighted in the readytree. A visualization of the ready tree is presented to a user so that the user can explore theevents in the tree and annotate the automatically generated tree to aid in problem diagnosis.,*,2013,21

Tiled packaging of vector image data,*,Architecture for encoding (or packaging) vector-object data using fixed boundary tiles. Tilinga large vector database provides the same advantages that tiling provides for a large rasterimage. Tiling the dataset means that the set of all possible browser requests is finite andpredetermined. The tiles can be rasterized on a client once the tiles have been receivedfrom a server. Alternatively; the server can do the tiling and rasterizing; and then send theraster data to the client for presentation and user interaction. Tiles can be precomputed onthe server; with selected tiles then transmitted to the client for rasterization. Moreover; tilescan be cached for improved performance; and prefetched based on user interactivity on theclient. Summarization of the vector-object data can be accomplished at the server using aconfigurable plug-in interface.,*,2011,20

Assisting Users with Clustering Tasks by Combining Metric Learning and Classification.,Sumit Basu; Danyel Fisher; Steven M Drucker; Hao Lu,Abstract Interactive clustering refers to situations in which a human labeler is willing to assista learning algorithm in automatically clustering items. We present a related but somewhatdifferent task; assisted clustering; in which a user creates explicit groups of items from alarge set and wants suggestions on what items to add to each group. While the traditionalapproach to interactive clustering has been to use metric learning to induce a distancemetric; our situation seems equally amenable to classification. Using clusterings ofdocuments from human subjects; we found that one or the other method proved to besuperior for a given cluster; but not uniformly so. We thus developed a hybrid mechanism forcombining the metric learner and the classifier. We present results from a large number oftrials based on human clusterings; in which we show that our combination scheme …,AAAI,2010,19

Using social sorting to enhance email management,Danyel Fisher; Bernie Hogan; AJ Brush; Marc Smith; Andy Jacobs,ABSTRACT We evaluate the use and potential benefits of social sorting as a technique formanaging email. We present SNARF; the Social Network and Relationship Finder; a toolwhich filters and sorts email based on the type of message and the user's past history withan email correspondent; a process we refer to as social sorting. This tool also combinesseveral contemporary techniques for email selection and review; including threadmanagement and multiple simultaneous views. We report on the results of a 4 week fieldstudy (N= 574); and describe the user behavior that emerged around the tool. Additionally;we present a scale of email overflow to assess users' experience with email generally. Whileour application did not significantly reduce experience of email overflow; we concludeleveraging past email behavior can be of value to email users for both time-critical triage …,Human-Computer Interaction Consortium,2006,18
Sample-oriented task-driven visualizations: allowing users to make better; more confident decisions,Nivan Ferreira; Danyel Fisher; Arnd Christian Konig,Abstract We often use datasets that reflect samples; but many visualization tools treat dataas full populations. Uncertain visualizations are good at representing data distributionsemerging from samples; but are more limited in allowing users to carry out decision tasks.This is because tasks that are simple on a traditional chart (eg" compare two bars") becomea complex probabilistic task on a chart with uncertainty. We present guidelines for creatingvisual annotations for solving tasks with uncertainty; and an implementation that addressesfive core tasks on a bar chart. A preliminary user study shows promising results: that usershave a justified confidence in their answers with our system.,Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2014,17
Visualizations everywhere: A multiplatform infrastructure for linked visualizations,Danyel Fisher; Steven Drucker; Roland Fernandez; Scott Ruble,In order to use new visualizations; most toolkits require application developers to rebuildtheir applications and distribute new versions to users.

TimeSlice: Interactive faceted browsing of timeline data,Jian Zhao; Steven M Drucker; Danyel Fisher; Donald Brinkman,Abstract Temporal events with multiple sets of metadata attributes; ie; facets; are ubiquitousacross different domains. The capabilities of efficiently viewing and comparing events datafrom various perspectives are critical for revealing relationships; making hypotheses; anddiscovering patterns. In this paper; we present TimeSlice; an interactive faceted visualizationof temporal events; which allows users to easily compare and explore timelines with differentattributes on a set of facets. By directly manipulating the filtering tree; a dynamic visualrepresentation of queries and filters in the facet space; users can simultaneously browse thefocused timelines and their contexts at different levels of detail; which supports efficientnavigation of multi-dimensional events data.

Canvas approach for analytics,*,The claimed subject matter relates to an architecture that can construct a map forsummarizing analyses with respect to data included in a database. In addition; thearchitecture can display the map in a special canvas area. Generally; the map is a hub-and-spoke-style map in which a hub is associated with an entity (eg; a related set of records)included in a database. Likewise; the spokes are typically representative of operations (eg;filter; join; transform) that act upon the hub/entity from which it extends. The map can aid withopen-ended analysis on complex databases by recording and ordering competinghypotheses and can also further collaborative efforts with respect to analysis.,*,2012,13

Social networks for end users,Danyel Fisher,Social network analysis is a tool for understanding the shapes and contexts of groupinteractions. By mapping the relationships between groups of people—a map in whichnodes are individuals and ties are the collected or measured relationships between them—analysts can develop both qualitative and quantitative descriptions of the group'srelationships (Wasserman and Faust 1994; Grannovetter 1973). Network analysis has beenapplied to a wide variety of organizations; as well as to other forms of social relations; andhas found use in sociology; organizational behavior (as in Ahuja and Carley; 1998); andepidemiology (as in Morris and Kretzschmar; 1997); to name only a few.

Iterating between tools to create and edit visualizations,Alex Bigelow; Steven Drucker; Danyel Fisher; Miriah Meyer,A common workflow for visualization designers begins with a generative tool; like D3 orProcessing; to create the initial visualization; and proceeds to a drawing tool; like AdobeIllustrator or Inkscape; for editing and cleaning. Unfortunately; this is typically a one-wayprocess: once a visualization is exported from the generative tool into a drawing tool; it isdifficult to make further; data-driven changes. In this paper; we propose a bridge model toallow designers to bring their work back from the drawing tool to re-edit in the generativetool. Our key insight is to recast this iteration challenge as a merge problem-similar to whentwo people are editing a document and changes between them need to reconciled. We alsopresent a specific instantiation of this model; a tool called Hanpuku; which bridges betweenD3 scripts and Illustrator. We show several examples of visualizations that are iteratively …,IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,2017,8

Big data exploration requires collaboration between visualization and data infrastructures,Danyel Fisher,Abstract As datasets grow to tera-and petabyte sizes; exploratory data visualizationbecomes very difficult: a screen is limited to a few million pixels; and main memory to a fewtens of millions of data points. Yet these very large scale analyses are of tremendous interestto industry and academia. This paper discusses some of the major challenges involved indata analytics at scale; including issues of computation; communication; and rendering. Itidentifies techniques for handling large scale data; grouped into" look at less of it;" and" lookat it faster." Using these techniques involves a number of difficult design tradeoffs for boththe ways that data can be represented; and the ways that users can interact with thevisualizations.,Proceedings of the Workshop on Human-In-the-Loop Data Analytics,2016,7

Trust; but verify: Optimistic visualizations of approximate queries for exploring big data,Dominik Moritz; Danyel Fisher; Bolin Ding; Chi Wang,Abstract Analysts need interactive speed for exploratory analysis; but big data systems areoften slow. With sampling; data systems can produce approximate answers fast enough forexploratory visualization; at the cost of accuracy and trust. We propose optimisticvisualization; which approaches these issues from a user experience perspective. Thismethod lets analysts explore approximate results interactively; and provides a way to detectand recover from errors later. Pangloss implements these ideas. We discuss design issuesraised by optimistic visualization systems. We test this concept with five expert visualizers ina laboratory study and three case studies at Microsoft. Analysts reported that they felt moreconfident in their results; and used optimistic visualization to check that their preliminaryresults were correct.,Proceedings of the 2017 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2017,6

Remote communication and technology diffusion,Gloria Mark; Steven Poltrock; Danyel Fisher,The rise of virtual collocation in distributed organizations may lead to new patterns oftechnology adoption. Whereas previous studies of technology diffusion (eg Rogers; 1995)point to the role of mass media and interpersonal communication in adoption; we find thatcollaborating partners who rarely see one another are important contributors to the diffusionof virtual collocation technologies. We studied a large distributed organization to discoverhow and why a data conferencing technology was disseminated rapidly in a relatively shorttime. We interpret our results to show that the technology has spread on an on-demandbasis rather than through formal channels that the company had established. We connectthis growth in usage with Rogers' theories about the diffusion of innovations and the socialnetworks in place at this organization.,Professional Communication Conference; 2001. IPCC 2001.

Microsoft Research1 Redmond; WA; United States [sdrucker; danyelf; rob. deline]@ microsoft. com,Emanuel Zgraggen; Steven M Drucker; Danyel Fisher,Abstract Many different domains collect event sequence data and rely on finding andanalyzing patterns within it to gain meaningful insights. Current systems that support suchqueries either provide limited expressiveness; hinder exploratory workflows or presentinteraction and visualization models which do not scale well to large and multi-faceted datasets. In this paper we present (s| qu) eries (pronounced" Squeries"); a visual query interfacefor creating queries on sequences (series) of data; based on regular expressions.(s| qu)eries is a touch-based system that exposes the full expressive power of regular expressionsin an approachable way and interleaves query specification with result visualizations. Beingable to visually investigate the results of different query-parts supports debugging andencourages iterative query-building as well as exploratory work-flows. We validate our …,*,*,*
Making Sense of Temporal Queries with Fine-Grained Provenance,Leilani Battle; Danyel Fisher; Mike Barnett; Badrish Chandramouli; Rob DeLine; Jonathan Goldstein,ABSTRACT As real-time monitoring and analysis becomes increasingly popular; moreresearchers and developers are turning to data stream management systems (DSMS's) forfast; efficient ways to pose temporal questions over their datasets. However; these systemsare inherently complex; and even individuals with database expertise find it difficult tounderstand the behavior of DSMS queries. To help analysts better understand their temporalDSMS queries; we developed a visualization tool that illustrates how a temporal querymanipulates a given dataset; step-by-step. StreamTrace produces an interactivevisualization that allows the user to audit their queries. We incorporated feedback from threeexpert DSMS users throughout our design process.,*,*,*

Populating the Social Workscape: Using Networks and Rhythms to Enrich the User Experience,Danyel Fisher; Paul Dourish,ABSTRACT Most work carried out online is collaborative to some degree; involving activitiesthat must be coordinated with other people. However; most user interfaces are resolutelysingle-user. We are exploring designs in which the singleuser experience is extended toincorporate the wider social frame within which work takes place. Based on the concepts ofsocial networks and temporal rhythms; we present an infrastructure and tools for exploringthe social workscape within which a user is embedded. This approach allows us to identifysome key properties of social groups which can be incorporated into traditional interactivetools.,*,*,*

Detecting and Understanding Temporal Patterns for Everyday Collaboration,Danyel Fisher,My research group has been involved in attempting to visualize and construct tools tosupport what we refer to as the “social workscape”—the space of documents; people; andtasks within which each individual is engaged as part of their work. I read these tasksbroadly as being intrinsically shared: a document written alone is intended for an audience;and is likely to be presented before others. The day-to-day work that individuals accomplish;both separately and collectively; can be spoken of as parts of “everyday collaboration.” Theword “everyday” emphasizes that the collaboration is not the domain of particularcollaborative tools; but rather merely the collection of actions around common tasks. In orderto analyze this “workscape”; I exploit recurrent structures that relate the details of specificactivity to broader patterns. With others; I have been investigating two sorts of structures …,*,*,*
