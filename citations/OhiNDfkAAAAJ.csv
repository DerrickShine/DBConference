Making database systems usable,HV Jagadish; Adriane Chapman; Aaron Elkiss; Magesh Jayapandian; Yunyao Li; Arnab Nandi; Cong Yu,Abstract Database researchers have striven to improve the capability of a database in termsof both performance and functionality. We assert that the usability of a database is asimportant as its capability. In this paper; we study why database systems today are sodifficult to use. We identify a set of five pain points and propose a research agenda toaddress these. In particular; we introduce a presentation data model and recommend directdata manipulation with a schema later approach. We also stress the importance ofprovenance and of consistency across presentation models.,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,225
Michigan Molecular Interactions (MiMI): putting the jigsaw puzzle together,Magesh Jayapandian; Adriane Chapman; V Glenn Tarcea; Cong Yu; Aaron Elkiss; Angela Ianni; Bin Liu; Arnab Nandi; Carlos Santos; Philip Andrews; Brian Athey; HV Jagadish,Abstract Protein interaction data exists in a number of repositories. Each repository has itsown data format; molecule identifier and supplementary information. Michigan MolecularInteractions (MiMI) assists scientists searching through this overwhelming amount of proteininteraction data. MiMI gathers data from well-known protein interaction databases and deep-merges the information. Utilizing an identity function; molecules that may have differentidentifiers but represent the same real-world object are merged. Thus; MiMI allows the usersto retrieve information from many different databases at once; highlighting complementaryand contradictory information. To help scientists judge the usefulness of a piece of data;MiMI tracks the provenance of all data. Finally; a simple yet powerful user interface aidsusers in their queries; and frees them from the onerous task of knowing the data format or …,Nucleic acids research,2007,130
Assisted querying using instant-response interfaces,Arnab Nandi; HV Jagadish,Abstract We demonstrate a novel query interface that enables users to construct a richsearch query without any prior knowledge of the underlying schema or data. The interface;which is in the form of a single text input box; interacts in real-time with the users as theytype; guiding them through the query construction. We discuss the issues of schema anddata complexity; result size estimation; and query validity; and provide novel approaches tosolving these problems. We demonstrate our query interface on two popular applications; anenterprise-wide personnel search; and a biological information database.,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,110
Data cube materialization and mining over mapreduce,Arnab Nandi; Cong Yu; Philip Bohannon; Raghu Ramakrishnan,Computing interesting measures for data cubes and subsequent mining of interesting cubegroups over massive data sets are critical for many important analyses done in the realworld. Previous studies have focused on algebraic measures such as SUM that areamenable to parallel computation and can easily benefit from the recent advancement ofparallel computing infrastructure such as MapReduce. Dealing with holistic measures suchas TOP-K; however; is nontrivial. In this paper; we detail real-world challenges in cubematerialization and mining tasks on web-scale data sets. Specifically; we identify animportant subset of holistic measures and introduce MR-Cube; a MapReduce-basedframework for efficient cube computation and identification of interesting cube groups onholistic measures. We provide extensive experimental analyses over both real and …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2012,105
Effective phrase prediction,Arnab Nandi; HV Jagadish,Abstract Autocompletion is a widely deployed facility in systems that require user input.Having the system complete a partially typed" word" can save user time and effort. In thispaper; we study the problem of autocompletion not just at the level of a single" word"; but atthe level of a multi-word" phrase". There are two main challenges: one is that the number ofphrases (both the number possible and the number actually observed in a corpus) iscombinatorially larger than the number of words; the second is that a" phrase"; unlike a"word"; does not have a well-defined boundary; so that the autocompletion system has todecide not just what to predict; but also how far.,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,96
Distributed and interactive cube exploration,Niranjan Kamat; Prasanth Jayachandran; Karthik Tunga; Arnab Nandi,Interactive ad-hoc analytics over large datasets has become an increasingly popular usecase. We detail the challenges encountered when building a distributed system that allowsthe interactive exploration of a data cube. We introduce DICE; a distributed system that usesa novel session-oriented model for data cube exploration; designed to provide the user withinteractive sub-second latencies for specified accuracy levels. A novel framework isprovided that combines three concepts: faceted exploration of data cubes; speculativeexecution of queries and query execution over subsets of data. We discuss designconsiderations; implementation details and optimizations of our system. Experimentsdemonstrate that DICE provides a sub-second interactive cube exploration experience at thebillion-tuple scale that is at least 33% faster than current approaches.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,65
Guided interaction: Rethinking the query-result paradigm,Arnab Nandi; HV Jagadish,ABSTRACT Many decades of research; coupled with continuous increases in computingpower; have enabled highly efficient execution of queries on large databases. Inconsequence; for many databases; far more time is spent by users formulating queries thanby the system evaluating them. It stands to reason that; looking at the overall queryexperience we provide users; we should pay attention to how we can assist users in theholistic process of obtaining the information they desire from the database; and not just theconstituent activity of efficiently generating a result given a complete precise query. In thispaper; we examine the conventional query-result paradigm employed by databases anddemonstrate challenges encountered when following this paradigm for an informationseeking task. We recognize that the process of query specification itself is a major …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,48
Saga: Array storage as a db with support for structural aggregations,Yi Wang; Arnab Nandi; Gagan Agrawal,Abstract In recent years; many Array DBMSs; including SciDB and RasDaMan haveemerged to meet the needs of data management applications where the natural structuresare the arrays. These systems; like their relational counterparts; involve an expensive dataingestion phase. The paradigm of using native storage as a DB and providing database-likesupport (eg; the NoDB approach) has recently been shown to be an effective approach fordealing with infrequently queried data; where data ingestion costs cannot be justified;though only in context of relational data. Applications that generate massive arrays; such asthe scientific simulations; often store the data in one of a small number of array storageformats; like NetCDF or HDF5. Thus; a natural question is;" can database-like functionalitybe supported over native array storage?". In this paper; we present algorithms; different …,Proceedings of the 26th international conference on scientific and statistical database management,2014,43
Gestural Query Specification,Arnab Nandi; Lilong Jiang; Michael Mandel,Abstract Direct; ad-hoc interaction with databases has typically been performed overconsole-oriented conversational interfaces using query languages such as SQL. With therise in popularity of gestural user interfaces and computing devices that use gestures astheir exclusive modes of interaction; database query interfaces require a fundamentalrethinking to work without keyboards. We present a novel query specification system thatallows the user to query databases using a series of gestures. We present a novel gesturerecognition system that uses both the interaction and the state of the database to classifygestural input into relational database queries. We conduct exhaustive systems performancetests and user studies to demonstrate that our system is not only performant and capable ofinteractive latencies; but it is also more usable; faster to use and more intuitive than …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,42
HAMSTER: using search clicklogs for schema and taxonomy matching,Arnab Nandi; Philip A Bernstein,Abstract We address the problem of unsupervised matching of schema information from alarge number of data sources into the schema of a data warehouse. The matching process isthe first step of a framework to integrate data feeds from third-party data providers into astructured-search engine's data warehouse. Our experiments show that traditional schema-based and instance-based schema matching methods fall short. We propose a newtechnique based on the search engine's clicklogs. Two schema elements are matched if thedistribution of keyword queries that cause click-throughs on their instances are similar. Wepresent experiments on large commercial datasets that show the new technique has muchbetter accuracy than traditional techniques.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,40
Qunits: queried units in database search,Arnab Nandi; HV Jagadish,Abstract: Keyword search against structured databases has become a popular topic ofinvestigation; since many users find structured queries too hard to express; and enjoy thefreedom of a``Google-like''query box into which search terms can be entered. Attempts toaddress this problem face a fundamental dilemma. Database querying is based on the logicof predicate evaluation; with a precisely defined answer set for a given query. On the otherhand; in an information retrieval approach; ranked query results have long been acceptedas far superior to results based on boolean query evaluation. As a consequence; whenkeyword queries are attempted against databases; relatively ad-hoc ranking mechanismsare invented (if ranking is used at all); and there is little leverage from the large body of IRliterature regarding how to rank query results. Our proposal is to create a clear separation …,CIDR,2009,37
Spin: searching personal information networks,Soumen Chakrabarti; Jeetendra Mirchandani; Arnab Nandi,Affordable storage has grown dramatically over the last decade; enabling large-scalearchival of email; contacts; documents; images; and music. Large personal storage becomesall the more useful with effective search tools. Recent operating systems can index PC harddisks and enable keyword search over many file types. All Web-based email servicesinclude keyword search. Major Web search companies have recently released desktopsearch tools that enable search on file systems and browser caches. Many researchprototypes exist as well [4; 5; 3; 6]. With some exceptions [3; 6]; prototypes and productshave stayed close to traditional IR: they largely lack the capability to discover and reconcileentities and relations that pervade the user's life from diverse and heterogeneous sources; torepresent these in a graphical model; and to enable powerful but user-friendly queries on …,Proceedings of the 28th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2005,17
Skimmer: rapid scrolling of relational query results,Manish Singh; Arnab Nandi; HV Jagadish,Abstract A relational database often yields a large set of tuples as the result of a query.Users browse this result set to find the information they require. If the result set is large; theremay be many pages of data to browse. Since results comprise tuples of alphanumericvalues that have few visual markers; it is hard to browse the data quickly; even if it is sorted.In this paper; we describe the design of a system for browsing relational data by scrollingthrough it at a high speed. Rather than showing the user a fast changing blur; the systempresents the user with a small number of representative tuples. Representative tuples areselected to provide a" good impression" of the query result. We show that the informationloss to the user is limited; even at high scrolling speeds; and that our algorithms can pickgood representatives fast enough to provide for real-time; high-speed scrolling over large …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,14

Due to the" fun" and informal nature of such events;they make for excellent informal learning platforms that attract a diverse spectrum ofstudents; especially those typically uninterested in traditional classroom settings. In thispaper; we investigate the informal learning aspects of Ohio State's annual hackathon eventsover the past two years; with over 100 student participants in 2013 and over 200 studentparticipants in 2014. Despite the competitive nature of such events; we observed asignificant amount of peer-learning--students teaching each other how to solve specificchallenges and learn new skills.

Existing supervisedcomputer vision techniques typically require large quantities of labeled training data; andeven with that; fail to return accurate results in all but the most stylized settings. Using vanillacrowdsourcing; on the other hand; can lead to significant errors; especially on images withmany objects. In this paper; we present our JellyBean suite of algorithms; that combines thebest of crowds and computer vision to count objects in images; and uses judiciousdecomposition of images to greatly improve accuracy at low cost. Our algorithms haveseveral desirable properties:(i) they are theoretically optimal or near-optimal; in that they askas few questions as possible to humans (under certain intuitively reasonable …,Third AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing,2015,13
Snaptoquery: providing interactive feedback during exploratory query specification,Lilong Jiang; Arnab Nandi,Abstract A critical challenge in the data exploration process is discovering and issuing the"right" query; especially when the space of possible queries is large. This problem ofexploratory query specification is exacerbated by the use of interactive user interfaces drivenby mouse; touch; or next-generation; three-dimensional; motion capture-based devices;which; are often imprecise due to jitter and sensitivity issues. In this paper; we proposeSnapToQuery; a novel technique that guides users through the query space by providinginteractive feedback during the query specification process by" snapping" to the user's likelyintended queries. These intended queries can be derived from prior query logs; or from thedata itself; using methods described in this paper. In order to provide interactive responsetimes over large datasets; we propose two data reduction techniques when snapping to …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,12
FluxQuery: An Execution Framework for Highly Interactive Query Workloads,Roee Ebenstein; Niranjan Kamat; Arnab Nandi,Abstract Modern computing devices and user interfaces have necessitated highly interactivequerying. Some of these interfaces issue a large number of dynamically changing andcontinuous queries to the backend. In others; users expect to inspect results during thequery formulation process; in order to guide or help them towards specifying a full-fledgedquery. Thus; users end up issuing a fast-changing workload to the underlying database. Insuch situations; the user's query intent can be thought of as being in flux. In this paper; weshow that the traditional query execution engines are not well-suited for this new class ofhighly interactive workloads. We propose a novel model to interpret the variability of likelyqueries in a workload. We implemented a cyclic scan-based approach to process queriesfrom such workloads in an efficient and practical manner while reducing the overall …,Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2016,7
With a little help from my friends,Arnab Nandi; Stelios Paparizos; John C Shafer; Rakesh Agrawal,A typical person has numerous online friends that; according to studies; the person oftenconsults for opinions and advice. However; public broadcasting a question to all friends riskssocial capital when repeated too often; is not tolerant to topic sensitivity; and can result in noresponse; as the message is lost in a myriad of status updates. Direct messaging is morepersonal and avoids these pitfalls; but requires manual selection of friends to contact; whichcan be time consuming and challenging. A user may have difficulty guessing which of theirnumerous online friends can provide a high quality and timely response. We demonstrate aworking system that addresses these issues by returning an ordered subset of friendspredicting (a) near-term availability;(b) willingness to respond and (c) topical knowledge;given a query.

Schema Matching Using Clicklogs,*,Techniques described herein describe a schema and taxonomy matching process that usesclicklogs to map a schema for source data to a schema for target data. A search engine mayreceive source data that is structured using the source schema; and the search engine itselfmay contain target data structured using the target schema. Using query distributionsderived from the clicklogs; the source schema may be mapped to the target schema. Themapping can be used to integrate the source data into the target data and to index theintegrated data for a search engine.,*,2010,5
Don’t Just Swipe Left; Tell Me Why: Enhancing Gesture-based Feedback with Reason Bins,Juan Beltran; Ziqi Huang; Azza Abouzied; Arnab Nandi,Abstract Despite several advances in information retrieval systems and user interfaces; thespecification of queries over text-based document collections remains a challengingproblem. Query specification with keywords is a popular solution. However; given thewidespread adoption of gesture-driven interfaces such as multitouch technologies insmartphones and tablets; the lack of a physical keyboard makes query specification withkeywords inconvenient. We present BinGO; a novel gestural approach to querying textdatabases that allows users to refine their queries using a swipe gesture to either" like" or"dislike" candidate documents as well as express the reasons they like or dislike a documentby swiping through automatically generated" reason bins". Such reasons refine a user'squery with additional keywords. We present an online and efficient bin generation …,ACM Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI),2017,3
Discovery of driving patterns by trajectory segmentation,Sobhan Moosavi; Rajiv Ramnath; Arnab Nandi,Abstract Telematics data is becoming increasingly available due to the ubiquity of devicesthat collect data during drives; for different purposes; such as usage based insurance (UBI);fleet management; navigation of connected vehicles; etc. Consequently; a variety of data-analytic applications have become feasible that extract valuable insights from the data. Inthis paper; we address the especially challenging problem of discovering behavior-baseddriving patterns from only externally observable phenomena (eg vehicle's speed). Wepresent a trajectory segmentation approach capable of discovering driving patterns asseparate segments; based on the behavior of drivers. This segmentation approach includesa novel transformation of trajectories along with a dynamic programming approach forsegmentation.

Perfect and maximum randomness in stratified sampling over joins,Niranjan Kamat; Arnab Nandi,Abstract: Supporting sampling in the presence of joins is an important problem in dataanalysis; but is inherently challenging due to the need to avoid correlation between outputtuples. Current solutions provide either correlated or non-correlated samples. Samplingmight not always be feasible in the non-correlated sampling-based approaches--the samplesize or intermediate data size might be exceedingly large. On the other hand; a correlatedsample may not be representative of the join. This paper presents a\emph {unified} strategytowards join sampling; while considering sample correlation every step of the way. Weprovide two key contributions. First; in the case where a\emph {correlated} sample is\emph{acceptable}; we provide techniques; for all join types; to sample base relations so that theirjoin is\emph {as random as possible}.

Organic databases,HV Jagadish; Li Qian; Arnab Nandi,Databases today are carefully engineered: there is an expensive and deliberate designprocess; after which a database schema is defined; during this design process; variouspossible instance examples and use cases are hypothesised and carefully analysed; finally;the schema is ready and then can be populated with data. All of this effort is a major barrierto database adoption. In this paper; we explore the possibility of organic database creationinstead of the traditional engineered approach. The idea is to let the user start storing data ina database with a schema that is just enough to cove the instances at hand. We then supportefficient schema evolution as new data instances arrive. By designing the database toevolve; we can sidestep the expensive front-end cost of carefully engineering the design ofthe database.

Data tweening: Incremental visualization of data transforms,Meraj Khan; Larry Xu; Arnab Nandi; Joseph M Hellerstein,Abstract In the context of interactive query sessions; it is common to issue a succession ofqueries; transforming a dataset to the desired result. It is often difficult to comprehend asuccession of transformations; especially for complex queries. Thus; to facilitateunderstanding of each data transformation and to provide continuous feedback; weintroduce the concept of" data tweening"; ie; interpolating between resultsets; presenting tothe user a series of incremental visual representations of a resultset transformation. Wepresent tweening methods that consider not just the changes in the result; but also thechanges in the query. Through user studies; we show that data tweening allows users toefficiently comprehend data transforms; and also enables them to gain a betterunderstanding of the underlying query operations.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,2
Graphical Perception in Animated Bar Charts,Eugene Wu; Lilong Jiang; Larry Xu; Arnab Nandi,Abstract: Interactive visual applications create animations that encode changes in the data.For example; cross-filtering dynamically updates linked visualizations based on the user'scontinuous brushing actions. The animated effects resulting from these interactions dependsboth on how interaction (eg; brushing speed) controls properties of the animation such asframe rate; as well as how the data that is being explored dictates the data encoded in theanimation. Past work has found that frame rate matters to general perception; however acritical question is which of these animation and data properties affects the perceptualaccuracy of judgement tasks; and to what extent. Although graphical perception has beenwell studied for static data visualizations; it is ripe for exploration in the animated setting. Wedesigned two animated judgment tasks of a target bar in an animated bar chart and …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1604.00080,2016,2

Characterizing driving context from driver behavior,Sobhan Moosavi; Behrooz Omidvar-Tehrani; R Bruce Craig; Arnab Nandi; Rajiv Ramnath,Abstract: Because of the increasing availability of spatiotemporal data; a variety of data-analytic applications have become possible. Characterizing driving context; where contextmay be thought of as a combination of location and time; is a new challenging application.An example of such a characterization is finding the correlation between driving behaviorand traffic conditions. This contextual information enables analysts to validate observation-based hypotheses about the driving of an individual. In this paper; we present DriveContext;a novel framework to find the characteristics of a context; by extracting significant drivingpatterns (eg; a slow-down); and then identifying the set of potential causes behind patterns(eg; traffic congestion). Our experimental results confirm the feasibility of the framework inidentifying meaningful driving patterns; with improvements in comparison with the state-of …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.05733,2017,1

A Session-Based Approach to Fast-But-Approximate Interactive Data Cube Exploration,Niranjan Kamat; Arnab Nandi,Abstract With the proliferation of large datasets; sampling has become pervasive in dataanalysis. Sampling has numerous benefits—from reducing the computation time and cost toincreasing the scope of interactive analysis. A popular task in data science; well-suitedtoward sampling; is the computation of fast-but-approximate aggregations over sampleddata. Aggregation is a foundational block of data analysis; with data cube being its primaryconstruct. We observe that such aggregation queries are typically issued in an ad-hoc;interactive setting. In contrast to one-off queries; a typical query session consists of a seriesof quick queries; interspersed with the user inspecting the results and formulating the nextquery. The similarity between session queries opens up opportunities for reusingcomputation of not just query results; but also error estimates. Error estimates need to be …,*,2017,1

InfiniViz: Interactive Visual Exploration using Progressive Bin Refinement,Niranjan Kamat; Arnab Nandi,Abstract: Interactive visualizations can accelerate the data analysis loop through near-instantaneous feedback. To achieve interactivity; techniques such as data cubes andsampling are typically employed. While data cubes can speedup querying for moderate-sized datasets; they are ineffective at doing so at a larger scales due to the size of thematerialized data cubes. On the other hand; while sampling can help scale to large datasets;it adds sampling error and the associated issues into the process. While increasing accuracyby looking at more data may sometimes be valuable; providing result minutiae might not benecessary if they do not impart additional significant information. Indeed; such details notonly incur a higher\emph {computational} cost; but also tax the\emph {cognitive} load of theanalyst with worthless trivia.

Although these workloads areimportant; many of the classical challenges associated with scale and Big Data do not apply.This panel brings together experts in a variety of fields to explore the new opportunities andchallenges presented by" Small Data".,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on,2017,*
Casual Querying: Facilitating Information Dissemination in Ad-hoc Environments.,Arnab Nandi,ABSTRACT Data-driven dashboards have now become ubiquitous. Environments such asinformation kiosks in public spaces; dashboards in cars; or smart televisions at home–allcater to a casual form of data exploration; where the user may have a quick-and-simpleinformation need. In contrast to long and complex database query sessions for experts;casual queries pose two requirements to the query interface. First; queries (or the results toqueries) need to be discoverable by the end-user. Second; a user may often not issue aquery at all; in which case the system still needs to provide some information to the user.Given these requirements; we present a case study of The Invisible Library; an interactiveexhibit that presents log analysis as public art.,CIDR,2017,*
TrendQuery: a system for interactive exploration of trends,Niranjan Kamat; Eugene Wu; Arnab Nandi,Abstract The surfacing of trends from data collections such as user-generated contentstreams and news articles is a popular and important data analysis activity; used inapplications such as business intelligence; quantitative stock trading and; social mediaexploration. Unlike traditional content analysis; trend analysis includes an additional vitaltime dimension: a trend can be defined as a temporal pattern over a group of semanticallyrelated items. The unsupervised discovery of trends is often not sufficient; either due toinadequacies in the trend analysis algorithm; or because the data collection itself does notpossess all of the information to identify the trend. Thus; it is necessary for an expert human-in-the-loop to be involved in the process of trend analysis. To this end; we introduceTrendQuery; a system designed towards iterative and interactive surfacing of trends. Our …,Proceedings of the Workshop on Human-In-the-Loop Data Analytics,2016,*

Beyond Binary Gestures: Exploring Documents using Touch Interfaces,Ziqi Huang; Juan Felipe Beltran; Azza Abouzied; Arnab Nandi,Abstract As keyboard-less devices such as tablets and smartphones become more importantin daily life; searching and exploring documents has become an increasingly important task.Traditional document exploration interfaces require multiple keywords to be typed in; whichis cumbersome and time-consuming using a touch-driven device. We present BigGo-aninterface for exploration of documents using touch gestures. Our interface goes beyondcommon binary touch gestures as" like" or" dislike": the user is given a chance to not justprovide binary feedback; but also explain why they like or dislike a certain document. Sincethe feedback is richer; it allows BinGo to provide a better recommendation of documents;and aid exploration of the documents. The ability to provide richer feedback improves theexploration experience and decreases the overall gesture cost for targeting the proper …,Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2015,*
Interactive Tweaking of Text Analytics Dashboards,Arnab Nandi; Ziqi Huang; Man Cao; Micha Elsner; Lilong Jiang; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Ramiya Venkatachalam,Abstract With the increasing importance of text analytics in all disciplines; eg; science;business; and social media analytics; it has become important to extract actionable insightsfrom text in a timely manner. Insights from text analytics are conventionally presented asvisualizations and dashboards to the analyst. While these insights are intended to be set upas a one-time task and observed in a passive manner; most use cases in the real worldrequire constant tweaking of these dashboards in order to adapt to new data analysissettings. Current systems supporting such analysis have grown from simplistic chains ofaggregations to complex pipelines with a range of implicit (or latent) and explicit parametricknobs. The re-execution of such pipelines can be computationally expensive; and theincreased query-response time at each step may significantly delay the analysis task …,International Workshop on Databases in Networked Information Systems,2015,*
Piloting interactive exhibits in the academic research library,Erin Fletcher; Meris Madernach; Arnab Nandi; Alex Oliszewski,Erin Fletcher is the Exhibits Coordinator at The Ohio State University Libraries.

PLASMA-HD: probing the lattice structure and makeup of high-dimensional data,David Fuhry; Yang Zhang; Venu Satuluri; Arnab Nandi; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract Rapidly making sense of; analyzing; and extracting useful information from largeand complex data is a grand challenge. A user tasked with meeting this challenge is oftenbefuddled with questions on where and how to begin to understand the relevantcharacteristics of such data. Real-world problem scenarios often involve scalabilitylimitations and time constraints. In this paper we present an incremental interactive dataanalysis system as a step to address this challenge. This system builds on recent progressin the fields of interactive data exploration; locality sensitive hashing; knowledge caching;and graph visualization. Using visual clues based on rapid incremental estimates; a user isprovided a multi-level capability to probe and interrogate the intrinsic structure of data.Throughout the interactive process; the output of previous probes can be used to …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,*

Answering Imprecise Structured Search Queries.,Arnab Nandi,Humans are increasingly becoming the primary consumer of structured data. As the volumeand heterogeneity of data produced in the world increases; the existing paradigm of usingan application layer to query and search for information in data is becoming infeasible. Thehuman end-user is overwhelmed with a barrage of diverse query and data models. Due tothe lack of familiarity with the data sources; search queries issued by the user are typicallyfound to be imprecise. To solve this problem; this dissertation introduces the notion of a"queried unit"; or qunit; which is the semantic unit of information returned in response to auser's search query. In a qunits-based system; the user comes in with an information need;and is guided to the qunit that is an appropriate response for that need. The qunits-basedparadigm aids the user by systematically shrinking both the query and result spaces. On …,*,2011,*

GROCS Grant Proposal,Arnab Nandi; Nikhil C Rao; Sameer Halai,Despite the crowded university environment; it is incredibly easy for a person to be alone.While classes; societies and activities keep us around each other; we often find ourselvesreaching out to connect with someone else; to share our feelings—to be heard; and to beacknowledged. Michigan weather doesn't help either; long; cold and dark winters can bequite depressing. The installation:! alone (read “not alone”) is a university wide installationthat attempts to address this problem; in the form of a large multi-player game. Specifically;we consider the UM bus network as a potential platform for deployment. Every bus stop(which can get very lonely if you're waiting for a bus at night!) on the UM Bus network isequipped with a! alone node—a book sized box placed either inside a bus stop housing; ormounted on the bus stop sign posts.
