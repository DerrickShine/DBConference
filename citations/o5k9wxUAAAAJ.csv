Approaching the skyline in Z order,Ken CK Lee; Baihua Zheng; Huajing Li; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract Given a set of multidimensional data points; skyline query retrieves a set of datapoints that are not dominated by any other points. This query is useful for multi-preferenceanalysis and decision making. By analyzing the skyline query; we observe a closeconnection between Z-order curve and skyline processing strategies and propose to use anew index structure called ZBtree; to index and store data points based on Z-order curve.We develop a suite of novel and efficient skyline algorithms; which scale very well to datadimensionality and cardinality; including (1) ZSearch; which processes skyline queries andsupports progressive result delivery;(2) ZUpdate; which facilitates incremental skyline resultmaintenance; and (3) k-ZSearch; which answers k-dominant skyline query (a skyline variantthat retrieves a representative subset of skyline results).

Cache invalidation and replacement strategies for location-dependent data in mobile environments,Baihua Zheng; Jianliang Xu; Dik Lun Lee,Mobile location-dependent information services (LDISs) have become increasingly popularin recent years. However; data caching strategies for LDISs have thus far received littleattention. In this paper; we study the issues of cache invalidation and cache replacement forlocation-dependent data under a geometric location model. We introduce a newperformance criterion; called caching efficiency; and propose a generic method for location-dependent cache invalidation strategies. In addition; two cache replacement policies; PAand PAID; are proposed. Unlike the conventional replacement policies; PA and PAID takeinto consideration the valid scope area of a data value. We conduct a series of simulationexperiments to study the performance of the proposed caching schemes. The experimentalresults show that the proposed location-dependent invalidation scheme is very effective …,IEEE Transactions on Computers,2002,200
Ir-tree: An efficient index for geographic document search,Zhisheng Li; Ken CK Lee; Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee; Dik Lee; Xufa Wang,Given a geographic query that is composed of query keywords and a location; a geographicsearch engine retrieves documents that are the most textually and spatially relevant to thequery keywords and the location; respectively; and ranks the retrieved documents accordingto their joint textual and spatial relevances to the query. The lack of an efficient index thatcan simultaneously handle both the textual and spatial aspects of the documents makesexisting geographic search engines inefficient in answering geographic queries. In thispaper; we propose an efficient index; called IR-tree; that together with a top-k documentsearch algorithm facilitates four major tasks in document searches; namely; 1) spatialfiltering; 2) textual filtering; 3) relevance computation; and 4) document ranking in a fullyintegrated manner. In addition; IR-tree allows searches to adopt different weights on …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,197
Semantic caching in location-dependent query processing,Baihua Zheng; Dik Lun Lee,Abstract A method is presented in this paper for answering location-dependent queries in amobile computing environment. We investigate a common scenario where data objects (eg;restaurants and gas stations) are stationary while clients that issue queries about the dataobjects are mobile. Our proposed technique constructs a Voronoi Diagram (VD) on the dataobjects to serve as an index for them. A VD defines; for each data object d; the region withinwhich d is the nearest point to any mobile client within that region. As such; the VD can beused to answer nearest-neighbor queries directly. Furthermore; the area within which theanswer is valid can be computed. Based on the VD; we develop a semantic caching schemethat records a cached item as well as its valid range. A simulation is conducted to study theperformance of the proposed semantic cache in comparison with the traditional cache …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2001,179
Grid-partition index: a hybrid method for nearest-neighbor queries in wireless location-based services,Baihua Zheng; Jianliang Xu; Wang-Chien Lee; Lun Lee,Abstract Traditional nearest-neighbor (NN) search is based on two basic indexingapproaches: object-based indexing and solution-based indexing. The former is constructedbased on the locations of data objects: using some distance heuristics on object locations.The latter is built on a precomputed solution space. Thus; NN queries can be reduced to andprocessed as simple point queries in this solution space. Both approaches exhibit somedisadvantages; especially when employed for wireless data broadcast in mobile computingenvironments. In this paper; we introduce a new index method; called the grid-partitionindex; to support NN search in both on-demand access and periodic broadcast modes ofmobile computing. The grid-partition index is constructed based on the Voronoi diagram; ie;the solution space of NN queries. However; it has two distinctive characteristics. First; it …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2006,115
Spatial queries in wireless broadcast systems,Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee; Dik Lun Lee,Abstract Owing to the advent of wireless networking and personal digital devices;information systems in the era of mobile computing are expected to be able to handle atremendous amount of traffic and service requests from the users. Wireless data broadcast;thanks to its high scalability; is particularly suitable for meeting such a challenge. Indexingtechniques have been developed for wireless data broadcast systems in order to conservethe scarce power resources in mobile clients. However; most of the previous studies do nottake into account the impact of location information of users. In this paper; we address theissues of supporting spatial queries (including window queries and k NN queries) of location-dependent information via wireless data broadcast. A linear index structure based on theHilbert curve and corresponding search algorithms are proposed to answer spatial …,Wireless Networks,2004,114
Energy efficient index for querying location-dependent data in mobile broadcast environments,Jianliang Xu; Baibua Zheng; W-C Lee; Dik Lun Lee,We are witnessing in recent years growing interest for location-dependent informationservices among mobile users. We examine the issue of processing location-dependentqueries in a mobile broadcast environment. Different from a traditional environment; mobileusers are concerned with not only access latencies but also power conservation. The planarpoint location algorithms and conventional spatial index structures are shown inefficient. Wepropose a new index data structure; called D-tree; for querying location-dependent data inmobile broadcast environments. The basic idea is to index data regions based on thedivisions between them. We describe how to construct the binary D-tree index; how toprocess location-dependent queries based on this index structure; and how to page the D-tree to fit the packet capacity. The performance of the D-tree is evaluated using both …,Data Engineering; 2003. Proceedings. 19th International Conference on,2003,108
DSI: A fully distributed spatial index for location-based wireless broadcast services,Wang-Chien Lee; Baihua Zheng,Recent announcement of the MSN Direct Service has demonstrated the feasibility andindustrial interest in utilizing wireless broadcast for pervasive information services. Tosupport location-based services in wireless data broadcast systems; a distributed spatialindex (called DSI) is proposed in this paper. DSI is highly efficient because it has a linear yetfully distributed structure that facilitates multiple search paths to be naturally mixed togetherby sharing links. Moreover; DSI is very resilient in error-prone wireless communicationenvironments. Search algorithms for two classical location-based queries; window queriesand kNN queries; based on DSI are presented. Performance evaluation of DSI shows thatDSI significantly outperforms R-tree and Hilbert Curve Index; two state-of-the-art spatialindexing techniques for wireless data broadcast,25th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS'05),2005,88
TOSA: a near-optimal scheduling algorithm for multi-channel data broadcast,Baihua Zheng; Xia Wu; Xing Jin; Dik Lun Lee,Abstract Wireless broadcast is very suitable for delivering information to a large userpopulation. In this paper; we concentrate on data allocation methods for multiple broadcastchannels. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first allocation model that takes into theconsideration of items' access frequencies; items' lengths. and bandwidth of differentchannels. We first derive the optimal average expected delay for multiple channels for thegeneral case where data access frequencies; data sizes; and channel bandwidths can all benon-uniform. Second; we develop TOSA; a multi-channel allocation method that does notassume a uniform broadcast schedule for data items on the same channel. TOSA is basedon the idea of two-level data allocation; ie; a high-level optimization step for allocating datato the channels; followed by a low-level optimization step to schedule data within a …,Proceedings of the 6th international conference on Mobile data management,2005,79
Proactive caching for spatial queries in mobile environments,Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu; Wing Sing Wong; Baihua Zheng; Dik Lun Lee; W-C Lee,Semantic caching enables mobile clients to answer spatial queries locally by storing thequery descriptions together with the results. However; it supports only a limited number ofquery types; and sharing results among these types is difficult. To address these issues; wepropose a proactive caching model which caches the result objects as well as the index thatsupports these objects as the results. The cached index enables the objects to be reused forall common types of queries. We also propose an adaptive scheme to cache such an index;which further optimizes the query response time for the best user experience. Simulationresults show that proactive caching achieves a significant performance gain over pagecaching and semantic caching in mobile environments where wireless bandwidth andbattery are precious resources.,21st International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE'05),2005,75
Continuous obstructed nearest neighbor queries in spatial databases,Yunjun Gao; Baihua Zheng,Abstract In this paper; we study a novel form of continuous nearest neighbor queries in thepresence of obstacles; namely continuous obstructed nearest neighbor (CONN) search. Itconsiders the impact of obstacles on the distance between objects; which is ignored by mostof spatial queries. Given a data set P; an obstacle set O; and a query line segment q in a two-dimensional space; a CONN query retrieves the nearest neighbor of each point on qaccording to the obstructed distance; ie; the shortest path between them without crossingany obstacle. We formulate CONN search; analyze its unique properties; and developalgorithms for exact CONN query processing; assuming that both P and O are indexed byconventional data-partitioning indices (eg; R-trees). Our methods tackle the CONN retrievalby performing a single query for the entire query segment; and only process the data …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,72
The D-tree: An index structure for planar point queries in location-based wireless services,Jianliang Xu; Baihua Zheng; W-C Lee; Dik Lun Lee,Location-based services (LBSs); considered as a killer application in the wireless datamarket; provide information based on locations specified in the queries. In this paper; weexamine the indexing issue for querying location-dependent data in wireless LBSs; inparticular; we focus on an important class of queries; planar point queries. To address theissues of responsiveness; energy consumption; and bandwidth contention in wirelesscommunications; an index has to minimize the search time and maintain a small storageoverhead. It is shown that the traditional point-location algorithms and spatial indexstructures fail to achieve either objective or both. This paper proposes a new index structure;called D-tree; which indexes spatial regions based on the divisions that form the boundariesof the regions.

A distributed spatial index for error-prone wireless data broadcast,Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee; Ken C Lee; Dik Lun Lee; Min Shao,Abstract Information is valuable to users when it is available not only at the right time butalso at the right place. To support efficient location-based data access in wireless databroadcast systems; a distributed spatial index (called DSI) is presented in this paper. DSI ishighly efficient because it has a linear yet fully distributed structure that naturally shares linksin different search paths. DSI is very resilient to the error-prone wireless communicationenvironment because interrupted search operations based on DSI can be resumed easily. Itsupports search algorithms for classical location-based queries such as window queries andk NN queries in both of the snapshot and continuous query modes. In-depth analysis andsimulation-based evaluation have been conducted. The results show that DSI significantlyout-performs a variant of R-trees tailored for wireless data broadcast environments.,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2009,64

ROAD: A new spatial object search framework for road networks,Ken CK Lee; Wang-Chien Lee; Baihua Zheng; Yuan Tian,In this paper; we present a new system framework called ROAD for spatial object search onroad networks. ROAD is extensible to diverse object types and efficient for processingvarious location-dependent spatial queries (LDSQs); as it maintains objects separately froma given network and adopts an effective search space pruning technique. Based on ouranalysis on the two essential operations for LDSQ processing; namely; network traversaland object lookup; ROAD organizes a large road network as a hierarchy of interconnectedregional subnetworks (called Rnets). Each Rnet is augmented with 1) shortcuts and 2)object abstracts to accelerate network traversals and provide quick object lookups;respectively. To manage those shortcuts and object abstracts; two cooperating indices;namely; Route Overlay and Association Directory are devised.

Continuous visible nearest neighbor queries,Yunjun Gao; Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee; Gencai Chen,Abstract In this paper; we identify and solve a new type of spatial queries; called continuousvisible nearest neighbor (CVNN) search. Given a data set P; an obstacle set O; and a queryline segment q; a CVNN query returns a set of (p; R) tuples such that p ε P is the nearestneighbor (NN) to every point r along the interval R ε q as well as p is visible to r. Note that pmay be NULL; meaning that all points in P are invisible to all points in R; due to theobstruction of some obstacles in O. In this paper; we formulate the problem and proposeefficient algorithms for CVNN query processing; assuming that both P and O are indexed byR-trees. In addition; we extend our techniques to several variations of the CVNN query.Extensive experiments verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithmsusing both real and synthetic datasets.,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,48
Location-dependent skyline query,Baihua Zheng; Ken CK Lee; Wang-Chien Lee,Given a set of data points with both spatial coordinates andnon-spatial attributes; point alocation-dependently dominates point b with respect to a query point q if a is closer to q thanb and meanwhile a dominates b. A location-dependent skyline query (LDSQ) issued at pointq is to retrieve all the points that are not location-dependently dominated by other points withregard to q. In this paper; we focus on the query processing and result validation of LDSQoverstatic objects. Two algorithms; namely brute-forth and δ-scanning; are proposed. Theformer serves as the baseline algorithm while the latter significantly improves theperformance via space pruning.

Ranked reverse nearest neighbor search,Ken CK Lee; Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee,Given a set of data points P and a query point q in a multidimensional space; reversenearest neighbor (RNN) query finds data points in P whose nearest neighbors are q.Reverse k-nearest neighbor (RkNN) query (where k ges 1) generalizes RNN query to finddata points whose kNNs include q. For RkNN query semantics; q is said to have influence toall those answer data points. The degree of q's influence on a data point p (isin P) is denotedby kappap where q is the kappap-th NN of p. We introduce a new variant of RNN query;namely; ranked reverse nearest neighbor (RRNN) query; that retrieves t data points mostinfluenced by q; ie; the t data points having the smallest kappa's with respect to q.

On searching continuous k nearest neighbors in wireless data broadcast systems,Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee; Dik Lun Lee,A continuous nearest neighbor (CNN) search; which retrieves the nearest neighborscorresponding to every point in a given query line segment; is important for location-basedservices such as vehicular navigation and tourist guides. It is infeasible to answer a CNNsearch by issuing a traditional nearest neighbor query at every point of the line segment dueto the large number of queries generated and the overhead on bandwidth. Algorithms havebeen proposed recently to support CNN search in the traditional client-server systems butnot in the environment of wireless data broadcast; where uplink communication channelsfrom mobile devices to the server are not available.

On semantic caching and query scheduling for mobile nearest-neighbor search,Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee; Dik Lun Lee,Abstract Location-based services have received increasing attention in recent years. In thispaper; we address the performance issues of mobile nearest-neighbor search; in which themobile user issues a query to retrieve stationary service objects nearest to him/her. An indexbased on Voronoi Diagram is used in the server to support such a search; while a semanticcache is proposed to enhance the access efficiency of the service. Cache replacementpolicies tailored for the proposed semantic cache are examined. Moreover; several queryscheduling policies are proposed to address the inter-cell roaming issues in multi-cellenvironments. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the proposed methods. The resultshows that the system performance; in terms of cache hit ratio; query response time; cell-cross number and cell-recross number; is improved significantly.,Wireless Networks,2004,41

Given a data object set DA;a target object set DB; a spatial region R; and a critical distance dc in a multidimensionalspace; an OLS query retrieves those target objects in DB that are outside R but havemaximal optimality. Here; the optimality of a target object b isin DB located outside R isdefined as the number of the data objects from DA that are inside R and meanwhile havetheir distances to b not exceeding d c. When there is a tie; the accumulated distance from thedata objects to b serves as the tie breaker; and the one with smaller distance has the betteroptimality.

Efficient processing of exact top-k queries over disk-resident sorted lists,HweeHwa Pang; Xuhua Ding; Baihua Zheng,Abstract The top-k query is employed in a wide range of applications to generate a rankedlist of data that have the highest aggregate scores over certain attributes. As the pool ofattributes for selection by individual queries may be large; the data are indexed with per-attribute sorted lists; and a threshold algorithm (TA) is applied on the lists involved in eachquery. The TA executes in two phases--find a cut-off threshold for the top-k result scores;then evaluate all the records that could score above the threshold. In this paper; we focus onexact top-k queries that involve monotonic linear scoring functions over disk-resident sortedlists. We introduce a model for estimating the depths to which each sorted list needs to beprocessed in the two phases; so that (most of) the required records can be fetched efficientlythrough sequential or batched I/Os.

This type of queries is useful in many applications such asdecision making; data mining; and pattern recognition; as it considers both the proximity ofthe trajectories to q and the proximity of q to the trajectories. In this paper; we first formalizeMNN search and identify its characteristics; and then develop several algorithms forprocessing MNN queries efficiently. In particular; we investigate two classes of MNN queries;ie; MNN P and MNN T queries; which are defined with respect to stationary query points andmoving query trajectories; respectively. Our methods utilize the batch processing and …,Information Sciences,2010,24
An air index for spatial query processing in road networks,Weiwei Sun; Chunan Chen; Baihua Zheng; Chong Chen; Peng Liu,Spatial queries such as range query and kNN query in road networks have received agrowing number of attention in real life. Considering the large population of the users andthe high overhead of network distance computation; it is extremely important to guaranteethe efficiency and scalability of query processing. Motivated by the scalable and secureproperties of wireless broadcast model; this paper presents an air index called NetworkPartition Index (NPI) to support efficient spatial query processing in road networks viawireless broadcast. The main idea is to partition the road network into a number of regionsand then build the index to carry some pre-computation information of each region. We alsopropose multiple client-side algorithms to facilitate the processing of different spatial queriessuch as kNN query; range query and CNN query.

Efficient reverse top-k boolean spatial keyword queries on road networks,Yunjun Gao; Xu Qin; Baihua Zheng; Gang Chen,Reverse k nearest neighbor (RkNN) queries have a broad application base such asdecision support; profile-based marketing; and resource allocation. Previous work on RkNNsearch does not take textual information into consideration or limits to the Euclidean space.In the real world; however; most spatial objects are associated with textual information andlie on road networks. In this paper; we introduce a new type of queries; namely; reverse top-k Boolean spatial keyword (RkBSK) retrieval; which assumes objects are on the roadnetwork and considers both spatial and textual information. Given a data set P on a roadnetwork and a query point q with a set of keywords; an RkBSK query retrieves the points in Pthat have q as one of answer points for their top-k Boolean spatial keyword queries. Weformalize the RkBSK query and then propose filter-and-refinement framework based …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,21
High utility K-anonymization for social network publishing,Yazhe Wang; Long Xie; Baihua Zheng; Ken CK Lee,Abstract Privacy and utility are two main desiderata of good sensitive information publishingschemes. For publishing social networks; many existing algorithms rely on k k-anonymity asa criterion to guarantee privacy protection. They reduce the utility loss by first using thedegree sequence to model the structural properties of the original social network and thenminimizing the changes on the degree sequence caused by the anonymization process.However; the degree sequence-based graph model is simple; and it fails to capture manyimportant graph topological properties. Consequently; the existing anonymization algorithmsthat rely on this simple graph model to measure utility cannot guarantee generatinganonymized social networks of high utility. In this paper; we propose novel utilitymeasurements that are based on more complex community-based graph models. We …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2014,20
Direction-based surrounder queries for mobile recommendations,Xi Guo; Baihua Zheng; Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Yunjun Gao,Abstract Location-based recommendation services recommend objects to the user based onthe user's preferences. In general; the nearest objects are good choices considering theirspatial proximity to the user. However; not only the distance of an object to the user but alsotheir directional relationship are important. Motivated by these; we propose a new spatialquery; namely a direction-based surrounder (DBS) query; which retrieves the nearestobjects around the user from different directions. We define the DBS query not only in a two-dimensional Euclidean space E but also in a road network R. In the Euclidean space E; weconsider two objects a and b are directional close wrt a query point q iff the included angle∠ aqb is bounded by a threshold specified by the user at the query time. In a road networkR; we consider two objects a and b are directional close iff their shortest paths to q …,The VLDB Journal,2011,20
Algorithms for constrained k-nearest neighbor queries over moving object trajectories,Yunjun Gao; Baihua Zheng; Gencai Chen; Qing Li,Abstract An important query for spatio-temporal databases is to find nearest trajectories ofmoving objects. Existing work on this topic focuses on the closest trajectories in the wholedata space. In this paper; we introduce and solve constrained k-nearest neighbor (C k NN)queries and historical continuous C k NN (HCC k NN) queries on R-tree-like structuresstoring historical information about moving object trajectories. Given a trajectory set D; aquery object (point or trajectory) q; a temporal extent T; and a constrained region CR;(i) a C kNN query over trajectories retrieves from D within T; the k (≥ 1) trajectories that lie closest toq and intersect (or are enclosed by) CR; and (ii) an HCC k NN query on trajectories retrievesthe constrained k nearest neighbors (C k NNs) of q at any time instance of T.

Continuous nearest-neighbor search in the presence of obstacles,Yunjun Gao; Baihua Zheng; Gang Chen; Chun Chen; Qing Li,Abstract Despite the ubiquity of physical obstacles (eg; buildings; hills; and blindages; etc.)in the real world; most of spatial queries ignore the obstacles. In this article; we study a novelform of continuous nearest-neighbor queries in the presence of obstacles; namelycontinuous obstructed nearest-neighbor (CONN) search; which considers the impact ofobstacles on the distance between objects. Given a data set P; an obstacle set O; and aquery line segment q; in a two-dimensional space; a CONN query retrieves the nearestneighbor p &in; P of each point p′ on q according to the obstructed distance; the shortestpath between p and p′ without crossing any obstacle in O.

Tuning on-air signatures for balancing performance and confidentiality,Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee; Peng Liu; Dik Lun Lee; Xuhua Ding,In this paper; we investigate the trade off between performance and confidentiality insignature-based air indexing schemes for wireless data broadcast. Two metrics; namely;false drop probability and false guess probability; are defined to quantify the filteringefficiency and confidentiality loss of a signature scheme. Our analysis reveals that false dropprobability and false guess probability share a similar trend as the tuning parameters of asignature scheme change and it is impossible to achieve a low false drop probability and ahigh false guess probability simultaneously. In order to balance the performance andconfidentiality; we perform an analysis to provide a guidance for parameter settings of thesignature schemes to meet different system requirements. In addition; we propose the jumppointer technique and the XOR signature scheme to further improve the performance and …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2009,19
On efficient mutual nearest neighbor query processing in spatial databases,Yunjun Gao; Baihua Zheng; Gencai Chen; Qing Li,Abstract This paper studies a new form of nearest neighbor queries in spatial databases;namely; mutual nearest neighbor (MNN) search. Given a set D of objects and a query objectq; an MNN query returns from D; the set of objects that are among the k 1 (⩾ 1) nearestneighbors (NNs) of q; meanwhile; have q as one of their k 2 (⩾ 1) NNs. Although MNNqueries are useful in many applications involving decision making; data mining; and patternrecognition; it cannot be efficiently handled by existing spatial query processing approaches.In this paper; we present the first piece of work for tackling MNN queries efficiently.

Two-tier air indexing for on-demand xml data broadcast,Weiwei Sun; Ping Yu; Yongrui Qing; Zhuoyao Zhang; Baihua Zheng,XML data broadcast is an efficient way to disseminate semi-structured information inwireless mobile environments. Air indexing is the common method to improve the accesstime; and reduce the energy consumption in a broadcast system. In this paper; we propose anovel two-tier air indexing method that provides an overall picture of the document set in theserver which is necessary for XML data retrieving in on-demand mode. The efficiency of ourindexing method is contributed by two distinct advantages. First; the proposed pruningtechnique and the two-tier structure significantly reduce the index size. Second; the two-tierstructure enables efficient access protocol at the client which can further reduce the tuningtime during the index look up.

Navigational path privacy protection: navigational path privacy protection,Ken CK Lee; Wang-Chien Lee; Hong Va Leong; Baihua Zheng,Abstract Navigational path query; one of the most popular location-based services (LBSs);determines a route from a source to a destination on a road network. However; issuing pathqueries to some non-trustworthy service providers may pose privacy threats to the users. Forinstance; given a query requesting for a path from a residential address to a psychiatrist;some adversaries may deduce" who is related to what disease". In this paper; we present anobfuscator framework that reduces the likelihood of path queries being revealed; whilesupporting different user privacy protection needs and retaining query evaluation efficiency.The framework consists of two major components; namely; an obfuscator and an obfuscatedpath query processor. The former formulates obfuscated path queries by intermixing trueand fake sources and destinations and the latter facilitates efficient evaluation of the …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,18
Processing multiple aggregation queries in geo-sensor networks,Ken CK Lee; Wang-Chien Lee; Baihua Zheng; Julian Winter,Abstract To process aggregation queries issued through different sensors as access pointsin sensor networks; existing algorithms handle queries independently and perform in-network aggregation only at the query time. As a result of ad-hoc and independent executionof queries; no partial result is sharable and reusable among the queries. Consequently;scarce sensor network resources can be easily overconsumed; particularly; those sensorscommonly accessed by queries. In this paper; we address this issue by examining strategiesto maintain M aterialized I nN etwork V iews (MINV s) that pre-compute and store commonlyused aggregation results in the sensor network. With MINVs; aggregated sensed results forsome spatial regions are available and sharable to queries. Thus; the number of sensoraccesses is greatly reduced.

Efficient Collective Spatial Keyword Query Processing on Road Networks,Yunjun Gao; Jingwen Zhao; Baihua Zheng; Gang Chen,The collective spatial keyword query (CSKQ); an important variant of spatial keywordqueries; aims to find a set of the objects that collectively cover users' queried keywords; andthose objects are close to the query location and have small inter-object distances. Existingworks only focus on the CSKQ problem in the Euclidean space; although we observe that; inmany real-life applications; the closeness of two spatial objects is measured by their roadnetwork distance. Thus; existing methods cannot solve the problem of network-based CSKQefficiently. In this paper; we study the problem of collective spatial keyword query processingon road networks; where the objects are located on a predefined road network. We firstprove that this problem is NP-complete; and then we propose two approximate algorithmswith provable approximation bounds and one exact algorithm; for supporting CSKQ on …,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2016,17
Air indexing for on-demand XML data broadcast,Weiwei Sun; Yongrui Qin; Jingjing Wu; Baihua Zheng; Zhuoyao Zhang; Ping Yu; Peng Liu; Jian Zhang,XML data broadcast is an efficient way to disseminate semistructured information in wirelessmobile environments. In this paper; we propose a novel two-tier index structure to facilitatethe access of XML document in an on-demand broadcast system. It provides the clients withan overall image of all the XML documents available at the server side and hence enablesthe clients to locate complete result sets accordingly. A pruning strategy is developed to cutdown the index size and a two-tier structure is proposed to further remove any redundantinformation. In addition; two index distribution strategies; namely naive distribution andpartial distribution; have been designed to interleave the index information with the XMLdocuments in the wireless channels. Theoretical analysis and simulation experiments arealso put forward to show the benefits of our indexing methods.,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2014,17
On efficient obstructed reverse nearest neighbor query processing,Yunjun Gao; Jiacheng Yang; Gang Chen; Baihua Zheng; Chun Chen,Abstract In this paper; we study a new form of reverse nearest neighbor (RNN) queries; ie;obstructed reverse nearest neighbor (ORNN) search. It considers the impact of obstacles onthe distance between objects; which is ignored by the existing work on RNN retrieval. Givena data set P; an obstacle set O; and a query point q in a 2D space; an ORNN query finds allthe points/objects in P that have q as their nearest neighbor; according to the obstructeddistance metric; ie; the length of the shortest path between two points without crossing anyobstacle. We formalize ORNN search; develop effective pruning heuristics (via introducing anovel boundary region concept); and propose efficient algorithms for ORNN queryprocessing; assuming that both P and O are indexed by traditional data-partitioning indexes(eg; R-trees).

Should we use the sample? Analyzing datasets sampled from Twitter’s stream API,Yazhe Wang; Jamie Callan; Baihua Zheng,Abstract Researchers have begun studying content obtained from microblogging servicessuch as Twitter to address a variety of technological; social; and commercial researchquestions. The large number of Twitter users and even larger volume of tweets often make itimpractical to collect and maintain a complete record of activity; therefore; most research andsome commercial software applications rely on samples; often relatively small samples; ofTwitter data. For the most part; sample sizes have been based on availability and practicalconsiderations. Relatively little attention has been paid to how well these samples representthe underlying stream of Twitter data. To fill this gap; this article performs a comparativeanalysis on samples obtained from two of Twitter's streaming APIs with a more completeTwitter dataset to gain an in-depth understanding of the nature of Twitter data samples …,ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB),2015,15
On processing reverse k-skyband and ranked reverse skyline queries,Yunjun Gao; Qing Liu; Baihua Zheng; Li Mou; Gang Chen; Qing Li,Abstract In this paper; for the first time; we identify and solve the problem of efficient reversek-skyband (RkSB) query processing. Given a set P of multi-dimensional points and a querypoint q; an RkSB query returns all the points in P whose dynamic k-skyband contains q. Weformalize RkSB retrieval; and then propose five algorithms for computing the RkSB of anarbitrary query point efficiently. Our methods utilize a conventional data-partitioning index(eg; R-tree) on the dataset; and employ pre-computation; reuse and pruning techniques toboost the query efficiency. In addition; we extend our solutions to tackle an interestingvariant of reverse skyline queries; namely; ranked reverse skyline (RRS) query where; givena data set P; a parameter K; and a preference function f; the goal is to find the K reverseskyline points that have the minimal score according to the user-specified function f …,Information Sciences,2015,15
Processing transitive nearest-neighbor queries in multi-channel access environments,Xiao Zhang; Wang-Chien Lee; Prasenjit Mitra; Baihua Zheng,Abstract Wireless broadcast is an efficient way for information dissemination due to its goodscalability [10]. Existing works typically assume mobile devices; such as cell phones andPDAs; can access only one channel at a time. In this paper; we consider a scenario of nearfuture where a mobile device has the ability to process queries using informationsimultaneously received from multiple channels. We focus on the query processing of thetransitive nearest neighbor (TNN) search [19]. Two TNN algorithms developed for a singlebroadcast channel environment are adapted to our new broadcast enviroment. Based on theobtained insights; we propose two new algorithms; namely Double-NN-Search and Hybrid-NN-Search algorithms. Further; we develop an optimization technique; called approximate-NN (ANN); to reduce the energy consumption in mobile devices.

Tracking nearest surrounders in moving object environments,Ken CK Lee; Josh Schiffman; Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee; Hong Va Leong,This paper presents a system framework to support continuous nearest surrounder (NS)queries in moving object environments. NS query finds the nearest objects at individualdistinct angles from a query point. This query distinguishes itself from other conventionalspatial queries such as range queries and nearest neighbor queries by considering bothdistance and angular aspects of objects with respect to a query point. One of NS queryapplications is to monitor the nearest objects around an observation point. In our framework;a centralized server is dedicated to collect object location updates; to determine affected NSqueries of each object location update; to compute the incremental result change of affectedqueries and to deliver result updates to corresponding interested users/applications thatinitiate the queries. In particular; we propose algorithms namely; safe region formation …,Pervasive Services; 2006 ACS/IEEE International Conference on,2006,15
Caching complementary space for location-based services,Ken CK Lee; Wang-Chien Lee; Baihua Zheng; Jianliang Xu,Abstract In this paper; we propose a novel client-side; multi-granularity caching scheme;called “Complementary Space Caching”(CS caching); for location-based services in mobileenvironments. Different from conventional data caching schemes that only cache a portion ofdataset; CS caching maintains a global view of the whole dataset. Different portions of thisview are cached in varied granularity based on the probabilities of being accessed in thefuture queries. The data objects with very high access probabilities are cached in the finestgranularity; ie; the data objects themselves. The data objects which are less likely to beaccessed in the near future are abstracted and logically cached in the form ofcomplementary regions (CRs) in a coarse granularity. CS caching naturally supports alltypes of location-based queries. In this paper; we explore several design and system …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,15
Research challenges in information access and dissemination in a mobile environment,Jianliang Xu; Baihua Zheng; Manli Zhu; Dik Lun Lee,ABSTRACT A wireless environment has both benefits and limitations when it is used as amedium for information access and dissemination. In a wireless environment; we can accessto not only information anytime and anywhere as if we were connected to the Internet butinformation tailored to our particular needs depending on where we are located. This leadsto location-dependent information services (eg; querying for local traffic; restaurants; etc.).The capability of the system is also enhanced by the fact that genuine broadcast (asopposed to multicast) can be realized in a wireless environment; making massive broadcastof commonly requested data a simple and inexpensive task. On the other hand; we have toovercome a lot of limitations such as the limited bandwidth; high-cost of data transmission(both in terms of power consumption on the client devices and system bandwidth).

Efficient index-based approaches for skyline queries in location-based applications,Ken CK Lee; Baihua Zheng; Cindy Chen; Chi-Yin Chow,Enriching many location-based applications; various new skyline queries are proposed andformulated based on the notion of locational dominance; which extends conventional one bytaking objects' nearness to query positions into account additional to objects' nonspatialattributes. To answer a representative class of skyline queries for location-basedapplications efficiently; this paper presents two index-based approaches; namely;augmented R-tree and dominance diagram. Augmented R-tree extends R-tree by includingaggregated nonspatial attributes in index nodes to enable dominance checks during indextraversal. Dominance diagram is a solution-based approach; by which each object isassociated with a precomputed nondominance scope wherein query points should have thecorresponding object not locationally dominated by any other.

This type of queries considers proximity of q to the trajectoriesand the proximity of the trajectories to q; which is useful in many applications (eg; decisionmaking; data mining; pattern recognition; etc.). In this paper; we first formalize MNN queryand identify some problem characteristics; and then develop two algorithms to process MNNqueries efficiently.

CLAIM: An efficient method for relaxed frequent closed itemsets mining over stream data,Guojie Song; Dongqing Yang; Bin Cui; Baihua Zheng; Yunfeng Liu; Kunqing Xie,Abstract Recently; frequent itemsets mining over data streams attracted much attention.However; mining closed itemsets from data stream has not been well addressed. The maindifficulty lies in its high complexity of maintenance aroused by the exact model definition ofclosed itemsets and the dynamic changing of data streams. In data stream scenario; it issufficient to mining only approximated frequent closed itemsets instead of in full precision.Such a compact but close-enough frequent itemset is called a relaxed frequent closeditemsets. In this paper; we first introduce the concept of RC (Relaxed frequent ClosedItemsets); which is the generalized form of approximation.

An automaton-based index scheme for on-demand XML data broadcast,Weiwei Sun; Peng Liu; Jingjing Wu; Yongrui Qin; Baihua Zheng,Abstract XML data broadcast is an efficient way to deliver semi-structured information inwireless mobile environment. In the literature; many approaches have been proposed toimprove the performance of XML data broadcast. However; due to the appearance ofwildcard”*” and double slash”//” in queries; their performance deteriorates. Consequently; inthis paper; we propose a novel air indexing method called Deterministic Finite Automaton-based Index (abbreviated as DFAI) on the XPath queries. Different from existing approacheswhich build index based on XML documents; we propose to build the index based on thequeries submitted by users. The new index treating the XPath queries with”*” or”//” as a DFAactually improves the efficiency of broadcast system significantly. We further propose anefficient compression strategy to reduce the index size of DFAI as well. Experiment results …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2012,11
Utility-oriented k-anonymization on social networks,Yazhe Wang; Long Xie; Baihua Zheng; Ken CK Lee,Abstract “Identity disclosure” problem on publishing social network data has gainedintensive focus from academia. Existing k-anonymization algorithms on social network mayresult in nontrivial utility loss. The reason is that the number of the edges modified whenanonymizing the social network is the only metric to evaluate utility loss; not considering thefact that different edge modifications have different impact on the network structure. To tacklethis issue; we propose a novel utility-oriented social network anonymization scheme toachieve privacy protection with relatively low utility loss. First; a proper utility evaluationmodel is proposed. It focuses on the changes on social network topological feature; but notpurely the number of edge modifications. Second; an efficient algorithm is designed toanonymize a given social network with relatively low utility loss.

Owing to scarce wireless channel bandwidth and limited clientbattery life; frequent LDSQ submission from clients must be avoided. Observing that LDSQsissued from a client located at nearby positions would likely return the same query results;we explore the idea of valid scope; which represents a spatial area in which a set of LDSQswill retrieve exactly the same set of query results. With a valid scope derived and an LDSQresult cached; a client can assert whether the new LDSQs can be answered with themaintained LDSQ result; thus eliminating the need of sending LDSQs to the server.Contention on the wireless channel and client energy consumed for data transmission …,Journal of Software,2010,11

Accelerating sequence searching: dimensionality reduction method,Guojie Song; Bin Cui; Baihua Zheng; Kunqing Xie; Dongqing Yang,Abstract Similarity search over long sequence dataset becomes increasingly popular inmany emerging applications; such as text retrieval; genetic sequences exploring; etc. In thispaper; a novel index structure; namely Sequence Embedding Multiset tree (SEM− tree); hasbeen proposed to speed up the searching process over long sequences. The SEM-tree is amulti-level structure where each level represents the sequence data with differentcompression level of multiset; and the length of multiset increases towards the leaf levelwhich contains original sequences. The multisets; obtained using sequence embeddingalgorithms; have the desirable property that they do not need to keep the character order inthe sequence; ie shorter representation; but can reserve the majority of distance informationof sequences.

Materialized in-network view for spatial aggregation queries in wireless sensor network,Ken CK Lee; Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee; Julian Winter,Abstract Wireless sensor networks composed of battery-powered sensor nodes areinvaluable instruments for remote environment sensing. For sensor network applications;sensed readings are often collected in the form of aggregated data from a portion of asensor network as requested by spatial aggregation queries. In a large distributed sensornetwork; queries can be issued from various locations at any time. Existing in-network queryexecution techniques execute queries independently that considerably overconsumes theprecious energy of sensor nodes. As a result; the lifespan of a sensor network is inevitablyshortened. In this paper; we propose a Materialized In-Network View (MINV) framework thatprecalculates aggregated data from clusters of sensor nodes as intermediate query resultspreserved in the network and made ready for queries.

Valid scope computation for location-dependent spatial query in mobile broadcast environments,Ken CK Lee; Josh Schiffman; Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract Wireless data broadcast is an efficient and scalable means to provide informationaccess for a large population of clients in mobile environments. With Location-BasedServices (LBSs) deployed upon a broadcast channel; mobile clients can collect data fromthe channel to answer their location-dependent spatial queries (LDSQs). Since the results ofLDSQs would become invalid when mobile client moves to new locations; the knowledge ofvalid scopes for LDSQ results is necessary to assist clients to determine if their previousLDSQ results can be reused after they moved. This effectively improves query response timeand client energy consumption. In this paper; we devise efficient algorithms to determinevalid scopes for various LDSQs including range; window and nearest neighbor queriesalong with LDSQ processing over a broadcast channel.

CS cache engine: data access accelerator for location-based service in mobile environments,Ken CK Lee; Wang-Chien Lee; Julian Winter; Baihua Zheng; Jianliang Xu,Abstract Location-based services (LBS) have emerged as one of the killer applications formobile and pervasive computing environments. Due to limited bandwidth and scarce clientresources; client-side data caching plays an important role of enhancing the data availabilityand improving the response time. In this demonstration; we present CS Cache Enginesuitable for LBS. The underlying caching model is Complementary Space Caching (CScaching) scheme that we have recently presented in [citation].

Top-k Dominating Queries on Incomplete Data,Xiaoye Miao; Yunjun Gao; Baihua Zheng; Gang Chen; Huiyong Cui,The top-k dominating (TKD) query returns the k objects that dominate the maximum numberof objects in a given dataset. It combines the advantages of skyline and top-k queries; andplays an important role in many decision support applications. Incomplete data exists in awide spectrum of real datasets; due to device failure; privacy preservation; data loss; and soon. In this paper; for the first time; we carry out a systematic study of TKD queries onincomplete data; which involves the data having some missing dimensional value (s).

In this paper; we study issues on the dissemination ofspatial data and valid scopes in a wireless environment. We investigate methods forrepresenting valid scopes and their impacts on system performance.

Round-Eye: A system for tracking nearest surrounders in moving object environments,Ken CK Lee; Josh Schiffman; Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee; Hong Va Leong,Abstract This paper presents “Round-Eye”; a system for tracking nearest surrounding objects(or nearest surrounders) in moving object environments. This system provides a platform forsurveillance applications. The core part of this system is continuous nearest surrounder (NS)query that maintains views of the nearest objects at distinct angles from query points. Thisquery differs from conventional spatial queries such as range queries and nearest neighborqueries as NS query considers both distance and angular aspects of objects with respect toa query point at the same time. In our system framework; a centralized server is dedicated(1) to collect location updates of both objects and queries;(2) to determine which NS queriesare invalidated in presence of object/query location changes and corresponding resultchanges if any; and (3) to refresh the affected query answers. To enhance the system …,Journal of Systems and Software,2007,7
Transitive nearest neighbor search in mobile environments,Baihua Zheng; Ken CK Lee; W-C Lee,Given a query point p; typically the position of a current client; and two datasets S and R; atransitive nearest neighbor (TNN) search returns a pair of objects (s; r) isinStimesR such thatthe total distance from p to s and then to r; ie; dis (p; s)+ dis (s; r); is minimum. We proposevarious algorithms for supporting TNN search as a kind of location-based services in both on-demand-based and broadcast-based mobile environments. In addition; we develop a novelvalidation algorithm that allows the clients to verify whether their TNN query answers are stillvalid after they moved to new positions. Finally; we conduct a comprehensive simulation toevaluate performance of the proposed TNN search algorithms,Sensor Networks; Ubiquitous; and Trustworthy Computing; 2006.

Negative Factor: Improving Regular-Expression Matching in Strings,Xiaochun Yang; Tao Qiu; Bin Wang; Baihua Zheng; Yaoshu Wang; Chen Li,Abstract The problem of finding matches of a regular expression (RE) on a string exists inmany applications; such as text editing; biosequence search; and shell commands. Existingtechniques first identify candidates using substrings in the RE; then verify each of them usingan automaton. These techniques become inefficient when there are many candidateoccurrences that need to be verified. In this article; we propose a novel technique thatprunes false negatives by utilizing negative factors; which are substrings that cannot appearin an answer. A main advantage of the technique is that it can be integrated with manyexisting algorithms to improve their efficiency significantly. We present a detailed descriptionof this technique. We develop an efficient algorithm that utilizes negative factors to prunecandidates; then improve it by using bit operations to process negative factors in parallel …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2016,6
Preserving privacy in social networks against connection fingerprint attacks,Yazhe Wang; Baihua Zheng,Existing works on identity privacy protection on social networks make the assumption that allthe user identities in a social network are private and ignore the fact that in many real-worldsocial networks; there exists a considerable amount of users such as celebrities; mediausers; and organization users whose identities are public.

A fully distributed spatial index for wireless data broadcast,Wang-Chien Lee; Baihua Zheng,To support location-based services in wireless data broadcast systems; a distributed spatialindex (called DSI) is proposed in this paper. DSI is highly efficient because it has a linear yetfully distributed structure that naturally facilitates multiple replications of the index by sharinglinks in different search trees. Search algorithms for point queries; window queries; and kNNqueries; based on DSI are presented. Empirical evaluation of DSI are conducted. Resultshows that DSI significantly out-performs R-tree and Hilbert curve index; two state-of-the-artspatial indexing techniques for wireless data broadcast.,21st International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE'05),2005,6
SAP: Improving Continuous Top-K Queries Over Streaming Data,Rui Zhu; Bin Wang; Xiaochun Yang; Baihua Zheng; Guoren Wang,Continuous top-k query over streaming data is a fundamental problem in database. In thispaper; we focus on the sliding window scenario; where a continuous top-k query returns thetop-k objects within each query window on the data stream. Existing algorithms support thistype of queries via incrementally maintaining a subset of objects in the window and try toretrieve the answer from this subset as much as possible whenever the window slides.However; since all the existing algorithms are sensitive to query parameters and datadistribution; they all suffer from expensive incremental maintenance cost. In this paper; wepropose a self-adaptive partition framework to support continuous top-k query. It partitionsthe window into sub-windows and only maintains a small number of candidates with highestscores in each sub-window. Based on this framework; we have developed several …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,5
Processing incomplete k nearest neighbor search,Xiaoye Miao; Yunjun Gao; Gang Chen; Baihua Zheng; Huiyong Cui,Given a setS of multidimensional objects and a query object q; ak nearest neighbor (kNN)query finds from S the k closest objects to q. This query is a fundamental problem indatabase; data mining; and information retrieval research. It plays an important role in awide spectrum of real applications such as image recognition and location-based services.However; due to the failure of data transmission devices; improper storage; and accidentalloss; incomplete data exist widely in those applications; where some dimensional values ofdata items are missing. In this paper; we systematically study incomplete k nearest neighbor(IkNN) search; which aims at the kNN query for incomplete data.

Is only one gps position sufficient to locate you to the road network accurately?,Hao Wu; Weiwei Sun; Baihua Zheng,Abstract Locating only one GPS position to a road segment accurately is crucial to manylocation-based services such as mobile taxi-hailing service; geo-tagging; POI check-in; etc.This problem is challenging because of errors including the GPS errors and the digital maperrors (misalignment and the same representation of bidirectional roads) and a lack ofcontext information. To the best of our knowledge; no existing work studies this problemdirectly and the work to reduce GPS signal errors by considering hardware aspect is themost relevant. Consequently; this work is the first attempt to solve the problem of locatingone GPS position to a road segment. We study the problem in a data-driven view to makethis process ubiquitous by proposing a tractable; efficient and robust generative model.

An incremental approach to closest pair queries in spatial networks using best-first search,Chunan Chen; Weiwei Sun; Baihua Zheng; Dingding Mao; Weimo Liu,Abstract This paper addresses the problem of k Closest Pairs (kCP) query in spatial networkdatabases. A Best-First search approach namely BFCP (Best-First Closest Pair) is proposed.Given two data sets of objects in a spatial network; BFCP first finds the 1st CP by computingthe 1st NN (nearest neighbor) of each object in the set with smaller cardinality. Then BFCPretrieves the 2nd; 3rd;…; kth CP in an incremental way by searching the next NN of thecurrently found CP's source point. Furthermore; a novel buffer replacement policy calledMDU (Minimum Distance Unit) is proposed to reduce I/O cost of BFCP. Unlike LRU; whichrecords only the last reference time; the MDU policy considers both temporal locality andspatial locality when selecting a buffer page as the victim. A comprehensive experimentalstudy is conducted to demonstrate the advantage of BFCP and MDU.,*,2011,5
OPAQUE: protecting path privacy in directions search,Ken CK Lee; Wang-Chien Lee; Hong Va Leong; Baihua Zheng,Directions search returns the shortest path from a source to a destination on a road network.However; the search interests of users may be exposed to the service providers; thus raisingprivacy concerns. For instance; a path query that finds a path from a resident address to aclinic may lead to a deduction about" who is related to what disease". To protect user privacyfrom accessing directions search services; we introduce the OPAQUE system; whichconsists of two major components:(1) an obfuscator that formulates obfuscated path queriesby mixing true and fake sources/destinations; and (2) an obfuscated path query processorinstalled in the server for obfuscated path query processing. OPAQUE reduces the likelihoodof path queries being revealed and allows retrieval of requested paths. We propose twotypes of obfuscated path queries; namely; independently obfuscated path query and …,2009 IEEE 25th International Conference on Data Engineering,2009,5
On efficient k-optimal-location-selection query processing in metric spaces,Yunjun Gao; Shuyao Qi; Lu Chen; Baihua Zheng; Xinhan Li,Abstract This paper studies the problem of k-optimal-location-selection (kOLS) retrieval inmetric spaces. Given a set DA of customers; a set DB of locations; a constrained region R;and a critical distance dc; a metric kOLS (MkOLS) query retrieves k locations in DB that areoutside R but have the maximal optimality scores. Here; the optimality score of a location l∈DB located outside R is defined as the number of the customers in DA that are inside R andmeanwhile have their distances to l bounded by dc according to a certain similarity metric(eg; L 1-norm; L 2-norm; etc.). The existing kOLS methods are not sufficient because theyare applicable only to the Euclidean space; and are not sensitive to k. In this paper; for thefirst time; we present an efficient algorithm for kOLS query processing in metric spaces. Oursolution employs metric index structures (ie; M-trees) on the datasets; enables several …,Information Sciences,2015,4
Location-dependent spatial query containment,Ken CK Lee; Brandon Unger; Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee,Abstract Nowadays; location-related information is highly accessible to mobile users viaissuing Location-Dependent Spatial Queries (LDSQs) with respect to their locationswirelessly to Location-Based Service (LBS) servers. Due to the limited mobile device batteryenergy; scarce wireless bandwidth; and heavy LBS server workload; the number of LDSQssubmitted over wireless channels to LBS servers for evaluation should be minimized asappropriate. In this paper; we exploit query containment techniques for LDSQs (called LDSQcontainment) to enable mobile clients to determine whether the result of a new LDSQ Q′ iscompletely covered by that of another LDSQ Q previously answered by a server (denoted byQ′⊆ Q) and to answer Q′ locally if Q′⊆ Q. Thus; many LDSQs can be reduced fromserver evaluation. To support LDSQ containment; we propose a notion of containment …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2011,4

An automaton-based index scheme supporting twig queries for on-demand XML data broadcast,Peng Liu; Weiwei Sun; Jian Zhang; Baihua Zheng,Abstract XML data broadcast is an efficient way to deliver semi-structured information in awireless mobile environment. In the literature; many approaches have been proposed todisseminate XML data via wireless broadcast. However; because of the existence of “*” and“//” in queries; their performance deteriorates. In this paper; we propose a novel indexingmethod called Deterministic Finite Automaton-based Index (abbreviated as DFAI) on theXPath queries. Different from existing approaches which build index based on XMLdocuments; DFAI is built based on the submitted queries. The new index treats the XPathqueries as a DFA and it improves the efficiency of broadcast systems significantly. We furtherpropose a compression strategy to reduce the index size of DFAI as well. Besides; as anextension; we extend the DFAI to support twig queries. Experiment results show that our …,Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing,2015,3
Indexing Metric Uncertain Data for Range Queries,Lu Chen; Yunjun Gao; Xinhan Li; Christian S Jensen; Gang Chen; Baihua Zheng,Abstract Range queries in metric spaces have applications in many areas such asmultimedia retrieval; computational biology; and location-based services; where metricuncertain data exists in different forms; resulting from equipment limitations; high-throughputsequencing technologies; privacy preservation; or others. In this paper; we represent metricuncertain data by using an object-level model and a bi-level model; respectively. Two novelindexes; the uncertain pivot B+-tree (UPB-tree) and the uncertain pivot B+-forest (UPB-forest); are proposed accordingly in order to support probabilistic range queries wrt a widerange of uncertain data types and similarity metrics. Both index structures use a small set ofeffective pivots chosen based on a newly defined criterion; and employ the B+-tree (s) as theunderlying index. By design; they are easy to be integrated into any existing DBMS. In …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,3
Data access techniques for location-based services,Jianliang Xu; Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee,Location based service (LBS) is emerging as a killer application in mobile data servicesthanks to the rapid development in wireless communication and location positioningtechnologies. Users with location-aware wireless devices can query about theirsurroundings (eg; finding the nearest Japanese restaurant or all shopping malls within 5miles) at any place; anytime. While this ubiquitous computing paradigm brings greatconvenience for information access; the constraints of mobile environments; the spatialproperty of location-dependent data; and the mobility of mobile users pose a great challengefor the provision of location-based services to mobile users. This seminar will provide anoverview of research issues arising from accessing of location-based services in a mobilecomputing environment and discuss the state-of-theart solutions.,7th International Conference on Mobile Data Management (MDM'06),2006,3

Answering why-not and why questions on reverse top-k queries,Qing Liu; Yunjun Gao; Gang Chen; Baihua Zheng; Linlin Zhou,Abstract Why-not and why questions can be posed by database users to seek clarificationson unexpected query results. Specifically; why-not questions aim to explain why certainexpected tuples are absent from the query results; while why questions try to clarify whycertain unexpected tuples are present in the query results.

Finding Causality and Responsibility for Probabilistic Reverse Skyline Query Non-Answers,Yunjun Gao; Qing Liu; Gang Chen; Linlin Zhou; Baihua Zheng,Causality and responsibility is an essential tool in the database community for providingintuitive explanations for answers/non-answers to queries. Causality denotes the causes forthe answers/non-answers to queries; and responsibility represents the degree of a causewhich reflects its influence on the answers/non-answers to queries. In this paper; we studythe causality and responsibility problem (CRP) for the non-answers to probabilistic reverseskyline queries (PRSQ). We first formalize CRP on PRSQ; and then; we propose an efficientalgorithm termed as CP to compute the causality and responsibility for the non-answers toPRSQ. CP first finds candidate causes; and then; it performs verification to obtain actualcauses with their responsibilities; during which several strategies are used to boostefficiency. Further; we explore the CRP for the non-answers to reverse skyline queries …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,2

Unsupervised analysis of top-k core members in poly-relational networks,Hao Huang; Yunjun Gao; Kevin Chiew; Qinming He; Baihua Zheng,Abstract Poly-relational networks such as social networks are prevalent in the real world.The existing research on poly-relational networks focuses on community detection; aiming tofind a global partition of nodes across relations. However; in some real cases; users may benot interested in such a global partition. For example; commercial analysts often care moreabout the top-k core members in business competitions; and relations among them that aremore important to their competitions. Motivated by this; in this paper; we investigate anunsupervised analysis of the top-k core members in a poly-relational network and identifytwo complementary tasks; namely (1) detection of the top-k core members that are mosttightly connected by relevant relations; and (2) identification of the relevant relations viaanalysis on the importance of each relation to the formation of the top-k core members …,Expert Systems with Applications,2014,2

Challenges in managing and mining large; heterogeneous data,Haibo Hu; Haixun Wang; Baihua Zheng,Abstract Success in various application domains including sensor networks; social networks;and multimedia; has ushered in a new era of information explosion. Despite the diversity ofthese domains; data acquired by applications in these domains are often voluminous;heterogeneous and containing much uncertainty. They share several commoncharacteristics; which impose new challenges to storing; integrating; and processing thesedata; especially in the context of data outsourcing and cloud computing. Some challengesinclude the following. First; autonomous data acquisition gives rise to privacy and securityissues. Therefore; data management and mining must be elastic and privacy-conscious.Second; data is often dynamic and the trend in the data is often unpredictable.

Disqo: A distributed framework for spatial queries over moving objects,Baihua Zheng; Wang-Chien Lee; Ken CK Lee; Julian Winter; Meng-Chang Chen,This paper presents DISQO; a DIStributed Framework for Spatial Queries over MovingObjects. Distinguished from existing work; DISQO aims at achieving high scalability andsystem performance in support of both snapshot and continuous spatial queries over movingobjects. The design of DISQO is based on our observation that exchanging object locationinformation and query information between the location server and moving objects canreduce communication cost and facilitate scalable query processing. Thus; DISQO is builtupon the notions of roaming regions and query maps in correspondence with object locationinformation and query information.

Squeezing long sequence data for efficient similarity search,Guojie Song; Bin Cui; Baihua Zheng; Kunqing Xie; Dongqing Yang,Abstract Similarity search over long sequence dataset becomes increasingly popular inmany emerging applications. In this paper; a novel index structure; namely SequenceEmbedding Multiset tree (SEM-tree); has been proposed to speed up the searching processover long sequences. The SEM-tree is a multi-level structure where each level representsthe sequence data with different compression level of multiset; and the length of multisetincreases towards the leaf level which contains original sequences. The multisets; obtainedusing sequence embedding algorithms; have the desirable property that they do not need tokeep the character order in the sequence; ie shorter representation; but can reserve themajority of distance information of sequences. Each level of the tree serves to prune thesearch space more efficiently as the multisets utilize the predicability to finish the …,Progress in WWW Research and Development,2008,2
Secure real-time user preference collection for broadcast scheduling,Xuhua Ding; Shuhong Wang; Baihua Zheng,Efficient broadcast scheduling is essential to the performance of wireless data broadcastsystems. Existing algorithms for broadcast scheduling are mostly based on the knowledge ofusers' data access pattern. Unfortunately; the requirement of exposing individual preferenceprofile becomes a serious threat to user privacy. In this paper; we investigate the issue ofsecurely collecting user access patterns in real-time for broadcast scheduling. We propose anovel secure user profile collection protocol which protects the privacy of individual users yetfacilitates efficient wireless data broadcast scheduling. To address the crucial issue of powerconservation in mobile devices; our scheme does not rely on expensive public keycryptography. Light computation and communication at the user end makes the schemefeasible for mobile devices with limited resource. Our theoretical security analysis shows …,Securecomm and Workshops; 2006,2006,2
Balancing performance and confidentiality in air index,Qingzhao Tan; Wang-Chien Lee; Baihua Zheng; Peng Liu; Dik Lun Lee,Abstract Studies on the performance issues (ie; access latency and energy conservation) ofwireless data broadcast have appeared in the literature. However; the important securityissues have not been well addressed. This paper investigates the tradeoff betweenperformance and security of signature-based air index schemes in wireless data broadcast.From the performance perspective; keeping low false drop probability helps clients retrievethe information from a broadcast channel efficiently. Meanwhile; from the securityperspective; achieving high false guess probability prevents the hacker from guessing theinformation easily. There is a tradeoff between these two aspects. An administrator of thewireless broadcast system may balance this tradeoff by carefully configuring the signaturesused in broadcast. This study provides a guidance for parameter settings of the signature …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2005,2
Pivot-based metric indexing,Lu Chen; Yunjun Gao; Baihua Zheng; Christian S Jensen; Hanyu Yang; Keyu Yang,Abstract The general notion of a metric space encompasses a diverse range of data typesand accompanying similarity measures. Hence; metric search plays an important role in awide range of settings; including multimedia retrieval; data mining; and data integration. Withthe aim of accelerating metric search; a collection of pivot-based indexing techniques formetric data has been proposed; which reduces the number of potentially expensivesimilarity comparisons by exploiting the triangle inequality for pruning and validation.However; no comprehensive empirical study of those techniques exists. Existing studieseach offers only a narrower coverage; and they use different pivot selection strategies thataffect performance substantially and thus render cross-study comparisons difficult orimpossible.

Modeling trajectories with recurrent neural networks,Hao Wu; Ziyang Chen; Weiwei Sun; Baihua Zheng; Wei Wang,Abstract Modeling trajectory data is a building block for many smart-mobility initiatives.Existing approaches apply shallow models such as Markov chain and inverse reinforcementlearning to model trajectories; which cannot capture the long-term dependencies. On theother hand; deep models such as Recurrent NeuralNetwork (RNN) have demonstrated theirstrength of modeling variable length sequences. However; directly adopting RNN to modeltrajectories is not appropriate because of the unique topological constraints faced bytrajectories. Motivated by these findings; we design two RNN-based models which can makefull advantage of the strength of RNN to capture variable length sequence and meanwhile toaddress the constraints of topo-logical structure on trajectory modeling.

Hypergraph index: an index for context-aware nearest neighbor query on social networks,Yazhe Wang; Baihua Zheng,Abstract Social network has been touted as the No. 2 innovation in a recent IEEE SpectrumSpecial Report on “Top 11 Technologies of the Decade”; and it has cemented its status as abona fide Internet phenomenon. With more and more people starting using social networksto share ideas; activities; events; and interests with other members within the network; socialnetworks contain a huge amount of content. However; it might not be easy to navigate socialnetworks to find specific information.

Non-determinism can arise when;for example; paths are determined by relative processor speed or the sequence of externalevents. Such software bugs have been called ''Heisenbugs''(hard failures being ''Bohrbugs'').2. Soft hardware failures: Hardware can also suffer from ''Heisenbugs.''For example; atransient hardware failure may be triggered by an environmental cause; such as a cosmicray changing a memory bit; etc. 3. Operator failures: Systems occasionally require operatorintervention. Operators; being human; make mistakes. An operator is unlikely to make thesame mistake at the same point in a subsequent execution.,*,2009,1

Such a representation contains large number ofduplicate information to achieve a lower entropy compared with the existing representations;thereby drastically cutting the storage cost. We propose several techniques to compressspatial path and locations separately; which can support fast positioning and achieve bettercompression ratio. For locations; we propose two novel encoding schemes such that thebinary code can preserve distance information; which is very helpful for\mbox {LBS}applications.

Most existing works studythe problem on general Euclidean trajectories and require accesses to the historicaltrajectory database or computations on the distance metric that are very expensive.Furthermore; few of existing works consider some specific characteristics of vehiclestrajectories (eg; their movements are constrained by the underlying road networks); andmajority of them require the input of complete trajectories. Motivated by this; we propose a …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2017,*
CLSTERS: A General System for Reducing Errors of Trajectories Under Challenging Localization Situations,Hao Wu; Weiwei Sun; Baihua Zheng; Li Yang; Wei Zhou,Abstract Trajectory data generated by outdoor activities have great potential for locationbased services. However; depending on the localization technique used; certain trajectorydata could contain large errors. For example; the error of trajectories generated by cellular-based localization techniques is around 100m which is ten times larger than that of GPS-based trajectories. Hence; enhancing the utility of those large-error trajectories becomes achallenge. In this paper we show how to improve the quality of trajectory data having largeerrors. Some existing works reduce the error through hardware which requires informationsuch as the time of arrival (TOA); received signal strength indication (RSSI); the position ofcell towers; etc. Moreover; different positioning techniques will result in different hardware-based solutions and different data formats; which limit the generalizablity.

Indexing metric uncertain data for range queries and range joins,Lu Chen; Yunjun Gao; Aoxiao Zhong; Christian S Jensen; Gang Chen; Baihua Zheng,Abstract Range queries and range joins in metric spaces have applications in many areas;including GIS; computational biology; and data integration; where metric uncertain data existin different forms; resulting from circumstances such as equipment limitations; high-throughput sequencing technologies; and privacy preservation. We represent metricuncertain data by using an object-level model and a bi-level model; respectively. Two novelindexes; the uncertain pivot B^++-tree (UPB-tree) and the uncertain pivot B^++-forest (UPB-forest); are proposed in order to support probabilistic range queries and range joins for awide range of uncertain data types and similarity metrics. Both index structures use a smallset of effective pivots chosen based on a newly defined criterion and employ the B^++-tree(s) as the underlying index. In addition; we present efficient metric probabilistic range …,The VLDB Journal,2017,*
Metric Similarity Joins Using MapReduce,Gang Chen; Keyu Yang; Lu Chen; Yunjun Gao; Baihua Zheng; Chun Chen,Given two object sets Q and O; a metric similarity join finds similar object pairs according to acertain criterion. This operation has a wide variety of applications in data cleaning and datamining; to name but a few. However; the rapidly growing volume of data nowadayschallenges traditional metric similarity join methods; and thus; a distributed method isrequired. In this paper; we adopt a popular distributed framework; namely; MapReduce; tosupport scalable metric similarity joins. To ensure the load balancing; we present twosampling based partition methods. One utilizes the pivot and the space-filling curvemappings to cluster the data into one-dimensional space; and then selects high qualitycentroids to enable equal-sized partitions. The other uses the KD-tree partitioning techniqueto equally divide the data after the pivot mapping. To avoid unnecessary object pair …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,*
Exploring dynamic fan shapes for nearby traffic monitoring queries in road networks,Ting-Wei Lin; Baihua Zheng; Ling-Yin Wei; Wen-Chih Peng,Abstract In this paper; we first introduce the traffic status estimation service; a location-basedcontinuous range query application provided by the CarWeb system. The service providesusers nearby realtime traffic estimation according to their locations and moving behaviors.This paper focuses on how to provide users with the most relevant information efficiently andaccurately. We propose the Continuous Query with Dynamic Fan-Shape framework (CQ-DFS) which dynamically changes parameters of fan shape range query to efficiently acquiremore useful query results without compromising the performance of the system. We conductextensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of CQ-DFS framework by using realworld vehicle trajectories.,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2011,*
Context-aware nearest neighbor query on social networks,Yazhe Wang; Baihua Zheng,Abstract Social networking has grown rapidly over the last few years; and social networkscontain a huge amount of content. However; it can be not easy to navigate the socialnetworks to find specific information. In this paper; we define a new type of queries; namelycontext-aware nearest neighbor (CANN) search over social network to retrieve the nearestnode to the query node that matches the context specified. CANN considers both thestructure of the social network; and the profile information of the nodes. We design a hyper-graph based index structure to support approximated CANN search efficiently.,International Conference on Social Informatics,2011,*
ROAD: an efficient framework for location dependentspatial queries on road networks,Ken CK Lee; Wang-Chien Lee; Baihua Zheng,Abstract In this research; we develop ROAD; a system framework for processing locationdependent spatial queries (LDSQs) that search for spatial objects of interest on roadnetworks. By exploiting search space pruning; ROAD is very efficient and flexible for variousLDSQs on different types of objects over large-scale networks. In ROAD; a large roadnetwork is organized as a set of interconnected regional sub-networks (called Rnets)augmented with 1) shortcuts for accelerating search traversals; and 2) object abstracts forguiding object search. In this poster; we outline this framework and explain how it cansupport efficient location-dependent nearest neighbor search.,Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2008,*
Searching Correlated Objects in a Long Sequence,Ken CK Lee; Wang-Chien Lee; Donna Peuquet; Baihua Zheng,Abstract Sequence; widely appearing in various applications (eg event logs; text documents;etc) is an ordered list of objects. Exploring correlated objects in a sequence can provideuseful knowledge among the objects; eg; event causality in event log and word phrases indocuments. In this paper; we introduce correlation query that finds correlated pairs of objectsoften appearing closely to each other in a given sequence. A correlation query is specifiedby two control parameters; distance bound; the requirement of object closeness; andcorrelation threshold; the minimum requirement of correlation strength of result pairs. Insteadof processing the query by scanning the sequence multiple times; that is called Multi-ScanAlgorithm (MSA); we propose One-Scan Algorithm (OSA) and Index-Based Algorithm (IBA).OSA accesses a queried sequence once and IBA considers correlation threshold in the …,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2008,*

Mobile Cache Management,Jianliang Xu; Haibo Hu; Xueyan Tang; Baihua Zheng,Abstract This chapter introduces advanced client-side data-caching techniques to enhancethe performance of mobile data access. The authors address three mobile caching issues.The first is the necessitv of a cache replacement policv for realistic wirelessdatabroadcasting services. The authors present the Min-SAUD policy; which takes intoaccount the cost of ensuring cache consistency before each cached item is used. Next; theauthors discuss the caching issues for an emerging mobile data application; that is; location-dependent information services (LDISs). In particular; they consider data inconsistencycaused by client movements and describe several location-dependent cache invalidationschemes. Then; as the spatial property of LDISs also brings new challenges for cachereplacement policies; the authors present two novel cache replacement policies; called …,Wireless information highways,2005,*
Indexing of location-dependent data in mobile computing environments,Baihua Zheng,Abstract This thesis conducts research on advanced indexing techniques to improve theperformance of location-dependent information services (LDISs). For location-dependentdata (LDD); the validity of a data value is dependent on the location of the client retrievingthe data value. The retrieval of LDD requires the identification of the region that the client isresiding in; given a partition of the geographical space. For example; finding the name of thecity that the client is visiting requires identifying which city the client is located in given thecity boundaries of a country. D-tree is proposed to efficiently determine the target region byindexing the division of adjacent regions. Compared to the existing approximation methods;such as Minimal Bounding Rectangles (MBRs) in R-tree; D-tree does not index anyoverlapping region and therefore avoids back-tracking.

Efficient Valid Scope for Location-Dependent Spatial Queries in Mobile Environments.(2010),Ken CK LEE; Wang-Chien LEE; Hong Va LEONG; Brandon Unger; Baihua ZHENG,Abstract—In mobile environments; mobile clients can access information with respect to theirlocations by submitting Location-Dependent Spatial Queries (LDSQs) to Location-BasedService (LBS) servers. Owing to scarce wireless channel bandwidth and limited clientbattery life; frequent LDSQ submission from clients must be avoided. Observing that LDSQsissued from a client located at nearby positions would likely return the same query results;we explore the idea of valid scope; which represents a spatial area in which a set of LDSQswill retrieve exactly the same set of query results. With a valid scope derived and an LDSQresult cached; a client can assert whether the new LDSQs can be answered with themaintained LDSQ result; thus eliminating the need of sending LDSQs to the server.Contention on the wireless channel and client energy consumed for data transmission …,Journal of Software,*,*
