Efficient similarity joins for near-duplicate detection,Chuan Xiao; Wei Wang; Xuemin Lin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Guoren Wang,Abstract With the increasing amount of data and the need to integrate data from multipledata sources; one of the challenging issues is to identify near-duplicate records efficiently. Inthis article; we focus on efficient algorithms to find a pair of records such that their similaritiesare no less than a given threshold. Several existing algorithms rely on the prefix filteringprinciple to avoid computing similarity values for all possible pairs of records. We proposenew filtering techniques by exploiting the token ordering information; they are integrated intothe existing methods and drastically reduce the candidate sizes and hence improve theefficiency. We have also studied the implementation of our proposed algorithm in stand-alone and RDBMS-based settings. Experimental results show our proposed algorithms canoutperform previous algorithms on several real datasets.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2011,559
Graph clustering based on structural/attribute similarities,Yang Zhou; Hong Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract The goal of graph clustering is to partition vertices in a large graph into differentclusters based on various criteria such as vertex connectivity or neighborhood similarity.Graph clustering techniques are very useful for detecting densely connected groups in alarge graph. Many existing graph clustering methods mainly focus on the topologicalstructure for clustering; but largely ignore the vertex properties which are oftenheterogenous. In this paper; we propose a novel graph clustering algorithm; SA-Cluster;based on both structural and attribute similarities through a unified distance measure. Ourmethod partitions a large graph associated with attributes into k clusters so that each clustercontains a densely connected subgraph with homogeneous attribute values. An effectivemethod is proposed to automatically learn the degree of contributions of structural …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,540
-Holistic Twig Joins on Indexed XML Documents,Haifeng Jiang; Wei Wang; Hongjun Lu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,XML is emerging as a de facto standard for information exchange over the Internet. AlthoughXML documents could have rather complex internal structures; they can generally modeledas ordered trees. Finding all the occurrences of a twig pattern specified by a selectionpredicate on multiple elements in an XML document is a core operation for efficientevaluation of XML queries. Holistic twig join algorithms were proposed as an optimalsolution when the twig pattern only involves ancestor-descendant relationships. The chapteraddresses the problem of efficient processing of holistic twig joins on all/partly indexed XMLdocuments. It proposes an algorithm that utilizes available indices on element sets. While itcan be shown analytically that the proposed algorithm is as efficient as the existing state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of worst case I/O and CPU cost; experimental results on …,*,2003,404
Efficient computation of the skyline cube,Yidong Yuan; Xuemin Lin; Qing Liu; Wei Wang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Qing Zhang,Abstract Skyline has been proposed as an important operator for multi-criteria decisionmaking; data mining and visualization; and user-preference queries. In this paper. weconsider the problem of efficiently computing a SKYCUBE; which consists of skylines of allpossible non-empty subsets of a given set of dimensions. While existing skyline computationalgorithms can be immediately extended to computing each skyline query independently;such" shared-nothing" algorithms are inefficient. We develop several computation sharingstrategies based on effectively identifying the computation dependencies among multiplerelated skyline queries. Based on these sharing strategies; two novel algorithms; Bottom-Upand Top-Down algorithms; are proposed to compute SKYCUBE efficiently. Finally; ourextensive performance evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the sharing strategies. It is …,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,369
Parameter free bursty events detection in text streams,Gabriel Pui Cheong Fung; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Philip S Yu; Hongjun Lu,Abstract Text classification is a major data mining task. An advanced text classificationtechnique is known as partially supervised text classification; which can build a text classifierusing a small set of positive examples only. This leads to our curiosity whether it is possibleto find a set of features that can be used to describe the positive examples. Therefore; usersdo not even need to specify a set of positive examples. As the first step; in this paper; weformalize it as a new problem; called hot bursty events detection; to detect bursty events froma text stream which is a sequence of chronologically ordered documents. Here; a burstyevent is a set of bursty features; and is considered as a potential category to build a textclassifier. It is important to know that the hot bursty events detection problem; we study in thispaper; is different from TDT (topic detection and tracking) which attempts to cluster …,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,357

In this paper; we study processingan l-keyword query; p 1; p 1;...; pl; against a relational database which can be modeled as aweighted graph; G (V; E). Here V is a set of nodes (tuples) and E is a set of edgesrepresenting foreign key references between tuples. Let V i⊆ V be a set of nodes thatcontain the keyword p i. We study finding top-k minimum cost connected trees that contain atleast one node in every subset V i; and denote our problem as GST-k When k= 1; it is knownas a minimum cost group Steiner tree problem which is NP-complete.

Politician control; agency problems and ownership reform,Lixin Colin Xu; Tian Zhu; Yi‐min Lin,Abstract Using data from a recent national survey on the ownership reform of state-ownedenterprises in China; we study the effects of reducing politician control and agency problemson a number of reform outcomes. Taking into account the endogenous nature of the reform;we find that these outcome measures of the reform's success are positively affected by thelessening of politician control through increasing the firm's flexibility in labour deploymentand by the mitigation of agency costs through the introduction of more effective corporategovernance mechanisms such as one-share one-vote and shareholding-based boardstructure composition. Ownership structure also matters: relative to shareholding by thestate; foreign ownership has a positive effect on reform outcomes; individual (mostlyemployee) shareholding has a negative or insignificant effect.

Condensed cube: An effective approach to reducing data cube size,Wei Wang; Jianlin Feng; Hongjun Lu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Pre-computed data cube facilitates OLAP (on-line analytical processing). It is well-knownthat data cube computation is an expensive operation. While most algorithms have beendevoted to optimizing memory management and reducing computation costs; less work hasaddressed a fundamental issue: the size of a data cube is huge when a large base relationwith a large number of attributes is involved. In this paper; we propose a new concept; calleda condensed data cube. The condensed cube is of much smaller size than a complete non-condensed cube. More importantly; it is a fully pre-computed cube without compression;and; hence; it requires neither decompression nor further aggregation when answeringqueries. Several algorithms for computing a condensed cube are proposed. Results ofexperiments on the effectiveness of condensed data cube are presented; using both …,Data Engineering; 2002.

Dual labeling: Answering graph reachability queries in constant time,Haixun Wang; Hao He; Jun Yang; Philip S Yu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Graph reachability is fundamental to a wide range of applications; including XML indexing;geographic navigation; Internet routing; ontology queries based on RDF/OWL; etc. Manyapplications involve huge graphs and require fast answering of reachability queries. Severalreachability labeling methods have been proposed for this purpose. They assign labels tothe vertices; such that the reachability between any two vertices may be decided using theirlabels only. For sparse graphs; 2-hop based reachability labeling schemes answerreachability queries efficiently using relatively small label space. However; the labelingprocess itself is often too time consuming to be practical for large graphs. In this paper; wepropose a novel labeling scheme for sparse graphs. Our scheme ensures that graphreachability queries can be answered in constant time. Furthermore; for sparse graphs …,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06.

Taming verification hardness: an efficient algorithm for testing subgraph isomorphism,Haichuan Shang; Ying Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Graphs are widely used to model complicated data semantics in many applications.In this paper; we aim to develop efficient techniques to retrieve graphs; containing a givenquery graph; from a large set of graphs. Considering the problem of testing subgraphisomorphism is generally NP-hard; most of the existing techniques are based on theframework of filtering-and-verification to reduce the precise computation costs; consequentlyvarious novel feature-based indexes have been developed. While the existing techniqueswork well for small query graphs; the verification phase becomes a bottleneck when thequery graph size increases. Motivated by this; in the paper we firstly propose a novel andefficient algorithm for testing subgraph isomorphism; QuickSI. Secondly; we develop a newfeature-based index technique to accommodate QuickSI in the filtering phase. Our …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,232
Graph indexing: tree+ delta<= graph,Peixiang Zhao; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Philip S Yu,Abstract Recent scientific and technological advances have witnessed an abundance ofstructural patterns modeled as graphs. As a result; it is of special interest to process graphcontainment queries effectively on large graph databases. Given a graph database G; and aquery raph q; the graph containment query is to retrieve all graphs in G which contain q assubgraph (s). Due to the vast number of graphs in G and the nature of complexity forsubgraph isomorphism testing; it is desirable to make use of high-quality graph indexingmechanisms to reduce the overall query processing cost. In this paper; we propose a newcost-effective graph indexing method based on frequent tree-features of the graph database.We analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of tree as indexing feature from three criticalaspects: feature size; feature selection cost; and pruning power.

Semantics of ranking queries for probabilistic data and expected ranks,Graham Cormode; Feifei Li; Ke Yi,When dealing with massive quantities of data; top-k queries are a powerful technique forreturning only the k most relevant tuples for inspection; based on a scoring function. Theproblem of efficiently answering such ranking queries has been studied and analyzedextensively within traditional database settings. The importance of the top-k is perhaps evengreater in probabilistic databases; where a relation can encode exponentially many possibleworlds. There have been several recent attempts to propose definitions and algorithms forranking queries over probabilistic data. However; these all lack many of the intuitiveproperties of a top-k over deterministic data. Specifically; we define a number of fundamentalproperties; including exact-k; containment; unique-rank; value-invariance; and stability;which are all satisfied by ranking queries on certain data. We argue that all these …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,212
Finding time-dependent shortest paths over large graphs,Bolin Ding; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lu Qin,Abstract The spatial and temporal databases have been studied widely and intensively overyears. In this paper; we study how to answer queries of finding the best departure time thatminimizes the total travel time from a place to another; over a road network; where the trafficconditions dynamically change from time to time. We study a generalized form of thisproblem; called the time-dependent shortest-path problem. A time-dependent graph GT is agraph that has an edge-delay function; wi; j (t); associated with each edge (vi; vj); to bestored in a database. The edge-delay function wi; j (t) specifies how much time it takes totravel from node vi to node vj; if it departs from vi at time t.

False positive or false negative: Mining frequent itemsets from high speed transactional data streams,Jeffery Xu Yu; Zhihong Chong; Hongjun Lu; Aoying Zhou,Abstract The problem of finding frequent items has been recently studied over high speeddata streams. However; mining frequent itemsets from transactional data streams has notbeen well addressed yet in terms of its bounds of memory consumption. The main difficulty isdue to the nature of the exponential explosion of itemsets. Given a domain of I unique items;the possible number of itemsets can be up to 2 I-1. When the length of data streamsapproaches to a very large number N; the possibility of an itemset to be frequent becomeslarger and difficult to track with limited memory. However; the real killer of effective frequentitemset mining is that most of existing algorithms are false-positive oriented. That is; theycontrol memory consumption in the counting processes by an error parameter ε; and allowitems with support below the specified minimum support s but above s-ε counted as …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,202
Dynamically maintaining frequent items over a data stream,Cheqing Jin; Weining Qian; Chaofeng Sha; Jeffrey X Yu; Aoying Zhou,Abstract It is challenge to maintain frequent items over a data stream; with a small boundedmemory; in a dynamic environment where both insertion/deletion of items are allowed. Inthis paper; we propose a new novel algorithm; called hCount; which can handle bothinsertion and deletion of items with a much less memory space than the best reportedalgorithm. Our algorithm is also superior in terms of precision; recall and processing time. Inaddition; our approach does not request the preknowledge on the size of range for a datastream; and can handle range extension dynamically. Given a little modification; algorithmhCount can be improved to hCount*; which even owns significantly better performance thanbefore.,Proceedings of the twelfth international conference on Information and knowledge management,2003,187
Text classification without negative examples revisit,Gabriel Pui Cheong Fung; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hongjun Lu; Philip S Yu,Traditionally; building a classifier requires two sets of examples: positive examples andnegative examples. This paper studies the problem of building a text classifier using positiveexamples (P) and unlabeled examples (U). The unlabeled examples are mixed with bothpositive and negative examples. Since no negative example is given explicitly; the task ofbuilding a reliable text classifier becomes far more challenging. Simply treating all of theunlabeled examples as negative examples and building a classifier thereafter isundoubtedly a poor approach to tackling this problem. Generally speaking; most of thestudies solved this problem by a two-step heuristic: first; extract negative examples (N) fromU. Second; build a classifier based on P and N. Surprisingly; most studies did not try toextract positive examples from U. Intuitively; enlarging P by P'(positive examples …,IEEE transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2006,179
The autophagic paradox in cancer therapy,WKK Wu; SB Coffelt; CH Cho; XJ Wang; CW Lee; FKL Chan; J Yu; JJY Sung,Abstract Autophagy; hallmarked by the formation of double-membrane bound organellesknown as autophagosomes; is a lysosome-dependent pathway for protein degradation. Therole of autophagy in carcinogenesis is context dependent. As a tumor-suppressingmechanism in early-stage carcinogenesis; autophagy inhibits inflammation and promotesgenomic stability. Moreover; disruption of autophagy-related genes acceleratestumorigenesis in animals. However; autophagy may also act as a pro-survival mechanism toprotect cancer cells from various forms of cellular stress. In cancer therapy; adaptiveautophagy in cancer cells sustains tumor growth and survival in face of the toxicity of cancertherapy. To this end; inhibition of autophagy may sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeuticagents and ionizing radiation. Nevertheless; in certain circumstances; autophagy …,*,2012,174
Path materialization revisited: an efficient storage model for XML data,Haifeng Jiang; Hongjun Lu; Wei Wang; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract XML is emerging as a new major standard for representing data on the world wideweb. Several XML storage models have been proposed to store XML data in differentdatabase management systems. The unique feature of model-mapping-based approachesis that no DTD information is required for XML data storage. In this paper; we present a newmodel-mapping-based storage model; called XParent. Unlike the existing work on model-mapping-based approaches that emphasized on converting XML documents to/fromdatabase schema and translation of XML queries into SQL queries; in this paper; we focusourselves on the effectiveness of storage models in terms of query processing. We study thekey issues that affect query performance; namely; storage schema design (storing XML dataacross multiple tables) and path materialization (storing path information in databases) …,Australian Computer Science Communications,2002,171
Keyword search in databases: the power of RDBMS,Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lijun Chang,Abstract Keyword search in relational databases (RDBs) has been extensively studiedrecently. A keyword search (or a keyword query) in RDBs is specified by a set of keywords toexplore the interconnected tuple structures in an RDB that cannot be easily identified usingSQL on RDBMS. In brief; it finds how the tuples containing the given keywords areconnected via sequences of connections (foreign key references) among tuples in an RDB.Such interconnected tuple structures can be found as connected trees up to a certain size;sets of tuples that are reachable from a root tuple within a radius; or even multi-centersubgraphs within a radius. In the literature; there are two main approaches. One is togenerate a set of relational algebra expressions and evaluate every such expression usingSQL on an RDBMS directly or in a middleware on top of an RDBMS indirectly.

Fast graph pattern matching,Jiefeng Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Bolin Ding; S Yu Philip; Haixun Wang,Due to rapid growth of the Internet technology and new scientific/technological advances;the number of applications that model data as graphs increases; because graphs have highexpressive power to model complicated structures. The dominance of graphs in real-worldapplications asks for new graph data management so that users can access graph dataeffectively and efficiently. In this paper; we study a graph pattern matching problem over alarge data graph. The problem is to find all patterns in a large data graph that match a user-given graph pattern. We propose a new two-step R-join (reachability join) algorithm withfilter step and fetch step based on a cluster-based join-index with graph codes. We considerthe filter step as an R-semijoin; and propose a new optimization approach by interleaving R-joins with R-semijoins.

Sliding-window top-k queries on uncertain streams,Cheqing Jin; Ke Yi; Lei Chen; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Query processing on uncertain data streams has attracted a lot of attentions lately;due to the imprecise nature in the data generated from a variety of streaming applications;such as readings from a sensor network. However; all of the existing works on uncertaindata streams study unbounded streams. This paper takes the first step towards the importantand challenging problem of answering sliding-window queries on uncertain data streams;with a focus on arguably one of the most important types of queries---top-k queries. Thechallenge of answering sliding-window top-k queries on uncertain data streams stems fromthe strict space and time requirements of processing both arriving and expiring tuples in high-speed streams; combined with the difficulty of coping with the exponential blowup in thenumber of possible worlds induced by the uncertain data model.

Bloom histogram: path selectivity estimation for XML data with updates,Wei Wang; Haifeng Jiang; Hongjun Lu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Cost-based XML query optimization calls for accurate estimation of the selectivity ofpath expressions. Some other interactive and internet applications can also benefit fromsuch estimations. While there are a number of estimation techniques proposed in theliterature; almost none of them has any guarantee on the estimation accuracy within a givenspace limit. In addition; most of them assume that the XML data are more or less static; ie;with few updates. In this paper; we present a framework for XML path selectivity estimation ina dynamic context. Specifically; we propose a novel data structure; bloom histogram; toapproximate XML path frequency distribution within a small space budget and to estimatethe path selectivity accurately with the bloom histogram. We obtain the upper bound of itsestimation error and discuss the trade-offs between the accuracy and the space limit.

In thispaper; we study the problem of efficient processing of continuous skyline queries oversliding windows on uncertain data elements regarding given probability thresholds. We firstcharacterize what kind of elements we need to keep in our query computation. Then weshow the size of dynamically maintained candidate set and the size of skyline. We developnovel; efficient techniques to process a continuous; probabilistic skyline query. Finally; weextend our techniques to the applications where multiple probability thresholds are given orwe want to retrieve" top-k" skyline data objects.

Indexable PLA for efficient similarity search,Qiuxia Chen; Lei Chen; Xiang Lian; Yunhao Liu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Similarity-based search over time-series databases has been a hot research topicfor a long history; which is widely used in many applications; including multimedia retrieval;data mining; web search and retrieval; and so on. However; due to high dimensionality (ielength) of the time series; the similarity search over directly indexed time series usuallyencounters a serious problem; known as the" dimensionality curse". Thus; manydimensionality reduction techniques are proposed to break such curse by reducing thedimensionality of time series. Among all the proposed methods; only Piecewise LinearApproximation (PLA) does not have indexing mechanisms to support similarity queries;which prevents it from efficiently searching over very large time-series databases.

A novel spectral coding in a large graph database,Lei Zou; Lei Chen; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Yansheng Lu,Abstract Retrieving related graphs containing a query graph from a large graph database isa key issue in many graph-based applications; such as drug discovery and structural patternrecognition. Because sub-graph isomorphism is a NP-complete problem [4]; we have toemploy a filter-and-verification framework to speed up the search efficiency; that is; using aneffective and efficient pruning strategy to filter out the false positives (graphs that are notpossible in the results) as many as possible first; then validating the remaining candidatesby subgraph isomorphism checking. In this paper; we propose a novel filtering method; aspectral encoding method; ie GCoding. Specifically; we assign a signature to each vertexbased on its local structures. Then; we generate a spectral graph code by combining allvertex signatures in a graph. Based on spectral graph codes; we derive a necessary …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,127
Scalable sequential pattern mining for biological sequences,Ke Wang; Yabo Xu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Biosequences typically have a small alphabet; a long length; and patternscontaining gaps (ie;" don't care") of arbitrary size. Mining frequent patterns in suchsequences faces a different type of explosion than in transaction sequences primarilymotivated in market-basket analysis. In this paper; we study how this explosion affects theclassic sequential pattern mining; and present a scalable two-phase algorithm to deal withthis new explosion. The< i> Segment Phase</i> first searches for short patterns containingno gaps; called< i> segments</i>. This phase is efficient.

TwigList: make twig pattern matching fast,Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Bolin Ding,Abstract Twig pattern matching problem has been widely studied in recent years. Give anxml tree T. A twig-pattern matching query; Q; represented as a query tree; is to find all theoccurrences of such twig pattern in T. Previous works like HolisticTwig and TJFastdecomposed the twig pattern into single paths from root to leaves; and merged all theoccurrences of such path-patterns to find the occurrences of the twig-pattern matching query;Q. Their techniques can effectively prune impossible path-patterns to avoid producing alarge amount of intermediate results. But they still need to merge path-patterns which occurshigh computational cost.

Inparticular; we investigate the immediate impact of news articles on the time series based onthe Efficient Markets Hypothesis. Several data mining and text mining techniques are usedin a novel way. A new statistical based piecewise segmentation algorithm is proposed toidentify trends on the time series.

Comparison of the Kato-Katz technique; hatching test and indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) for the diagnosis of Schistosoma japonicum infection in China,JM Yu; SJ De Vlas; QW Jiang; Bruno Gryseels,Abstract The Kato-Katz technique (duplicate 41.7 mg fecal smears); hatching test andindirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) were compared for their ability to detect humanSchistosoma japonicum infection in two endemic villages (Zhonjiang and Zhuxi) in ruralChina. The hatching test (using a nylon bag; and based on about 30 g of feces) and IHA areconventional Chinese diagnostic methods. In both villages; the trends of prevalences withage and sex were comparable for the different methods. In Zhuxi; Kato-Katz examinations ofstools from 7 different days and hatching were available; which could be used as a reliablegold standard. This resulted for IHA in a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 48%. Thesensitivity of the Kato-Katz technique using one stool specimen was 68%; twice that ofhatching (33%).

Materialized view selection as constrained evolutionary optimization,Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xin Yao; Chi-Hon Choi; Gang Gou,One of the important issues in data warehouse development is the selection of a set of viewsto materialize in order to accelerate a large number of on-line analytical processing (OLAP)queries. The maintenance-cost view-selection problem is to select a set of materializedviews under certain resource constraints for the purpose of minimizing the total queryprocessing cost. However; the search space for possible materialized views may beexponentially large. A heuristic algorithm often has to be used to find a near optimal solution.In this paper; for the maintenance-cost view-selection problem; we propose a newconstrained evolutionary algorithm.

Clustering large attributed graphs: An efficient incremental approach,Yang Zhou; Hong Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu,In recent years; many networks have become available for analysis; including socialnetworks; sensor networks; biological networks; etc. Graph clustering has shown itseffectiveness in analyzing and visualizing large networks. The goal of graph clustering is topartition vertices in a large graph into clusters based on various criteria such as vertexconnectivity or neighborhood similarity. Many existing graph clustering methods mainlyfocus on the topological structures; but largely ignore the vertex properties which are oftenheterogeneous. Recently; a new graph clustering algorithm; SA-Cluster; has been proposedwhich combines structural and attribute similarities through a unified distance measure.

Existing pattern growth algorithms differ in severaldimensions:(1) item search order;(2) conditional database representation;(3) conditionaldatabase construction strategy; and (4) tree traversal strategy. They adopted differentstrategies on these dimensions. Several adaptive algorithms were proposed to try to findgood strategies for general situations. In this paper; we described the implementationtechniques of an adaptive pattern growth algorithm; called AFOPT; which demonstratedgood performance on all tested datasets. We also extended the algorithm to mine closedand maximal frequent itemsets. Comprehensive experiments were conducted todemonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.,FIMI,2003,117
PBiTree coding and efficient processing of containment joins,Wei Wang; Haifeng Jiang; Hongjun Lu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,We address issue related to containment join processing in tree-structured data such asXML documents. A containment join takes two sets of XML node elements as input andreturns pairs of elements such that the containment relationship holds between them. Whilethere are previous algorithms for processing containment joins; they require both elementsets either sorted or indexed. We propose a novel and complete containment queryprocessing framework based on a new coding scheme; PBiTree code. The PBiTree codeallows us to determine the ancestor-descendant relationship between two elements fromtheir PBiTree-based codes efficiently. We present algorithms in the framework that areoptimized for various combinations of settings. In particular; the newly proposed partitioningbased algorithms can process containment joins efficiently without sorting or indexes …,Data Engineering; 2003.

N-3-oxododecanoyl homoserine lactone (3OC12-HSL) is the majorautoinducer in P. aeruginosa. We have previously shown that human airway epithelia andparaoxonases (PONs) degrade 3OC12-HSL. This study investigated the role of PON1;PON2; and PON3 in airway epithelial cell inactivation of 3OC12-HSL. All three PONs werepresent in murine tracheal epithelial cells; with PON2 and PON3 expressed at the highestlevels. Lysates of tracheal epithelial cells from PON2; but not PON1 or PON3; knockout micehad impaired 3OC12-HSL inactivation compared with wild-type mice. In contrast; PON1 …,American Journal of Physiology-Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology,2007,116
Querying communities in relational databases,Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lijun Chang; Yufei Tao,Keyword search on relational databases provides users with insights that they can not easilyobserve using the traditional RDBMS techniques. Here; an l-keyword query is specified by aset of l keywords;{k1; k2;···; kl}. It finds how the tuples that contain the keywords areconnected in a relational database via the possible foreign key references. Conceptually; itis to find some structural information in a database graph; where nodes are tuples andedges are foreign key references. The existing work studied how to find connected trees foran l-keyword query. However; a tree may only show partial information about how thosetuples that contain the keywords are connected. In this paper; we focus on findingcommunities for an l-keyword query. A community is an induced subgraph that contains allthe l-keywords within a given distance. We propose new efficient algorithms to find all/top …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,113
Variations in fecal Schistosoma japonicum egg counts.,JM Yu; SJ De Vlas; HC Yuan; B Gryseels,Variations in fecal Schistosoma japonicum egg counts were studied in ZhuXi administrativevillage; JiangXi Province; China. Population stool examinations were collected withduplicate; standard; 41.5-mg Kato-Katz thick smears on seven consecutive days for 570individuals from two natural (individual) villages: village I with high endemicity and village IIwith low endemicity. The proportion of individuals with at least one positive count increasedfrom 42.4% after a single measurement to 68.3% after seven measurements in village I (n=356); and from 17.0% to 36.0% in village II (n= 214); respectively. This demonstrates a veryhigh variation in repeated S. japonicum egg counts and a considerable lack of sensitivity ofthe Kato-Katz technique; light and moderate infections are especially missed with a single ora few measurements.

The sedimentsamples were collected from Xiangjiang River (Changsha; Central-south China). Dataobtained from adsorption experiments show that the rapid adsorption plays the main rolerather than slow adsorption in adsorption process of BPA on sediments. Freundlich modelcan describe the adsorption behavior of BPA on sediments very well. The calculated K f (mg1− nlng− 1) ranged from 0.0072 to 0.0178 (n ranged from 0.6944 to 0.8106). Throughanalyzing the data of adsorption experiments and properties of sediments; we consider thatblack carbon (eg soot-and charcoal-like material; collectively termed black carbon or BC)and hole-filling domain of the organic matters in sediment are responsible for the …,Chemosphere,2006,109
Aerobic degradation of bisphenol A by Achromobacter xylosoxidans strain B-16 isolated from compost leachate of municipal solid waste,Chang Zhang; Guangming Zeng; Li Yuan; Jian Yu; Jianbing Li; Guohe Huang; Beidou Xi; Hongliang Liu,Abstract A novel bacterium designated strain B-16 was isolated from the compost leachateof the municipal solid waste (MSW) in a laboratory reactor. This strain was identified as agram-negative bacterium; Achromobacter xylosoxidans that could grow on bisphenol A(BPA; a representative endocrine disruptor) as a sole carbon source under aerobiccondition. BPA-degrading characteristics of strain B-16 were investigated in liquid cultures.The results show that BPA degradation was influenced by several factors (eg inoculum size;substrate concentration; temperature and pH; etc). The half-lives; optimum temperature andpH were found to be 0.58–3.1 d; 35° C and 7.0; respectively. BPA-degrading activity and cellgrowth were inhibited at high substrate concentration.

Stock prediction: Integrating text mining approach using real-time news,G Pui Cheong Fung; J Xu Yu; Wai Lam,Mining textual documents and time series concurrently; such as predicting the movements ofstock prices based on news articles; is an emerging topic in data mining society nowadays.Previous research has already suggested that the relationship between news articles andstock prices do exist. However; all of the existing approaches are concerning in miningsingle time series only. The interrelationships among different stocks are not well-addressed. Mining multiple time series concurrently is not only more informative but also farmore challenging. Research in such a direction is lacking. In this paper; we try to exploresuch an opportunity and propose a systematic framework for mining multiple time seriesbased on Efficient Market Hypothesis.,Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering; 2003.

Fast computation of reachability labeling for large graphs,Jiefeng Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xuemin Lin; Haixun Wang; S Yu Philip,Abstract The need of processing graph reachability queries stems from many applicationsthat manage complex data as graphs. The applications include transportation network;Internet traffic analyzing; Web navigation; semantic web; chemical informatics and bio-informatics systems; and computer vision. A graph reachability query; as one of the primarytasks; is to find whether two given data objects; u and v; are related in any ways in a largeand complex dataset. Formally; the query is about to find if v is reachable from u in a directedgraph which is large in size. In this paper; we focus ourselves on building a reachabilitylabeling for a large directed graph; in order to process reachability queries efficiently. Such alabeling needs to be minimized in size for the efficiency of answering the queries; and needsto be computed fast for the efficiency of constructing such a labeling. As such a labeling; 2 …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,100
Monitoring path nearest neighbor in road networks,Zaiben Chen; Heng Tao Shen; Xiaofang Zhou; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract This paper addresses the problem of monitoring the k nearest neighbors to adynamically changing path in road networks. Given a destination where a user is going to;this new query returns the k-NN with respect to the shortest path connecting the destinationand the user's current location; and thus provides a list of nearest candidates for referenceby considering the whole coming journey. We name this query the k-Path Nearest Neighborquery (k-PNN). As the user is moving and may not always follow the shortest path; the querypath keeps changing. The challenge of monitoring the k-PNN for an arbitrarily moving useris to dynamically determine the update locations and then refresh the k-PNN efficiently. Wepropose a three-phase Best-first Network Expansion (BNE) algorithm for monitoring the k-PNN and the corresponding shortest path. In the searching phase; the BNE finds the …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,96
Ascending frequency ordered prefix-tree: Efficient mining of frequent patterns,Guimei Liu; Hongjun Lu; Yabo Xu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Mining frequent patterns is a fundamental and important problem in many data miningapplications. Many of the algorithms adopt the pattern growth approach; which is shown tobe superior to the candidate generate-and-test approach significantly. We identify the keyfactors that influence the performance of the pattern growth approach; and optimize them tofurther improve the performance. Our algorithm uses a simple while compact data structure-ascending frequency ordered prefixtree (AFOPT) to organize the conditional databases; inwhich we use arrays to store single branches to further save space. We traverse our prefix-tree structure using a top-down strategy. Our experiment results show that the combinationof the top-down traversal strategy and the ascending frequency item ordering methodachieves significant performance improvement over previous works.,Database Systems for Advanced Applications; 2003.(DASFAA 2003).

Fast computing reachability labelings for large graphs with high compression rate,Jiefeng Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xuemin Lin; Haixun Wang; Philip S Yu,Abstract There are numerous applications that need to deal with a large graph and need toquery reachability between nodes in the graph. A 2-hop cover can compactly represent thewhole edge transitive closure of a graph in O (| V|.| E| 1/2) space; and be used to answerreachability query efficiently. However; it is challenging to compute a 2-hop cover. Theexisting approaches suffer from either large resource consumption or low compression rate.In this paper; we propose a hierarchical partitioning approach to partition a large graph Ginto two subgraphs repeatedly in a top-down fashion. The unique feature of our approach isthat we compute 2-hop cover while partitioning. In brief; in every iteration of top-downpartitioning; we provide techniques to compute the 2-hop cover for connections between thetwo subgraphs first. A cover is computed to cut the graph into two subgraphs; which …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,93
Containment join size estimation: Models and methods,Wei Wang; Haifeng Jiang; Hongjun Lu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Recent years witnessed an increasing interest in researches in XML; partly due tothe fact that XML has now become the de facto standard for data interchange over theinternet. A large amount of work has been reported on XML storage models and queryprocessing techniques. However; few works have addressed issues of XML queryoptimization. In this paper; we report our study on one of the challenges in XML queryoptimization: containment join size estimation. Containment join is well accepted as animportant operation in XML query processing. Estimating the size of its results is no doubtessential to generate efficient XML query processing plans. We propose two models; theinterval model and the position model; and a set of estimation methods based on these twomodels. Comprehensive performance studies were conducted.

Keyword search in databases,Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lu Qin; Lijun Chang,Abstract It has become highly desirable to provide users with flexible ways to query/searchinformation over databases as simple as keyword search like Google search. This booksurveys the recent developments on keyword search over databases; and focuses onfinding structural information among objects in a database using a set of keywords. Suchstructural information to be returned can be either trees or subgraphs representing how theobjects; that contain the required keywords; are interconnected in a relational database or inan XML database. The structural keyword search is completely different from findingdocuments that contain all the user-given keywords. The former focuses on theinterconnected object structures; whereas the latter focuses on the object content. The bookis organized as follows. In Chapter 1; we highlight the main research issues on the …,Synthesis Lectures on Data Management,2009,92
A false negative approach to mining frequent itemsets from high speed transactional data streams,Jeffrey Xu Yu; Zhihong Chong; Hongjun Lu; Zhenjie Zhang; Aoying Zhou,Abstract Mining frequent itemsets from transactional data streams is challenging due to thenature of the exponential explosion of itemsets and the limit memory space required formining frequent itemsets. Given a domain of I unique items; the possible number of itemsetscan be up to 2 I− 1. When the length of data streams approaches to a very large number N;the possibility of an itemset to be frequent becomes larger and difficult to track with limitedmemory. The existing studies on finding frequent items from high speed data streams arefalse-positive oriented. That is; they control memory consumption in the counting processesby an error parameter ϵ; and allow items with support below the specified minimum supports but above s− ϵ counted as frequent ones. However; such false-positive orientedapproaches cannot be effectively applied to frequent itemsets mining for two reasons …,Information Sciences,2006,92

Natural language question answering over RDF: a graph data driven approach,Lei Zou; Ruizhe Huang; Haixun Wang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Wenqiang He; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract RDF question/answering (Q/A) allows users to ask questions in natural languagesover a knowledge base represented by RDF. To answer a national language question; theexisting work takes a two-stage approach: question understanding and query evaluation.Their focus is on question understanding to deal with the disambiguation of the naturallanguage phrases. The most common technique is the joint disambiguation; which has theexponential search space. In this paper; we propose a systematic framework to answernatural language questions over RDF repository (RDF Q/A) from a graph data-drivenperspective. We propose a semantic query graph to model the query intention in the naturallanguage question in a structural way; based on which; RDF Q/A is reduced to subgraphmatching problem. More importantly; we resolve the ambiguity of natural language …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,90
Constructing suffix tree for gigabyte sequences with megabyte memory,Ching-Fung Cheung; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hongjun Lu,Mammalian genomes are typically 3 Gbps (gibabase pairs) in size. The largest publicdatabase NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information (http://www. ncbi. nlm. nih.gov)) of DNA contains more than 20 Gbps. Suffix trees are widely acknowledged as a datastructure to support exact/approximate sequence matching queries as well as repetitivestructure finding efficiently when they can reside in main memory. But; it has been shown asdifficult to handle long DNA sequences using suffix trees due to the so-called memorybottleneck problems. The most space efficient main-memory suffix tree constructionalgorithm takes nine hours and 45 GB memory space to index the human genome [S. Kurtz(1999)]. We show that suffix trees for long DNA sequences can be efficiently constructed ondisk using small bounded main memory space and; therefore; all existing algorithms …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2005,89
Continuously maintaining quantile summaries of the most recent n elements over a data stream,Xuemin Lin; Hongjun Lu; Jian Xu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Statistics over the most recently observed data elements are often required in applicationsinvolving data streams; such as intrusion detection in network monitoring; stock priceprediction in financial markets; Web log mining for access prediction; and user click streammining for personalization. Among various statistics; computing quantile summary isprobably most challenging because of its complexity. We study the problem of continuouslymaintaining quantile summary of the most recently observed N elements over a stream sothat quantile queries can be answered with a guaranteed precision of/spl epsiv/N. Wedeveloped a space efficient algorithm for predefined N that requires only one scan of theinput data stream and O (log (/spl epsiv//sup 2/N)//spl epsiv/+ 1//spl epsiv//sup 2/) space inthe worst cases.

iGraph: a framework for comparisons of disk-based graph indexing techniques,Wook-Shin Han; Jinsoo Lee; Minh-Duc Pham; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Graphs are of growing importance in modeling complex structures such aschemical compounds; proteins; images; and program dependence. Given a query graph Q;the subgraph isomorphism problem is to find a set of graphs containing Q from a graphdatabase; which is NP-complete. Recently; there have been a lot of research efforts to solvethe subgraph isomorphism problem for a large graph database by utilizing graph indexes.By using a graph index as a filter; we prune graphs that are not real answers at aninexpensive cost. Then; we need to use expensive subgraph isomorphism tests to verifyfiltered candidates only. This way; the number of disk I/Os and subgraph isomorphism testscan be significantly minimized.

Finding maximal cliques in massive networks by h*-graph,James Cheng; Yiping Ke; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Linhong Zhu,Abstract Maximal clique enumeration (MCE) is a fundamental problem in graph theory andhas important applications in many areas such as social network analysis andbioinformatics. The problem is extensively studied; however; the best existing algorithmsrequire memory space linear in the size of the input graph. This has become a seriousconcern in view of the massive volume of today's fast-growing network graphs. Since MCErequires random access to different parts of a large graph; it is difficult to divide the graphinto smaller parts and process one part at a time; because either the result may be incorrectand incomplete; or it incurs huge cost on merging the results from different parts. Wepropose a novel notion; H*-graph; which defines the core of a network and extends toencompass the neighborhood of the core for MCE computation.

Time-dependent event hierarchy construction,Gabriel Pui Cheong Fung; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Huan Liu; Philip S Yu,Abstract In this paper; an algorithm called Time Driven Documents-partition (TDD) isproposed to construct an event hierarchy in a text corpus based on a given query.Specifically; assume that a query contains only one feature-Election. Election is directlyrelated to the events such as 2006 US Midterm Elections Campaign; 2004 US PresidentialElection Campaign and 2004 Taiwan Presidential Election Campaign; where these eventsmay further be divided into several smaller events (eg the 2006 US Midterm ElectionsCampaign can be broken down into events such as campaign for vote; election results andthe resignation of Donald H.

The Predicting Power of Textual Information on Financial Markets.,Gabriel Pui Cheong Fung; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hongjun Lu,Abstract—Mining textual documents and time series concur-rently; such as predicting themovements of stock prices based on the contents of the news stories; is an emerging topic indata mining community. Previous researches have shown that there is a strong relationshipbetween the time when the news stories are released and the time when the stock pricesfluctuate. In this paper; we propose a systematic framework for predicting the tertiarymovements of stock prices by analyzing the impacts of the news stories on the stocks. To bemore specific; we investigate the immediate impacts of news stories on the stocks based onthe Efficient Markets Hypothesis. Several data mining and text mining techniques are usedin a novel way.

Querying k-truss community in large and dynamic graphs,Xin Huang; Hong Cheng; Lu Qin; Wentao Tian; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Community detection which discovers densely connected structures in a networkhas been studied a lot. In this paper; we study online community search which is practicallyuseful but less studied in the literature. Given a query vertex in a graph; the problem is to findmeaningful communities that the vertex belongs to in an online manner. We propose a novelcommunity model based on the k-truss concept; which brings nice structural andcomputational properties. We design a compact and elegant index structure which supportsthe efficient search of k-truss communities with a linear cost with respect to the communitysize. In addition; we investigate the k-truss community search problem in a dynamic graphsetting with frequent insertions and deletions of graph vertices and edges.

On-line exact shortest distance query processing,Jiefeng Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Shortest-path query processing not only serves as a long established routine fornumerous applications in the past but also is of increasing popularity to support novel graphapplications in very large databases nowadays. For a large graph; there is the new scenarioto query intensively against arbitrary nodes; asking to quickly return node distance or evenshortest paths. And traditional main memory algorithms and shortest paths materializationbecome inadequate. We are interested in graph labelings to encode the underlying graphsand assign labels to nodes to support efficient query processing. Surprisingly; the existingwork of this category mainly emphasizes on reachability query processing; while nosufficient effort has been given to distance labelings to support querying exact shortestdistances between nodes.

Clustering large attributed graphs: A balance between structural and attribute similarities,Hong Cheng; Yang Zhou; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Social networks; sensor networks; biological networks; and many other informationnetworks can be modeled as a large graph. Graph vertices represent entities; and graphedges represent their relationships or interactions. In many large graphs; there is usuallyone or more attributes associated with every graph vertex to describe its properties. In manyapplication domains; graph clustering techniques are very useful for detecting denselyconnected groups in a large graph as well as for understanding and visualizing a largegraph. The goal of graph clustering is to partition vertices in a large graph into differentclusters based on various criteria such as vertex connectivity or neighborhood similarity.Many existing graph clustering methods mainly focus on the topological structure forclustering; but largely ignore the vertex properties; which are often heterogenous.

Diversifying top-k results,Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lijun Chang,Abstract Top-k query processing finds a list of k results that have largest scores wrt the usergiven query; with the assumption that all the k results are independent to each other. Inpractice; some of the top-k results returned can be very similar to each other. As a resultsome of the top-k results returned are redundant. In the literature; diversified top-k searchhas been studied to return k results that take both score and diversity into consideration.Most existing solutions on diversified top-k search assume that scores of all the searchresults are given; and some works solve the diversity problem on a specific problem and canhardly be extended to general cases. In this paper; we study the diversified top-k searchproblem. We define a general diversified top-k search problem that only considers thesimilarity of the search results themselves.

High-throughput transaction executions on graphics processors,Bingsheng He; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract OLTP (On-Line Transaction Processing) is an important business system sector invarious traditional and emerging online services. Due to the increasing number of users;OLTP systems require high throughput for executing tens of thousands of transactions in ashort time period. Encouraged by the recent success of GPGPU (General-Purposecomputation on Graphics Processors); we propose GPUTx; an OLTP engine performing high-throughput transaction executions on the GPU for in-memory databases. Compared withexisting GPGPU studies usually optimizing a single task; transaction executions requirehandling many small tasks concurrently. Specifically; we propose the bulk execution modelto group multiple transactions into a bulk and to execute the bulk on the GPU as a singletask. The transactions within the bulk are executed concurrently on the GPU. We study …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,69
Multiple materialized view selection for XPath query rewriting,Nan Tang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; M Tamer Ozsu; Byron Choi; Kam-Fai Wong,We study the problem of answering XPATH queries using multiple materialized views.Despite the efforts on answering queries using single materialized view; answering queriesusing multiple views remains relatively new. We address two important aspects of thisproblem: multiple-view selection and equivalent multiple-view rewriting. With regards to thefirst problem; we propose an NFA-based approach (called VFILTER) to filter views thatcannot be used to answer a given query. We then present the criterion for multipleview/query answerability. Based on the output of VFILTER; we further propose a heuristicmethod to identify a minimal view set that can answer a given query. For the problem ofmultiple-view rewriting; we first refine the materialized fragments of each selected view (likepushing selection); we then join the refined fragments utilizing an encoding scheme …,Data Engineering; 2008.

On computing; storing and querying frequent patterns,Guimei Liu; Hongjun Lu; Wenwu Lou; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Extensive efforts have been devoted to developing efficient algorithms for miningfrequent patterns. However; frequent pattern mining remains a time-consuming process;especially for very large datasets. It is therefore desirable to adopt a" mining once and usingmany times" strategy. Unfortunately; there has been little work reported on managing andorganizing a large set of patterns for future use. In this paper; we propose a disk-based datastructure; CFP-tree (Condensed Frequent Pattern Tree); for organizing frequent patternsdiscovered from transactional databases. In addition to an efficient algorithm for CFP-treeconstruction; we also developed algorithms to efficiently support two important types ofqueries; namely queries with minimum support constraints and queries with item constraints;against the stored patterns; as these two types of queries are basic building blocks for …,Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2003,69
Suppressing model overfitting in mining concept-drifting data streams,Haixun Wang; Jian Yin; Jian Pei; Philip S Yu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Mining data streams of changing class distributions is important for real-timebusiness decision support. The stream classifier must evolve to reflect the current classdistribution. This poses a serious challenge. On the one hand; relying on historical data mayincrease the chances of learning obsolete models. On the other hand; learning only from thelatest data may lead to biased classifiers; as the latest data is often an unrepresentativesample of the current class distribution. The problem is particularly acute in classifying rareevents; when; for example; instances of the rare class do not even show up in the mostrecent training data. In this paper; we use a stochastic model to describe the concept shiftingpatterns and formulate this problem as an optimization one: from the historical and thecurrent training data that we have observed; find the most-likely current distribution; and …,Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2006,68
A mobile TCP socket,Xun Qu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Richard P Brent,In this paper; we propose a mobile TCP socket which is the second step of our two stepapproach to support mobility. The first step of our approach is to support portability asreported earlier. In our mobile TCP socket; a mobile mapping is introduced; which mapsTCP associations to underlying TCP connections. The mobile mapping can be implementedin the socket layer and on top of TCP/IP protocol layers. Our approach achieves highcompatibility with current TCP/IP protocols; due to the fact that neither of the two steps in ourapproach impose any changes on TCP/IP protocols nor the underlying Link layer. At thesame time; our approach can reduce both the propagation cost for distributing locationinformation of mobile hosts and the forwarding cost for forwarding IP datagrams across theInternet.

Identifying interesting visitors through Web log classification,Jeffrey Xu Yu; Yuming Ou; Chengqi Zhang; Shichao Zhang,Web site owners have trouble identifying customer purchasing patterns from their Web logsbecause the two aren't directly related. Thus; organizations must understand their customers'behavior; preferences; and future needs. This imperative leads many companies to developa great many e-service systems for data collection and analysis. Web mining is a populartechnique for analyzing visitor activities in e-service systems. It mainly includes Web textmining; Web structure mining and Web log mining. Our Web log mining approach classifiesa particular site's visitors into different groups on the basis of their purchase interest.,IEEE Intelligent Systems,2005,65
Entity matching: How similar is similar,Jiannan Wang; Guoliang Li; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Jianhua Feng,Abstract Entity matching that finds records referring to the same entity is an importantoperation in data cleaning and integration. Existing studies usually use a given similarityfunction to quantify the similarity of records; and focus on devising index structures andalgorithms for efficient entity matching. However it is a big challenge to define" how similar issimilar" for real applications; since it is rather hard to automatically select appropriatesimilarity functions. In this paper we attempt to address this problem. As there are a largenumber of similarity functions; and even worse thresholds may have infinite values; it israther expensive to find appropriate similarity functions and thresholds. Fortunately; we havean observation that different similarity functions and thresholds have redundancy; and wehave an opportunity to prune inappropriate similarity functions. To this end; we propose …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,64
Web communities: Analysis and construction,Yanchun Zhang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Jingyu Hou,Due to the lack of a uniform schema for Web documents and the sheer amount anddynamics of Web data; both the effectiveness and the efficiency of information managementand retrieval of Web data is often unsatisfactory when using conventional data managementtechniques. Web community; defined as a set of Web-based documents with its own logicalstructure; is a flexible and efficient approach to support information retrieval and toimplement various applications.

What makes the differences: benchmarking XML database implementations,Hongjun Lu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Guoren Wang; Shihui Zheng; Haifeng Jiang; Ge Yu; Aoying Zhou,Abstract XML is emerging as a major standard for representing data on the World Wide Web.Recently; many XML storage models have been proposed to manage XML data. In order toassess an XML database's abilities to deal with XML queries; several benchmarks have alsobeen proposed; including XMark and XMach. However; no reported studies using thosebenchmarks were found that can provide users with insights on the impacts of a variety ofstorage models on XML query performance. In this article; we report our first set of results onbenchmarking a set of XML database implementations using two XML benchmarks. Theselected implementations represent a wide range of approaches; including RDBMS-basedsystems with document-independent and document-dependent XML-relational schemamapping approaches; and XML native engines based on an Object-Oriented Model and …,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (TOIT),2005,64
Fibulin 1 is downregulated through promoter hypermethylation in gastric cancer,YY Cheng; H Jin; X Liu; JMT Siu; YP Wong; EKO Ng; J Yu; WK Leung; JJY Sung; FKL Chan,Abstract Tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) were frequently inactivated through promoterhypermethylation in gastric carcinoma as well as pre-malignant gastric lesions; suggestingthat promoter hypermethylation can be used as a marker to define novel TSGs and alsobiomarkers for early detection of gastric cancer. In an effort to search for such genesaberrantly methylated in gastric cancer development; fibulin 1 (FBLN1) was found as acandidate TSG epigenetically downregulated in gastric cancer.

Spatial join strategies in distributed spatial DBMS,David J Abel; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Robert Power; X Yu Jeffrey,Abstract In a distributed spatial database system; a user may issue a query that relates twospatial relations that are stored at different sites. Because of the sheer volume andcomplexity of spatial data; spatial joins between two spatial relations at different sites areexpensive in terms of computation and transmission cost. In this paper; we examine theproblems of spatial joins between sites; and present spatial join processing strategies usedin a heterogeneous spatial database system. Preliminary experimental results are reported.,International Symposium on Spatial Databases,1995,63
Fast single-pair simrank computation,Pei Li; Hongyan Liu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Jun He; Xiaoyong Du,Abstract SimRank is an intuitive and effective measure for link-based similarity that scoressimilarity between two nodes as the first-meeting probability of two random surfers; based onthe random surfer model. However; when a user queries the similarity of a given node-pairbased on SimRank; the existing approaches need to compute the similarities of other node-pairs beforehand; which we call an all-pair style. In this paper; we propose a Single-PairSimRank approach. Without accuracy loss; this approach performs an iterative computationto obtain the similarity of a single node-pair. The time cost of our Single-Pair SimRank isalways less than All-Pair SimRank and obviously efficient when we only need to assesssimilarity of one or a few node-pairs. We confirm the accuracy and efficiency of our approachin extensive experimental studies over synthetic and real datasets.,*,2010,62
Hot: Hypergraph-based outlier test for categorical data,Li Wei; Weining Qian; Aoying Zhou; Wen Jin; X Yu Jeffrey,Abstract As a widely used data mining technique; outlier detection is a process which aimsat finding anomalies with good explanations. Most existing methods are designed fornumeric data. They will have problems with real-life applications that contain categoricaldata. In this paper; we introduce a novel outlier mining method based on a hypergraphmodel. Since hypergraphs precisely capture the distribution characteristics in datasubspaces; this method is effective in identifying anomalies in dense subspaces andpresents good interpretations for the local outlierness. By selecting the most relevantsubspaces; the problem of “curse of dimensionality” in very large databases can also beameliorated. Furthermore; the connectivity property is used to replace the distance metrics;so that the distance-based computation is not needed anymore; which enhances the …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2003,62
M+-tree: a new dynamical multidimensional index for metric spaces,Xiangmin Zhou; Guoren Wang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Ge Yu,Abstract In this paper; we propose a new metric index; called M+-tree; which is a treedynamically organized for large datasets in metric spaces. The proposed M+-tree takes fulladvantages of M-tree and MVP-tree; with a new concept called key dimension; whicheffectively reduces response time for similarity search. The main idea behind the keydimension is to make the fanout of tree larger by partitioning a subspace further into twosubspaces; called twin-nodes. We can double the filtering effectiveness by utilizing the twin-nodes. In addition; for the purpose of ensuring high space utilization; we also conduct datareallocation between the twin nodes dynamically. Our experiment shows that higher filteringefficiency can be obtained by using the key dimensions for r-neighbor search and k-NN (k-nearest neighbor). We will report our experimental results in this paper.,Proceedings of the 14th Australasian database conference-Volume 17,2003,61
Scalable big graph processing in mapreduce,Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lijun Chang; Hong Cheng; Chengqi Zhang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract MapReduce has become one of the most popular parallel computing paradigms incloud; due to its high scalability; reliability; and fault-tolerance achieved for a large variety ofapplications in big data processing. In the literature; there are MapReduce Class MRC andMinimal MapReduce Class MMC to define the memory consumption; communication cost;CPU cost; and number of MapReduce rounds for an algorithm to execute in MapReduce.However; neither of them is designed for big graph processing in MapReduce; since theconstraints in MMC can be hardly achieved simultaneously on graphs and the conditions inMRC may induce scalability problems when processing big graph data.

Finding maximal cliques in massive networks,James Cheng; Yiping Ke; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Linhong Zhu,Abstract Maximal clique enumeration is a fundamental problem in graph theory and hasimportant applications in many areas such as social network analysis and bioinformatics.The problem is extensively studied; however; the best existing algorithms require memoryspace linear in the size of the input graph. This has become a serious concern in view of themassive volume of today's fast-growing networks. We propose a general framework fordesigning external-memory algorithms for maximal clique enumeration in large graphs. Thegeneral framework enables maximal clique enumeration to be processed recursively insmall subgraphs of the input graph; thus allowing in-memory computation of maximalcliques without the costly random disk access. We prove that the set of cliques obtained bythe recursive local computation is both correct (ie; globally maximal) and complete. The …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2011,58

E-cadherin plays an important role in the maintenance of cell-celladhesion and its function is thought to be regulated by its associated cytoplasmic proteins;such as α-catenin and β-catenin. To determine the role of α-catenin expression in gastriccarcinogenesis; we studied its expression in human gastric cancer and in the gastricmucosa of first degree relatives with no clinical disease. METHODS α-Catenin expressionwas assessed by immunohistochemical analysis and reverse transcriptase-polymerasechain reaction (RT-PCR) using gastric tissue specimens from patients with gastric cancerand from the gastric mucosa of first degree relatives of gastric cancer patients and healthycontrols.

Catch the wind: Graph workload balancing on cloud,Zechao Shang; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Graph partitioning is a key issue in graph database processing systems for achieving highefficiency on Cloud. However; the balanced graph partitioning itself is difficult because it isknown to be NP-complete. In addition a static graph partitioning cannot keep all graphalgorithms efficient for a long time in parallel on Cloud because the workload balancing indifferent iterations for different graph algorithms are all possible different. In this paper; weinvestigate graph behaviors by exploring the working window (we call it wind) changes;where a working window is a set of active vertices that a graph algorithm really needs toaccess in parallel computing. We investigated nine classic graph algorithms using realdatasets; and propose simple yet effective policies that can achieve both high graphworkload balancing and efficient partition on Cloud.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,57
Expression of transforming growth factor beta-1 in gastric cancer and in the gastric mucosa of first-degree relatives of patients with gastric cancer,MPA Ebert; J Yu; S Miehlke; G Fei; U Lendeckel; K Ridwelski; M Stolte; E Bayerdörffer; P Malfertheiner,Abstract Transforming growth factors beta (TGF-β) constitute a family of polypeptide growthfactors that control cell growth; cell differentiation and migration; as well as the formation ofthe extracellular matrix. Recent analyses revealed the overexpression of TGF-β1 in humangastric cancers and demonstrated increased cell proliferation in the stomach of patients withgastric cancer and their first-degree relatives. Using human gastric tissues obtained frompatients with gastric cancer (n= 19); biopsies from healthy first-degree relatives of gastriccancer patients (n= 18) and healthy individuals (n= 19); we analysed the expression of TGF-β1 using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) andimmunohistochemistry. Fifteen of 19 patients with gastric cancer expressed TGF-β1 in thetumour. In 11 of these 15 cases TGF-β1 mRNA was also detectable in the non-tumourous …,British journal of cancer,2000,57
Approximate graph schema extraction for semi-structured data,Qiu Yue Wang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Kam-Fai Wong,Abstract Semi-structured data are typically represented in the form of labeled directedgraphs. They are self-describing and schemaless. The lack of a schema renders queryprocessing over semi-structured data expensive. To overcome this predicament; someresearchers proposed to use the structure of the data for schema representation. Suchschemas are commonly referred to as graph schemas. Nevertheless; since semi-structureddata are irregular and frequently subjected to modifications; it is costly to construct anaccurate graph schema and worse still; it is difficult to maintain it thereafter. Furthermore; anaccurate graph schema is generally very large; hence impractical. In this paper; anapproximation approach is proposed for graph schema extraction. Approximation isachieved by summarizing the semi-structured data graph using an incremental clustering …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2000,55
An analysis of selective tuning schemes for nonuniform broadcast,Jeffrey Xu Yu; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Broadcasting is an effective means of disseminating information in a wirelessenvironment to a large number of clients with powerful palmtops. However; it requires theclients to be actively listening to the communication channels for the desired information.Because of the high power consumption of the active mode; it is crucial for the battery-operated palmtops to conserve their energy in order to extend their effective battery life. Thiscalls for selective tuning mechanisms that allow the clients to operate in the less energy-consuming doze mode; and to operate only in active mode when the desirable portion of theinformation is broadcast. Most of the existing work focuses on uniform broadcast. In practice;only a small amount of information is highly in demand by a large number of clients while theremainder is less popular. This nonuniform access pattern poses several new issues. In …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,1997,55
Context-aware object connection discovery in large graphs,James Cheng; Yiping Ke; Wilfred Ng; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Given a large graph and a set of objects; the task of object connection discovery is to find asubgraph that retains the best connection between the objects. Object connection discoveryis useful to many important applications such as discovering the connection betweendifferent terrorist groups for counter-terrorism operations. Existing work considers only theconnection between individual objects; however; in many real problems the objects usuallyhave a context (eg; a terrorist belongs to a terrorist group). We identify the context for thenodes in a large graph. We partition the graph into a set of communities based on theconcept of modularity; where each community becomes naturally the context of the nodeswithin the community. By considering the context we also significantly improve the efficiencyof object connection discovery; since we break down the big graph into much smaller …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09.

However; the function of PAX5 in gastriccancer (GC) development is largely unclear. We analyzed its epigenetic inactivation;biological functions and clinical application in GC. PAX5 was silenced in seven out of eightGC cell lines. A significant downregulation was also detected in paired gastric tumorscompared with adjacent non-cancerous tissues. The downregulation of PAX5 was closelylinked to the promoter hypermethylation status and could be restored with demethylationtreatment. Ectopic expression of PAX5 in silenced GC cell lines (AGS and BGC823)inhibited colony formation and cell viability; arrested cell cycle; induced apoptosis;suppressed cell migration and invasion and repressed tumorigenicity in nude mice …,Oncogene,2012,52
Robust reputation-based ranking on bipartite rating networks,Rong-Hua Li; Jeffery Xu Yu; Xin Huang; Hong Cheng,Abstract With the growth of the Internet and E-commerce; bipartite rating networks areubiquitous. In such bipartite rating networks; there exist two types of entities: the users andthe objects; where users give ratings to objects. A fundamental problem in such networks ishow to rank the objects by user's ratings. Although it has been extensively studied in the pastdecade; the existing algorithms either cannot guarantee convergence; or are not robust tothe spammers. In this paper; we propose six new reputation-based algorithms; where theusers' reputation is determined by the aggregated difference between the users' ratings andthe corresponding objects' rankings. We prove that all of our algorithms converge into aunique fixed point. The time and space complexity of our algorithms are linear wrt the size ofthe graph; thus they can be scalable to large datasets. Moreover; our algorithms are …,*,2012,52
High electron mobility in nickel bis (dithiolene) complexes,Jian-Yang Cho; Benoit Domercq; Simon C Jones; Junsheng Yu; Xiaohong Zhang; Zesheng An; Maximilienne Bishop; Stephen Barlow; Seth R Marder; Bernard Kippelen,The charge-carrier mobilities for three Ni bis (dithiolene) complexes have been determinedusing the steady-state space-charge limited current technique. A high mobility of 2.8 cm2 V–1 s–1 was observed for one compound; which exhibits a π-stacked columnar structure; in anannealed unsymmetrical melt-processed device. Energy-level considerations and field-effect transistor measurements suggest that this value represents an electron mobility.However; saturation mobilities measured for this compound in spin-coated field-effecttransistors were found to be over two orders of magnitude lower than the space-chargelimited current values. X-Ray diffraction shows a difference in morphology between thickmelt-processed and thin spin-coated films and; therefore; a significant change inintermolecular packing between the device types may explain the discrepancy in …,Journal of Materials Chemistry,2007,52
Community detection in social networks: an in-depth benchmarking study with a procedure-oriented framework,Meng Wang; Chaokun Wang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Jun Zhang,Abstract Revealing the latent community structure; which is crucial to understanding thefeatures of networks; is an important problem in network and graph analysis. During the lastdecade; many approaches have been proposed to solve this challenging problem in diverseways; ie different measures or data structures. Unfortunately; experimental reports onexisting techniques fell short in validity and integrity since many comparisons were notbased on a unified code base or merely discussed in theory.

Dynamically updating XML data: numbering scheme revisited,Jeffrey Xu Yu; Daofeng Luo; Xiaofeng Meng; Hongjun Lu,Abstract Almost all existing approaches use certain numbering scheme to encode XMLelements to facilitate query processing when XML data is stored in databases. For example;under the most popular region-based numbering scheme; the starting and ending positionsof an element in a document are used as the code to identify the element so that theancestor/descendant relationship between two elements can be determined by merelyexamining their codes. While such numbering scheme can greatly improve queryperformance; renumbering large amount of elements caused by updates becomes aperformance bottleneck if XML documents are frequently updated. Unfortunately; nosatisfactory work has been reported for efficient update of XML data.

Energy efficient filtering of nonuniform broadcast,Kian-Lee Tan; Jeffrey Xu Yu,In a wireless environment; information is broadcast on communication channels to clientsusing powerful; battery-operated palmtops. To conserve the usage of energy; the informationto be broadcast must be organized so that the client can selectively tune in at the desirableportion of the broadcast. Most of the existing work focus on uniform broadcast. However veryoften; a small amount of information is more frequently accessed by a large number ofclients while the remainder are less in demand. This nonuniform access pattern posesseveral new issues. In this paper we examine these issues and look at how a nonuniformbroadcast can be organized for selective tuning by the clients. We propose several newindexing schemes to facilitate selective tuning. A performance study is conducted to studyand demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.,Distributed Computing Systems; 1996.; Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on,1996,51
Connected substructure similarity search,Haichuan Shang; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Wei Wang,Abstract Substructure similarity search is to retrieve graphs that approximately contain agiven query graph. It has many applications; eg; detecting similar functions among chemicalcompounds. The problem is challenging as even testing subgraph containment between twographs is NP-complete. Hence; existing techniques adopt the filtering-and-verificationframework with the focus on developing effective and efficient techniques to remove non-promising graphs. Nevertheless; existing filtering techniques may be still unable toeffectively remove many" low" quality candidates. To resolve this; in this paper we propose anovel indexing technique; GrafD-Index; to index graphs according to their" distances" tofeatures. We characterize a tight condition under which the distance-based triangularinequality holds. We then develop lower and upper bounding techniques that exploit the …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,50

In this paper; wetake the shortest path discovery as an example to investigate the technique issues whenleveraging existing infrastructure of relational database (RDB) in the graph datamanagement. Based on the observation that a variety of graph search queries can beimplemented by iterative operations including selecting frontier nodes from visited nodes;making expansion from the selected frontier nodes; and merging the expanded nodes intothe visited ones; we introduce a relational FEM framework with three correspondingoperators to implement graph search tasks in the RDB context.

Finding centric local outliers in categorical/numerical spaces,Jeffrey Xu Yu; Weining Qian; Hongjun Lu; Aoying Zhou,Abstract Outlier detection techniques are widely used in many applications such as credit-card fraud detection; monitoring criminal activities in electronic commerce; etc. Theseapplications attempt to identify outliers as noises; exceptions; or objects around the border.The existing density-based local outlier detection assigns the degree to which an object isan outlier in a numerical space. In this paper; we propose a novel mutual-reinforcement-based local outlier detection approach. Instead of detecting local outliers as noise; weattempt to identify local outliers in the center; where they are similar to some clusters ofobjects on one hand; and are unique on the other. Our technique can be used for bankinvestment to identify a unique body; similar to many good competitors; in which to invest.We attempt to detect local outliers in categorical; ordinal as well as numerical data.

Available are an old classifier; representing previous knowledge aboutclassification characteristics; and a new data. We want to find the changes of classificationcharacteristics in the new data. An example of such changes is “members with a large familyno longer shop frequently; but they used to”. Finding this kind of changes holds the key forthe organization to adopt to the changed environment and stay ahead of competitors. Thechallenge is that it is difficult to see what has really changed from comparing the old andnew classifiers that could be very large and different. In this paper; we propose a techniqueto identify such changes. The idea is tracing the characteristics; in the old and newclassifiers; that correspond to each other by classifying the same examples.

Approximate shortest distance computing: A query-dependent local landmark scheme,Miao Qiao; Hong Cheng; Lijun Chang; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Shortest distance query is a fundamental operation in large-scale networks. Many existingmethods in the literature take a landmark embedding approach; which selects a set of graphnodes as landmarks and computes the shortest distances from each landmark to all nodesas an embedding. To answer a shortest distance query; the precomputed distances from thelandmarks to the two query nodes are used to compute an approximate shortest distancebased on the triangle inequality. In this paper; we analyze the factors that affect the accuracyof distance estimation in landmark embedding. In particular; we find that a globally selected;query-independent landmark set may introduce a large relative error; especially for nearbyquery nodes. To address this issue; we propose a query-dependent local landmark scheme;which identifies a local landmark close to both query nodes and provides more accurate …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,48
Neighborhood-privacy protected shortest distance computing in cloud,Jun Gao; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Ruoming Jin; Jiashuai Zhou; Tengjiao Wang; Dongqing Yang,Abstract With the advent of cloud computing; it becomes desirable to utilize cloud computingto efficiently process complex operations on large graphs without compromising theirsensitive information. This paper studies shortest distance computing in the cloud; whichaims at the following goals: i) preventing outsourced graphs from neighborhood attack; ii)preserving shortest distances in outsourced graphs; iii) minimizing overhead on the clientside. The basic idea of this paper is to transform an original graph G into a link graph Gl keptlocally and a set of outsourced graphs Go. Each outsourced graph should meet therequirement of a new security model called 1-neighborhood-d-radius. In addition; theshortest distance query can be answered using Gl and Go. Our objective is to minimize thespace cost on the client side when both security and utility requirements are satisfied.

A template model for multidimensional inter-transactional association rules,Ling Feng; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hongjun Lu; Jiawei Han,Abstract. Multidimensional inter-transactional association rules extend the traditionalassociation rules to describe more general associations among items with multipleproperties across transactions.“After McDonald and Burger King open branches; KFC willopen a branch two months later and one mile away” is an example of such rules. Since thenumber of potential inter-transactional association rules tends to be extremely large; mininginter-transactional associations poses more challenges on efficient processing than miningtraditional intra-transactional associations. In order to make such association rule miningtruly practical and computationally tractable; in this study we present a template model tohelp users declare the interesting multidimensional inter-transactional associations to bemined.

Influential community search in large networks,Rong-Hua Li; Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Rui Mao,Abstract Community search is a problem of finding densely connected subgraphs that satisfythe query conditions in a network; which has attracted much attention in recent years.However; all the previous studies on community search do not consider the influence of acommunity. In this paper; we introduce a novel community model called k-influentialcommunity based on the concept of k-core; which can capture the influence of a community.Based on the new community model; we propose a linear-time online search algorithm tofind the top-r k-influential communities in a network. To further speed up the influentialcommunity search algorithm; we devise a linear-space index structure which supportsefficient search of the top-r k-influential communities in optimal time.

On top-k structural similarity search,Pei Lee; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Search for objects similar to a given query object in a network has numerous applicationsincluding web search and collaborative filtering.

Meeting-based methods including SimRank and P-Rankcapture structural similarity very well. Deriving inspiration from PageRank; SimRank hasgained popularity by a natural intuition and domain independence. Since it'scomputationally expensive; subsequent work has focused on optimizing and approximatingthe computation of SimRank.

Efficient core maintenance in large dynamic graphs,Rong-Hua Li; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Rui Mao,The k-core decomposition in a graph is a fundamental problem for social network analysis.The problem of k-core decomposition is to calculate the core number for every node in agraph. Previous studies mainly focus on k-core decomposition in a static graph. There existsa linear time algorithm for k-core decomposition in a static graph. However; in many real-world applications such as online social networks and the Internet; the graph typicallyevolves overtime. In such applications; a key issue is to maintain the core numbers of nodeswhen the graph changes overtime. A simple implementation is to perform the linear timealgorithm to recompute the core number for every node after the graph is updated. Suchsimple implementation is expensive when the graph is very large.

Methods and systems for generating and searching a cross-linked keyphrase ontology database,*,The methods and systems of the invention involve the generation and use of a cross-linkedkeyphrase ontology database.

High efficiency and quality: large graphs matching,Yuanyuan Zhu; Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Yiping Ke; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Graph matching plays an essential role in many real applications. In this paper; westudy how to match two large graphs by maximizing the number of matched edges; which isknown as maximum common subgraph matching and is NP-hard. To find exact matching; itcannot a graph with more than 30 nodes. To find an approximate matching; the quality canbe very poor. We propose a novel two-step approach that can efficiently match two largegraphs over thousands of nodes with high matching quality. In the first step; we propose ananchor-selection/expansion approach to compute a good initial matching. In the secondstep; we propose a new approach to refine the initial matching. We give the optimality of ourrefinement and discuss how to randomly refine the matching with different combinations. Wefurther show how to extend our solution to handle labeled graphs.

Metallic fabrics as the current collector for high-performance graphene-based flexible solid-state supercapacitor,Jianhui Yu; Jifeng Wu; Haozong Wang; Anan Zhou; Chaoqiang Huang; Hua Bai; Lei Li,Flexible solid-state supercapacitors attract more and more attention as the power supply forwearable electronics. To fabricate such devices; the flexible and economical currentcollectors are needed. In this paper; we report the stainless steel fabrics as the currentcollector for high-performance graphene-based supercapacitors. The stainless steel fabricshave superior properties compared with the widely used flexible current collectors. Theflexible supercapacitors show large specific capacitance of 180.4 mF/cm2; and capacitanceretention of 96.8% after 7500 charge–discharge cycles. Furthermore; 96.4% of thecapacitance is retained after 800 repeating stretching-bending cycles. The high performanceis related to the excellent conductivity; good mechanical flexibility; and high electrochemicalstability of the stainless steel fabrics.

Finding maximal k-edge-connected subgraphs from a large graph,Rui Zhou; Chengfei Liu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Weifa Liang; Baichen Chen; Jianxin Li,Abstract In this paper; we study how to find maximal k-edge-connected subgraphs from alarge graph. k-edge-connected subgraphs can be used to capture closely related vertices;and finding such vertex clusters is interesting in many applications; eg; social networkanalysis; bioinformatics; web link research. Compared with other explicit structures formodeling vertex clusters; such as quasi-clique; k-core; which only set the requirement onvertex degrees; k-edge-connected subgraph further requires high connectivity within asubgraph (a stronger requirement); and hence defines a more closely related vertex cluster.To find maximal k-edge-connected subgraphs from a graph; a basic approach is torepeatedly apply minimum cut algorithm to the connected components of the input graphuntil all connected components are k-connected. However; the basic approach is very …,Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2012,39
Graph reachability queries: A survey,Jeffrey Xu Yu; Jiefeng Cheng,Abstract There are numerous applications that need to deal with a large graph; includingbioinformatics; social science; link analysis; citation analysis; and collaborative networks. Afundamental query is to query whether a node is reachable from another node in a largegraph; which is called a reachability query. In this survey; we discuss several existingapproaches to process reachability queries. In addition; we will discuss how to answerreachability queries with the shortest distance; and graph pattern matching over a largegraph.,*,2010,39
K-reach: who is in your small world,James Cheng; Zechao Shang; Hong Cheng; Haixun Wang; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract We study the problem of answering k-hop reachability queries in a directed graph;ie; whether there exists a directed path of length k; from a source query vertex to a targetquery vertex in the input graph. The problem of k-hop reachability is a general problem ofthe classic reachability (where k=∞). Existing indexes for processing classic reachabilityqueries; as well as for processing shortest path queries; are not applicable or not efficient forprocessing k-hop reachability queries. We propose an index for processing k-hopreachability queries; which is simple in design and efficient to construct. Our experimentalresults on a wide range of real datasets show that our index is more efficient than the state-of-the-art indexes even for processing classic reachability queries; for which these indexes areprimarily designed. We also show that our index is efficient in answering k-hop …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,38
Finding top-k similar graphs in graph databases,Yuanyuan Zhu; Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hong Cheng,Abstract Querying similar graphs in graph databases has been widely studied in graphquery processing in recent years. Existing works mainly focus on subgraph similarity searchand supergraph similarity search. In this paper; we study the problem of finding top-k graphsin a graph database that are most similar to a query graph. This problem has manyapplications; such as image retrieval and chemical compound structure search. Regardingthe similarity measure; feature based and kernel based similarity measures have been usedin the literature. But such measures are rough and may lose the connectivity informationamong substructures. In this paper; we introduce a new similarity measure based on themaximum common subgraph (MCS) of two graphs. We show that this measure can bettercapture the common and different structures of two graphs. Since computing the MCS of …,Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2012,38
Matching dependence-related queries in the system dependence graph,Xiaoyin Wang; David Lo; Jiefeng Cheng; Lu Zhang; Hong Mei; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract In software maintenance and evolution; it is common that developers want to applya change to a number of similar places. Due to the size and complexity of the code base; it ischallenging for developers to locate all the places that need the change. A main challengein locating the places that need the change is that; these places share certain commondependence conditions but existing code searching techniques can hardly handledependence relations satisfactorily. In this paper; we propose a technique that enablesdevelopers to make queries involving dependence conditions and textual conditions on thesystem dependence graph of the program. We carried out an empirical evaluation on foursearching tasks taken from the development history of two real-world projects. The results ofour evaluation indicate that; compared with code-clone detection; our technique is able to …,Proceedings of the IEEE/ACM international conference on Automated software engineering,2010,38
Assembly line balancing based on an adaptive genetic algorithm,Jianfeng Yu; Yuehong Yin,Abstract An adaptive genetic algorithm is presented as an intelligent algorithm for theassembly line balancing in this paper. The probability of crossover and mutation isdynamically adjusted according to the individual's fitness value. The individuals with higherfitness values are assigned to lower probabilities of genetic operator; and vice versa.Compared with the traditional heuristic algorithms; the adaptive genetic algorithm haseffective convergence and efficient computation speed. The computational resultsdemonstrate that the proposed adaptive genetic algorithm is an effective algorithm to dealwith the assembly line balancing to obtain a smoother line.,The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,2010,38
Spatial range querying for Gaussian-based imprecise query objects,Yoshiharu Ishikawa; Yuichi Iijima; Jeffrey Xu Yu,In sensor environments and moving robot applications; the position of an object is oftenknown imprecisely because of measurement error and/or movement of the object. In thispaper; we present query processing methods for spatial databases in which the position ofthe query object is imprecisely specified by a probability density function based on aGaussian distribution. We define the notion of a probabilistic range query by extending thetraditional notion of a spatial range query and present three strategies for query processing.Since the qualification probability evaluation of target objects requires numerical integrationby a method such as the Monte Carlo method; reduction of the number of candidate objectsthat should be evaluated has a large impact on query performance.

Finding frequent co-occurring terms in relational keyword search,Yufei Tao; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Given a set Q of keywords; conventional keyword search (KS) returns a set oftuples; each of which (i) is obtained from a single relation; or by joining multiple relations;and (ii) contains all the keywords in Q. This paper proposes a relevant problem calledfrequent co-occurring term (FCT) retrieval. Specifically; given a keyword set Q and an integerk; a FCT query reports the k terms that are not in Q; but appear most frequently in the resultof a KS query with the same Q. FCT search is able to discover the concepts that are closelyrelated to Q. Furthermore; it is also an effective tool for refining the keyword set Q oftraditional keyword search. While a FCT query can be trivially supported by solving thecorresponding KS query; we provide a faster algorithm that extracts the correct resultswithout evaluating any KS query at all.

Spotting significant changing subgraphs in evolving graphs,Zheng Liu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Yiping Ke; Xuemin Lin; Lei Chen,Graphs are popularly used to model structural relationships between objects. In manyapplication domains such as social networks; sensor networks and telecommunication;graphs evolve over time. In this paper; we study a new problem of discovering thesubgraphs that exhibit significant changes in evolving graphs. This problem is challengingsince it is hard to define changing regions that are closely related to the actual changes (ie;additions/deletions of edges/nodes) in graphs. We formalize the problem; and design anefficient algorithm that is able to identify the changing subgraphs incrementally.

Query translation from XPath to SQL in the presence of recursive DTDs,Wenfei Fan; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hongjun Lu; Jianhua Lu; Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract The interaction between recursion in XPATH and recursion in DTDS makes itchallenging to answer XPATH queries on XML data that is stored in an RDBMS via schema-based shredding. We present a new approach to translating XPATH queries into SQLqueries with a simple least fixpoint (LFP) operator; which is already supported by mostcommercial RDBMS. The approach is based on our algorithm for rewriting XPATH queriesinto regular XPATH expressions; which are capable of capturing both DTD recursion andXPATH queries in a uniform framework. Furthermore; we provide an algorithm for translatingregular XPATH queries to SQL queries with LFP; and optimization techniques for minimizingthe use of the LFP operator. The novelty of our approach consists in its capability to answera large class of XPATH queries by means of only low-end RDBMS features already …,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,37
CFP-tree: A compact disk-based structure for storing and querying frequent itemsets,Guimei Liu; Hongjun Lu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Frequent itemset mining is an important problem in the data mining area with awide range of applications. Many decision support systems need to support onlineinteractive frequent itemset mining; which is a challenging task because frequent itemsetmining is a computation intensive repetitive process. One solution is to precompute frequentitemsets. In this paper; we propose a compact disk-based data structure—CFP-tree to storeprecomputed frequent itemsets on a disk to support online mining requests. The CFP-treestructure effectively utilizes the redundancy in frequent itemsets to save space. Thecompressing ratio of a CFP-tree can be as high as several thousands or even higher.Efficient algorithms for retrieving frequent itemsets from a CFP-tree; as well as efficientalgorithms to construct and maintain a CFP-tree; are developed.

Fast graph query processing with a low-cost index,James Cheng; Yiping Ke; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract This paper studies the problem of processing supergraph queries; that is; given adatabase containing a set of graphs; find all the graphs in the database of which the querygraph is a supergraph. Existing works usually construct an index and performs a filtering-and-verification process; which still requires many subgraph isomorphism testings. Thereare also significant overheads in both index construction and maintenance. In this paper; wedesign a graph querying system that achieves both fast indexing and efficient queryprocessing. The index is constructed by a simple but fast method of extracting thecommonality among the graphs; which does not involve any costly operation such as graphmining. Our query processing has two key techniques; direct inclusion and filtering.

Similarity match over high speed time-series streams,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Guoren Wang; Ge Yu,Similarity-based time series retrieval has been a subject of long term study due to its wideusage in many applications; such as financial data analysis; weather data forecasting; andmultimedia data retrieval. Its original task was to find those time series similar to a pattern(query) time series data; where both the pattern and data time series are static. Recently;with an increasing demand on stream data management; similarity-based stream time seriesretrieval has raised new research issues due to its unique requirements during the streamprocessing; such as one-pass search and fast response.

Statistical estimation of access frequencies in data broadcasting environments,Jeffrey Xu Yu; Toshio Sakata; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract In a data publishing environment; the server periodically broadcasts data to usersbased on a broadcast program. The program is constructed using knowledge of accessfrequencies; which is assumed to be available and accurate; on the broadcast data. Forexample; the program may broadcast frequently accessed data more often in a broadcastcycle. However; it remains an open question as to how to obtain such access frequencies.The difficulty of obtaining such access frequencies is that in such an environment; mobileusers are only listening to the channel they are interested in and do not request for the dataitems from the server. A promising approach in the literature is to make use of broadcastmisses to understand the access patterns in a data publishing environment. In this case;mobile users may decide whether to wait for the required item to arrive or to make an …,Wireless Networks,2000,35
Link prediction: the power of maximal entropy random walk,Rong-Hua Li; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Jianquan Liu,Abstract Link prediction is a fundamental problem in social network analysis. The keytechnique in unsupervised link prediction is to find an appropriate similarity measurebetween nodes of a network. A class of wildly used similarity measures are based onrandom walk on graph. The traditional random walk (TRW) considers the link structures bytreating all nodes in a network equivalently; and ignores the centrality of nodes of a network.However; in many real networks; nodes of a network not only prefer to link to the similarnode; but also prefer to link to the central nodes of the network. To address this issue; weuse maximal entropy random walk (MERW) for link prediction; which incorporates thecentrality of nodes of the network. First; we study certain important properties of MERW ongraph $ G $ by constructing an eigen-weighted graph G.

Effective schema-based XML query optimization techniques,Guoren Wang; Mengchi Liu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Bing Sun; Ge Yu; Jianhua Lv; Hongjun Lu,Use of path expressions is a common feature in most XML query languages; and manyevaluation methods for path expression queries have been proposed recently. However;there are few researches on the issue of optimizing regular path expression queries. In thispaper; two kinds of path expression optimization principles are proposed; named pathshortening and path complementing; respectively. The path shortening principle reduces thequerying cost by shortening the path expressions with the knowledge of XML schema. Whilethe path complementing principle substitutes the user queries with the equivalent lower-costpath expressions. The experimental results show that these two techniques can largelyimprove the performance of path expression query processing.,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2003. Proceedings.

Scalable diversified ranking on large graphs,Rong-Hua Li; Jeffery Xu Yu,Enhancing diversity in ranking on graphs has been identified as an important retrieval andmining task. Nevertheless; many existing diversified ranking algorithms either cannot bescalable to large graphs due to the time or memory requirements; or lack an intuitive andreasonable diversified ranking measure. In this paper; we propose a new diversified rankingmeasure on large graphs; which captures both relevance and diversity; and formulate thediversified ranking problem as a submodular set function maximization problem. Based onthe submodularity of the proposed measure; we develop an efficient greedy algorithm withlinear time and space complexity wrt the size of the graph to achieve near-optimal diversifiedranking. In addition; we present a generalized diversified ranking measure and give a near-optimal randomized greedy algorithm with linear time and space complexity for optimizing …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2013,33
Maximal subspace coregulated gene clustering,Yuhai Zhao; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Guoren Wang; Lei Chen; Bin Wang; Ge Yu,Clustering is a popular technique for analyzing microarray data sets; with n genes and mexperimental conditions. As explored by biologists; there is a real need to identifycoregulated gene clusters; which include both positive and negative regulated geneclusters. The existing pattern-based and tendency-based clustering approaches cannotdirectly be applied to find such coregulated gene clusters; because they are designed forfinding positive regulated gene clusters. In this paper; in order to cluster coregulated genes;we propose a coding scheme that allows us to cluster two genes into the same cluster if theyhave the same code; where two genes that have the same code can be either positive ornegative regulated. Based on the coding scheme; we propose a new algorithm for findingmaximal subspace coregulated gene clusters with new pruning techniques.

Sliding-window top-k queries on uncertain streams,Cheqing Jin; Ke Yi; Lei Chen; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Recently; due to the imprecise nature of the data generated from a variety ofstreaming applications; such as sensor networks; query processing on uncertain datastreams has become an important problem. However; all the existing works on uncertaindata streams study unbounded streams. In this paper; we take the first step towards theimportant and challenging problem of answering sliding-window queries on uncertain datastreams; with a focus on one of the most important types of queries--top-k queries. It isnontrivial to find an efficient solution for answering sliding-window top-k queries onuncertain data streams; because challenges not only stem from the strict space and timerequirements of processing both arriving and expiring tuples in high-speed streams; but alsorise from the exponential blowup in the number of possible worlds induced by the …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2010,32

The island size and island density was investigated by atomics forcemicroscopy. Ten-layer and twenty-layer MQW were selected for photodiode devicefabrication. In photoluminescence (PL); a broad peak around 1.55-μm wavelength wasobserved with higher peak intensity for the 10-layer MQW which had less defects than the 20-layer sample. Resonant cavity enhanced (RCE) photodiodes were fabricated by bonding ona SOI wafer. Selected responsivity at 1.55 μm was successfully demonstrated.,Thin Solid Films,2006,32

An efficient strategy for mining exceptions in multi-databases,Shichao Zhang; Chengqi Zhang; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract This paper proposes a new strategy; referred to as local instance analysis; for multi-database mining. While many interstate organizations have an imperative need to analyzetheir data in multi-databases distributed throughout their branches; traditional multi-database mining utilizes the strategies for mono-database mining: pooling all the data fromrelevant databases into a single dataset for discovery. This leads to the destruction of usefulinformation; for instance;70% of branches within a company agreed that a married customerusually has at least 2 cars if his/her age is between 45 and 65'. This information assists inglobal decision-making within the company. Our new strategy is developed for discoveringthis useful information. Using the local instance analysis; we design an algorithm foridentifying exceptions from multi-databases. Exceptional pattern reflects theindividuality'of …,Information Sciences,2004,32

Since thenumber of potential inter-transaction association rules tends to be extremely large; mininginter-transaction associations poses more challenges on efficient processing than miningintra-transaction associations. In order to make such association mining truly practical andcomputationally tractable; in this study; we present a template model to help users declarethe interesting inter-transaction associations to be mined.

Graph classification: a diversified discriminative feature selection approach,Yuanyuan Zhu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hong Cheng; Lu Qin,Abstract A graph models complex structural relationships among objects; and has beenprevalently used in a wide range of applications. Building an automated graph classificationmodel becomes very important for predicting unknown graphs or understanding complexstructures between different classes. The graph classification framework being widely usedconsists of two steps; namely; feature selection and classification. The key issue is how toselect important subgraph features from a graph database with a large number of graphsincluding positive graphs and negative graphs. Given the features selected; a genericclassification approach can be used to build a classification model. In this paper; we focuson feature selection.

Finding the influence set through skylines,Xiaobing Wu; Yufei Tao; Raymong Chi-Wing Wong; Ling Ding; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Given a set P of products; a set O of customers; and a product p ε P; a bichromaticreverse skyline query retrieves all the customers in O that do not find any other product in Pto be absolutely better than p. More specifically; a customer o ε O is in the reverse skyline ofp ε P if and only no other product in P better matches the preference of o on all dimensions.The only existing bichromatic reverse skyline algorithm; which we refer to as basic; isdesigned for uncertain data. This paper focuses on traditional datasets; where each object isa precise point. Since a precise point can be regarded as a special uncertain object; basiccan still be applied. However; as precise data are inherently easier to handle than uncertaindata; one should expect that basic can be further improved by taking advantage of thereduced problem complexity.

Top-k correlative graph mining,Yiping Ke; James Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Correlation mining has been widely studied due to its ability for discovering theunderlying occurrence dependency between objects. However; correlation mining in graphdatabases is expensive due to the complexity of graph data. In this paper; we study theproblem of mining top-k correlative subgraphs in the database; which share similaroccurrence distributions with a given query graph. The search space of the problem isprohibitively large since every subgraph in the database is a candidate. We propose anefficient algorithm; TopCor; which mines the top-k correlative graphs by exploring only thecandidate graphs in the projected database of a query graph.

Though studied for over thirty years inrdbms; the selection is hard to make in the context of xml databases; where both the semi-structured data and the expressiveness of xml query languages add challenges to the viewselection problem. We start our discussion on producing minimal xml views (in terms of size)as candidates for a given workload (a query set). To facilitate intuitionistic view selection; wepresent a view graph (called vcube) to structurally maintain all generated views. By basingour selection on vcube for materialization; we propose two view selection strategies;targeting at space-optimized and space-time tradeoff; respectively. We built our …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2009,30
Answering XML queries using path-based indexes: a survey,Kam-Fai Wong; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Nan Tang,Abstract The problem of answering XML queries using path-based indexes is to find efficientmethods for accelerating the XML query with pre-designed index structures over the XMLdatabase. This problem received increasing interests and have been lucubrated in recentyears. Regular path expression is the core of the XML query languages eg; XPath andXQuery. Most of the state-of-the-art path-based XML indexes; therefore; hammer at how toefficiently answer the path-based XML queries. This paper surveys various approaches toindexing XML data proposed in the literature. We give a step by step analysis to show theevolution of index structures for XML path information; based on tree structures or morecommonly; directed labeled graphs. For each approach; we first present the specific issue itaims to tackle; and then the proposed solution presented. Furthermore; construction …,World Wide Web,2006,30
What difference heuristics make: Maintenance-cost view-selection revisited,Chi-Hon Choi; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Gang Gou,Abstract The maintenance-cost view-selection problem is one of the important issues in datawarehouse design. It is to select a set of materialized views under a maintenance costconstraint (such as maintenance time); in order to minimize the total query processing costfor a given set of queries. The problem has recently received significant attention. Severalgreedy/heuristic algorithms were proposed. However; the quality of the greedy/heuristicalgorithms has not been well analyzed. In this paper; in a multidimensional data warehouseenvironment; we reexamine the greedy/heuristic algorithms in various settings; and provideusers with insights on the quality of these heuristic algorithms.,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2002,30
Scalable keyword search on large data streams,Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lijun Chang,Abstract It is widely recognized that the integration of information retrieval (IR) and database(DB) techniques provides users with a broad range of high quality services. Along thisdirection; IR-styled m-keyword query processing over a relational database in an rdbmsframework has been well studied. It finds all hidden interconnected tuple structures; forexample connected trees that contain keywords and are interconnected by sequences ofprimary/foreign key relationships among tuples. A new challenging issue is how to monitorevents that are implicitly interrelated over an open-ended relational data stream for a user-given m-keyword query. Such a relational data stream is a sequence of tupleinsertion/deletion operations. The difficulty of the problem is related to the number of costlyjoins to be processed over time when tuples are inserted and/or deleted. Such cost is …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2011,28
Influence maximization over large-scale social networks: A bounded linear approach,Qi Liu; Biao Xiang; Enhong Chen; Hui Xiong; Fangshuang Tang; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Information diffusion in social networks is emerging as a promising solution tosuccessful viral marketing; which relies on the effective and efficient identification of a set ofnodes with the maximal social influence. While there are tremendous efforts on thedevelopment of social influence models and algorithms for social influence maximization;limited progress has been made in terms of designing both efficient and effective algorithmsfor finding a set of nodes with the maximal social influence. To this end; in this paper; weprovide a bounded linear approach for influence computation and influence maximization.Specifically; we first adopt a linear and tractable approach to describe the influencepropagation. Then; we develop a quantitative metric; named Group-PageRank; to quicklyestimate the upper bound of the social influence based on this linear approach.

Approximate closest community search in networks,Xin Huang; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hong Cheng,Abstract Recently; there has been significant interest in the study of the community searchproblem in social and information networks: given one or more query nodes; find denselyconnected communities containing the query nodes. However; most existing studies do notaddress the" free rider" issue; that is; nodes far away from query nodes and irrelevant tothem are included in the detected community. Some state-of-the-art models have attemptedto address this issue; but not only are their formulated problems NP-hard; they do not admitany approximations without restrictive assumptions; which may not always hold in practice.In this paper; given an undirected graph G and a set of query nodes Q; we study communitysearch using the k-truss based community model. We formulate our problem of finding aclosest truss community (CTC); as finding a connected k-truss subgraph with the largest k …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,26
Multiscale representations for fast pattern matching in stream time series,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Jinsong Han; Jian Ma,Similarity-based time-series retrieval has been a subject of long-term study due to its wideusage in many applications; such as financial data analysis; weather data forecasting; andmultimedia data retrieval. Its original task was to find those time series similar to a pattern(query) time-series data; where both the pattern and data time series are static. Recently;with an increasing demand on stream data management; similarity-based stream time-series retrieval has raised new research issues due to its unique requirements during thestream processing; such as one-pass search and fast response. In this paper; we addressthe problem of matching both static and dynamic patterns over stream time-series data. Wewill develop a novel multiscale representation; called multiscale segment mean; for streamtime-series data; which can be incrementally computed and thus perfectly adapted to the …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2009,26
Query ranking in probabilistic xml data,Lijun Chang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lu Qin,Abstract Twig queries have been extensively studied as a major fragment of XPATH queriesto query XML data. In this paper; we study PXML-RANK query;(Q; k); which is to rank top-kprobabilities of the answers of a twig query Q in probabilistic XML (PXML) data. A newresearch issue is how to compute top-k probabilities of answers of a twig query Q in PXML inthe presence of containment (ancestor/descendant) relationships. In the presence of theancestor/descendant relationships; the existing dynamic programming approaches to ranktop-k probabilities over a set of tuples cannot be directly applied; because any node/edge inPXML may have impacts on the top-k probabilities of answers. We propose new algorithmsto compute PXML-RANK queries efficiently and give conditions under which a PXML-RANKquery can be processed efficiently without enumeration of all the possible worlds.

WIN: An efficient data placement strategy for parallel XML databases,Nan Tang; Guoren Wang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Kam-Fai Wong; Ge Yu,The basic idea behind parallel database systems is to perform operations in parallel toreduce the response time and improve the system throughput. Data placement is a keyfactor on the overall performance of parallel systems. XML is semistructured data; traditionaldata placement strategies cannot serve it well. In this paper; we present the concept ofintermediary node I Node; and propose a novel workload-aware data placement WIN toeffectively decluster XML data; to obtain high intra query parallelism. The extensiveexperiments show that the speedup and scale up performance of WIN outperforms theprevious strategies.,Parallel and Distributed Systems; 2005.

Classifying text streams in the presence of concept drifts,Gabriel Pui Cheong Fung; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hongjun Lu,Abstract Concept drifting is always an interesting problem. For instance; a user is interestedin a set of topics; X; for a period; may switches to a different set of topics; Y; in the nextperiod. In this paper; we focus on two issues of concept drifts; namely; concept driftsdetection and model adaptation in a text stream context. We use statistical control to detectconcept drifts; and propose a new multi-classifier strategy for model adaptation.

Discriminative category matching: Efficient text classification for huge document collections,Gabriel Pui Cheong Fung; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hongjun Lu,With the rapid growth of textual information available on the Internet; having a good modelfor classifying and managing documents automatically is undoubtedly important. When moredocuments are archived; new terms; new concepts and concept-drift will frequently appearWithout a doubt; updating the classification model frequently; rather than using the oldmodel for a very long period is absolutely essential. Here; the challenges are: a) obtain ahigh accuracy classification model; b) consume low computational time for both modeltraining and operation; and c) occupy low storage space. However; none of the existingclassification approaches could achieve all of these requirements. In this paper; we proposea novel text classification approach; called discriminative category matching; which couldachieve all of the stated characteristics.

Top-k nearest keyword search on large graphs,Miao Qiao; Lu Qin; Hong Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Wentao Tian,Abstract It is quite common for networks emerging nowadays to have labels or textualcontents on the nodes. On such networks; we study the problem of top-k nearest keyword (k-NK) search. In a network G modeled as an undirected graph; each node is attached withzero or more keywords; and each edge is assigned with a weight measuring its length.Given a query node q in G and a keyword λ; a k-NK query seeks k nodes which contain λand are nearest to q. k-NK is not only useful as a stand-alone query but also as a buildingblock for tackling complex graph pattern matching problems. The key to an accurate k-NKresult is a precise shortest distance estimation in a graph. Based on the latest distanceoracle technique; we build a shortest path tree for a distance oracle and use the treedistance as a more accurate estimation. With such representation; the original k-NK query …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,25
Top-k graph pattern matching over large graphs,Jiefeng Cheng; Xianggang Zeng; Jeffrey Xu Yu,There exist many graph-based applications including bioinformatics; social science; linkanalysis; citation analysis; and collaborative work. All need to deal with a large data graph.Given a large data graph; in this paper; we study finding top-k answers for a graph patternquery (kGPM); and in particular; we focus on top-k cyclic graph queries where a graph queryis cyclic and can be complex. The capability of supporting kGPM provides much moreflexibility for a user to search graphs. And the problem itself is challenging. In this paper; wepropose a new framework of processing kGPM with on-the-fly ranked lists based onspanning trees of the cyclic graph query. We observe a multidimensional representation forusing multiple ranked lists to answer a given kGPM query. Under this representation; wepropose a cost model to estimate the least number of tree answers to be consumed in …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,25
TreeSpan: efficiently computing similarity all-matching,Gaoping Zhu; Xuemin Lin; Ke Zhu; Wenjie Zhang; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Given a query graph $ q $ and a data graph G; computing all occurrences of q in G;namely exact all-matching; is fundamental in graph data analysis with a wide spectrum ofreal applications. It is challenging since even finding one occurrence of q in G (subgraphisomorphism test) is NP-Complete. Consider that in many real applications; exploratoryqueries from users are often inaccurate to express their real demands. In this paper; westudy the problem of efficiently computing all approximate occurrences of q in G. Particularly;we study the problem of efficiently retrieving all matches of q in G with the number ofpossible missing edges bounded by a given threshold θ; namely similarity all-matching. Theproblem of similarity all-matching is harder than the problem of exact all-matching since itcovers the problem of exact all-matching as a special case with θ= 0.

From path tree to frequent patterns: A framework for mining frequent patterns,Yabo Xu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Guimei Liu; Hongjun Lu,We propose a framework for mining frequent patterns from large transactional databases.The core of the framework is a coded prefix-path tree with two representations; namely; amemory-based prefix-path tree and a disk-based prefix-path tree. The disk-based prefix-pathtree is simple in its data structure yet rich in information contained; and is small in size. Thememory-based prefix-path tree is simple and compact. Based on the memory-based prefix-path tree; a new depth-first frequent pattern discovery algorithm; called PP-Mine; isproposed that outperforms FP-growth significantly. The memory-based prefix-path tree canbe stored on disk using a disk-based prefix-path tree with assistance of the new codingscheme. We present loading algorithms to load the minimal required disk-based prefix-pathtree into main memory. Our technique is to push constraints into the loading process …,Data Mining; 2002. ICDM 2003.

MOCgraph: Scalable distributed graph processing using message online computing,Chang Zhou; Jun Gao; Binbin Sun; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Existing distributed graph processing frameworks; eg; Pregel; Giraph; GPS andGraphLab; mainly exploit main memory to support flexible graph operations for efficiency.Due to the complexity of graph analytics; huge memory space is required especially forthose graph analytics that spawn large intermediate results. Existing frameworks mayterminate abnormally or degrade performance seriously when the memory is exhausted orthe external storage has to be used. In this paper; we propose MOCgraph; a scalabledistributed graph processing framework to reduce the memory footprint and improve thescalability; based on message online computing. MOCgraph consumes incoming messagesin a streaming manner; so as to handle larger graphs or more complex analytics with thesame memory capacity. MOCgraph also exploits message online computing with external …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,24
Fast maximal cliques enumeration in sparse graphs,Lijun Chang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lu Qin,Abstract In this paper; we consider the problem of generating all maximal cliques in a sparsegraph in polynomial delay. Given a graph G=(V; E) with n vertices and m edges; the latestand fastest polynomial delay algorithm for sparse graphs enumerates all maximal cliques inO (Δ 4) time delay; where Δ is the maximum degree of vertices. However; it requires an O(n⋅ m) preprocessing time. We improve it in two aspects. First; our algorithm does not needpreprocessing. Therefore; our algorithm is a truly polynomial delay algorithm. Second; ouralgorithm enumerates all maximal cliques in O (Δ⋅ H 3) time delay; where H is the so calledH-value of a graph or equivalently it is the smallest integer satisfying|{v∈ V∣ δ (v)≥ H}|≤ Hgiven δ (v) as the degree of a vertex. In real-world network data; H usually is a small valueand much smaller than Δ.,Algorithmica,2013,24

Efficient discovery of frequent correlated subgraph pairs,Yiping Ke; James Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu,The recent proliferation of graph data in a wide spectrum of applications has led to anincreasing demand for advanced data analysis techniques. In view of this; many graphmining techniques; such as frequent subgraph mining and correlated subgraph mining;have been proposed. In many applications; both frequency and correlation play an importantrole. Thus; this paper studies a new problem of mining the set of frequent correlatedsubgraph pairs. A simple algorithm that combines existing algorithms for mining frequentsubgraphs and correlated subgraphs results in a multiplication of the mining operations; themajority of which are redundant. We discover that most of the graphs correlated to acommon graph are also highly correlated.

Text classification without labeled negative documents,Gabriel Pui Cheong Fung; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hongjun Lu; Philip S Yu,This paper presents a new solution for the problem of building a text classifier with a smallyet of labeled positive documents (P) and a large set of unlabeled documents (U). Here; theunlabeled documents are mixed with both of the positive and negative documents. In otherwords; no document is labeled as negative. This makes the task of building a reliable textclassifier challenging. In general; the existing approaches for solving this kind of problemuse a two-step approach: i) extract the negative documents (N) from U; and ii) build aclassifier based on P and N. However; none of the reported studies tries to further extractany positive documents (P') from U. Intuitively; extracting P'from U will increase the reliabilityof the classifier. However; extracting P'from U is difficult. A document in U that possessessome of the features exhibited in P does not necessarily mean that it is a positive …,Data Engineering; 2005. ICDE 2005.

Graph pattern matching: A join/semijoin approach,Jiefeng Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu; S Yu Philip,Due to rapid growth of the Internet and new scientific/technological advances; there existmany new applications that model data as graphs; because graphs have sufficientexpressiveness to model complicated structures. The dominance of graphs in real-worldapplications demands new graph processing techniques to access large data graphseffectively and efficiently. In this paper; we study a graph pattern matching problem; which isto find all patterns in a large data graph that match a user-given graph pattern. We proposenew two-step R-join (reachability join) algorithms with a filter step (R-semijoin) and a fetchstep (R-join) by utilizing a new cluster-based join index with graph codes in a relationaldatabase context.

Pattern matching over cloaked time series,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen; Jeffrey Xu Yu,In many privacy preserving applications such as Location-Based Services (LBS); medicaldata analysis; and data sequence matching; users often deliberately disturb the original datain order to avoid the release of their private information. Although these disturbed cloakeddata cannot reveal the privacy information of individual users; they can still help performsome data mining tasks such as data classification. In this paper; we study one importantand fundamental query predicate; that is; to find the cloaked time series that are similar to aquery pattern. In this paper; we formalize such similarity search problem over the cloakedtime series; and propose a novel approach to index the cloaked series; which can facilitatethe similarity query.,Data Engineering; 2008.

Locating motifs in time-series data,Zheng Liu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xuemin Lin; Hongjun Lu; Wei Wang,Abstract Finding motifs in time-series is proposed to make clustering of time-seriessubsequences meaningful; because most existing algorithms of clustering time-seriessubsequences are reported meaningless in recent studies. The existing motif findingalgorithms emphasize the efficiency at the expense of quality; in terms of the number of time-series subsequences in a motif and the total number of motifs found. In this paper; weformalize the problem as a continuous top-k motif balls problem in an m-dimensional space;and propose heuristic approaches that can significantly improve the quality of motifs withreasonable overhead; as shown in our experimental studies.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2005,23
Reachability querying: An independent permutation labeling approach,Hao Wei; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Can Lu; Ruoming Jin,Abstract Reachability query is a fundamental graph operation which answers whether avertex can reach another vertex over a large directed graph G with n vertices and m edgesand has been extensively studied. In the literature; all the approaches compute a label forevery vertex in a graph G by index construction offline. The query time for answeringreachability queries online is affected by the quality of the labels computed in indexconstruction. The three main costs are the index construction time; the index size; and thequery time. Some of the up-to-date approaches can answer reachability queries efficiently;but spend nonlinear time to construct an index. Some of the up-to-date approaches constructan index in linear time and space; but may need to depth-first search G at run-time in O (n+m) O (n+ m).

The exact distance to destination in undirected world,Lijun Chang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lu Qin; Hong Cheng; Miao Qiao,Abstract Shortest distance queries are essential not only in graph analysis and graph miningtasks but also in database applications; when a large graph needs to be dealt with. Suchshortest distance queries are frequently issued by end-users or requested as a subroutine inreal applications. For intensive queries on large graphs; it is impractical to compute shortestdistances on-line from scratch; and impractical to materialize all-pairs shortest distances. Inthe literature; 2-hop distance labeling is proposed to index the all-pairs shortest distances. Itassigns distance labels to vertices in a large graph in a pre-computing step off-line and thenanswers shortest distance queries on-line by making use of such distance labels; whichavoids exhaustively traversing the large graph when answering queries.

Clustering large attributed information networks: an efficient incremental computing approach,Hong Cheng; Yang Zhou; Xin Huang; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract In recent years; many information networks have become available for analysis;including social networks; road networks; sensor networks; biological networks; etc. Graphclustering has shown its effectiveness in analyzing and visualizing large networks. The goalof graph clustering is to partition vertices in a large graph into clusters based on variouscriteria such as vertex connectivity or neighborhood similarity. Many existing graphclustering methods mainly focus on the topological structures; but largely ignore the vertexproperties which are often heterogeneous. Recently; a new graph clustering algorithm; SA-cluster; has been proposed which combines structural and attribute similarities through aunified distance measure. SA-Cluster performs matrix multiplication to calculate the randomwalk distances between graph vertices. As part of the clustering refinement; the graph …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2012,22

In this paper; we propose a new approach to answer shortest pathand shortest path distance queries efficiently with an error bound. The error bound iscontrolled by a user-specified parameter; and the online query efficiency is achieved withprepossessing offline. In the offline preprocessing; we take a reference node embeddingapproach which computes the single-source shortest paths from each reference node to allthe other nodes. To guarantee the user-specified error bound; we design a novel coverage-based reference node selection strategy; and show that selecting the optimal set ofreference nodes is NP-hard.

Adaptive relaxation for querying heterogeneous XML data sources,Chengfei Liu; Jianxin Li; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Rui Zhou,Abstract Searching XML data with a structured XML query can improve the precision ofresults compared with a keyword search. However; the structural heterogeneity of the largenumber of XML data sources makes it difficult to answer the structured query exactly. Assuch; query relaxation is necessary. Previous work on XML query relaxation poses theproblem of unnecessary computation of a big number of unqualified relaxed queries. Toaddress this issue; we propose an adaptive relaxation approach which relaxes a queryagainst different data sources differently based on their conformed schemas. In this paper;we present a set of techniques that supports this approach; which includes schema-awarerelaxation rules for relaxing a query adaptively; a weighted model for ranking relaxedqueries; and algorithms for adaptive relaxation of a query and top-k query processing.

Context-based diversification for keyword queries over XML data,Jianxin Li; Chengfei Liu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,While keyword query empowers ordinary users to search vast amount of data; the ambiguityof keyword query makes it difficult to effectively answer keyword queries; especially for shortand vague keyword queries. To address this challenging problem; in this paper we proposean approach that automatically diversifies XML keyword search based on its differentcontexts in the XML data. Given a short and vague keyword query and XML data to besearched; we first derive keyword search candidates of the query by a simple featureselection model.

Top-k structural diversity search in large networks,Xin Huang; Hong Cheng; Rong-Hua Li; Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Social contagion depicts a process of information (eg; fads; opinions; news)diffusion in the online social networks. A recent study reports that in a social contagionprocess the probability of contagion is tightly controlled by the number of connectedcomponents in an individual's neighborhood. Such a number is termed structural diversity ofan individual and it is shown to be a key predictor in the social contagion process. Based onthis; a fundamental issue in a social network is to find top-k users with the highest structuraldiversities. In this paper; we; for the first time; study the top-k structural diversity searchproblem in a large network. Specifically; we develop an effective upper bound of structuraldiversity for pruning the search space. The upper bound can be incrementally refined in thesearch process. Based on such upper bound; we propose an efficient framework for top-k …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,20
Ten thousand SQLs: parallel keyword queries computing,Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lijun Chang,Abstract Keyword search in relational databases has been extensively studied. Given arelational database; a keyword query finds a set of interconnected tuple structuresconnected by foreign key references. On rdbms; a keyword query is processed in two steps;namely; candidate networks (CNs) generation and CNs evaluation; where a CN is an sql. Incommon; a keyword query needs to be processed using over 10;000 sqls.

Detecting leaders from correlated time series,Di Wu; Yiping Ke; Jeffrey Xu Yu; S Yu Philip; Lei Chen,Abstract Analyzing the relationships of time series is an important problem for manyapplications; including climate monitoring; stock investment; traffic control; etc. Existingresearch mainly focuses on studying the relationship between a pair of time series. In thispaper; we study the problem of discovering leaders among a set of time series by analyzinglead-lag relations. A time series is considered to be one of the leaders if its rise or fallimpacts the behavior of many other time series. At each time point; we compute the laggedcorrelation between each pair of time series and model them in a graph. Then; theleadership rank is computed from the graph; which brings order to time series. Based on theleadership ranking; the leaders of time series are extracted. However; the problem posesgreat challenges as time goes by; since the dynamic nature of time series results in highly …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,20
UD (k; l)-index: An efficient approximate index for xml data,Hongwei Wu; Qing Wang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Aoying Zhou; Shuigeng Zhou,Abstract XML has become the main standard of data presentation and exchange on theInternet. Processing path expressions plays a key role in XML queries evaluation. Pathindices can speed up path expressions evaluation on XML data by restricting search only tothe relevant portion. However; to answer all path expressions accurately; traditional pathindices group data nodes according to the paths from the root of the data graph to the nodesin question; regardless of the paths fanning out from these nodes. This leads to large indicessize and low efficiency of branching path expressions evaluation. In this paper; we presentUD (k; l)-indices; a family of efficient approximate index structures in which data nodes aregrouped according to their incoming paths of length up to k and outgoing paths of length upto l. UD (k; l)-indices fully exploit local similarity of XML data nodes on their upward and …,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2003,20
Multi-cube computation,J Xu Yu; Hongjun Lu,Computing an n-attribute datacube requires the computation of an aggregate function overall groups generated by 2/sup n/interrelated GROUP-BYs. In this paper; we focus on multi-cube computation. We extend the algorithms for single datacube computation to processmultiple datacubes simultaneously. The issue we intend to explore is the memory utilization.We propose two multi-cube algorithms; namely; a sort-based algorithm and a hash-basedalgorithm. Different data skews and sparsities are investigated. Results from our extensiveperformance studies are reported.,Database Systems for Advanced Applications; 2001. Proceedings.

Dense community detection in multi-valued attributed networks,Xin Huang; Hong Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract The proliferation of rich information available for real world entities and theirrelationships gives rise to a general type of graph; namely multi-valued attributed graph;where graph vertices are associated with a number of attributes and a vertex may havemultiple values on an attribute. It would be useful if we can cluster such graphs into denselyconnected components with homogeneous attribute values. Recent work has studied graphclustering in attributed graphs considering the full attribute space. However; full spaceclustering often leads to poor results due to irrelevant attributes. In this paper; we studysubspace clustering in multi-valued attributed graph and propose an algorithm SCMAG forcommunity detection. Our algorithm uses a cell-based subspace clustering approach andidentifies cells with dense connectivity in the subspaces. Random walk with restart is …,Information Sciences,2015,19
Efficient clustering of uncertain data streams,Cheqing Jin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Aoying Zhou; Feng Cao,Abstract Clustering uncertain data streams has recently become one of the most challengingtasks in data management because of the strict space and time requirements of processingtuples arriving at high speed and the difficulty that arises from handling uncertain data. Theprior work on clustering data streams focuses on devising complicated synopsis datastructures to summarize data streams into a small number of micro-clusters so that importantstatistics can be computed conveniently; such as Clustering Feature (CF)(Zhang et al. inProceedings of ACM SIGMOD; pp 103–114; 1996) for deterministic data and Error-basedClustering Feature (E CF)(Aggarwal and Yu in Proceedings of ICDE; 2008) for uncertaindata. However; E CF can only handle attribute-level uncertainty; while existentialuncertainty; the other kind of uncertainty; has not been addressed yet. In this paper; we …,Knowledge and information systems,2014,19
Mining most frequently changing component in evolving graphs,Yajun Yang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hong Gao; Jian Pei; Jianzhong Li,Abstract Many applications see huge demands of finding important changing areas inevolving graphs. In this paper; given a series of snapshots of an evolving graph; we modeland develop algorithms to capture the most frequently changing component (MFCC).Motivated by the intuition that the MFCC should capture the densest area of changes in anevolving graph; we propose a simple yet effective model. Using only one parameter; userscan control tradeoffs between the “density” of the changes and the size of the detected area.We verify the effectiveness and the efficiency of our approach on real data setssystematically.,World Wide Web,2014,19
Answering label-constraint reachability in large graphs,Kun Xu; Lei Zou; Jeffery Xu Yu; Lei Chen; Yanghua Xiao; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract In this paper; we study a variant of reachability queries; called label-constraintreachability (LCR) queries; specifically; given a label set S and two vertices u1 and u2 in alarge directed graph G; we verify whether there exists a path from u1 to u2 under labelconstraint S. Like traditional reachability queries; LCR queries are very useful; such aspathway finding in biological networks; inferring over RDF (resource description f ramework)graphs; relationship finding in social networks. However; LCR queries are much morecomplicated than their traditional counterpart. Several techniques are proposed in this paperto minimize the search space in computing path-label transitive closure. Furthermore; wedemonstrate the superiority of our method by extensive experiments.,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,19
Query translation from XPath to SQL in the presence of recursive DTDs,Wenfei Fan; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Jianzhong Li; Bolin Ding; Lu Qin,Abstract We study the problem of evaluating xp ath queries over xml data that is stored in anrdbms via schema-based shredding. The interaction between recursion (descendants-axis)in xp ath queries and recursion in dtd s makes it challenging to answer xp ath queries usingrdbms. We present a new approach to translating xp ath queries into sql queries based on anotion of extended XP ath expressions and a simple least fixpoint (lfp) operator. Extended xpath expressions are a mild extension of xp ath; and the lfp operator takes a single inputrelation and is already supported by most commercial rdbms. We show that extended xp athexpressions are capable of capturing both dtd recursion and xp ath queries in a uniformframework. Furthermore; they can be translated into an equivalent sequence of sql querieswith the lfp operator. We present algorithms for rewriting xp ath queries over a (possibly …,The VLDB Journal,2009,19

Matching top-k answers of twig patterns in probabilistic XML,Bo Ning; Chengfei Liu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Guoren Wang; Jianxin Li,Abstract The flexibility of XML data model allows a more natural representation of uncertaindata compared with the relational model. The top-k matching of a twig pattern againstprobabilistic XML data is essential. Some classical twig pattern algorithms can be adjustedto process the probabilistic XML. However; as far as finding answers of the top-kprobabilities is concerned; the existing algorithms suffer in performance; because manyunnecessary intermediate path results; with small probabilities; need to be processed. Tocope with this problem; we propose a new encoding scheme called PEDewey forprobabilistic XML in this paper. Based on this encoding scheme; we then design twoalgorithms for finding answers of top-k probabilities for twig queries. One is called ProTJFast;to process probabilistic XML data based on element streams in document order; and the …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,18
A balanced ensemble approach to weighting classifiers for text classification,Gabriel Pui Cheong Fung; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Haixun Wang; David W Cheung; Huan Liu,This paper studies the problem of constructing an effective heterogeneous ensembleclassifier for text classification. One major challenge of this problem is to formulate a goodcombination function; which combines the decisions of the individual classifiers in theensemble. We show that the classification performance is affected by three weightcomponents and they should be included in deriving an effective combination function. Theyare:(1) Global effectiveness; which measures the effectiveness of a member classifier inclassifying a set of unseen documents;(2) Local effectiveness; which measures theeffectiveness of a member classifier in classifying the particular domain of an unseendocument; and (3) Decision confidence; which describes how confident a classifier is whenmaking a decision when classifying a specific unseen document.

Fully dynamic partitioning: Handling data skew in parallel data cube computation,Hongjun Lu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Ling Feng; Zhixian Li,Abstract Parallel data processing is a promising approach for efficiently computing datacube in relational databases; because most aggregate functions used in OLAP (On-LineAnalytical Processing) are distributive functions. This paper studies the issues of handlingdata skew in parallel data cube computation. We present a fully dynamic partitioningapproach that can effectively distribute workload among processing nodes without prioriknowledge of data distribution. As supplement; a simple and effective dynamic loadbalancing mechanism is also incorporated into our algorithm; which further improves theoverall performance. Our experimental results indicated that the proposed techniques areeffective even when high data skew exists. The results of scale-up and speedup tests arealso satisfactory.,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2003,18
Effects of four different drying methods on the quality characteristics of peeled litchis (Litchi chinensis Sonn.),Chun Fang Song; ZhengWei Cui; Guang Yuan Jin; Arun S Mujumdar; Jian Feng Yu,Four different drying methods; namely; air drying (AD); microwave-assisted vacuum drying(MWVD); coupled microwave–hot air drying (MWAD); and freeze drying (FD); were studied;in terms of drying time; color; reducing sugar content; shrinkage; microstructure; and sensoryevaluation. The drying rate of MWVD and MWAD were notably faster than that of AD and FD.The highest reducing sugar content was observed in MWAD; followed by MWVD. Nosignificant differences were observed in reducing sugar between air-dried and freeze-driedproducts. FD had the best color and shrinkage among the other drying methods. The colorand shrinkage of MWVD drying is close to the fresh litchis and much better than hot air andMWAD. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that the MWVD and FD litchishave a porous structure; whereas AD and MWAD litchis have a compact structure. The …,Drying technology,2015,17
Quasi-SLCA based keyword query processing over probabilistic XML data,Jianxin Li; Chengfei Liu; Rui Zhou; Jeffrey Xu Yu,The probabilistic threshold query is one of the most common queries in uncertain databases;where a result satisfying the query must be also with probability meeting the thresholdrequirement. In this paper; we investigate probabilistic threshold keyword queries (PrTKQ)over XML data; which is not studied before. We first introduce the notion of quasi-SLCA anduse it to represent results for a PrTKQ with the consideration of possible world semantics.Then we design a probabilistic inverted (PI) index that can be used to quickly return thequalified answers and filter out the unqualified ones based on our proposed lower/upperbounds. After that; we propose two efficient and comparable algorithms: Baseline Algorithmand PI index-based Algorithm. To accelerate the performance of algorithms; we also utilizeprobability density function.

ELCA evaluation for keyword search on probabilistic XML data,Rui Zhou; Chengfei Liu; Jianxin Li; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract As probabilistic data management is becoming one of the main research focusesand keyword search is turning into a more popular query means; it is natural to think how tosupport keyword queries on probabilistic XML data. With regards to keyword query ondeterministic XML documents; ELCA (Exclusive Lowest Common Ancestor) semanticsallows more relevant fragments rooted at the ELCAs to appear as results and is morepopular compared with other keyword query result semantics (such as SLCAs). In this paper;we investigate how to evaluate ELCA results for keyword queries on probabilistic XMLdocuments. After defining probabilistic ELCA semantics in terms of possible worldsemantics; we propose an approach to compute ELCA probabilities without generatingpossible worlds. Then we develop an efficient stack-based algorithm that can find all …,World Wide Web,2013,17
Energy-efficient skyline query optimization in wireless sensor networks,Baichen Chen; Weifa Liang; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract With the deployment of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for environmentalmonitoring and event surveillance; WSNs can be treated as virtual databases to respond touser queries. It thus becomes more urgent that such databases are able to supportcomplicated queries like skyline queries. Skyline query which is one of popular queries formulti-criteria decision making has received much attention in the past several years. In thispaper we study skyline query optimization and maintenance in WSNs. Specifically; we firstconsider skyline query evaluation on a snapshot dataset; by devising two algorithms forfinding skyline points progressively without examining the entire dataset. Two key strategiesare adopted: One is to partition the dataset into several disjoint subsets and produce theskyline points in each subset progressively. Another is to employ a global filter that …,Wireless Networks,2012,17
Teaching embedded software concepts using Android,Jogesh K Muppala,Abstract Does smartphone application development provide an opportunity to explorevarious aspects of embedded software? This question is the primary motivator behind theideas explored in this paper. We cannot deny the ubiquitous nature of smartphones.Leveraging on this already available" platform" to convey embedded software concepts toComputer Science (CS) students seems an exciting opportunity. Traditionally CS have oftenshied away from the field of embedded systems owing to their perception of this area as"hardware" oriented; not without reason. We explore the Android platform as a means ofadvancing embedded software concepts to CS students.,Proceedings of the 6th Workshop on Embedded Systems Education,2011,17
Synthesis; electron mobility; and electroluminescence of a polynorbornene-supported silole,Xiaowei Zhan; Andreas Haldi; Junsheng Yu; Takeshi Kondo; Benoit Domercq; Jian-Yang Cho; Stephen Barlow; Bernard Kippelen; Seth R Marder,Abstract A solution-processable polynorbornene with pendant fluorescent and electron-transport silole groups was synthesized using ruthenium-complex-initiated ring-openingmetathesis polymerization. A weight-average molecular weight around 59;300 and a lowpolydispersity index of 1.4 were estimated for the polymer using gel permeationchromatography. The thermal; electronic; photo-and electroluminescence properties of thepolymer were investigated and compared with those of a small-molecule referencecompound. The polymer exhibits better thermal stability than the small molecule and exhibitsa glass transition temperature of 91° C; while retaining the optical and electronic propertiesof the corresponding small-molecule silole.

Organic field-effect transistors (OFET) are fabricated from TPD thinfilms and their electrical properties characterized. The comparative results show that all-electrical measurements that involve carrier injection from a metal electrode into the organicfilm yield effective mobility values that are one order of magnitude lower than those obtainedfrom time-of-flight experiments in which carriers are created in the film optically.

Divide-and-approximate: A novel constraint push strategy for iceberg cube mining,Ke Wang; Yuelong Jiang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Guozhu Dong; Jiawei Han,The iceberg cube mining computes all cells v; corresponding to GROUP BY partitions; thatsatisfy a given constraint on aggregated behaviors of the tuples in a GROUP BY partition.The number of cells often is so large that the result cannot be realistically searched withoutpushing the constraint into the search. Previous works have pushed antimonotone andmonotone constraints. However; many useful constraints are neither antimonotone normonotone. We consider a general class of aggregate constraints of the form f (v)/spltheta//spl sigma/; where f is an arithmetic function of SQL-like aggregates and/spl theta/isone of<;/spl les/;/spl ges/>.

MB+ tree: A dynamically updatable metric index for similarity search,Masahiro Ishikawa; Hanxiong Chen; Kazutaka Furuse; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Nobuo Ohbo,Abstract One of the common query patterns is to find approximate matches to a given queryobject in a large database. This kind of query processing is referred as similarity search in ametric space. In this paper; we propose a new metric index MB+ tree; called Metric B+ tree;which supports near neighbour searching in a generic metric space. MB+ tree is aimed atreducing both the number of I/O accesses and the number of distance calculations forsimilarity search in large databases; while allowing dynamic data updates. In this paper; weshow that a B+ tree; with an auxiliary tree; can be used as a metric index. Unlike othermultidimensional (spatial) access methods; using our approach; we can partition data intodisjoint partitions while building/maintaining a metric index; which can lead to a significantcost reduction since the number of metric sub-spaces to be searched is reduced.

Measuring the impact of MVC attack in large complex networks,Rong-Hua Li; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xin Huang; Hong Cheng; Zechao Shang,Abstract Measuring the impact of network attack is an important issue in network science. Inthis paper; we study the impact of maximal vertex coverage (MVC) attack in large complexnetworks; where the attacker aims at deleting as many edges of the network as possible byattacking a small fraction of nodes. First; we present two metrics to measure the impact ofMVC attack. To compute these metrics; we propose an efficient randomized greedyalgorithm with near-optimal performance guarantee. Second; we generalize the MVC attackinto an uncertain setting; in which a node is deleted by the attacker with a prior probability.We refer to the MVC attack under such uncertain environment as the probabilistic MVCattack. Based on the probabilistic MVC attack; we propose two adaptive metrics; and thenpresent an adaptive greedy algorithm for calculating such metrics accurately and …,Information Sciences,2014,16
Answering tree pattern queries using views: a revisit,Junhu Wang; Jiang Li; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract We revisit the problem of answering tree pattern queries using views. We first showthat; for queries and views that do not have nodes labeled with the wildcard*; there is analternative to the approach of query rewriting which does not require us to find any rewritingsexplicitly yet which produces the same answers as the maximal contained rewriting. Then;using the new approach; we give a simple criterion and a corresponding algorithm foridentifying redundant view answers; which are view answers that can be ignored whenevaluating the maximal contained rewriting. Finally; for queries and views that do havenodes labeled*; we provide a method to find the maximal contained rewriting and show howto answer the query using views without explicitly finding the rewritings.,Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2011,16
Top-k query evaluation in sensor networks under query response time constraint,Weifa Liang; Baichen Chen; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Top-k query in a wireless sensor network is to find the k sensor nodes with thehighest sensing values. To evaluate the top-k query in such an energy-constrained networkposes great challenges; due to the unique characteristics imposed on its sensors. Existingsolutions for top-k query in the literature mainly focused on energy efficiency but littleattention has been paid to the query response time and its effect on the network lifetime. Inthis paper we address the query response time and its effect on the network lifetime throughthe study of the top-k query problem in sensor networks with the response time constraint.We aim at finding an energy-efficient routing tree and evaluating top-k queries on the treesuch that the network lifetime is significantly prolonged; provided that the query responsetime constraint is met too. To do so; we first present a cost model of energy consumption …,Information Sciences,2011,16

Previous work has considered the rewriting problem using asingle view. We consider two different ways of combining multiple views; define rewritings ofa tree pattern using these combinations; and study the relationship between them. We showthat when rewritings using single views do not exist; we may use such combinations ofmultiple views to rewrite a query; and even if rewritings using single views do exist; therewritings using combinations of multiple views may provide more answers than thoseprovided by the union of the rewritings using the individual views. We also study propertiesof intersections of tree patterns; and present algorithms for finding rewritings usingintersections of views.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2008,16

Statistical estimation of access frequencies: Problems; solutions and consistencies,Toshio Sakata; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract In a wireless environment; a server periodically broadcasts data to users under anassumption that accurate access frequencies are known. The server broadcasts frequentlyaccessed data more often in a broadcast cycle. The difficulty of obtaining such accessfrequencies is that; in a wireless environment; mobile users are only listening to the channelthey are interested in and do not request the data items from the server. An approach in theliterature is to make use of broadcast misses to understand the access patterns. In brief;mobile users may decide whether to wait for the required item to arrive (with uncertaintywhether it will arrive soon or not) or to make an explicit request for it even though it will bebroadcasted soon. In this paper; we extend our early work on access frequency estimations.First; we consider two cases:(a) a mobile user will make an explicit request when he/she …,Wireless Networks,2003,16
A topic-biased user reputation model in rating systems,Baichuan Li; Rong-Hua Li; Irwin King; Michael R Lyu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract In rating systems like Epinions and Amazon's product review systems; users rateitems on different topics to yield item scores. Traditionally; item scores are estimated byaveraging all the ratings with equal weights. To improve the accuracy of estimated itemscores; user reputation [aka; user reputation (UR)] is incorporated. The existing algorithmson UR; however; have underplayed the role of topics in rating systems. In this paper; we firstreveal that UR is topic-biased from our empirical investigation. However; existing algorithmscannot capture this characteristic in rating systems. To address this issue; we propose atopic-biased model (TBM) to estimate UR in terms of different topics as well as item scores.With TBM; we develop six topic-biased algorithms; which are subsequently evaluated withexperiments using both real-world and synthetic data sets.

Repairing vertex labels under neighborhood constraints,Shaoxu Song; Hong Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lei Chen,Abstract A broad class of data; ranging from similarity networks; workflow networks to proteinnetworks; can be modeled as graphs with data values as vertex labels. The vertex labels(data values) are often dirty for various reasons such as typos or erroneous reporting ofresults in scientific experiments. Neighborhood constraints; specifying label pairs that areallowed to appear on adjacent vertexes in the graph; are employed to detect and repairerroneous vertex labels. In this paper; we study the problem of repairing vertex labels tomake graphs satisfy neighborhood constraints. Unfortunately; the relabeling problem isproved to be NP hard; which motivates us to devise approximation methods for repairing;and identify interesting special cases (star and clique constraints) that can be efficientlysolved. We propose several approximate repairing algorithms including greedy heuristics …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,15

Random-walk domination in large graphs,Rong-Hua Li; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xin Huang; Hong Cheng,We introduce and formulate two types of random-walk domination problems in graphsmotivated by a number of applications in practice (eg; item-placement problem in onlinesocial networks; Ads-placement problem in advertisement networks; and resource-placement problem in P2P networks). Specifically; given a graph G; the goal of the first typeof random-walk domination problem is to target k nodes such that the total hitting time of anL-length random walk starting from the remaining nodes to the targeted nodes is minimized.The second type of random-walk domination problem is to find k nodes to maximize theexpected number of nodes that hit any one targeted node through an L-length random walk.We prove that these problems are two special instances of the submodular set functionmaximization with cardinality constraint problem.

Firstly; we characterize theproperties of elements to be kept in our computation. Then; we show the size of dynamicallymaintained candidate set and the size of skyline. Novel; efficient techniques are developedto process continuous probabilistic skyline queries over sliding windows. Finally; we extendour techniques to cover the applications where multiple probability thresholds are given;“top-k” skyline data objects are retrieved; or elements have individual life-spans.

Monitoring aggregate k-nn objects in road networks,Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Bolin Ding; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,Abstract In recent years; there is an increasing need to monitor k nearest neighbor (k-NN) ina road network. There are existing solutions on either monitoring k-NN objects from a singlequery point over a road network; or computing the snapshot k-NN objects over a roadnetwork to minimize an aggregate distance function with respect to multiple query points. Inthis paper; we study a new problem that is to monitor k-NN objects over a road network frommultiple query points to minimize an aggregate distance function with respect to the multiplequery points. We call it a continuous aggregate k-NN (CANN) query. We propose a newapproach that can significantly reduce the cost of computing network distances whenmonitoring aggregate k-NN objects on road networks. We conducted extensive experimentalstudies and confirmed the efficiency of our algorithms.,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2008,15
Fast XML structural join algorithms by partitioning,Nan Tang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Kam-Fai Wong; Jianxin Li,An XML structural join evaluates structural relationships (eg parent-child or ancestor-descendant) between XML elements. It serves as an important computation unit in XMLpattern matching. Several classical structural join algorithms have been proposed such asStack-tree join and XR-Tree join. In this paper; we consider to answer the problem ofstructural join by partitioning.

We first extend therelationships between nodes to the relationships between partitions on a plane and obtainsome observations and properties about the relationships between partitions.

Fast reachability query processing,Jiefeng Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Nan Tang,Abstract Graph has great expressive power to describe the complex relationships amongdata objects; and there are large graph datasets available. In this paper; we focus ourselveson processing a primitive graph query. We call it reachability query. The reachability query;denoted A\rightsquigarrowD; is to find all elements of a type D that are reachable from someelements in another type A. The problem is challenging because the existing structural joinalgorithms; studied in XML query processing; cannot be directly applied to it; because thosetechniques make use of the tree-structure heavily. We propose a novel approach which canprocess reachability queries on the fly while keeping the space consumption small that isneeded to keep the required information for processing reachability queries. In brief; ourapproach is based on 2-hop labeling for a directed graph G which consumes O (| V| log| E …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2006,15
Optimizing multiple dimensional queries simultaneously in multidimensional databases,Weifa Liang; Maria E Orlowska; X Yu Jeffrey,Abstract. Some significant progress related to multidimensional data analysis has beenachieved in the past few years; including the design of fast algorithms for computingdatacubes; selecting some precomputed group-bys to materialize; and designing efficientstorage structures for multidimensional data. However; little work has been carried out onmultidimensional query optimization issues. Particularly the response time (or evaluationcost) for answering several related dimensional queries simultaneously is crucial to theOLAP applications. Recently; Zhao et al. first exploited this problem by presenting threeheuristic algorithms. In this paper we first consider in detail two cases of the problem inwhich all the queries are either hash-based star joins or index-based star joins only. In thecase of the hash-based star join; we devise a polynomial approximation algorithm which …,The VLDB Journal,2000,15
Speedup graph processing by graph ordering,Hao Wei; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Can Lu; Xuemin Lin,Abstract The CPU cache performance is one of the key issues to efficiency in databasesystems. It is reported that cache miss latency takes a half of the execution time in databasesystems. To improve the CPU cache performance; there are studies to support searchingincluding cache-oblivious; and cache-conscious trees. In this paper; we focus on CPUspeedup for graph computing in general by reducing the CPU cache miss ratio for differentgraph algorithms. The approaches dealing with trees are not applicable to graphs which arecomplex in nature. In this paper; we explore a general approach to speed up CPUcomputing; in order to further enhance the efficiency of the graph algorithms withoutchanging the graph algorithms (implementations) and the data structures used. That is; weaim at designing a general solution that is not for a specific graph algorithm; neither for a …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,14
I/O efficient core graph decomposition at web scale,Dong Wen; Lu Qin; Ying Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Core decomposition is a fundamental graph problem with a large number of applications.Most existing approaches for core decomposition assume that the graph is kept in memoryof a machine. Nevertheless; many real-world graphs are big and may not reside in memory.In the literature; there is only one work for I/O efficient core decomposition that avoidsloading the whole graph in memory. However; this approach is not scalable to handle biggraphs because it cannot bound the memory size and may load most parts of the graph inmemory. In addition; this approach can hardly handle graph updates. In this paper; we studyI/O efficient core decomposition following a semi-external model; which only allows nodeinformation to be loaded in memory. This model works well in many web-scale graphs. Wepropose a semi-external algorithm and two optimized algorithms for I/O efficient core …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,14
GLog: A high level graph analysis system using MapReduce,Jun Gao; Jiashuai Zhou; Chang Zhou; Jeffrey Xu Yu,With the rapid growth of graphs in different applications; it is inevitable to leverage existingdistributed data processing frameworks in managing large graphs. Although theseframeworks ease the developing cost; it is still cumbersome and error-prone for developersto implement complex graph analysis tasks in distributed environments. Additionally;developers have to learn the details of these frameworks quite well; which is a key toimprove the performance of distributed jobs. This paper introduces a high level querylanguage called GLog and proposes its evaluation method to overcome these limitations.Specifically; we first design a RG (Relational-Graph) data model to mix relational data andgraph data; and extend Datalog to GLog on RG tables to support various graph analysistasks. Second; we define operations on RG tables; and show translation templates to …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,14
Learning phenotype structure using sequence model,Yuhai Zhao; Guoren Wang; Xiang Zhang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Zhanghui Wang,Advanced microarray technologies have enabled to simultaneously monitor the expressionlevels of all genes. An important problem in microarray data analysis is to discoverphenotype structures. The goal is to 1) find groups of samples corresponding to differentphenotypes (such as disease or normal); and 2) for each group of samples; find therepresentative expression pattern or signature that distinguishes this group from others.Some methods have been proposed for this issue; however; a common drawback is that theidentified signatures often include a large number of genes but with low discriminativepower. In this paper; we propose ag*-sequence model to address this limitation; where theordered expression values among genes are profitably utilized. Compared with the existingmethods; the proposed sequence model is more robust to noise and allows to discover …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,14
Co-occurrence prediction in a large location-based social network,Rong-Hua Li; Jianquan Liu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hanxiong Chen; Hiroyuki Kitagawa,Abstract Location-based social network (LBSN) is at the forefront of emerging trends insocial network services (SNS) since the users in LBSN are allowed to “check-in” the places(locations) when they visit them. The accurate geographical and temporal information ofthese check-in actions are provided by the end-user GPS-enabled mobile devices; andrecorded by the LBSN system. In this paper; we analyze and mine a big LBSN data;Gowalla; collected by us. First; we investigate the relationship between the spatio-temporalco-occurrences and social ties; and the results show that the co-occurrences are stronglycorrelative with the social ties. Second; we present a study of predicting two users whetheror not they will meet (co-occur) at a place in a given future time; by exploring their check-inhabits. In particular; we first introduce two new concepts; bag-of-location and bag-of-time …,Frontiers of Computer Science,2013,14
Evolution of cooperation in spatial traveler's dilemma game,Rong-Hua Li; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Jiyuan Lin,Traveler's dilemma (TD) is one of social dilemmas which has been well studied in theeconomics community; but it is attracted little attention in the physics community. The TDgame is a two-person game. Each player can select an integer value between and () as apure strategy. If both of them select the same value; the payoff to them will be that value. Ifthe players select different values; say and (); then the payoff to the player who chooses thesmall value will be and the payoff to the other player will be. We term the player who selectsa large value as the cooperator; and the one who chooses a small value as the defector. Thereason is that if both of them select large values; it will result in a large total payoff. The Nashequilibrium of the TD game is to choose the smallest value. However; in previous behavioralstudies; players in TD game typically select values that are much larger than; and the …,PloS one,2013,14
Online time interval top-k queries in wireless sensor networks,Baichen Chen; Weifa Liang; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Motivated by many applications; top-k query is a fundamental operation in modern databasesystems. Technological advances have enabled the deployment of large-scale sensornetworks for environmental monitoring and surveillance purposes; efficient processing of top-k query in such networks poses great challenges due to the unique characteristics ofsensors and a vast amount of data generated by sensor networks. In this paper; we firstintroduce the concept of time interval top-k query that is to return k highest sensed valuesfrom the sensory data generated within a specified time interval. We then propose a filter-based algorithm for time interval top-k query evaluation; which is capable to filter out nearlya half unlikely top-k data from transmission in comparison with a well known existingsolution. We also develop a novel online algorithm for answering time interval top-k …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2010 Eleventh International Conference on,2010,14
Modeling for calculation of vanadium oxide film composition in reactive-sputtering process,He Yu; Yadong Jiang; Tao Wang; Zhiming Wu; Junsheng Yu; Xiongbang Wei,A modified model describing the changing ratio of vanadium to oxide on the target andsubstrate as a function of oxygen flow is described. Actually; this ratio is extremely sensitiveto the deposition conditions during the vanadium oxide (VO x) reactive magnetron-sputteringprocess. The method in this article is an extension of a previously presented Berg's model;where only a single stoichiometry compound layer was taken into consideration. This workdeals with reactive magnetron sputtering of vanadium oxide films with different oxygencontents from vanadium metal target. The presence of vanadium mixed oxides at both targetand substrate surface produced during reactive-sputtering process are included. It showsthat the model can be used for the optimization of film composition with respect to oxygenflow in a stable hysteresis-free reactive-sputtering process.

Stock prediction: an event-driven approach based on bursty keywords,Di Wu; Gabriel Pui Cheong Fung; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Qi Pan,Abstract There are many real applications existing where the decision making processdepends on a model that is built by collecting information from different data sources. Let ustake the stock market as an example. The decision making process depends on a modelwhich that is influenced by factors such as stock prices; exchange volumes; market indices(eg Dow Jones Index); news articles; and government announcements (eg; the increase ofstamp duty). Yet Nevertheless; modeling the stock market is a challenging task because (1)the process related to market states (rise state/drop state) is a stochastic process; which ishard to capture using the deterministic approach; and (2) the market state is invisible but willbe influenced by the visible market information; like stock prices and news articles. In thispaper; we propose an approach to model the stock market process by using a Non …,Frontiers of Computer Science in China,2009,14
Independence of containing patterns property and its application in tree pattern query rewriting using views,Junhu Wang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Chengfei Liu,Abstract We show that several classes of tree patterns observe the independence ofcontaining patterns property; that is; if a pattern is contained in the union of several patterns;then it is contained in one of them. We apply this property to two related problems on treepattern rewriting using views. First; given view V and query Q; is it possible for Q to have anequivalent rewriting using V which is the union of two or more tree patterns; but not anequivalent rewriting which is a single pattern? This problem is of both theoretical andpractical importance because; if the answer is no; then; to find an equivalent rewriting of atree pattern using a view; we should use more efficient methods; such as the polynomialtime algorithm of Xu and Özsoyoglu (2005); rather than try to find the union of all containedrewritings (which takes exponential time in the worst case) and test its equivalence to Q …,World Wide Web,2009,14
Fast frequent free tree mining in graph databases,Peixiang Zhao; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Free tree; as a special undirected; acyclic and connected graph; is extensively usedin computational biology; pattern recognition; computer networks; XML databases; etc. Inthis paper; we present a computationally efficient algorithm F3TM (Fast Frequent Free TreeMining) to find all frequently-occurred free trees in a graph database; \calD={g_1;g_2;⋯;g_N\}. Two key steps of F3TM are candidate generation and frequency counting. The frequencycounting step is to compute how many graphs in \calD containing a candidate frequent freetree; which is proved to be the subgraph isomorphism problem in nature and is NP-complete. Therefore; the key issue becomes how to reduce the number of false positives inthe candidate generation step. Based on our observations; the cost of false positivereduction can be prohibitive itself. In this paper; we focus ourselves on how to reduce the …,World Wide Web,2008,14
Algebraic equivalences of nested relational operators,Hong-Cheu Liu; X Yu Jeffrey,Abstract Algebraic optimisation is both theoretically and practically important for queryprocessing in complex value databases. In this paper; we consider this issue and investigatesome algebraic properties concerning the nested relational operators. The join operation isone of the most time-consuming operations in nested relational query processing. Weintroduce a new join operator; called P-join; which combines the advantages of Roth'sextended natural join and Colby's recursive join for efficient data access. We also investigatesome algebraic properties concerning the P-join operator and extended relational operators;which can be used for query optimisation in nested relational databases. We then examinethe role of the restructuring operators nest and unnest in their interactions with the extendedrelational operators proposed by Roth et al.

Top-k structural diversity search in large networks,Xin Huang; Hong Cheng; Rong-Hua Li; Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Social contagion depicts a process of information (eg; fads; opinions; news)diffusion in the online social networks. A recent study reports that in a social contagionprocess; the probability of contagion is tightly controlled by the number of connectedcomponents in an individual's neighborhood. Such a number is termed structural diversity ofan individual; and it is shown to be a key predictor in the social contagion process. Based onthis; a fundamental issue in a social network is to find top-k k users with the highest structuraldiversities. In this paper; we; for the first time; study the top-k k structural diversity searchproblem in a large network. Specifically; we study two types of structural diversity measures;namely; component-based structural diversity measure and core-based structural diversitymeasure. For component-based structural diversity; we develop an effective upper bound …,The VLDB Journal,2015,13
I/O efficient: computing SCCs in massive graphs,Zhiwei Zhang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lu Qin; Lijun Chang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract A strongly connected component (SCC SCC) is a maximal subgraph of a directedgraph GG in which every pair of nodes is reachable from each other in the SCC SCC. Withsuch a property; a general directed graph can be represented by a directed acyclic graph(DAG) by contracting every SCC SCC of GG to a node in DAG. In many real applications thatneed graph pattern matching; topological sorting; or reachability query processing; the bestway to deal with a general directed graph is to deal with its DAG representation. Therefore;finding all SCC SCC s in a directed graph GG is a critical operation. The existing in-memoryalgorithms based on depth first search (DFS) can find all SCC SCC s in linear time withrespect to the size of a graph. However; when a graph cannot reside entirely in the mainmemory; the existing external or semi-external algorithms to find all SCC SCC s have …,The VLDB Journal,2015,13
Efficient and accurate query evaluation on uncertain graphs via recursive stratified sampling,Rong-Hua Li; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Rui Mao; Tan Jin,In this paper; we introduce two types of query evaluation problems on uncertain graphs:expectation query evaluation and threshold query evaluation. Since these two problemsare# P-complete; most previous solutions for these problems are based on naive Monte-Carlo (NMC) sampling. However; NMC typically leads to a large variance; which significantlyreduces its effectiveness. To overcome this problem; we propose two classes of estimators;called class-I and class-II estimators; based on the idea of stratified sampling. Morespecifically; we first propose two classes of basic stratified sampling estimators; named BSS-I and BSS-II; which partition the entire population into 2 r and r+ 1 strata by picking r edgesrespectively. Second; to reduce the variance; we find that both BSS-I and BSS-II can berecursively performed in each stratum. Therefore; we propose two classes of recursive …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,13
Topic distributions over links on web,Jie Tang; Jing Zhang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Zi Yang; Keke Cai; Rui Ma; Li Zhang; Zhong Su,It is well known that Web users create links with different intentions. However; a keyquestion; which is not well studied; is how to categorize the links and how to quantify thestrength of the influence of a web page on another if there is a link between the two linkedweb pages. In this paper; we focus on the problem of link semantics analysis; and propose anovel supervised learning approach to build a model; based on a training link-labeled andlink-weighted graph where a link-label represents the category of a link and a link-weightrepresents the influence of one web page on the other in a link. Based on the model built;we categorize links and quantify the influence of web pages on the others in a large graph inthe same application domain. We discuss our proposed approach; namely PairwiseRestricted Boltzmann Machines (PRBMs); and conduct extensive experimental studies to …,Data Mining; 2009. ICDM'09.

Ordered conducting polymer multilayer films and its application for hole injection layers in organic light-emitting devices,Jianhua Xu; Yajie Yang; Junsheng Yu; Yadong Jiang,Abstract We reported a controlled architecture growth of layer-ordered multilayer film of poly(3; 4-ethylene dioxythiophene)(PEDOT) via a modified Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) method. Anin situ polymerization of 3; 4-ethylene dioxythiophene (EDOT) monomer in multilayer LB filmoccurred for the formation of ordered conducting polymer embedded multilayer film. The well-distribution of conducting polymer particles was characterized by secondary-ion massspectrometry (SIMS). The conducting film consisting of ordered PEDOT ultrathin layers wasinvestigated as a hole injection layer for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). The resultsshowed that; compared to conventional spin-coating PEDOT film and electrostatic self-assembly (ESA) film; the improved performance of OLEDs was obtained after using orderedPEDOT LB film as hole injection layer. It also indicated that well-ordered structure of hole …,Applied Surface Science,2009,13
Approximate processing of massive continuous quantile queries over high-speed data streams,Xuemin Lin; Jian Xu; Qing Zhang; Hongjun Lu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xiaofang Zhou; Yidong Yuan,Quantile computation has many applications including data mining and financial dataanalysis. It has been shown that an/spl epsi/-approximate summary can be maintained sothat; given a quantile query (/spl phi/;/spl epsi/); the data item at rank/spl lceil//spl phi/N/splrceil/may be approximately obtained within the rank error precision/spl epsi/N over all N dataitems in a data stream or in a sliding window. However; scalable online processing ofmassive continuous quantile queries with different/spl phi/and/spl epsi/poses a newchallenge because the summary is continuously updated with new arrivals of data items. Inthis paper; first we aim to dramatically reduce the number of distinct query results bygrouping a set of different queries into a cluster so that they can be processed virtually as asingle query while the precision requirements from users can be retained. Second; we …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2006,13
Dynamic materialized view management based on predicates,Chi-Hon Choi; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hongjun Lu,Abstract For the purpose of satisfying different users' profiles and accelerating thesubsequence OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) queries in a large data warehouse;dynamic materialized OLAP view management is highly desirable. Previous work cachesdata as either chunks or multidimensional range fragments. In this paper; we focus onROLAP (Relational OLAP) in an existing relational database system. We propose a dynamicpredicate-based partitioning approach; which can support a wide range of OLAP queries.We conducted extensive performance studies using TPC H benchmark data on IBM DB2and encouraging results are obtained which indicate that our approach is highly feasible.,Asia-Pacific Web Conference,2003,13
PathGuide: an efficient clustering based indexing method for XML path expressions,Jiefeng Cheng; Ge Yu; Guoren Wang; Jeffrey Xu Yu,This paper focuses on the performance improvement for long-path XML query processing. Itis motivated by the fact that the existing inverted index and join algorithms are efficient forshort path XML queries; but are inefficient for long path XML queries since the response timeof the existing approaches is exponential to the length of paths. We propose a clusteringbased indexing method; called PathGuide; in this paper; which enhances the XML invertedindex with the clustering technique. The element nodes are clustered based on their pathpatterns and the summary for such path information is kept in a suffix tree as the index ofthese element nodes. In addition; new operations are proposed to fully utilize PathGuide.With the assistance of PathGuide; unlike the path expansion approach used in Lore; the setof a relative location path can be found via one-step index lookup.

Using stem rules to refine document retrieval queries,Ye Liu; Hanxiong Chen; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Nobuo Ohbo,Abstract In this paper; a data mining approach for query refinement is proposed usingAssociation Rules (ARs) among keywords being extracted from a document database.When a query is under-specified or contains ambiguous keywords; a set of association ruleswill be displayed to assist the user to choose additional keywords in order to refine his/heroriginal query. To the best of our knowledge; no reported study has discussed on how toscreen the number of documents being retrieved using ARs. The issues we are concernedin this paper are as follows. First; an AR; X⟹ Y; with high confidence will intend to show thatthe number of documents that contain both sets of keywords X and Y is large. Therefore; theeffectiveness of using minimum support and minimum confidence to screen documents canbe little. To address this issue; maximum support and maximum confidence are used …,International Conference on Flexible Query Answering Systems,1998,13
Personalized influential topic search via social network summarization,Jianxin Li; Chengfei Liu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Yi Chen; Timos Sellis; J Shane Culpepper,Social networks are a vital mechanism to disseminate information to friends and colleagues.In this work; we investigate an important problem-the personalized influential topic search;or PIT-Search in a social network: Given a keyword query q issued by a user u in a socialnetwork; a PIT-Search is to find the top-k q-related topics that are most influential for thequery user u. The influence of a topic to a query user depends on the social connectionbetween the query user and the social users containing the topic in the social network. Tomeasure the topics' influence at the similar granularity scale; we need to extract the socialsummarization of the social network regarding topics. To make effective topic-aware socialsummarization; we propose two random-walk based approaches: random clustering and anL-length random walk. Based on the proposed approaches; we can find a small set of …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,12
I/O cost minimization: reachability queries processing over massive graphs,Zhiwei Zhang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lu Qin; Qing Zhu; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Given a directed graph G; a reachability query (u; v) asks whether there exists apath from a node u to a node v in G. The existing studies support reachability queries usingindexing techniques; where both the graph and the index are required to reside in mainmemory. However; they cannot handle reachability queries on massive graphs; when thegraph and the index cannot be entirely held in memory because of the high I/O cost. In thispaper; we focus on how to minimize the I/O cost when answering reachability queries onmassive graphs that cannot reside entirely in memory. First; we propose a new Yes-Labelscheme; as a complement of the No-Label used in GRAIL [23]; to reduce the number ofintermediate results generated. Second; we show how to minimize the number of I/Os usinga heap-on-disk data structure when traversing a graph. We also propose new methods to …,Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2012,12
Ranking individuals and groups by influence propagation,Pei Li; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hongyan Liu; Jun He; Xiaoyong Du,Abstract Ranking the centrality of a node within a graph is a fundamental problem in networkanalysis. Traditional centrality measures based on degree; betweenness; or closeness missto capture the structural context of a node; which is caught by eigenvector centrality (EVC)measures. As a variant of EVC; PageRank is effective to model and measure the importanceof web pages in the web graph; but it is problematic to apply it to other link-based rankingproblems. In this paper; we propose a new influence propagation model to describe thepropagation of predefined importance over individual nodes and groups accompanied withrandom walk paths; and we propose new IPRank algorithm for ranking both individuals andgroups. We also allow users to define specific decay functions that provide flexibility tomeasure link-based centrality on different kinds of networks. We conducted testing using …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2011,12
Duplicate-insensitive order statistics computation over data streams,Ying Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Yidong Yuan; Masaru Kitsuregawa; Xiaofang Zhou; Jeffrey Wu Yu,Duplicates in data streams may often be observed by the projection on a subspace and/ormultiple recordings of objects. Without the uniqueness assumption on observed dataelements; many conventional aggregates computation problems need to be furtherinvestigated due to their duplication-sensitive nature. In this paper; we present novel; space-efficient; one-scan algorithms to continuously maintain duplicate-insensitive order sketchesso that rank-based queries can be approximately processed with a relative rank errorguarantee\epsilon in the presence of data duplicates. Besides the space efficiency; theproposed algorithms are time-efficient and highly accurate. Moreover; our techniques maybe immediately applied to the heavy hitter problem against distinct elements and to theexisting fault-tolerant distributed communication techniques.

A uniform framework for ad-hoc indexes to answer reachability queries on large graphs,Linhong Zhu; Byron Choi; Bingsheng He; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Wee Keong Ng,Abstract Graph-structured databases and related problems such as reachability queryprocessing have been increasingly relevant to many applications such as XML databases;biological databases; social network analysis and the Semantic Web. To efficiently evaluatereachability queries on large graph-structured databases; there has been a host of recentresearch on graph indexing. To date; reachability indexes are generally applied to the entiregraph. This can often be suboptimal if the graph is large or/and its subgraphs are diverse instructure. In this paper; we propose a uniform framework to support existing reachabilityindexing for subgraphs of a given graph. This in turn supports fast reachability queryprocessing in large graph-structured databases. The contributions of our uniform frameworkare as follows:(1) We formally define a graph framework that facilitates indexing …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2009,12
Integrating multiple data sources for stock prediction,Di Wu; Gabriel Pui Cheong Fung; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Zheng Liu,Abstract In many real world applications; decisions are usually made by collecting andjudging information from multiple different data sources. Let us take the stock market as anexample. We never make our decision based on just one single piece of advice; but alwaysrely on a collection of information; such as the stock price movements; exchange volumes;market index; as well as the information from the news articles; expert comments and specialannouncements (eg; the increase of stamp duty). Yet; modeling the stock market is difficultbecause:(1) The process related to market states (up and down) is a stochastic process;which is hard to capture by using the deterministic approach; and (2) The market state isinvisible but will be influenced by the visible market information; such as stock prices andnews articles.

Efficient top-k search across heterogeneous XML data sources,Jianxin Li; Chengfei Liu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Rui Zhou,Abstract An important issue arising from XML query relaxation is how to efficiently search thetop-k best answers from a large number of XML data sources; while minimizing thesearching cost; ie; finding the k matches with the highest computed scores by only traversingpart of the documents. This paper resolves this issue by proposing a bound-threshold basedscheduling strategy. It can answer a top-k XML query as early as possible by dynamicallyscheduling the query over XML documents. In this work; the total amount of documents thatneed to be visited can be greatly reduced by skipping those documents that will not producethe desired results with the bound-threshold strategy. Furthermore; most of the candidates ineach visited document can also be pruned based on the intermediate results.

In this paper; first; weexplicitly identify principles of a data mining model for query refinement; and show that ourmodel satisfies the principles. Second; we propose a mechanism to reduce the largenumber of ARs using a concept called" prime keyword". The effectiveness of our approachwill be discussed. Considering the fact that most of today's searching engines on the Internetare keyword based; our approach can be easily extended to support Web applications.,Web Information Systems Engineering; 2001.

New Red Electroluminescent Devices Using Tris (2; 2′-bipyridine) Ruthenium (II) Hexafluorophosphate as Emitter,Minrun Li; Junsheng Yu; Zhijian Chen; Kenro Totani; Toshiyuki Watanabe; Seizo Miyata,Abstract A new ruthenium complex; tris (2; 2'-bipyridine) ruthenium (II) hexafluorophosphate[Ru (bpy) 3 (PF 6) 2]; was synthesized. Two single-layer electroluminescent devices with anindium-tin oxide (ITO) anode and a Mg cathode were fabricated; one with the newlysynthesized material and the other with the known tris (2; 2'-bipyridine) ruthenium (II)chloride [Ru (bpy) 3 Cl 2] as emitting materials. The efficiency of the electroluminescentdevice with the new emitting material [Ru (bpy) 3 (PF 6) 2] was found to be much higher thanthat with [Ru (bpy) 3 Cl 2]. The efficiency of the devices is influenced by the anion size of theemitting materials.,Japanese Journal of Applied Physics,2000,12
Supporting range queries in a wireless environment with nonuniform broadcast,Kian-Lee Tan; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Pin-Kwang Eng,Abstract In a wireless computing environment; a server disseminates information byperiodically broadcasting data on 'air'; while clients 'catch'their desired data on the fly. Todetermine the data to be broadcast; the server constructs a broadcast program. While anonuniform broadcast program has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing theaverage access times for single-record retrievals; existing nonuniform broadcast programsperform poorly for range queries. In this paper; we propose a new algorithm to generatenonuniform broadcast programs that can facilitate range queries. Our algorithm supportsselective tuning using the flexible indexing scheme. We conducted an extensive simulationstudy; and our results show that the proposed algorithm can generate programs that lead tosignificant improvement (in terms of both access time and tuning time) for range queries …,Data & knowledge engineering,1999,12
Assessing single-pair similarity over graphs by aggregating first-meeting probabilities,Jun He; Hongyan Liu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Pei Li; Wei He; Xiaoyong Du,Abstract Link-based similarity plays an important role in measuring similarities betweennodes in a graph. As a widely used link-based similarity; SimRank scores similarity betweentwo nodes as the first-meeting probability of two random surfers. However; due to the largescale of graphs in real-world applications and dynamic change characteristic; it is not viableto frequently update the whole similarity matrix. Also; people often only concern about thesimilarities of a small subset of nodes in a graph. In such a case; the existing approachesneed to compute the similarities of all node-pairs simultaneously; suffering from highcomputation cost. In this paper; we propose a new algorithm; Iterative Single-Pair SimRank(ISP); based on the random surfer-pair model to compute the SimRank similarity score for asingle pair of nodes in a graph.

A data mining proxy approach for efficient frequent itemset mining,Jeffrey Xu Yu; Zhiheng Li; Guimei Liu,Abstract Data mining has attracted a lot of research efforts during the past decade. However;little work has been reported on the efficiency of supporting a large number of users whoissue different data mining queries periodically when there are new needs and when data isupdated. Our work is motivated by the fact that the pattern-growth method is one of the mostefficient methods for frequent pattern mining which constructs an initial tree and minesfrequent patterns on top of the tree. In this paper; we present a data mining proxy approachthat can reduce the I/O costs to construct an initial tree by utilizing the trees that have alreadybeen resident in memory. The tree we construct is the smallest for a given data miningquery. In addition; our proxy approach can also reduce CPU cost in mining patterns;because the cost of mining relies on the sizes of trees. The focus of the work is to …,The VLDB Journal,2008,11
Pushing aggregate constraints by divide-and-approximate,Ke Wang; Yuelong Jiang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Guozhu Dong; Jiawei Han,Iceberg-cube mining is to compute the GROUP BY partitions; for all GROUP BY dimensionlists; that satisfy a given aggregate constraint. Previous works have pushed anti-monotoneconstraints into iceberg-cube mining. However; many useful constraints are not anti-monotone. We propose a novel strategy for pushing general aggregate constraints; calleddivide-and-approximate. This strategy divides the search space and approximates theconstraint in subspaces by a pushable constraint. As the strategy is recursively applied; theapproximation approaches the given constraint and the pruning tights up. We show that allconstraints defined by SQL aggregates; arithmetic operators and comparison operators canbe pushed by divide-and-approximate. We present an efficient implementation for animportant subclass and evaluate it on both synthetic and real life databases.,Data Engineering; 2003.

Patterns discovery based on time-series decomposition,Jeffrey Xu Yu; Michael K Ng; Joshua Zhexue Huang,Abstract Complete or partial periodicity search in time-series databases is an interestingdata mining problem. Most previous studies on finding periodic or partial periodic patternsfocused on data structures and computing issues. Analysis of long-term or short-term trendsover different time windows is a great interest. This paper presents a new approach todiscovery of periodic patterns from time-series with trends based on time-seriesdecomposition. First; we decompose time series into three components; seasonal; trend andnoise. Second; with an existing partial periodicity search algorithm; we search either partialperiodic patterns from trends without seasonal component or partial periodic patterns forseasonal components. Different patterns from any combination of the three decomposedtime-series can be found using this approach. Examples show that our approach is more …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2001,11

Triangle minimization in large networks,Rong-Hua Li; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract The number of triangles is a fundamental metric for analyzing the structure andfunction of a network. In this paper; for the first time; we investigate the triangle minimizationproblem in a network under edge (node) attack; where the attacker aims to minimize thenumber of triangles in the network by removing kk edges (nodes). We show that the triangleminimization problem under edge (node) attack is a submodular function maximizationproblem; which can be solved efficiently. Specifically; we propose a degree-based edge(node) removal algorithm and a near-optimal greedy edge (node) removal algorithm forapproximately solving the triangle minimization problem under edge (node) attack. Inaddition; we introduce two pruning strategies and an approximate marginal gain evaluationtechnique to further speed up the greedy edge (node) removal algorithm.

Efficient processing of label-constraint reachability queries in large graphs,Lei Zou; Kun Xu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lei Chen; Yanghua Xiao; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract In this paper; we study a variant of reachability queries; called label-constraintreachability (LCR) queries. Specifically; given a label set S and two vertices u 1 and u 2 in alarge directed graph G; we check the existence of a directed path from u 1 to u 2; whereedge labels along the path are a subset of S. We propose the path-label transitive closuremethod to answer LCR queries. Specifically; we t4ransform an edge-labeled directed graphinto an augmented DAG by replacing the maximal strongly connected components asbipartite graphs. We also propose a Dijkstra-like algorithm to compute path-label transitiveclosure by re-defining the “distance” of a path. Comparing with the existing solutions; weprove that our method is optimal in terms of the search space. Furthermore; we propose asimple yet effective partition-based framework (local path-label transitive closure+ online …,Information Systems,2014,10

Measuring robustness of complex networks under MVC attack,Rong-Hua Li; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xin Huang; Hong Cheng; Zechao Shang,Abstract Measuring robustness of complex networks is a fundamental task for analyzing thestructure and function of complex networks. In this paper; we study the network robustnessunder the maximal vertex coverage (MVC) attack; where the attacker aims to delete as manyedges of the network as possible by attacking a small fraction of nodes. First; we present tworobustness metrics of complex networks based on MVC attack. We then propose an efficientrandomized greedy algorithm with near-optimal performance guarantee for computing theproposed metrics. Finally; we conduct extensive experiments on 20 real datasets.

Top-k graph pattern matching: A twig query approach,Xianggang Zeng; Jiefeng Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Shengzhong Feng,Abstract There exist many graph-based applications including bioinformatics; social science;link analysis; citation analysis; and collaborative work. All need to deal with a large datagraph. Given a large data graph; in this paper; we study finding top-k answers for a graphquery; and in particular; we focus on top-k cyclic graph queries where a graph query is cyclicand can be complex. The capability of supporting top-k cyclic graph queries over a datagraph provides much more flexibility for a user to search graphs. And the problem itself ischallenging. After investigating a direct yet infeasible solution; we propose a new twig queryapproach. In our approach; we first identify a spanning tree of the cyclic graph query; whichis used to generate a list of ranked twig answers on-demand. Then we identify the top-kanswers for the graph query based on the twig answer list. In order to find the best twig …,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2012,10
iGraph in action: performance analysis of disk-based graph indexing techniques,Wook-Shin Han; Minh-Duc Pham; Jinsoo Lee; Romans Kasperovics; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Graphs provide a powerful way to model complex structures such as chemicalcompounds; proteins; images; and program dependence. The previous practice forexperiments in graph indexing techniques is that the author of a newly proposed techniquedoes not implement existing indexes on his own code base; but instead uses the originalauthors' binary executables and reports only the wall clock time. However; we observed thatthis practice may result in several problems [6]. In order to address these problems; we haveimplemented all representative graph indexing techniques on a common framework callediGraph [6]. In this demonstration we showcase iGraph and its visual tools using several realdatasets and their workloads. For selected queries of the workloads; we show severalunique features including visual performance analysis.,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,10
Indexing expensive functions for efficient multi-dimensional similarity search,Hanxiong Chen; Jianquan Liu; Kazutaka Furuse; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Nobuo Ohbo,Abstract Similarity search is important in information retrieval applications where objects areusually represented as vectors of high dimensionality. This leads to the increasing need forsupporting the indexing of high-dimensional data. On the other hand; indexing structuresbased on space partitioning are powerless because of the well-known “curse ofdimensionality”. Linear scan of the data with approximation is more efficient in the high-dimensional similarity search. However; approaches so far have concentrated on reducingI/O; and ignored the computation cost. For an expensive distance function such as L p normwith fractional p; the computation cost becomes the bottleneck. We propose a new techniqueto address expensive distance functions by “indexing the function” by pre-computing somekey values of the function once. Then; the values are used to develop the upper/lower …,Knowledge and information systems,2011,10

Reduction of store-operated Ca2+ entry correlates with endothelial progenitor cell dysfunction in atherosclerotic mice,Lian-You Wang; Ji-Hang Zhang; Jie Yu; Jie Yang; Meng-Yang Deng; Hua-Li Kang; Lan Huang,The dysfunction of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) has been shown to preventendothelial repair during the development of atherosclerosis (AS). Previous studies haverevealed that store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) is an important factor in regulating EPCfunctions. However; whether this is also the mechanism in AS has not been elucidated.Therefore; we evaluated the role of SOCE in EPCs isolated from an atherosclerotic mousemodel. Atheromatous plaques were more frequent in the aortas of ApoE−/− mice fed a high-fat diet for 16 weeks compared with controls; and the proliferative and migratory activities ofatherosclerotic EPCs were significantly decreased. Accordingly; SOCE amplitude; as well asspontaneous or VEGF-induced Ca2+ oscillations; decreased in atherosclerotic EPCs.

Organic field-effect transistors with nearly non-injection barrier from source/drain electrodes to pentacene,Xinge Yu; Junsheng Yu; Jianlin Zhou; Yadong Jiang,Abstract Top contact pentacene field-effect transistors (OFETs) with or without MoO 3source/drain (S/D) electrodes buffer layers were fabricated by utilizing different depositionrates of Au S/D electrodes. The results showed that the characteristics of these OFETs havea strong dependence on the deposition rate of Au S/D electrodes. More importantly; singlepentacene layer OFETs with optimized Au deposition process exhibits significantly improvedperformance; which is almost equal to the OFETs with MoO 3 buffer layers. The highperformance of OFETs with optimized Au deposition process was attributed to an improvedcontact of Au and pentacene caused by ordered dipole arrangement at the interface; leadingto a nearly non-injection barrier of charge carriers from Au electrodes to pentacene.,Synthetic Metals,2012,9

Cost-based query optimization for multi reachability joins,Jiefeng Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Bolin Ding,Abstract There is a need to efficiently identify reachabilities between different types ofobjects over a large data graph. A reachability join (R-join) serves as a primitive operator forsuch a purpose. Given two types; A and D; R-join finds all pairs of A and D that D-typedobjects are reachable from some A-typed objects. In this paper; we focus on processingmulti reachability joins (R-joins). In the literature; the up-to-date approach extended the well-known twig-stack join algorithm; to be applicable on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Theefficiency of such an approach is affected by the density of large DAGs. In this paper; wepresent algorithms to optimize R-joins using a dynamic programming based on theestimated costs associated with R-join. Our algorithm is not affected by the density of graphs.We conducted extensive performance studies; and report our findings in our performance …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,9
False-negative frequent items mining from data streams with bursting,Zhihong Chong; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hongjun Lu; Zhengjie Zhang; Aoying Zhou,Abstract False-negative frequent items mining from a high speed transactional data streamis to find an approximate set of frequent items with respect to a minimum support threshold;s. It controls the possibility of missing frequent items using a reliability parameter δ. Theimportance of false-negative frequent items mining is that it can exclude false-positives andtherefore significantly reduce the memory consumption for frequent itemsets mining. The keyissue of false-negative frequent items mining is how to minimize the possibility of missingfrequent items. In this paper; we propose a new false-negative frequent items miningalgorithm; called Loss-Negative; for handling bursting in data streams. The new algorithmconsumes the smallest memory in comparison with other false-negative and false-positivefrequent items algorithms.

A dynamic scheduler for the infinite air-cache,Kian-Lee Tan; X Yu Jeffrey,Abstract In a wireless environment; data objects can be delivered to clients with powerfulpalmtops in two modes: the broadcasting mode and the on-demand mode. By varying thenumber of data objects to be broadcast; we can arrive at different scheduling algorithms.Existing work has largely focused on exclusive broadcasting and exclusive on-demandscheduling. In the former; all the data objects are broadcast periodically; while the latterapproach provides all data objects on demand. A hybrid approach that partitions air-timebetween broadcasting popular data objects continuously and providing less frequentlyaccessed data upon request has also been proposed recently. However; none of thesetechniques performs well in all cases since access to data objects is unpredictable in ahighly mobile environment. One of these unpredictable factors is the number of clients …,Data & knowledge engineering,1997,9
A kernel-power-density-based algorithm for channel multipath components clustering,Ruisi He; Qingyong Li; Bo Ai; Yang Li-Ao Geng; Andreas F Molisch; Vinod Kristem; Zhangdui Zhong; Jian Yu,Cluster-based channel modeling has been an important trend in the development ofchannel model; as it maintains accuracy while reducing complexity. Whereas a largenumber of channel measurements have shown that multipath components (MPCs) aredistributed as groups; ie; clusters; existing clustering algorithms have various drawbackswith respect to complexity; threshold choices; and/or assumptions about prior knowledge. Inthis paper; a kernel-power-density (KPD)-based algorithm is proposed for MPC clustering. Ituses the kernel density of MPCs to incorporate the modeled behavior of MPCs and takesinto account the power of the MPCs. Furthermore; the KPD algorithm only considers the $ K$ nearest MPCs in the density estimation to better identify the local density variations ofMPCs. A heuristic approach of cluster merging is used to improve the performance. Both …,IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,2017,8

Finding the cost-optimal path with time constraint over time-dependent graphs,Yajun Yang; Hong Gao; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Jianzhong Li,Abstract Shortest path query is an important problem and has been well studied in staticgraphs. However; in practice; the costs of edges in graphs always change over time. We callsuch graphs as time-dependent graphs. In this paper; we study how to find a cost-optimalpath with time constraint in time-dependent graphs. Most existing works regarding the Time-Dependent Shortest Path (TDSP) problem focus on finding a shortest path with the minimumtravel time. All these works are based on the following fact: the earliest arrival time at avertex v can be derived from the earliest arrival time at v's neighbors. Unfortunately; this factdoes not hold for our problem. In this paper; we propose a novel algorithm to compute a cost-optimal path with time constraint in time-dependent graphs. We show that the time andspace complexities of our algorithm are O (kn log n+ mk) and O ((n+ m) k) respectively …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,8

A new path expression computing approach for XML data,Jianhua Lv; Guoren Wang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Ge Yu; Hongjun Lu; Bing Sun,Abstract Most query languages in XML database systems use Regular Path Expressions(RPE) to query or extract data from databases and some query processing and optimizationtechniques have been proposed for RPEs. Conceptually XML documents are collections ofpath instances. Each path instance should conform to an XML element tag sequence; calledpath schema. A RPE query can be written as an automaton that can represent a language;while path schemas can be seen as sentences. In this paper; a novel RPE computingapproach; automaton match (AM); is proposed. AM queries the RPEs by matching theautomatons with path schemas. The experimental results show AM is quite efficient forcomputing RPE queries.,*,2003,8

Top-Down XML Keyword Query Processing,Junfeng Zhou; Wei Wang; Ziyang Chen; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xian Tang; Yifei Lu; Yukun Li,Efficiently answering XML keyword queries has attracted much research effort in the lastdecade. The key factors resulting in the inefficiency of existing methods are the common-ancestor-repetition (CAR) and visiting-useless-nodes (VUN) problems. To address the CARproblem; we propose a generic top-down processing strategy to answer a given keywordquery wrt LCA/SLCA/ELCA semantics. By “top-down”; we mean that we visit all commonancestor (CA) nodes in a depth-first; left-to-right order; by “generic”; we mean that ourmethod is independent of the query semantics. To address the VUN problem; we propose touse child nodes; rather than descendant nodes to test the satisfiability of a node $ v $ wrt thegiven semantics. We propose two algorithms that are based on either traditional invertedlists or our newly proposed LLists to improve the overall performance.

Effect of organic electron blocking layers on the performance of organic photodetectors with high ultraviolet detectivity,Xiao Wang; Jiang Huang; Jie Li; Junsheng Yu,Abstract The performance of organic ultraviolet photodetectors (UV-PDs) was investigatedby focusing on the role of N; N'-bis-(1-naphthyl)-N; N'-diphenyl-1; 1'-biphenyl-4; 4'-diamine(NPB); N; N'-diphenyl-N; N'-bis (3-methyllphenyl)-(1; 1'-biphenyl)-4; 4'-diamine (TPD); 1; 1-bis ((di-4-tolylamino)-phenyl) cyclohexane (TAPC); and 4; 4; 4-tri (N-carbazolyl)triphenylamine)(TCTA) as the electron blocking layers (EBLs). The results showed that theUV-PDs with different EBLs exhibited significant improved electrical characteristics; such asdark current; detectivity and on/off ratio. Moreover; by analyzing the dark current behavior; itwas also found that the EBLs can effectively suppress the charge carrier injection fromAg/MoO 3 electrode to the active layer.

Improving update-intensive workloads on flash disks through exploiting multi-chip parallelism,Bingsheng He; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Amelie Chi Zhou,Solid state drives (SSDs); or flash disks have been considered as ideal storage for variousdata-intensive workloads; because of the low random access latency and the intra-disk multi-chip parallelism. However; due to inherent nature of flash memories; update-intensiveworkloads cause the flash disk fragmented; and trigger costly internal activities such ascleaning and wear leveling. We use database transaction processing as a motivating update-intensive workload. Our studies based on a flash disk simulator as well as flash disks showthat; these activities result in significant overhead to the I/O response time and systemthroughput.

Bayesian network structure learning from attribute uncertain data,Wenting Song; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hong Cheng; Hongyan Liu; Jun He; Xiaoyong Du,Abstract In recent years there has been a growing interest in Bayesian Network learningfrom uncertain data. While many researchers focus on Bayesian Network learning from datawith tuple uncertainty; Bayesian Network structure learning from data with attributeuncertainty gets little attention. In this paper we make a clear definition of attribute uncertaindata and Bayesian Network Learning problem from such data. We propose a structurelearning method named DTAU based on information theory. The algorithm assumes that thestructure of a Bayesian network is a tree. It avoids enumerating all possible worlds. Thedependency tree is computed with polynomial time complexity. We conduct experiments todemonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. The experiments show theclustering results on uncertain dataset by our dependency tree are acceptable.,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2012,7
Semi-supervised clustering of graph objects: A subgraph mining approach,Xin Huang; Hong Cheng; Jiong Yang; Jeffery Xu Yu; Hongliang Fei; Jun Huan,Abstract Semi-supervised clustering has recently received a lot of attention in the literature;which aims to improve the clustering performance with limited supervision. Most existingsemi-supervised clustering studies assume that the data is represented in a vector space;eg; text and relational data. When the data objects have complex structures; eg; proteins andchemical compounds; those semi-supervised clustering methods are not directly applicableto clustering such graph objects. In this paper; we study the problem of semi-supervisedclustering of data objects which are represented as graphs. The supervision information is inthe form of pairwise constraints of must-links and cannot-links.

Effect of molybdenum oxide anode buffer layer on the performance of inverted small molecular organic solar cells,Yue Zang; Jiang Huang; Haiqiang Li; Junsheng Yu; Yadong Jiang,Abstract Small molecular organic solar cells (OSCs) with an inverted structure of indium tinoxide (ITO)/cesium carbonate (Cs 2 CO 3)/C 60/subphthalocya-nine (SubPc)/molybdenumoxide (MoO 3)/Ag were fabri-cated and studied. By using the equivalent circuit model andtransfer matrix theory; the influence of the thickness of MoO 3 on the electrical and opticalcharacteristics of the device was systematically investigated. The results indicate that at theoptimized thickness of 15 nm; the power conversion efficiency was increased to 0.57%under AM 1.5 solar illumination at an intensity of 100 mW/cm 2. The enhancement of thedevice performance was attributed to the optical spacer effect and the good protection ofactive layer from Ag diffusion and charge extraction without introducing more seriesresistance.

Context-sensitive document ranking,Li-Jun Chang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lu Qin,Abstract Ranking is a main research issue in IR-styled keyword search over a set ofdocuments. In this paper; we study a new keyword search problem; called context-sensitivedocument ranking; which is to rank documents with an additional context that providesadditional information about the application domain where the documents are to besearched and ranked. The work is motivated by the fact that additional informationassociated with the documents can possibly assist users to find more relevant documentswhen they are unable to find the needed documents from the documents alone. In thispaper; a context is a multi-attribute graph; which can represent any information maintainedin a relational database; where multi-attribute nodes represent tuples; and edges representprimary key and foreign key references among nodes.

Optimizing updates of recursive XML views of relations,Ramadhana Bramandia; Jiefeng Cheng; Byron Choi; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract XML publishing has been an emerging technique for transforming (portions of) arelational database into an XML document; for example; to facilitate interoperability betweenheterogeneous applications. Such applications may update the XML document and thesource relational database must be updated accordingly. In this paper; we consider suchXML documents as (possibly) recursively defined XML views of relations.

Noise in boron doped amorphous/microcrystallization silicon films,Shibin Li; Zhiming Wu; Yadong Jiang; Wei Li; Naiman Liao; Junsheng Yu,Abstract Hydrogenated silicon (Si: H) film was grown by radio frequency plasma enhancedchemical vapor deposition (PECVD) method. The transition between hydrogenatedamorphous silicon (a-Si: H) and hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (μc-Si: H) wascharacterized by X-ray diffraction analysis. A semiconductor system was used to measurelow frequency noise (1/f noise) and random telegraph switching noise of Si: H films. Theresults show that the 1/f noise of μc-Si: H is 4 orders of magnitude lower than that of a-Si: Hand no RTS noise was found in both films. It also shows that using μc-Si: H instead of a-Si: Hfilm as a sensing layer will enable the development of high performance uncooledmicrobolometer.,Applied Surface Science,2008,7

However; it can be prohibitive dueto the presence of an exponential number of frequent free trees in the graph database. Inthis paper; we propose a computationally efficient algorithm that discovers only closedfrequent free trees in a database of labeled graphs. A free tree t is closed if there exist nosupertrees of t that has the same frequency of t. Two pruning algorithms; the safe positionpruning and the safe label pruning; are proposed to efficiently detect unsatisfactory searchspaces with no closed frequent free trees generated.

Fast structural join with a location function,Nan Tang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Kam-Fai Wong; Haifeng Jiang,Abstract A structural join evaluates structural relationship (parent-child or ancestor-descendant) between xml elements. It serves as an important computation unit in xml patternmatching; such as twig joins. There exists many work on efficient structural joins. Inparticular; indexes can expedite structural joins by skipping unmatchable elements. A typicaluse of indexes is to retrieve; for a given element; all its ancestor (or descendant) elementsfrom an indexed set. However we observed two possible limitations with such index probes;namely false hit and false locate. A false hit means that an index probe touches unnecessarydata besides real results; a false locate stands for a (wasted) probe that has zero answers.Obviously false hit and false locate can affect negatively the efficiency of structural joins. Inthis paper; we challenge ourselves to develop new structural join algorithm with no false …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2006,7

A performance study of declustering strategies for parallel spatial databases,Kian-Lee Tan; X Yu Jeffrey,Abstract Effective exploitation of shared-nothing multiprocessors to improve the performanceof spatial database applications requires novel query processing techniques. This isbecause; unlike traditional data; spatial objects are naturally multidimensional. As such;traditional single-dimensional declustering strategies are not directly applicable for spatialrelation. In this paper; we propose and study the effect of several declustering strategies forspatial relations. We build a simulation model to compare the various strategies on the basisof throughput and response time for window queries. Our results show that one of thetechniques which exploits redundancy performs best in most cases.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,1995,7
Improving the efficiency of bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells via binary-solvent treatment,Tianyu Kong; Hanyu Wang; Xuyang Liu; Junsheng Yu; Chao Wang,The effects of different binary-solvent treatments on the performance of polymer solar cells(PSCs) with thieno [3; 4-b] thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7):(6; 6)-phenyl-C 71-butyricacid methyl ester (PC 71 BM) as active layers are systematically investigated. The binary-solvents are obtained by mixing a primary solvent of methanol (MeOH) with a secondarysolvent comprising of 2-chlorophenol (2-CP); dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO); or o-xylene. Byanalyzing the variation of photovoltaic performance and the nanostructure morphology ofactive layers; we find that both polarity and boiling point of the secondary solvent are playingan important role in controlling the nanostructure morphology of PTB7: PC 71 BM blends. Inparticular; 2-CP and DMSO with higher polarity and boiling point mixed with MeOH couldsignificantly increase the power conversion efficiency from 6.47%(MeOH-treated device) …,IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics,2017,6

In this paper; we study the problem of top-k treepattern matching; that is; given a rooted tree T; compute its top-k matches in a directed graphG based on the twig-pattern matching semantics. We firstly present a novel and optimalenumeration paradigm based on the principle of Lawler's procedure. We show that ourenumeration algorithm runs in O (n T+ log k) time in each round where n T is the number ofnodes in T.

Efficient processing of top-k twig queries over probabilistic XML data,Bo Ning; Chengfei Liu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract The flexibility of XML data model allows a more natural representation of uncertaindata compared with the relational model. Matching twig pattern against XML data is afundamental problem in querying information from XML documents. For a probabilistic XMLdocument; each twig answer has a probabilistic value because of the uncertainty of data.The twig answers that have small probabilistic value are useless to the users; and usuallyusers only want to get the answers with the k largest probabilistic values. To this end;existing algorithms for ordinary XML documents cannot be directly applicable due to theneed for handling probability distributional nodes and efficient calculation of top-kprobabilities of answers in probabilistic XML. In this paper; we address the problem offinding twig answers with top-k probabilistic values against probabilistic XML documents …,World Wide Web,2013,6

It suggested that the concentration quenching of monomer emission in theundoped (pbi) 2 Ir (acac) film was mainly due to the formation of triplet excimer and partlydue to the triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) and triplet–polaron annihilation (TPA). A greenOLED with a maximum luminance of 26;531 cd/m 2; a current efficiency of 36.2 cd/A; and apower efficiency of 32.4 lm/W was obtained; when the triplet excimer emission was …,Physica B: Condensed Matter,2011,6

Guest Editors' Introduction: Special Section on Mining Large Uncertain and Probabilistic Databases,Reynold Cheng; Michael Chau; Minos Garofalakis; Jeffrey Xu Yu,RECENT years have witnessed the emergence of novel database applications in various nontraditionaldo- mains; including location-based services; sensor networks; RFID systems; and biologicaland biometric databases. Traditionally; data mining has been widely used to reveal interestingpatterns in the vast amounts of data generated by such applications. However; for most of theseemerging domains; data is often riddled with uncertainty; arising; for instance; from inherent measurementinaccuracies; sampling and curation errors; and network latencies; or even from intentional blurringof the data (to preserve anonymity). Such forms of data uncertainty have to be handledcarefully; or else the results of long and tedious data analyses could be inaccurate or evenincorrect. In particular; it is important to collect and distill the knowledge from experts in developingmining and data processing methods that are uncertainty- aware.

A query system for XML data stream and its semantics-based buffer reduction,Chi Yang; Chengfei Liu; Jianxin Li; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Junhu Wang,With respect to current methods for query evaluation over XML data streams; adoption ofcertain types of buffering techniques is unavoidable. Under lots of circumstances; the bufferscale may increase exponentially; which can cause memory bottleneck. Some optimizationtechniques have been proposed to solve the problem. However; the limit of thesetechniques has been defined by a concurrency lower bound and has been theoreticallyproved. In this paper; we show through an empirical study that this lower bound can bebroken by taking semantic information into account for buffer reduction. To demonstrate this;we built a SAX-based XML stream query evaluation system and designed an algorithm thatconsumes buffers in line with the concurrency lower bound. After a further analysis of thelower bound; we designed several semantic rules for the purpose of breaking the lower …,Journal of Research and Practice in Information Technology,2010,6

White light emission was achieved withthe two devices when the thicknesses of BCP and HKEthFLYPh were 1.5 nm (device B) and5 nm (device II); respectively. The obvious difference was that the EL spectrum of device IIwas not sensitive to the thickness of HKEthFLYPh compared to that of BCP layer. Moreover;the maximum luminance of device II was about 1000 cd/m2 higher than that of device B at aforward bias of 15 V; and it exhibited a maximum power efficiency of 1.0 lm/W at 5.5 V …,Chem. Res.

Reachability Querying: Can It Be Even Faster?,Jiao Su; Qing Zhu; Hao Wei; Jeffrey Xu Yu,As an important graph operator; reachability query has been extensively studied overdecades; which is to check whether a vertex can reach another vertex over a large directedgraph G with n vertices and m edges. The efforts made in the reported studies have greatlyimproved the query time of answering reachability queries online; while reducing the offlineindex construction time to construct an index with a reasonable size given the approachtaken; where an entry in an index for a vertex is called a label of the vertex.

We aimed to investigate the biological function and clinicalimplication of RASSF10 in gastric cancer (GC). We found that RASSF10 was silenced in sixof seven GC cell lines and in primary GC tissues; but was highly expressed in normal gastrictissues. The silence of RASSAF10 was mediated by promoter methylation as evaluated bybisulfite genomic sequencing. RASSF10 expression could be restored by demethylationtreatment. A negative correlation between methylation and mRNA expression of RASSF10was observed in 223 gastric samples of The Cancer Genome Atlas study (P< 0.0001).

Recursive stratified sampling: a new framework for query evaluation on uncertain graphs,Rong-Hua Li; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Rui Mao; Tan Jin,Uncertain graph management has been recognized as an important research topic in recentyears. In this paper; we first introduce two types of query evaluation problems on uncertaingraphs; named expectation query evaluation and threshold query evaluation. Most previoussolutions for these problems are based on naive Monte-Carlo (NMC) sampling; whichtypically result in large variances. To reduce the variance of NMC; we propose two efficientestimators; called RSS-I and RSS-II estimators; based on the idea of recursive stratifiedsampling (RSS). To further reduce the variances of RSS-I and RSS-II; we propose arecursive cut-set based stratified sampling estimator for a particular kind of query evaluationproblem.

Leveraging graph dimensions in online graph search,Yuanyuan Zhu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lu Qin,Abstract Graphs have been widely used due to its expressive power to model complicatedrelationships. However; given a graph database D g={g 1; g 2;···; gn}; it is challenging toprocess graph queries since a basic graph query usually involves costly graph operationssuch as maximum common subgraph and graph edit distance computation; which are NP-hard.

Synergism between upregulation of Rab7 and inhibition of autophagic degradation caused by mycoplasma facilitates intracellular mycoplasma infection,Xiaopeng Hu; Jie Yu; Xiang Zhou; Zhaoming Li; Yun Xia; Zhiyong Luo; Yaqun Wu,Abstract Following fusion of a mycoplasma with a host cell membrane; the insertedcomponents of mycoplasma may then be transported through the endocytic pathway.However; the effects of mycoplasmas on the host cell endomembrane system are largelyunknown. In this study; mycoplasma‑induced changes in the dynamics of endocytic andautophagic systems were investigated. Endocytosis and autophagy are two major processesinvolved in the survival of intracellular prokaryotic pathogens. It was found that; immediatelyfollowing infection; mycoplasmas induce endocytosis in the host cell; however; in the longterm the mycoplasmas suppress turnover of the components of the endocytic pathway.Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that Rab7 and LC3‑II are recruited to theintracellular mycoplasma‑containing compartments.

Preparation and characterization of activated carbons from spirit lees by physical activation,Qiang Li; Yin Wang; Jian Yu; Bin Yi; Jun Yang; Guang-wen Xu,Spirit lees was carbonized and then activated by steam and CO 2 to prepare activatedcarbons. The effect of carbonization temperature; type and amount of activator; activationtemperature and time on the pore structure; and the adsorption of methylene blue and iodinewere investigated. The gas products during activation were analyzed online to reveal theactivation mechanism. Results showed that steam activation was rather more active than CO2. Regardless of the activation agent; a low carbonization temperature of 450° C and amedium activation temperature of 800° C favored the iodine adsorption. For the methyleneblue adsorption; the same low carbonization temperature of 450° C; however; medium/highactivation temperatures (850–900° C) are favorable. The best activated carbon wasprepared with a steam activator using a carbonization temperature of 450° C and an …,Carbon,2013,5

Theoretical analysis on the development of opaque fibers based on Mie scattering,Ni Wang; Wenyan Pan; Meiwu Shi; Jianyong Yu,Mie scattering theory has been widely used to solve the problem of light scattering by singlespherical particles in many fields. In this article; it was applied for the development ofopaque fiber for the first time. Firstly; the spheroid particles were simplified as equivalentspherical particles. Then; the extinction coefficient was calculated using the Matlab programand the influences of the size parameter; refractive index and the wavelength of the incidentlight on the extinction coefficient were discussed in detail. Finally; the results indicated thatthe extinction coefficient depended greatly on the dimension and the refractive index of theparticles; and also the wavelength of the incident light. For the development of the opaquefiber; it would be better to choose particles that had the higher refractive index and a certaindiameter distribution to achieve the most effective light scattering.,Textile Research Journal,2013,5

A framework of algorithms: Computing the bias and prestige of nodes in trust networks,Rong-Hua Li; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xin Huang; Hong Cheng,A trust network is a social network in which edges represent the trust relationship betweentwo nodes in the network. In a trust network; a fundamental question is how to assess andcompute the bias and prestige of the nodes; where the bias of a node measures thetrustworthiness of a node and the prestige of a node measures the importance of the node.The larger bias of a node implies the lower trustworthiness of the node; and the largerprestige of a node implies the higher importance of the node. In this paper; we define avector-valued contractive function to characterize the bias vector which results in a richfamily of bias measurements; and we propose a framework of algorithms for computing thebias and prestige of nodes in trust networks. Based on our framework; we develop fouralgorithms that can calculate the bias and prestige of nodes effectively and robustly. The …,PloS one,2012,5

On summarizing graph homogeneously,Zheng Liu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Graph summarization is to obtain a concise representation of a large graph; whichis suitable for visualization and analysis. The main idea is to construct a super-graph bygrouping similar nodes together. In this paper; we propose a new information-preservingapproach for graph summarization; which consists of two parts: a super-graph and a list ofprobability distribution vectors affiliated to the super-nodes and super-edges. After acarefully analysis of the approximately homogenous grouping; we propose a unified modelusing information theory to relax all conditions and measure the quality of thesummarization. We also develop a new lazy algorithm to compute the exactly homogenousgrouping; as well as two algorithms to compute the approximate grouping.

In this paper; we study a new problem of discovering burst areas thatexhibit dramatic changes during some periods in evolving graphs. We focus on finding thetop-k results in a stream of fast graph evolutions. This problem is challenging because whenthe graph evolutions are coming in a high speed; the solution should be capable of handlinga large amount of evolutions in short time and returning the top-k results as soon aspossible. The experimental results on real data sets show that our proposed solution is veryefficient and effective.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,5

Indexing the function: An efficient algorithm for multi-dimensional search with expensive distance functions,Hanxiong Chen; Jianquan Liu; Kazutaka Furuse; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Nobuo Ohbo,Abstract Indexing structures based on space partitioning are powerless because of the well-known “curse of dimensionality”. Linear scan of the data with approximation is more efficientin high dimensional similarity search. However; approaches so far concentrated on reducingI/O; ignored the computation cost. For an expensive distance function such as L p norm withfractional p; the computation cost becomes the bottleneck. We propose a new technique toaddress expensive distance functions by “indexing the function” by pre-computing some keyvalues of the function once. Then; the values are used to develop the upper/lower bounds ofthe distance between each data and the query vector. The technique is extremely efficientsince it avoids most of the distance function computations; moreover; it does not spend anyextra storage because no index is constructed and stored. The efficiency is confirmed by …,International Conference on Advanced Data Mining and Applications,2009,5
Preparation and gas sensitivity of conducting polymeric nanowires,Jianhua Xu; Yajie Yang; Ya-dong JIANG; Jun-sheng YU,Conducting polymer nanowires of poly (3; 4-ethylene dioxythiophene)(PEDOT) was firstlyprepared by an simple wetting anodic aluminium oxide template (AAO) method. The AAOtemplate was wetted by PEDOT polymer solution and the conducting polymer nanowireswas formed into the hole of template. The formed PEDOT nanowires was characterized byUV-vis-near IR (UV-vis-NIR) absorption spectrum; and the result showed that the nanowireswas in a doped state. The size of obtained nanowires was larger than the size of AAOtemplate pore; which resulted from a swelling effect of polymer after removing AAO template.Conductivity investigation showed that nanowires had higher conductivity than conventionalbulk PEDOT materials and exhibited excellent doping/dedoping characteristic. For thesensitive characteristics study; the PEDOT nanowires showed faster response to different …,Journal of Functional Materials,2009,5

The effects of amount of added lime; amount of introduced CO2 andtemperature on protein reduction efficiency and Ca2+ concentraction in the inulin extractsolution were investigated by single-factor method. Based on canonical analysis; the optimalconditions for maximizing protein reduction efficiency were determined as follows: addinglime to pH 13.4; introducing CO2 to pH 6.8; and reaction temperature 80℃. The optimizedprocess resulted in over 81.6% protein reduction and only 3.4% inulin loss (especially; over90% fructose was contained); indicating notable efficiency to remove reduced sugars withlower loss of inulin.,Food Science,2009,5
Application Benchmark,Denilson Barbosa; Ioana Manolescu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,1. Software non-determinism: A software system is non-deterministic if; when re-executed; itresults in a different execution path than a prior execution. Non-determinism can arise when;for example; paths are determined by relative processor speed or the sequence of externalevents. Such software bugs have been called ''Heisenbugs''(hard failures being ''Bohrbugs'').2. Soft hardware failures: Hardware can also suffer from ''Heisenbugs.''For example; atransient hardware failure may be triggered by an environmental cause; such as a cosmicray changing a memory bit; etc. 3. Operator failures: Systems occasionally require operatorintervention. Operators; being human; make mistakes. An operator is unlikely to make thesame mistake at the same point in a subsequent execution.,*,2009,5
Mining multiple time series co-movements,Di Wu; Gabriel Pui Cheong Fung; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Zheng Liu,Abstract In this paper; we propose a new model; called co-movement model; for constructingfinancial portfolios by analyzing and mining the co-movement patterns among multiple timeseries. Unlike the existing approaches where the portfolios' expected risks are computedbased on the co-variances among the assets in the portfolios; we model their risks byconsidering the co-movement patterns of the time series. For example; given two financialassets; A and B; where we know that whenever the price of A drops; the price of B will drop;and vice versa. Intuitively; it may not be appropriate to construct a portfolio by including bothA and B concurrently; as the exposure of loss will be increased. Yet; such kind ofrelationship can not always be captured by co-variance (ie traditional statistics). Apart frommanipulating the risk; our proposed co-movement model also alters the computation of …,Asia-Pacific Web Conference,2008,5

Semantics based buffer reduction for queries over XML data streams,Chi Yang; Chengfei Liu; Jianxin Li; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Junhu Wang,Abstract With respect to current methods for query evaluation over XML data streams;adoption of certain types of buffering techniques is unavoidable. Under lots ofcircumstances; the buffer scale may increase exponentially; which can cause memorybottleneck. Some optimization techniques have been proposed to solve the problem.However; the limit of these techniques has been defined by a concurrency lower bound andbeen theoretically proved. In this paper; we show through an empirical study that this lowerbound can be broken by taking semantic information into account for buffer reduction. Todemonstrate this; we build a SAX-based XML stream query evaluation system and designan algorithm that consumes buffers in line with the concurrency lower bound. After a furtheranalysis of the lower bound; we design several semantic rules for the purpose of breaking …,Proceedings of the nineteenth conference on Australasian database-Volume 75,2008,5

A window-based algorithm for skyline queries,Jing Yu; Xin Liu; Guo-hua Liu,Given a set of points; the skyline comprises the points that are not dominated by other points.A point dominates another point if it is as good or better in all dimensions and better in atleast one dimension. Skyline queries are important for several database applications;including customer information systems; decision support; and data visualization. In thispaper we propose a window-based algorithm for skyline queries; which transforms skylinequeries into many different dynamic window queries. Though the first window query we getthe first skyline point; then we only need to search the points in the valid region we defined;so it is not necessary to retrieve all the points in the space and prune query space effectivelyand significantly. The window queries only visit the possible skyline points; and only visiteach point once; the number of the accessed data points decreases significantly; the …,Parallel and Distributed Computing; Applications and Technologies; 2005.

Safe database queries with external functions,Hong-Cheu Liu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Considers the theory of database queries with functions in the complex-value data model.The notion of a syntactic criterion; called" embedded allowed"; for queries which guaranteeembedded domain independence; is generalized for this model. We show that all"embedded allowed" calculus (or fixpoint) queries are external function domain-independentand continuous. We also develop an algorithm for translating" embedded allowed" queriesinto equivalent algebraic expressions as a basis for evaluating safe queries in all calculus-based query classes. We then compare the expressive power of various complex-valuequery languages extended with functions and certain restricted versions of them. If weassume polynomial time (space) complexity of external functions and type usage by thedatabase; such as density; then strongly" embedded allowed" inflationary (partial) fixpoint …,Database Engineering and Applications; 1999.

Finding influential communities in massive networks,Rong-Hua Li; Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Rui Mao,Abstract Community search is a problem of finding densely connected subgraphs that satisfythe query conditions in a network; which has attracted much attention in recent years.However; all the previous studies on community search do not consider the influence of acommunity. In this paper; we introduce a novel community model called k-influentialcommunity based on the concept of k-core to capture the influence of a community. Basedon this community model; we propose a linear time online search algorithm to find the top-rk-influential communities in a network. To further speed up the influential community searchalgorithm; we devise a linear space data structure which supports efficient search of the top-rk-influential communities in optimal time. We also propose an efficient algorithm to maintainthe data structure when the network is frequently updated. Additionally; we propose a …,The VLDB Journal,2017,4
Exploring hierarchies in online social networks,Can Lu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Rong-Hua Li; Hao Wei,Social hierarchy (ie; pyramid structure of societies) is a fundamental concept in sociologyand social network analysis. The importance of social hierarchy in a social network is thatthe topological structure of the social hierarchy is essential in both shaping the nature ofsocial interactions between individuals and unfolding the structure of the social networks.The social hierarchy found in a social network can be utilized to improve the accuracy of linkprediction; provide better query results; rank web pages; and study information flow andspread in complex networks. In this paper; we model a social network as a directed graph $G $; and consider the social hierarchy as DAG (directed acyclic graph) of $ G $; denoted as$ G_D $. By DAG; all the vertices in $ G $ can be partitioned into different levels; the verticesat the same level represent a disjoint group in the social hierarchy; and all the edges in …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,4
Hybrid pulling/pushing for i/o-efficient distributed and iterative graph computing,Zhigang Wang; Yu Gu; Yubin Bao; Ge Yu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Billion-node graphs are rapidly growing in size in many applications such as onlinesocial networks. Most graph algorithms generate a large number of messages duringiterative computations. Vertex-centric distributed systems usually store graph data andmessage data on disk to improve scalability. Currently; these distributed systems with disk-resident data take a push-based approach to handle messages. This works well if fewmessages reside on disk. Otherwise; it is I/O-inefficient due to expensive random writes. Bycontrast; the existing memory-resident pull-based approach individually pulls messages foreach vertex on demand. Although it can be used to avoid disk operations regardingmessages; expensive I/O costs are incurred by random and frequent access to vertices. Thispaper proposes a hybrid solution to support switching between push and pull adaptively …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,4
Sfdc: File access pattern aware cache framework for high-performance computer,Wenrui Dong; Guangming Liu; Jie Yu; Wei Hu; Xin Liu,The performance gap between computation and storage in HPC systems is enlarged withthe rapid increase of compute scale. Client-side file caching has been proved to be aneffective technique to improve I/O performance in parallel file system adopted by HPCsystems. Current cache frameworks mainly focus on local thread access frequency; whichsuffers from cache inefficiency problems for the lack of file level access information. Thispaper presents SFDC; a caching framework that aims to improve I/O performance throughproviding high cache efficiency by using file level access knowledge. SFDC collects accesstraces of each file from all the processes; evaluates each file according to access traces;evicts valueless file data from cache space as early as possible and prefetches valuable filedata before being used. Moreover; SFDC can reduce small access to underlying parallel …,High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC); 2015 IEEE 7th International Symposium on Cyberspace Safety and Security (CSS); 2015 IEEE 12th International Conferen on Embedded Software and Systems (ICESS); 2015 IEEE 17th International Conference on,2015,4

Energy-efficient top-k query evaluation and maintenance in wireless sensor networks,Baichen Chen; Weifa Liang; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Top-k query in a wireless sensor network is to identify k sensors with the highestsensor readings. Since sensors usually are powered by energy-limited batteries; afundamental problem associated with top-k query evaluation in such a network is tomaximize network lifetime; which poses great challenges due to the unique characteristics ofsensor networks. In this paper; we first propose a novel filter-based algorithm for top-k queryevaluation; which is able to filter out a fractional amount of data from network-widetransmission. We then develop an online algorithm for answering time-dependent top-kqueries with different values of k through the dynamic maintenance of a materialized viewthat consists of historical top-k results. We finally conduct extensive experiments bysimulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms using real sensing …,Wireless networks,2014,4

Through comparison between simulation and empirical analysis on thesocial networks of Twitter and Sina Weibo; we validate the effectiveness of the proposedmodel and estimate the evolutionary phases of the two networks. We find that the users ofSina Weibo can withstand comparatively more costs than the users of Twitter. Therefore;they can perform more positive behavior and consider more about their reputation thanTwitter users. Moreover; the evolutionary time of Sina Weibo to a stable state is longer thanthat of Twitter.,Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on World Wide Web,2014,4

By top-down; we mean that we visit all common ancestor (CA)nodes in a depth-first; left-to-right order; thus avoid the CAR problem; by generic; we meanthat our method is independent of the labeling schemes and query semantics. We show thatthe satisfiability of a node v wrt the given semantics can be determined by v's child nodes;based on which our methods avoid the VUN problem.

Androgen receptors expressed by prostatic stromal cells obtained from younger versus older males exhibit opposite roles in prostate cancer progression,You-Yi Lu; Bo Jiang; Fu-Jun Zhao; Di Cui; Qi Jiang; Jun-Jie Yu; En-Hui Li; Xiao-Hai Wang; Bang-Min Han; Shu-Jie Xia,Abstract Aging is a major risk factor for prostate cancer (PCa); and prostatic stromal cellsmay also promote PCa progression. Accordingly; stromal cells do not equally promote PCain older males and younger males. Therefore; it is also possible that the expression ofandrogen receptors (ARs) by prostatic stromal cells in older versus younger males playsdifferent roles in PCa progression. Using a gene knockdown technique and coculturesystem; we found that the knockdown of the AR in prostatic stromal cells obtained fromyounger males could promote the invasiveness and metastasis of cocultured PC3/LNCaPcells in vitro. By contrast; the invasiveness and metastasis of LNCaP cells was inhibitedwhen cocultured with prostatic stromal cells from older males that when AR expression wasknocked down. Moreover; after targeting AR expression with small hairpin RNA (shRNA) …,Asian journal of andrology,2013,4

Finding the optimal path over multi-cost graphs,Yajun Yang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hong Gao; Jianzhong Li,Abstract Shortest path query is an important problem in graphs and has been well-studied.However; most approaches for shortest path query are based on single-cost (weight)graphs. In this paper; we introduce the definition of multi-cost graph and study a novel query:the optimal path query over multi-cost graphs. We propose a best-first branch and boundsearch algorithm with two optimizing strategies. Furthermore; we propose a novel indexnamed k-cluster index to make our method more space and time efficient for large graphs.We discuss how to construct and utilize k-cluster index.

Revisiting answering tree pattern queries using views,Junhu Wang; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract We revisit the problem of answering tree pattern queries using views. We first showthat; for queries and views that do not have nodes labeled with the wildcard*; there is anapproach which does not require us to find any rewritings explicitly; yet which produces thesame answers as the maximal contained rewriting. Then; using the new approach; we givesimple conditions and a corresponding algorithm for identifying redundant view answers;which are view answers that can be ignored when evaluating the maximal containedrewriting. We also consider redundant view answers in the case where there are multipleviews; the relationship between redundant views and redundant view answers; and discusshow to combine the removal of redundant view answers and redundant rewritings. We showthat the aforesaid results can be extended to a number of other special cases. Finally; for …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2012,4

If the answer is no; when is T-[I+(T¯-T) T-]-1 an inner inverse of T¯? Inthis paper; we give a complete answer to these problems and provide somecharacterizations for T-[I+(T¯-T) T-]-1 to be an inner inverse of T¯ in Banach spaces. Utilizingthese results; we investigate similar problems for the generalized inverse;{1; 3}-inverse;{1; 4}-inverse;{1; 5}-inverse;{1; 2; 3}-inverse;{1; 2; 4}-inverse; Moore–Penrose inverse; groupinverse and Drazin inverse.

Emergency evacuation planning for highly populated urban zones: a transit-based solution and optimal operational strategies,Yue Liu; Jie Yu,Natural and man-made disasters (eg hurricanes; floods; terrorist attacks) could cause hugeeconomic loss and society damage. In many hazardous events; the best option is to relocatethreatened populations to safer areas; which is commonly referred as emergencyevacuation. During the process of evacuation; people would usually use their own vehiclesto evacuate from the impacted area. However; there are some cases where people may nothave access to reliable personal vehicles or using personal cars are not possible; then theyneed to rely on other forms of transportation. There are different modes of transportation thatcan be used to evacuate people; such as public transit; school buses; charter buses;demand-responsive vans; rail; and ambulances. In view of literature; though significantcontribution has been made in evacuation modelling considering passenger cars only …,*,2012,4
A survey of relational approaches for graph pattern matching over large graphs,Jiefeng Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Due to rapid growth of the Internet and new scientific/technological advances; thereexist many new applications that model data as graphs; because graphs have sufficientexpressiveness to model complicated structures. The dominance of graphs in real-worldapplications demands new graph processing techniques to access and analyze large graphdatasets effectively and efficiently. Among those techniques; a graph pattern matchingproblem receives increasing attention; which is to find all patterns in a large data graph thatmatch a user-given graph pattern. In this survey; we review approaches to process suchgraph pattern queries with a framework of multi joins; which can be easily implemented inrelational databases and requires no specialized native storage for graphs. We also discussthe top-k graph pattern matching problem.,*,2012,4

Answering frequent probabilistic inference queries in databases,Shaoxu Song; Lei Chen; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Existing solutions for probabilistic inference queries mainly focus on answering a singleinference query; but seldom address the issues of efficiently returning results for a sequenceof frequent queries; which is more popular and practical in many real applications. In thispaper; we mainly study the computation caching and sharing among a sequence ofinference queries in databases. The clique tree propagation (CTP) algorithm is firstintroduced in databases for probabilistic inference queries. We use the materialized views tocache the intermediate results of the previous inference queries; which might be shared withthe following queries; and consequently reduce the time cost. Moreover; we take the queryworkload into account to identify the frequently queried variables. To optimize probabilisticinference queries with CTP; we cache these frequent query variables into the …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2011,4
Photodiode Based on ZnO Nanorod/CuPc Hybrid,Wenming Ma; Junsheng Yu; Zhaolin Yuan; Yadong Jiang,A high performance organic-inorganic heterojunction photodiode based copper (II)phthalocyanine (CuPc) and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorods (NRs) have been fabricated. TheZnO NRs are enveloped by CuPc overlayers. The electrical properties of ITO/ZnONRs/CuPc/Ag sandwiched structures have been measured in dark and under 100 mW/cm2.The device has shown excellent reproducibility of their electrical characteristics. A highrectification ratio of 51 at a bias of 1 V is achieved for the photodiode along with a lowideality factor of 1.1. Such low ideality factor indicates that charge transport was primarilydue to the diffusion of majority charge carriers across ZnO NRs/CuPc junction.,Integrated Ferroelectrics,2011,4

Extending matching rules with conditions,Shaoxu Song; Lei Chen; Jeffrey Xu Yu,ABSTRACT Matching dependencies (mds) have recently been proposed [10] in order tomake dependencies tolerant to various information representations; and proved [13] usefulin data quality applications such as record matching. Instead of strict identification function intraditional dependency syntax (eg; functional dependencies); mds specify dependenciesbased on similarity matching quality. However; in practice; mds may still be too strict andonly hold in a subset of tuples in a relation. Thereby; we study conditioning mds in a subsetof tuples; called conditional matching dependencies (cmds); which bind matchingdependencies only in a certain part of a table. Compared to mds; cmds have moreexpressive power that enable them satisfy wider application needs. In this paper; we studyseveral important theoretical and practical issues of cmds; including inferring cmds; the …,Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Quality in Databases,2010,4

When there is no dtd; we show how to modify the approach of usefulembedding in a previous work to find the maximal contained rewriting. When there is a dtdthat is represented as an acyclic schema graph G; we show how to efficiently transform theview V to an equivalent DAG-pattern V′; and reduce the problem of finding the maximalcontained rewriting of query Q using V under G to that of finding the maximal containedrewriting of Q using V′ without dtd s.,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2008,4
Hierarchical indexing approach to support XPath queries,Nan Tang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; M Tamer Ozsu; Kam-Fai Wong,We study new hierarchical indexing approach to process XPATH queries. Here; ahierarchical index consists of index entries that are pairs of queries and their (full/partial)answers (called extents). With such an index; XPATH queries can be processed to extractthe results if they match the queries maintained in those index entries. Existing XML pathindexing approaches support either child-axis (/) only; or additional descendant-or-self-axis(//) but only in the query root. Different from them; we propose a novel indexing approach toprocess a large fragment of XPATH queries; which may use/;//; and wildcards (*). The keyissues are how to reduce the number of index entries and how to maintain non-overlappingextents among index entries. We show how to compress such index and how to evaluateXPATH queries on it. Experiments show the efficiency of our approaches.,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,4

Revisit on view maintenance in data warehouses,Weifa Liang; X Yu Jeffrey,Abstract The complete consistence maintenance of SPJ-type materialized views in adistributed source environment has been studied extensively in the past several years dueto its fundamental importance to data warehouses. Much effort has been taken based on anassumption that each source site contains only one relation and no multiple appearances ofa relation is allowed in the definition of views. In this paper a generalized version of the viewmaintenance problem that not only a relation may appear many times in the definition of theview but also a site may contain multiple relations is considered. Due to unpredictability ofthe communication delay and bandwidth between the data warehouse and the sources; thematerialized view maintenance is very expensive and time consuming. Therefore; onenatural question for this generalized case is whether there is an algorithm which not only …,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2001,4

Dag reduction: Fast answering reachability queries,Junfeng Zhou; Shijie Zhou; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hao Wei; Ziyang Chen; Xian Tang,Abstract Answering reachability queries is one of the fundamental graph operations. Theexisting approaches build indexes and answer reachability queries on a directed acyclicgraph (DAG) G; which is constructed by coalescing each strongly connected component ofthe given directed graph G into a node of G. Considering that G can still be large to beprocessed efficiently; there are studies to further reduce G to a smaller graph. However;these approaches suffer from either inefficiency in answering reachability queries; or cannotscale to large graphs. In this paper; we study DAG reduction to accelerate reachability queryprocessing; which reduces the size of G by computing transitive reduction (TR) followed bycomputing equivalence reduction (ER). For ER; we propose a divide-and-conquer algorithm;namely linear-ER.

The airfoil pitching waveform was performed under the condition calculatedfrom the angle of attack histogram of a vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT). Using PIV; theinstantaneous vorticity contours and streamlines can be revealed. Based on the formation ofthe leading edge vortex; the stall angle can be explored at reduced frequency k= 0.09; 0.18;and 0.27. It was found that the stall angle was delayed from the angle of attack α= 16° to α=30° as reduced frequency increased from k= 0.09 to 0.27. The hysteresis effect of stall angledelay was more pronounced for high reduced frequency.

Inferring directions of undirected social ties,Jun Zhang; Chaokun Wang; Jianmin Wang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Jun Chen; Changping Wang,The directionality is a significant but inherent property of social ties; though usually ignoredin undirected social networks due to its invisibility. However; we believe most social ties arenatively directed; and the perception of directionality can improve our understanding aboutthe network structures and further benefit other tasks upon social networks. In this study; weaddress the latent tie direction inference problem in undirected social networks. We engagein the investigation of directionality on real-world large-scale directed social networks andsummarize our findings using four patterns. Upon that we propose a family of ReDirectapproaches; including ReDirect-N; ReDirect-T and ReDirect-One; to inferring the hiddendirections of undirected social ties based on the network topology only.

Meta-Path Guided Embedding for Similarity Search in Large-Scale Heterogeneous Information Networks,Jingbo Shang; Meng Qu; Jialu Liu; Lance M Kaplan; Jiawei Han; Jian Peng,Abstract: Most real-world data can be modeled as heterogeneous information networks(HINs) consisting of vertices of multiple types and their relationships. Search for similarvertices of the same type in large HINs; such as bibliographic networks and business-reviewnetworks; is a fundamental problem with broad applications. Although similarity search inHINs has been studied previously; most existing approaches neither explore rich semanticinformation embedded in the network structures nor take user's preference as a guidance. Inthis paper; we re-examine similarity search in HINs and propose a novel embedding-basedframework. It models vertices as low-dimensional vectors to explore network structure-embedded similarity. To accommodate user preferences at defining similarity semantics; ourproposed framework; ESim; accepts user-defined meta-paths as guidance to learn vertex …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1610.09769,2016,3
Finding top-k influential users in social networks under the structural diversity model,Wenzheng Xu; Weifa Liang; Xiaola Lin; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract The influence maximization problem in a large-scale social network is to identify afew influential users such that their influence on the other users in the network is maximized;under a given influence propagation model. One common assumption adopted by twopopular influence propagation models is that a user is more likely to be influenced if morehis/her friends have already been influenced. This assumption recently however waschallenged to be over simplified and inaccurate; as influence propagation process typicallyis much more complex than that; and the social decision of a user depends more subtly onthe network structure; rather than how many his/her influenced friends. Instead; it has beenshown that a user is very likely to be influenced by structural diversities of his/her friends. Inthis paper; we first formulate a novel influence maximization problem under this new …,Information Sciences,2016,3
Efficient and progressive group steiner tree search,Rong-Hua Li; Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Rui Mao,Abstract The Group Steiner Tree (GST) problem is a fundamental problem in database areathat has been successfully applied to keyword search in relational databases and teamsearch in social networks. The state-of-the-art algorithm for the GST problem is aparameterized dynamic programming (DP) algorithm; which finds the optimal tree in O (3 kn+ 2 k (n log n+ m)) time; where k is the number of given groups; m and n are the number ofthe edges and nodes of the graph respectively. The major limitations of the parameterizedDP algorithm are twofold:(i) it is intractable even for very small values of k (eg; k= 8) in largegraphs due to its exponential complexity; and (ii) it cannot generate a solution until thealgorithm has completed its entire execution. To overcome these limitations; we propose anefficient and progressive GST algorithm in this paper; called PrunedDP. It is based on …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,3

Full-duplex RoF link with broadband mm-wave signal in W-band based on WDM-PON access network with optical mm-wave local oscillator broadcasting,Jianxin Ma; Ruijiao Zhang; Yanjie Li; Qi Zhang; Jianguo Yu,Abstract A novel full-duplex link with an optical mm-wave local oscillator broadcasting forbroadband millimeter (mm)-wave wireless access in W-band is proposed based on theWDM-PON-RoF. In our scheme; a universal optical mm-wave local oscillator in W-band isdistributed over the whole network to up-convert the downlink IF optical signal; which notonly improves the spectrum efficiency by reducing the bandwidth requirement of eachdownlink; but also decreases the degradation caused by the fiber chromatic dispersion.Moreover; since the incoherently down-converted uplink signal is modulated on the reusedblank optical carrier extracted from the downlink signal; the base stations (BSs) need nooptical source; and so its structure is simplified. The numerical simulation results agree wellwith the theoretical analysis and show that the proposed full-duplex link for the W-band …,Optics Communications,2015,3

Efficiently computing top-k shortest path join,Lijun Chang; Xuemin Lin; Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Jian Pei,ABSTRACT Driven by many applications; in this paper we study the problem of computingthe top-k shortest paths from one set of target nodes to another set of target nodes in agraph; namely the top-k shortest path join (KPJ) between two sets of target nodes. While KPJis an extension of the problem of computing the top-k shortest paths (KSP) between twotarget nodes; the existing technique by converting KPJ to KSP has several deficiencies inconducting the computation. To resolve these; we propose to use the best-first paradigm torecursively divide search subspaces into smaller subspaces; and to compute the shortestpath in each of the subspaces in a prioritized order based on their lower bounds.Consequently; we only compute shortest paths in subspaces whose lower bounds are largerthan the length of the current k-th shortest path. To improve the efficiency; we further …,Extending Database Technology,2015,3

Signal-to-interference-ratio based capacity analysis for vehicular Ad hoc networks,Minming Ni; Jian Yu; Hao Wu; Zhangdui Zhong,Considering the different quality of service (QoS) requirements posed by the variousapplications of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs); the characteristic of communicationcapacity is vital for the design of the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Although somescaling law-based results had already been obtained for VANETs to describe the generalperformance changing pattern when the total number of network nodes goes to infinity; theycannot be used directly to estimate the actual capacity of a communication pair or the entirenetwork. To make up with this disadvantage; a interference-based capacity analysis isfinished in this paper for the VANET scenario. For representing the unique constrain of inter-vehicle distance; which directly affects both the signal and interference power decaying; thecar-following model is used to describe the vehicles' mobility feature.

A systematic top–down approach for the identification and decomposition of product key characteristics,Wenbin Tang; Yuan Li; Jianfeng Yu; Jie Zhang; Lin Yu,Methodologies for the identification of key characteristics have been widely applied inquality management through the selection of critical dimensions and the measurement ofvariations. However; methods for both the identification and decomposition of keycharacteristics have not yet been developed; and more research is still required. Inanswering this need; a systematic top–down decomposition approach for the identification ofkey characteristics is proposed. The methodology of the identification and decomposition ofkey characteristics can be divided into two steps: first is the construction of candidatecharacteristics; and second is the identification of key characteristics. These steps are basedon precise mathematical definitions. Initially; the necessary information for the constructionof the candidate characteristics is obtained from analysis based on assembly-oriented …,Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers; Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture,2014,3
Dynamic assembly simplification for virtual assembly process of complex product in cloud computing environment,Hong Xiao; Yuan Li; Jianfeng Yu; Jie Zhang; Wenbin Tang,Three-dimensional model–based virtual assembly process planning plays an important rolein assembly design of complex product and is typically time-and resource-intensive. Thereare limited effective solution frameworks for delivering the three-dimensional model–basedassembly process information to assembly field in order to directly guide the assembly taskson site. A cloud service architecture for mobile three-dimensional model is proposed toaddress these challenges. Under this cloud computing architecture; this article introduces adynamic assembly simplification approach; which regards the virtual assembly process ofcomplex product as an incremental growth process of dynamic assembly.

Identifying interaction groups in social network using a game-theoretic approach,Jianye Yu; Yuanzhuo Wang; Xiaolong Jin; Xueqi Cheng,Abstract There are often enormous interactions among users of online social networkingservices. Based on their interactions and the corresponding contents; the users can beclustered into different interaction groups with different interests. In this paper; we propose agame-theoretic approach for formulating the dynamics of users' participation into interactiongroups on a social network formed by users' interrelationships. A partition of the socialnetwork into interaction groups corresponds to an equilibrium of the game. In the proposedapproach; the original interaction network is reduced to an effective one based on theattributes of interactions; where the proposed game is played. In the game; each node isrepresented by a selfish agent that performs actions to join or leave interaction groupsaccording to its utility. An agent may belong to more than one interaction group because …,Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conferences on Web Intelligence (WI) and Intelligent Agent Technologies (IAT)-Volume 02,2014,3

The positive effects of typhoons on the fish CPUE in the South China Sea,Jie Yu; Danling Tang; Guobao Chen; Yongzhen Li; Zirong Huang; Sufen Wang,Abstract Due to the logistical difficulties associated with fish data sampling after typhoons;short-term effects of typhoons on fishery in the South China Sea (SCS) have not been well-understood. The present study is to evaluate the impacts on the fish catch per unit effort(CPUE) owing to the three typhoons Chanthu; Vicente; and Kai-tak in the northwestern SCS;using long-term fish catch data and satellite data. The results show that the CPUE of totalcatch and some sorted catches have been changing because of the typhoons. On totalcatch; firstly; the CPUE has increased approximately 0.32 kg h− 1 kw− 1; 0.20 kg h− 1 kw− 1;and 0.25 kg h− 1 kw− 1 during the three typhoon periods. Then; the CPUEs decreased to thepre-typhoon level in about three weeks. Thirdly; among the three typhoons; the slow-movingChanthu has caused a larger increase in CPUE.

Demonstration of chirped-pulse compression with an object-image-grating self-tiling grating compressor,Zhaoyang Li; Tao Wang; Guang Xu; Xiaoping Ouyang; Dawei Li; Hui Wei; Jianwei Yu; Lei Chen; Yaping Dai,The capability of chirped-pulse compression and beam focusing of an object-image-gratingself-tiling grating compressor is demonstrated in an optical parametric chirped-pulseamplification laser for the first time. Probe lasers for tiling error adjustments; which aregenerally required by the traditional tiled-grating compressor; are not needed in ourdemonstration any more. With the aid of the double-sized effective optical aperture of thesecond grating in the compressor; a 490 fs near-transform-limit pulse duration and a 90 μmnear-diffraction-limit focal spot are obtained; synchronously; which are very close to the onesachieved by a non-tiled grating compressor with equal-sized individual gratings.,Journal of Modern Optics,2014,3
Efficient truss maintenance in evolving networks,Rui Zhou; Chengfei Liu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Weifa Liang; Yanchun Zhang,Abstract: Truss was proposed to study social network data represented by graphs. A k-trussof a graph is a cohesive subgraph; in which each edge is contained in at least k-2 triangleswithin the subgraph. While truss has been demonstrated as superior to model the closerelationship in social networks and efficient algorithms for finding trusses have beenextensively studied; very little attention has been paid to truss maintenance. However; mostsocial networks are evolving networks. It may be infeasible to recompute trusses fromscratch from time to time in order to find the up-to-date $ k $-trusses in the evolving networks.In this paper; we discuss how to maintain trusses in a graph with dynamic updates. We firstdiscuss a set of properties on maintaining trusses; then propose algorithms on maintainingtrusses on edge deletions and insertions; finally; we discuss truss index maintenance.

Salt-inducible kinase 1 (SIK1) prevents fibrosis by downregulating ALK5; while theexpression level of the SIK1 protein itself is downregulated by glucose in neuronal cellsfollowing ischemia. In this study; we investigated the correlation between SIK1 and the ALK5signaling pathway in a rat glomerular mesangial cell line (HBZY-1 cells). We found that highglucose levels downregulated the expression level of SIK1 and suppressed thephosphorylation of SIK1 at Thr-182. The downregulation of SIK1 by high glucose wasaccompanied by the activation of the ALK5 signaling pathway; while the overexpression ofSIK1 in the HBZY-1 cells resulted in a decrease in the ALK5 protein level; as well in the …,International journal of molecular medicine,2013,3

An analytic model and computationalmethod were established based on the process of gas diffusion in boundary layer and theequilibrium relations in surface chemical reactions. Simultaneously; an engineeringequation to predict the oxygen partial pressure of active-to-passive transition was derivedunder the specific temperature zone. The results indicated that the active-to-passiveoxidation transition of C/SiC is closely related to the composition of the material. At certaintemperature and oxygen partial pressure conditions; the composite with high carbon contentis prone to cause active oxidation which is negative to the oxidation resistance of thematerial.,Science China Technological Sciences,2013,3

However;little existing work has studied reachability with realistic constraints imposed on graphs withreal-valued edge or node weights. In fact; such weights are very common in many real-worldnetworks; for example; the bandwidth of a link in communication networks; the reliability ofan interaction between two proteins in PPI networks; and the handling capacity of awarehouse/storage point in a distribution network. In this paper; we formalize a new yetimportant reachability query in weighted undirected graphs; called weight constraintreachability (WCR) query that asks: is there a path between nodes a and b; on which …,The VLDB Journal,2013,3

It was found that the OFETs with the organic buffer layers exhibitedsignificant improved electrical characteristics; such as saturation current; threshold voltage;field-effect mobility and current on/off ratio. Moreover; by optimizing the film thicknesses ofthese buffer layers; we also found that the buffer layers with appropriate film thickness caneffectively improve charge carrier injection from Ag source/drain electrodes to C 60 films.Also; the interface properties and the contact resistance between Ag source/drain electrodesand C 60 films have been analyzed.,Synthetic Metals,2013,3

Aimbot detection in online fps games using a heuristic method based on distribution comparison matrix,Su-Yang Yu; Nils Hammerla; Jeff Yan; Peter Andras,Abstract Online gaming is very popular and has gained some recognition as the so called e-sport over the last decade. However; in particular First Person Shooter (FPS) games sufferfrom the development of sophisticated cheating methods such as aiming robots (aimbot);which can boost the players ability to acquire and track targets by the illicit use of internalgame states. This not only gives an obvious unfair advantage to the cheater; but hasnegative impact on the gaming experience of honest players. In this paper we present anovel supervised method based on distribution comparison matrices that shows verypromising performance in the identification of players that use such aimbots. It extends ourprevious work in which two features were identified and shown to have good predictiveperformance. The proposed method is further compared with other classification …,International Conference on Neural Information Processing,2012,3

Only a very small percentage of geneticvariability has been used in crop breeding programs. Traditionally; F 1 plants are used tobackcross to the adapted lines or populations. An alternative approach is to backcross the F2 individuals selected for agronomic acceptability. Our objective was to determine whetherselection before backcross would lead to more progenies with both high yield andacceptable levels of agronomic performance than direct backcross without selection. To testthe feasibility of the proposed approach; we conducted parallel experiments in which twoexotic sorghum accessions were crossed to two adapted sorghum parents and furtherbackcrossing was conducted with either F 1 or selected F 2 plants.

These mutations cluster in the DNA-binding Runt domain and are thought torepresent loss-of-function mutations; indicating that RUNX1 suppresses T-celltransformation. RUNX1 has been proposed to have tumor suppressor roles in T-cellleukemia homeobox 1/3–transformed human T-ALL cell lines and NOTCH1 T-ALL mousemodels. Yet; retroviral insertional mutagenesis screens identify RUNX genes ascollaborating oncogenes in MYC-driven leukemia mouse models. To elucidate RUNX1function (s) in leukemogenesis; we generated Tal1/Lmo2/Rosa26-CreER T2 Runx1 f/f miceand examined leukemia progression in the presence of vehicle or tamoxifen.

Performance of a vertical closed pulsating heat pipe with hydroxylated MWNTs nanofluid,Meibo Xing; Jianlin Yu; Ruixiang Wang,Abstract The thermal performance of vertical closed pulsating heat pipe (PHP) using purewater and hydroxylated MWNTs nanofluids as working fluids were experimentallyinvestigated. The heat transfer characteristics of PHP are presented in terms of start-upprocedure; temperature fluctuation and thermal resistance. Experimental results show thatthe MWNTs nanofluid PHP exhibits the better start-up characteristics than water as theconcentration is below 0.3 wt%. The thermal characteristics are related to temperaturefluctuation and a greater frequency of temperature fluctuation means more efficient heattransfer in the PHP. Furthermore; the results indicate that the heat transfer performance ofPHP can be significantly improved by applying the hydroxylated MWNTs nanofluids at thelower concentration.

Participation in self-emulsification by oil-thin film voltammetry,Koichi Jeremiah Aoki; Jie Yu; Jingyuan Chen; Toyohiko Nishiumi,Abstract When an oil phase comes in contact with an aqueous phase; emulsions are formedspontaneously in each phase even without surfactant. The self-emulsification seemsinconsistent with the electron transfer model proposed by Anson; in which ferricyanide in theaqueous phase is reduced at the oil/water interface by decamethylferrocene of the thinnitrobenzene phase. Anson's experimental data were here reproduced at slow scanvoltammetry. However; the electron transfer model did not agree with our experimentalresults at high scan rates; in that the reduction wave of ferricyanide appeared withoutdecamethylferrocene. Ferricyanide was demonstrated to pass through the nitrobenzene filmin the form of aqueous droplets; which were adsorbed on the electrode surface.

Performance analysis of minimum variance asset allocation with high frequency data,Jian Yu; Francisco Rubio; Matthew R McKay,We investigate the asset allocation optimization under the time-varying high frequencyglobal minimum variance portfolio framework. The overall performance strongly relies on theestimate of the portfolio covariance matrix. However; for such applications; the sample sizeis often of similar order to the number of assets and in this case; the performance of theconventional covariance estimators are not very satisfactory. Additionally; the time variationeffects will further amplify the estimation error and thus lead to inaccurate and high-riskinvestment decisions. In this paper; we propose to use the recently developed time variationadjusted realized covariance (TVARCV) estimator in a shrinkage structure; in order toaddress the above-mentioned problems.

Carrier Tracking Based on Combination of FLL and PLL,Zhi-Peng Xu; Chen Cui; Jian Yu,A carrier-tracking loop is designed on the base of respective advantages and disadvantagesof FLL and PLL on carrier-tracking. Two thresholds (mc and mpe) are proposed according tothe reason that when FLL and PLL catch the frequency; the rest of frequency error andphase error are approximately equal to zero. When the two thresholds satisfy the givenconditions; the loop will choose work state automatically. Simulation shows that when thetwo thresholds satisfy the given conditions; the loop can switch work state correctly; andcarrier can all be tracked whenever the Doppler frequency is a constant value or a stepequation of time; and the aim of design is realized.,Dianxun Jishu/ Telecommunications Engineering,2012,2

Removal of low concentration NO at room temperature using metal oxide supported on activated carbon [J],Juan YANG; Yin WANG; Jian YU; Guangwen XU,Metal oxide supported on activated carbon was used to remove low concentration NO atroom temperature. Activated carbon was pretreated by oxidant before use. After nitrate acidtreatment; both carbonyl and nitro groups on the surface of activated carbon increased; andthe capacity of removing NO also increased significantly. The activated carbon treated bynitrate acid was then deposited with metal oxide to further improve NO removal efficiency. Itwas found that samples containing Ce and Co oxide show the longest NO breakthroughtime and highest removal capacity. Further study shows the final form of removed NO ismetal nitrate; indicating that NO was first oxidized to NO2 when passing through the sorbentand then reacted with the supported metal oxide.,CIESC Journal,2012,2

Probabilistic ranking over relations,Lijun Chang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lu Qin; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Probabilistic top-k ranking queries have been extensively studied due to the factthat data obtained can be uncertain in many real applications. A probabilistic top-k rankingquery ranks objects by the interplay of score and probability; with an implicit assumption thatboth scores based on which objects are ranked and probabilities of the existence of theobjects are stored in the same relation. We observe that in general scores and probabilitiesare highly possible to be stored in different relations; for example; in column-orientedDBMSs and in data warehouses. In this paper we study probabilistic top-k ranking querieswhen scores and probabilities are stored in different relations. We focus on reducing the joincost in probabilistic top-k ranking. We investigate two probabilistic score functions; discussthe upper/lower bounds in random access and sequential access; and provide insights …,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2010,2

The Incident Angle Determination Based on Infrared Polarization,Yinfeng WU; Jinhua YANG; Xinping YU,A new method to determine the incident angle in the shape detection of transparent objectswas given in this paper. This method was based on the polarization degree of infrared light.In the visible domain; the polarization degree is a secondorder function of incident angle.There was an angle on each side of the Brewster's angle; so the incident angle can not beuniquely determined. In the infrared light domain; the polarization degree and the incidenceangle are in the one-one correspondence. You can make a distinction between the twoangles in the visible domain and get the correct incident angle. This method improves theaccuracy of detection for shapes of transparent objects and can be used to detect objectswith complex shape.,Journal of Changchun University of Science and Technology (Natural Science Edition),2010,2

Making filters smart in distributed data stream environments,Cheqing Jin; Bolin Ding; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Monitoring aggregate queries in real-time over distributed streaming environmentsappears to be a great challenge not only because of the huge data volume and high rate;but also because of the limitation of the network transmission bandwidth. Consequently;ensuring qualified approximate results with economical network consumption becomes oneof the most important goals in such scenarios. In this paper; we study how to monitoraggregate queries continuously over distributed environments efficiently by disposingnumerous filters at remote sites; in order to transmit only a small part of incoming data to thequery site and therefore save the network resource significantly. We also show how to adjustthe parameters of a filter continuously when the incoming data distribution at thecorresponding remote site changes.

Threshold-voltage instability of polymer thin-film transistor under gate-bias and drain-bias stresses,YR Liu; JL Yu; PT Lai; ZX Wang; J Han; R Liao,Polymer thin-film transistors (PTFTs) based on MEH-PPV semiconductor are fabricated byspin-coating process and characterized. Gate-bias and drain-bias stress effects at roomtemperature are observed in the devices. The saturation current decreases and thethreshold voltage shifts toward negative direction upon the gate-bias stress. However; thesaturation current increases and the threshold voltage shifts toward positive direction uponthe drain-bias stress. For variable bias stress conditions; carrier mobility is almostunchanged. The results suggest that the origin of threshold-voltage shift upon negative gate-bias stress is predominantly associated with holes trapped within the SiO 2 gate dielectric orat the SiO 2/Si interface due to hot-carrier emission under high gate-bias stress; while time-dependent charge trapping into the deep trap states in the channel region is responsible …,Electron Devices and Solid-State Circuits; 2008.

China Views,S Yu,1. It will probably take weeks; if not months; before we know the exact human tolls andbusiness fallout from the latest earthquake in China. As the search and rescue mission forvictims has come close to an end; market concerns have again been shifted to the economicimpact from the earthquake. In this context; Japan's experiences from the Kobe earthquakein 1995 have been cited by some commentators as risks that the potential economic falloutfrom China's latest earthquake could be more severe than expected initially. 2.Notwithstanding the much higher human tolls from the Sichuan earthquake (the expecteddeath tolls could reach 50;000); its economic impact is likely to be much less significant thanKobe (with 6;500 deaths).

A holistic algorithm for efficiently evaluating Xtwig joins,Bo Ning; Guoren Wang; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract More and more XML data have been generated and used in the data exchange.XML employs a tree-structure data model; but lots of queries submitted by users are not likethe tree-structure. Those queries contain ancestor axis in predicates; and specify the patternof selection predicates on multiple elements from descendants to ancestors. Efficientlyfinding all occurrences of such an xtwig pattern in an XML database is crucial for XML queryprocessing. A straightforward method is to rewrite an xtwig pattern to equivalent reverse-axis-free one. However; this method needs scanning the element streams several times and israther expensive to evaluate. In this paper; we study the xtwig pattern; and propose twobasic decomposing methods; VertiDec and HoriDec; and a holistic processing method;XtwigStack; for processing xtwig queries. The experiments show that the holistic algorithm …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2008,2

View Progressiveness of Mass Culture from a" People First" Perspective [J],Jian-ming YU; Chen WANG,The evaluation of mass culture is a controversial question. To give the culture a reasonableevaluation; we must view it from a" people first" perspective rather than from an elitismperspective. The progressiveness of mass culture gives expression to the fact that massculture has raised the main body position of the general public; that mass culture containsrespect to people's perceptual desire. Although there are some defects in mass culture; itsprogressiveness demands that we should take a constructive attitute towards it.,Academic Journal of Shanxi Provincial Committee Party School of CPC,2007,2

Mining dependent patterns in probabilistic databases,Shichao Zhang; Chengqi Zhang; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Today's database systems must deal with uncertainty in the data they store. Consequently;there is a strong need for mining probabilistic databases. Because probabilistic data in firstnormal form relations is redundant; existing mining techniques are inadequate fordiscovering probabilistic databases. This paper designs a new strategy for identifyingpotentially useful patterns in probabilistic databases. A dependent rule is thus identified in aprobabilistic database; represented in the form X→ Y with conditional probability matrix MY|X. This method uses an instance selection to increase efficiency; enabling us to reduce thesearch space. We evaluated the proposed technique; and our experimental resultsdemonstrate that the approach is effective and efficient.,Cybernetics and Systems: An International Journal,2004,2

Classifying high-speed text streams,Gabriel Pui Cheong Fung; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hongjun Lu,Abstract Recently; a new class of data-intensive application becomes widely recognizedwhere data is modeled best as transient open-end streams rather than persistent tables ondisk. It leads to a new surge of research interest called data streams. However; most of thereported works are concentrated on structural data; such as bit-sequences; and seldomfocus on unstructural data; such as textual documents. In this paper; we propose an efficientclassification approach for classifying high-speed text streams. The proposed approach isbased on sketches such that it is able to classify the streams efficiently by scanning themonly once; meanwhile consuming a small bounded of memory in both model maintenanceand operation. Extensive experiments using benchmarks and a real-life news articlecollection are conducted.

Unifying decision tree induction and association based classification,Hongyan Liu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hongjun Lu; Jian Chen,Decision tree induction is one of the widely used classification approaches. It constructs atree in which an internal node is split based on values of a selected attribute. Depending onthe attribute selected at each level of the tree; a training dataset could lead to many differenttrees. Consequently; it is possible that an unseen case is classified into different and conflictclasses using different trees. On the other band; recently developed association role basedclassifications are able to generate more interesting and useful rules than decision trees.However; the large number of rules without appropriate data structure brings the issue ofefficiency. In this paper; we propose to unify decision tree classification with association-based classification using generalized decision trees (GDT). GDT generalizes the concept ofdecision tree to encode all interesting classification rules discovered based on …,Systems; Man and Cybernetics; 2002 IEEE International Conference on,2002,2

[7] Phosphoglycerate kinase-triose-phosphate isomerase complex from Thermotoga neapolitana,Jae-Sung Yu; Kenneth M Noll,Publisher Summary Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) is one of two enzymes that conservesenergy by substrate level phosphorylation in glycolysis. The reversible reaction catalyzed byphosphoglycerate kinase involves the transfer of the acyl phosphate of 1; 3-diphosphoglycerate (1; 3-DPG) to ADP forming ATP and 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA).Because this enzyme is highly conserved in both sequence and function among Bacteria;Archaea; and Eukarya; phosphoglycerate kinase is an excellent candidate for studying thedeterminants of thermal stability of enzymes. Therefore; the structure of PGK amongmembers of the Thermotogales; a bacterial family of hyperthermophiles; is of considerableinterest. The fus gene encoding a protein with both 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) andtriosephosphate isomerase (TPI) activities was cloned from T. maritima. Later; the tpi …,*,2001,2

Maintaining materialized views for data warehouses with multiple remote sources,Weifa Liang; Chris Johnson; X Yu Jeffrey,Abstract A data warehouse is a data repository which collects and maintains a large amountof data from multiple distributed; autonomous and possibly heterogeneous data sources.Often the data is stored in the form of materialized views in order to provide fast access to theintegrated data. However; to maintain the data in the warehouse consistent with the sourcedata is a challenging task in a multiple remote source environment. Transactions containingmultiple updates at one or more sources further complicate the consistency issue. In thispaper we first consider improving the refresh time of select-project-join (SPJ) typematerialized views in a data warehouse by presenting a frequency-partitioned basedalgorithm; which takes into account the source update frequencies and the total space forauxiliary data. We then propose a solution in the design of data warehouses which can …,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2000,2

Hash in place with memory shifting: datacube computation revisited,Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hongjun Lu,A datacube on n attributes requires the computation of an aggregation function over allgroups generated by 2/sup n/interelated GROUP-BYs. Even n is not very large; and thecomputation could be very expensive if the database involved is large. Although a number ofalgorithms with various optimization techniques have been proposed; accurate estimation ofmemory requirement and efficient use of the available memory remain difficult issues. Thedifficulty of estimating memory requirement comes from data skews. We present a novelhash based approach for datacube computation. The approach effectively uses theavailable memory to maintain a minimum number of hash tables required for computingrelated cuboids and manages memory dynamically by shifting memory pages among hashtables. Therefore; no priori memory requirement estimation is necessary and all memory …,Data Engineering; 1999. Proceedings.; 15th International Conference on,1999,2

A break for workaholics: Energy-efficient selective tuning mechanisms for demand-driven-based wireless environment,Kian-Lee Tan; Jeffrey X Yu,Abstract Existing work on demand-driven-based wireless environments has largely focusedon energy-efficient caching strategies. While these schemes minimize the number of uplinkrequests (and hence conserve energy); they are still not adequate as clients must continueto monitor the broadcast for data that is not found in the cache or has been invalidated. Otherwork on disseminating data via periodic broadcasting of the data file has developedtechniques that organize data to allow clients to selectively tune to the desired portion of thebroadcast. Such schemes; unfortunately; cannot be applied to demand-driven-based contextbecause demand-driven data cannot be predetermined. In this paper; we study the issue ofselective tuning in a demand-driven-based environment. We propose and study threestrategies that allow clients to repeatedly toggle between doze mode and active mode …,*,1997,2

Distributed shared memory on AP1000,X Yu Jeffrey; Andrew Tridgell; Bill Keating; Jason Haines; Chris Johnson,Two basic programming paradigms exist on multiprocessor systems: message passing andshared memory. Processes in the message passing paradigm use messages to share dataand interact with each other. Unfortunately; writing message passing programs becomescomplicated when the programs exhibit irregular memory access patterns as a consequenceof using complex data structures. The shared memory paradigm makes the development ofprograms with these memory access patterns much simpler. Systems built on top of sharedmemory can also be maintained easily at run time. There are two ways to build an objectstore on a shared or distributed memory multiprocessor system. One can adopt theclient/server model. In this case; when a client c1 needs to access objects managed by theserver; ie the object store; it has to fetch the objects from the server and then swizzle them …,Proceedings of the Australian-European IDEA Workshop,1995,2
Preventive effect of bombesin on alloxan-induced diabetes in rat,Y Song; JR Yu,Abstract The effect of bombesin against injury on rat islet B cells was studied in three kindsof experiments:(1). In vivo experiment; it was found that preinjection of bombesin (50micrograms/kg; sublingual v.) could effectively prevent an increase of plasma glucose anddecrease of plasma insulin in diabetic rat induced by alloxan (200 mg/kg; sc)(2). In vitroexperiment; isolated pancreas perfusion showed that alloxan-induced (14 mmol/L) perfusionfluid inhibition of insulin secretion could be reversed by pretreatment of bombesin (10 (-3)mmol/L).(3). Investigation on isolated and incubated islets demonstrated that alloxaninduced decrease of insulin and somatostatin secretion and increase of glucagon secretioncould be prevented by bombesin.

Handling query skew in large indexes: a view based approach,Weihuang Huang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Zechao Shang,Abstract Indexing is one of the most important techniques to facilitate query processing overa multi-dimensional dataset. A commonly used strategy for such indexing is to keep the tree-structured index balanced. This strategy reduces query processing cost in the worst case;and can handle all different queries equally well. In other words; this strategy implies that allqueries are uniformly issued; which is partially because the query distribution is not possiblyknown and will change over time in practice. A key issue we study in this work is whether it isthe best to fully rely on a balanced tree-structured index in particular when datasets becomelarger and larger in the big data era. This means that; when a dataset becomes very large; itbecomes unreasonable to assume that all data in any subspace are equally important andare uniformly accessed by all queries at the index level.

String Similarity Search: A Hash-Based Approach,Hao Wei; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Can Lu,String similarity search is a fundamental query that has been widely used for DNAsequencing; error-tolerant query auto-completion; and data cleaning needed in database;data warehouse; and data mining. In this paper; we study string similarity search based onedit distance that is supported by many database management systems such as Oracle andPostgreSQL. Given the edit distance; ${\mathsf {ed}}(s; t) $; between two strings; $ s $ and $ t$; the string similarity search is to find every string $ t $ in a string database $ D $ which issimilar to a query string $ s $ such that ${\mathsf {ed}}(s; t)\leq\tau $ for a given threshold$\tau $. In the literature; most existing work takes a filter-and-verify approach; where the filterstep is introduced to reduce the high verification cost of two strings by utilizing an index builtoffline for $ D $.

In situ measurements of OTFTs undernitrogen dioxide (NO 2) exposure showed a remarkable sensitivity enhancement from 7% to241% by simply decreasing CuPc film thickness from 40 to 10 nm. CuPc films were analyzedby atomic force microscopy and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction.

Keyphrase extraction using knowledge graphs,Wei Shi; Weiguo Zheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hong Cheng; Lei Zou,Abstract Extracting keyphrases from documents automatically is an important and interestingtask since keyphrases provide a quick summarization for documents. Although lots of effortshave been made on keyphrase extraction; most of the existing methods (the co-occurrence-based methods and the statistic-based methods) do not take semantics into fullconsideration. The co-occurrence-based methods heavily depend on the co-occurrencerelations between two words in the input document; which may ignore many semanticrelations. The statistic-based methods exploit the external text corpus to enrich thedocument; which introduce more unrelated relations inevitably. In this paper; we propose anovel approach to extract keyphrases using knowledge graphs; based on which we coulddetect the latent relations of two keyterms (ie; noun words and named entities) without …,Data Science and Engineering,2017,1

Keyword Search on RDF Graphs-A Query Graph Assembly Approach,Shuo Han; Lei Zou; Jeffery Xu Yu; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract Keyword search provides ordinary users an easy-to-use interface for querying RDFdata. Given the input keywords; in this paper; we study how to assemble a query graph thatis to represent user's query intention accurately and efficiently. Based on the input keywords;we first obtain the elementary query graph building blocks; such as entity/class vertices andpredicate edges. Then; we formally define the query graph assembly (QGA) problem.Unfortunately; we prove theoretically that QGA is a NP-complete problem. In order to solvethat; we design some heuristic lower bounds and propose a bipartite graph matching-basedbest-first search algorithm. The algorithm's time complexity is O (k 2l... l 3l); where l is thenumber of the keywords and k is a tunable parameter; ie; the maximum number of candidateentity/class vertices and predicate edges allowed to match each keyword.

A Cytop Insulating Tunneling Layer for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells,Yifan Zheng; Wei Shi; Jaemin Kong; Di Huang; Howard E Katz; Junsheng Yu; André D Taylor,Abstract Improvement of the interface between the perovskite layer and the electron-transport layer (ETL) is critical toward the advancement of planar perovskite solar cells(PSCs). It is important to obtain a uniform and pinhole-free ETL that can minimize filmdefects and thus undesirable electron–hole recombination between the perovskite layer andcathode. However; this is extremely difficult because the rough perovskite surface causescharge–carrier recombination; facilitates large leakage currents; and inevitably deterioratesthe electron-extraction efficiency. Here; fluorine-containing insulating polymers; poly (perfluorobutenylvinylether)(Cytop); are used as the tunneling layer in planar PSCs for thefirst time; resulting in a significant improvement in the power conversion efficiency (PCE)from 11.9% to over 14.5%.

Efficient distance-based representative skyline computation in 2D space,Rui Mao; Taotao Cai; Rong-Hua Li; Jeffery Xu Yu; Jianxin Li,Abstract Representative skyline computation is a fundamental issue in database area; whichhas attracted much attention in recent years. A notable definition of representative skyline isthe distance-based representative skyline (DBRS). Given an integer k; a DBRS includes krepresentative skyline points that aims at minimizing the maximal distance between a non-representative skyline point and its nearest representative. In the 2D space; the state-of-the-art algorithm to compute the DBRS is based on dynamic programming (DP) which takes O(km 2) time complexity; where m is the number of skyline points. Clearly; such a DP-basedalgorithm cannot be used for handling large scale datasets due to the quadratic time cost.

Keyword Search over Distributed Graphs with Compressed Signature,Ye Yuan; Xiang Lian; Lei Chen; Jeffery Xu Yu; Guoren Wang; Yongjiao Sun,Graph keyword search has drawn many research interests; since graph models cangenerally represent both structured and unstructured databases and keyword searches canextract valuable information for users without the knowledge of the underlying schema andquery language. In practice; data graphs can be extremely large; eg; a Web-scale graphcontaining billions of vertices. The state-of-the-art approaches employ centralized algorithmsto process graph keyword searches; and thus they are infeasible for such large graphs; dueto the limited computational power and storage space of a centralized server. To addressthis problem; we investigate keyword search for Web-scale graphs deployed in a distributedenvironment. We first give a naive search algorithm to answer the query efficiently. However;the naive search algorithm uses a flooding search strategy that incurs large time and …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,1

Investigating TSP heuristics for location-based services,Weihuang Huang; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Travel planning is one of the important issues in the location-based services (LBS).Traveling salesman problem (TSP) is to find the optimal tour that traverses points exactlyonce in the minimum total distance. Given the hardness of TSP (NP-hard); TSP query for agiven set of points; QQ; is not widely studied for online LBS; and the nearest-neighborheuristic is the only heuristic adapted to find TSP-like tours with additional constraints forLBS. The questions to ask are: Is the nearest-neighbor the best in terms of accuracy? Whichheuristics among many should we use to process TSP queries online for LBS? In theliterature; TSPLIB benchmarks are designed for special cases where the number of pointsused is large; and the existing synthetic datasets are based on uniform/normal distributions.Both do not reflect the real datasets used in real applications.

Grid-Index Algorithm for Reverse Rank Queries.,Yuyang Dong; Hanxiong Chen; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Kazutaka Furuse; Hiroyuki Kitagawa,ABSTRACT In Rank-aware query processing; reverse rank queries have already attractedsignificant interests. Reverse rank queries can find matching customers for a given productbased on individual customers' preference. The results are used in numerous real-lifeapplications; such as market analysis and product placement. Efficient processing of reverserank queries is challenging because it needs to consider the combination on the given dataset of user preferences and the data set of products. Currently; there are two typical reverserank queries: Reverse top-k and reverse k-ranks. Both prefer top-ranking products and themost efficient algorithms for them have a common methodology that indexes and prunes thedata set using R-trees.

A Sketch-First Approach for Finding TSP,Weihuang Huang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Zechao Shang,Abstract Travel planning is one of the most important issues in location-based services(LBS); and TSP (traveling salesman problem) is to find the shortest tour that traverses all thegiven points exactly once. Given the hardness of TSP as an NP-hard problem; a largenumber of heuristic methods are proposed to find a tour efficiently. Here; the heuristicsproposed are based on a similar idea that is to expand a partial tour by adding points one byone in different ways until all points are visited. In this paper; we study TSP query with agiven set of points Q. We propose a new heuristic called Sketch-First; which is different fromthe existing approaches. By Sketch-First; we select a set of points out of Q; forming a sketchof Q; and add the points that are not in the sketch back to the sketch to obtain the answer forQ. The sketch gives a global picture on the points; and can be used to guide to add the …,Australasian Database Conference,2016,1

Scalable supergraph search in large graph databases,Bingqing Lyu; Lu Qin; Xuemin Lin; Lijun Chang; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Supergraph search is a fundamental problem in graph databases that is widely applied inmany application scenarios. Given a graph database and a query-graph; supergraph searchretrieves all data-graphs contained in the query-graph from the graph database. Mostexisting solutions for supergraph search follow the pruning-and-verification framework;which prunes false answers based on features in the pruning phase and performs subgraphisomorphism testings on the remaining graphs in the verification phase. However; they arenot scalable to handle large-sized data-graphs and query-graphs due to three drawbacks.First; they rely on a frequent subgraph mining algorithm to select features which is expensiveand cannot generate large features. Second; they require a costly verification phase.

Multi-modal Image Re-ranking with Autoencoders and Click Semantics,Chaohui Tang; Qingxin Zhu; Chaoqun Hong; Jun Yu,Abstract Image re-ranking is effective in improving text-based image retrieval experience.However; to construct an efficacious algorithm to achieve such a target is limited by twoimportant issues: one is that visual features extracted for image re-ranking from images aretoo superficial to represent the whole information contained within images; the other is thatthe corresponding text information often mismatches semantics of images. In this paper; weutilize autoencoders to extract deeper features of images and exploit click data to bridge thesemantic gap between query words and image semantics. A graph-based algorithm (MIR-AC) is proposed to adaptively integrate features from autoencoders and click information byconstructing two manifolds with updating weights. In particular; MIR-AC completes image re-ranking by conducting an iterative optimization process in which image ranking scores …,International Conference on Multimedia Modeling,2016,1

Preliminary investigation on coupling MCDA with GLUE to perform uncertainty analysis of a hydrological model,P Vallam; XS Qin; JJ Yu,Abstract Hydrological models are being used for different applications. Quantifying theuncertainty of popular Hydrological models has been well documented; especially withBayesian methods such as the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE).However; research studies have often either neglected the lesser known hydrologicalmodels or have performed a typical Bayesian analysis of uncertainty. In this paper; theSLURP model's uncertainty is examined using a novel approach of the GLUE method.Instead of considering the overall Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE); the NSE values of differentmagnitudes of flows are considered simultaneously to capture the predictive uncertainties ofthe SLURP model. By using a Multi-Criterion Decision Analysis (MCDA) method; the NSEvalues of different flow periods are simultaneously considered when computing the …,International Journal of Environmental Science and Development,2015,1

Nucleation and growth of boron nanowires on diamond particles,H Bai; HH Zou; GX Chen; JH Yu; K Nishimura; W Dai; N Jiang,Abstract Crystalline boron nanowires (BNWs) are grown on the entire surface of diamondpowders by a solid–solid reaction approach. The as-grown BNWs have diameters in therange of 20–200 nm; lengths of several micrometers. High-resolution transmission electronmicroscopy (HRTEM) observation indicated the boron nanowires are composed of twostructures; the interior of the nanowire is well crystalline in hexagonal structure and thesurface of the nanowire is covered by a 5–10 nm thick tetragonal structure layer. Systematicanalysis reveals that the conventional VLS (vapor–liquid–solid) growth model is notapplicable to explain this kind of BNWs' growth mechanism. Hereby; an extended VLSmodel is proposed which can perfectly interpret the BNW's growth process on diamondsurface and match experiment results very well.,Applied Surface Science,2014,1

Different tree species affect soil respiration spatial distribution in a subtropical forest of southern Taiwan,Po-Neng Chiang; Jui-Chu Yu; Ya-nan Wang; Yen-Jen Lai,Abstract Global forests contain 69% of total carbon stored in forest soil and litter. But thecarbon storage ability and release rate of warming gases of forest soil also affect globalclimate change. Soil carbon cycling processes are paid much attention by ecologicalscientists and policy makers because of the possibility of carbon being stored in soil via landuse management. Soil respiration contributed large part of terrestrial carbon flux; but therelationship of soil respiration and climate change was still obscurity. Most of soil respirationresearches focus on template and tropical area; little was known that in subtropical area.Afforestation is one of solutions to mitigate CO2 increase and to sequestrate CO2 in tree andsoil.

Adaptive dynamic programming for linear impulse systems,Xiao-hua Wang; Juan-juan Yu; Yao Huang; Hua Wang; Zhong-hua Miao,Abstract We investigate the optimization of linear impulse systems with the reinforcementlearning based adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) method. For linear impulse systems;the optimal objective function is shown to be a quadric form of the pre-impulse states. TheADP method provides solutions that iteratively converge to the optimal objective function. Ifan initial guess of the pre-impulse objective function is selected as a quadratic form of thepre-impulse states; the objective function iteratively converges to the optimal one throughADP. Though direct use of the quadratic objective function of the states within the ADPmethod is theoretically possible; the numerical singularity problem may occur due to thematrix inversion therein when the system dimensionality increases.

Query-driven Frequent Co-occurring Term Extraction over Relational Data using MapReduce,Jianxin Li; Chengfei Liu; Liang Yao; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Rui Zhou,Abstract: In this paper we study how to efficiently compute\textit {frequent co-occurringterms}(FCT) in the results of a keyword query in parallel using the popular MapReduceframework. Taking as input a keyword query q and an integer k; an FCT query reports the kterms that are not in q; but appear most frequently in the results of the keyword query q overmultiple joined relations. The returned terms of FCT search can be used to do queryexpansion and query refinement for traditional keyword search. Different from the method ofFCT search in a single platform; our proposed approach can efficiently answer a FCT queryusing the MapReduce Paradigm without pre-computing the results of the original keywordquery; which is run in parallel platform. In this work; we can output the final FCT searchresults by two MapReduce jobs: the first is to extract the statistical information of the data; …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1301.2378,2013,1

Estimation of velocities of tissue motion and blood flow based on radio frequency signal deconvolution [J],Gong CHEN; Jie YU; Fu-xian SONG; Dong ZHANG,A novel approach based on radio frequency signal deconvolution is developed to estimatingthe velocities of blood flow and tissue motion without MTI filtering. In this method; thesampled sequences of the radio frequency echoes are transformed to the frequency domainby FFT algorithm firstly. Then these transformed sequences are deconvolved. Finally thevelocities of the blood flow and the tissue motion can be obtained by a spectrum analysis ofthese deconvolved sequences. This approach has been applied to the simulated ultrasoundechoes with two typical time-delay parameter sets. The validity of this method is examinedby the comparison between the estimated velocities of blood and tissue motion and thegiven values. This approach is helpful to the measurement of the low-velocity blood flows.,Technical Acoustics,2010,1

» A New Method of DOA Estimation for Uniform Antenna Array;«,Ling Qin; Huiyong Li; Jia Yu; Zishu He,Abstract:-A novel method of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation based on subarraybeamforming for uniform circular arrays is proposed. In this method; the beamform manifoldof uniform circular arrays is transformed via virtual structure; and then the virtual array isdivided into two subarrrays. The target DOA is estimated from the phase shift between thereference signal and its phase-shifted version by subarray beamforming. Since thereference signal is obtained after interference rejection; the effect of interference Thecomputation of the proposed method is simple; and the number of the signal sources oftarget is not bounded by the number of antenna elements. Simulation results demonstratethat proposed method has significantly improved estimation resolution; capacity; andaccuracy relative to other method.,WSEAS Transactions on Signal Processing,2009,1

Regime-switching models with mean reversion and applications in option pricing,Jie Yu,Abstract In option pricing the underlying stock price is traditionally assumed to follow ageometric Brownian motion. However it is observed that the stock prices often switchbetween geometric Brownian motion and mean reversion behaviors. The contributions inthis dissertation include constructing a regime-switching model incorporating both geometricBrownian motion and mean reversion models in which the switching is determined by afinite state Markov chain. This model leads to an effective mathematical framework forstudying the valuation of the corresponding financial derivatives. Then we use a PDEmethod as well as a viscosity solution method to solve the non-smooth boundary valueproblem and to characterize the pricing of European options. In the second part of thisdissertation we obtain a closed-form pricing formula for European call options using a …,*,2009,1

Object Placement in Shared Nothing Architecture,Zhen He; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Stephen Blackburn,Abstract Effective data placement is crucial to the performance of any parallel databasesystem as it is an important lever for load balancing. In this paper we describe and explain atwo-phased approach to the placement of objects in a shared-nothing model of a parallelobject oriented database with page grain caching. The first phase is a declustering phase inwhich a greedy similarity graph partitioning algorithm is used to assign objects into nodes ofthe shared-nothing system. The aim of the first phase is to minimise internode traversals andmaximise parallelism. Once assigned to nodes; the second phase attempts to cluster objectsresiding at each node into pages with the aim of reducing occurrence of remote pagerequests. Therefore; objects that are likely to be accessed by another remote node areclustered together. Both phases use query frequency distribution information to decide …,Victoria,1999,1

The effects of dispersion compensation ratio on the performance of WDM systems with long amplifier spacing,J‐J Yu; Kejian Guan; Bojun Yang,Abstract When the transmission signal per channel is a 10 Gbit/s RZ pulse and the amplifierspan is over 100 km; proper undercompensation can enhance the nonlinear WDM systemperformance. Improper undercompensation or overcompensation will degrade the systemperformance. Cross-phase modulation plays an important role in the nonlinear WDMsystem. The maximum transmission distance with the XPM effect considered is far smallerthan that with the XPM effect isolated. The performance of difference channels in a nonlinearWDM system is dependent on the input power and DCF length.© 1998 John Wiley & Sons;Inc.

Framework for scheduling partition-based joins,K-L Tan; JX Yu,This paper presents a framework for scheduling partition-based joins. Partition-based joinsare commonly used in databases; be it relation-al; temporal or spatial databases. Under apartition-based algorithm; the data are organized into partitions. During the join process; apartition in one relation only needs to join with some; but not all; partitions of the otherrelation. Depending on the orders in which partitions are processed; the number of I/Osincurred varies. We propose a three-phase scheduling framework to minimize the numberI/Os incurred. From the framework; a large number of scheduling strategies can be derived.We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework on an application-temporalintersection join in temporal databases.,*,1997,1

Scheduling Issues in Partitioned Temporal Join,X Yu Jeffrey; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract One of the major problems of temporal databases is to develop e cient algorithmsfor operations that involves the time attributes. An operation that has received much attentionin recent years is the temporal join which matches records from two temporal relationswhose time intervals overlap. Under a partition-based algorithm; temporal data are split intopartitions. During the join process; a partition in one relation only needs to join with some;but not all; partitions of the other relation. In this paper; we address scheduling issues insuch an algorithm. Depending on the orders in which partitions are read; the number of I/Osincurred varies. We propose a three-phase scheduling framework to minimize the number ofI/Os incurred. From the framework; a large number of scheduling strategies can be derived.We also study several representative scheduling strategies and report our ndings in this …,*,1995,1
Investigation on invasion of preepiglottic space by supraglottic carcinoma,LP Wang; JH Yu; SZ Fei,Abstract This study; based on analysis of 100 whole-organ serial sections of the larynx;concluded that preepiglottic space invasion is involved in 60% of supraglottic carcinoma.The preepiglottic space is involved either by invasion through the adjacent structures of theepiglottis; or more frequently by destroying the epiglottic cartilage and the thyro-epiglotticligament. The preepiglottic space is involved mainly by epiglottic and epiglottic-ventricularcarcinomas; accounting for 95% of carcinomas which invade the space. The involvement ofpreepiglottic space by supraglottic carcinoma is intimately related to the morphologicfeatures; marginal growth patterns; and T classification.

A highly efficient polymer non-fullerene organic solar cell enhanced by introducing a small molecule as a crystallizing-agent,Yifan Zheng; Jiang Huang; Gang Wang; Jaemin Kong; Di Huang; Megan Mohadjer Beromi; Nilay Hazari; André D Taylor; Junsheng Yu,Abstract Non-fullerene organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted tremendous interestbecause of their potential to replace traditional expensive fullerene-based OSCs. To furtherincrease the power conversion efficiency (PCE); it is necessary to offset the narrowabsorption of the non-fullerene materials; which is often achieved by adding an additive (>10 wt%) to form a ternary blend. However; a high ratio of the third component can often bedetrimental to the active layer morphology and can increase the complexity in understandingthe device physics toward rationally designed improvements.

By adjusting the ratio of 2-CP/ODCB in the top PC71BM layers; the resulting SSPPPD shows a decreased dark current and an increased photocurrent; leading to a maximumdetectivity of 1.23× 1012 Jones at a wavelength of 550 nm. This value is 5.3-fold higher thanthat of the conventional bulk heterojunction PPD.

Adapting Stochastic Block Models to Power-Law Degree Distributions,Maoying Qiao; Jun Yu; Wei Bian; Qiang Li; Dacheng Tao,Stochastic block models (SBMs) have been playing an important role in modeling clusters orcommunity structures of network data. But; it is incapable of handling several complexfeatures ubiquitously exhibited in real-world networks; one of which is the power-law degreecharacteristic. To this end; we propose a new variant of SBM; termed power-law degreeSBM (PLD-SBM); by introducing degree decay variables to explicitly encode the varyingdegree distribution over all nodes. With an exponential prior; it is proved that PLD-SBMapproximately preserves the scale-free feature in real networks. In addition; from theinference of variational E-Step; PLD-SBM is indeed to correct the bias inherited in SBM withthe introduced degree decay factors.

Accelerating reachability query processing based on $ $\varvec {} $ $ reduction,Junfeng Zhou; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Na Li; Hao Wei; Ziyang Chen; Xian Tang,Abstract Answering reachability queries is one of the fundamental graph operations. Theexisting approaches build indexes and answer reachability queries on a directed acyclicgraph (DAG) GG; which is constructed by coalescing each strongly connected component ofthe given directed graph GG into a node of G G. Considering that GG can still be large to beprocessed efficiently; there are studies to further reduce GG to a smaller graph. However;these approaches suffer from either inefficiency in answering reachability queries; or cannotscale to large graphs. In this paper; we study DAG reduction to accelerate reachability queryprocessing; which reduces the size of GG by computing transitive reduction (TR) followed bycomputing equivalence reduction (ER). For TR; we propose a bottom-up algorithm; namelybuTR; which removes from GG all redundant edges to get the unique smallest DAG G^ t G …,The VLDB Journal,2018,*

Sensitive and selective pentacene-guanine field-effect transistor sensing of nitrogen dioxide and interferent vapor analytes,Wei Shi; Junsheng Yu; Howard E Katz,Abstract The biomolecule guanine and organic semiconductor pentacene were used to forma sensitive and selective organic field-effect transistor (OFET) pair sensitive to nitrogendioxide gas and five other vapor analytes. OFETs with two configurations were fabricated;one of which used thermally deposited guanine and pentacene layer-by-layer to form thesensing unit; while the other one only adopted pentacene as the sensing element.

Exemplar-based 3D human pose estimation with sparse spectral embedding,Jun Yu; Chaoqun Hong,Abstract In exemplar-based approaches; human pose estimation is achieved by retrievingrelevant poses with images. Therefore; image description is critical and it is common toextract multiple features to better describe the visual input data. To fuse multiple features;traditional methods simply concatenates multi-view features into a long vector. There are twoshortcomings in this oversimplified process:(1) it usually results in lengthy feature vectors;which suffers from “curse of dimensionality”;(2) it is not physically meaningful and may beincapable of fully exploiting the complementary properties of multi-view features. To addresssuch problems in this paper; we present a dimension reduction method based on sparsespectral embedding; followed by an ensemble of nearest neighbor regression in low-rankmulti-view feature space; to infer 3D human poses from monocular videos.

To Meet or not to Meet: Finding the Shortest Paths in Road Networks,Weihuang Huang; Yikai Zhang; Zechao Shang; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Finding the shortest path in road networks becomes one of the important issues in location-based services (LBS). The problem of finding the optimal meeting point for a group of usershas also been well studied in existing works. In this paper; we investigate a new problem fortwo users. Each user has his/her own source and destination. However; whether to meetbefore going to their destinations is with some uncertainty. We model it as the minimum pathpair (MPP) query; which consists of two pairs of source and destination and a user-specifiedweight alpha. The result is a pair of paths connecting the two sources and destinationsrespectively; with a minimal overall cost of the two paths and the shortest route betweenthem.

Pre-45s rRNA promotes colon cancer and is associated with poor survival of CRC patients,H Tsoi; KC Lam; Y Dong; X Zhang; CK Lee; J Zhang; SC Ng; SSM Ng; S Zheng; Y Chen; J Fang; J Yu,Abstract One characteristic of cancer cells is the abnormally high rate of cell metabolism tosustain their enhanced proliferation. However; the behind mechanism of this phenomenon isstill elusive. Here we find that enhanced precursor 45s ribosomal RNA (pre-45s rRNA) isone of the core mechanisms in promoting the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Pre-45s rRNA expression is significantly higher in primary CRC tumor tissues samples andcancer cell lines compared with the non-tumorous colon tissues; and is associated withtumor sizes. Knockdown of pre-45s rRNA inhibits G1/S cell-cycle transition by stabilizing p53through inducing murine double minute 2 (MDM2) and ribosomal protein L11 (RpL11)interaction.

Graph repairing under neighborhood constraints,Shaoxu Song; Boge Liu; Hong Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lei Chen,Abstract A broad class of data; ranging from similarity networks; workflow networks to proteinnetworks; can be modeled as graphs with data values as vertex labels. Both vertex labelsand neighbors could be dirty for various reasons such as typos or erroneous reporting ofresults in scientific experiments. Neighborhood constraints; specifying label pairs that areallowed to appear on adjacent vertices in the graph; are employed to detect and repairerroneous vertex labels and neighbors. In this paper; we study the problem of repairingvertex labels and neighbors to make graphs satisfy neighborhood constraints. Unfortunately;the problem is generally hard; which motivates us to devise approximation methods forrepairing and identify interesting special cases (star and clique constraints) that can beefficiently solved. First; we propose several label repairing approximation algorithms …,The VLDB Journal,2017,*

Extracting Keyphrases Using Heterogeneous Word Relations,Wei Shi; Zheng Liu; Weiguo Zheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Extracting keyphrases from documents for providing a quick and insightfulsummarization is an interesting and important task; on which lots of research efforts havebeen laid. Most of the existing methods could be categorized as co-occurrence based;statistic-based; or semantics-based. The co-occurrence based methods do not take variousword relations besides co-occurrence into full consideration. The statistic-based methodsintroduce more unrelated noises inevitably due to the inclusion of external text corpus; whilethe semantic-based methods heavily depend on the semantic meanings of words. In thispaper; we propose a novel graph-based approach to extract keyphrases by consideringheterogeneous latent word relations (the co-occurrence and the semantics). The underlyingrandom walk model behind the proposed approach is made possible and reasonable by …,Australasian Database Conference,2017,*

Increased mobility and on/off ratio in organic field-effect transistors using low-cost guanine-pentacene multilayers,Wei Shi; Yifan Zheng; André D Taylor; Junsheng Yu; Howard E Katz,Layer-by-layer deposited guanine and pentacene in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs)is introduced. Through adjusting the layer thickness ratio of guanine and pentacene; thetradeoff of two electronic parameters in OFETs; charge carrier mobility and current on/offratio; was controlled. The charge mobility was enhanced by depositing pentacene over andbetween guanine layers and by increasing the proportion of pentacene in the layer-by-layersystem; while the current on/off ratio was increased via the decreased off current induced bythe guanine layers. The tunable device performance was mainly ascribed to the trap anddopant neutralizing properties of the guanine layers; which would decrease the density offree hydroxyl groups in the OFETs. Furthermore; the cost of the devices could be reducedremarkably via the adoption of low-cost guanine.,Applied Physics Letters,2017,*

Effect of inlet configuration on hydrocyclone performance,TANG Bo; Yan-xia Xu; Xing-fu Song; SUN Ze; Jian-guo Yu,Abstract Inlet configuration is important parameter of hydrocyclones; which has great impacton the classification performance. The effects of inlet configuration on the preciseclassification were studied by computational fluid dynamics under various combinations ofinlet diameter and inlet velocity. The results showed that a high sharpness of classificationwas achieved with specific inlet diameter and inlet velocity. The separation efficiency of thecoarse particles by underflow significantly decreased when inlet had an oversize diameterowing to a stronger short-circuit flow. It is resulted from the chaotic flow and the strongerpressure gradient around the vortex finder. Meanwhile; a low separation efficiency of the fineparticles by overflow was achieved when inlet velocity was high; which indicated a lowsharpness caused by the overlarge centrifugal force.,Transactions of Nonferrous Metals Society of China,2017,*
Discovering Conditional Matching Rules,Yihan Wang; Shaoxu Song; Lei Chen; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hong Cheng,Abstract Matching dependencies (MDs) have recently been proposed to make datadependencies tolerant to various information representations; and found useful in dataquality applications such as record matching. Instead of the strict equality function used intraditional dependency syntax (eg; functional dependencies); MDs specify constraints basedon similarity and identification. However; in practice; MDs may still be too strict andapplicable only in a subset of tuples in a relation. Thereby; we study the conditionalmatching dependencies (CMDs); which bind matching dependencies only in a certain partof a table; ie; MDs conditionally applicable in a subset of tuples. Compared to MDs; CMDshave more expressive power that enables them to satisfy wider application needs.

Three models of lithium/C-103 alloy heat pipes were fabricated. And their startupproperties were tested by radiant heat tests and aerothermal tests. It is found that the startuptemperature of lithium heat pipe was about 860° C. At 1000° C radiant heat tests; theoperating temperature of lithium/C-103 alloy heat pipe is lower than 860° C. Thus; startupfailure occurs. At 1100° C radiant heat tests and aerothermal tests; the operatingtemperature of lithium/C-103 alloy heat pipe is higher than 860° C; and the heat pipe startsup successfully.

Misidentification of Brucella and a review of the literature,Jing Yang; Xiaoqing Ren; Wencheng Xue; Xiaonan Yu,Brucella is the etiological agent of brucellosis and also a potential agent of bioterrorism andlaboratory-acquired infections [1; 2]. Infection due to Brucella is prevalent worldwide. It istherefore essential that all laboratories be able to identify this pathogen accurately andrapidly. However; identification of Brucella species using some commercial bacterialidentification systems has not been consistent and misidentifications have been reportedpreviously [3–8]. Brucella species has been misidentified as Moraxella phenylpyruvica;Ochrobactrum anthropi; Haemophilus influenzae biotype IVand so on. Our laboratory hasencountered such circumstances five times since December 2011.

Supervised Spectral Embedding for Human Pose Estimation,Yukun Guo; Zhonggui Chen; Jun Yu,Abstract In exemplar-based approaches for human pose estimation; it is common to extractmultiple features to better describe the visual input data. However; simply concatenatingmultiview features into a long vector has two shortcomings:(1) it suffers from “curse ofdimensionality”;(2) it is not physically meaningful and may be incapable of fully exploitingthe complementary properties of multi-view features. To address such problems; in thispaper we present a dimension reduction method based on supervised spectral embedding;followed by an ensemble of nearest neighbor regressions in multi-view feature space; toinfer 3D human poses from monocular videos. The experiments on HumanEva dataset showthe effectiveness of the proposed method.,International Conference on Intelligent Science and Big Data Engineering,2015,*

However the rise of the sea-level is not uniformaround the world. The local or relative sea-level rise will be of great concern to the coastalregions. The combination of the land subsidence and global sea-level rise causes therelative sea-level to rise. Relative sea-level rise increases the risk of flooding and wetlandloss problems in near coastal areas; which in turn have important economic; environmental;and human health consequences for the heavily populated and ecologically importantcoastal region. However the role played by the coastal land subsidence is commonly absentduring the discussion of sea-level rise problems.

However; these approaches cannot describe long distancesemantic spatial-context in image. Therefore; in this paper; we propose a two-step LongDistance Spatial-context Model (LDSM) to solve that problem. First; because of highcomputational complexity in 2D spatial-context; we transform a 2D spatial-context into a 1Dsequence-context. Second; we use conditional random fields to model the 1D sequence-context.

PSP94; an upstream signaling mediator of prostasin found highly elevated in ovarian cancer,Jx Ma; Bx Yan; J Zhang; BH Jiang; Y Guo; H Riedel; MD Mueller; SC Remick; JJ Yu,Abstract Ovarian cancer is a leading cause of cancer death as diagnosis is frequentlydelayed to an advanced stage. Effective biomarkers and screening strategies for earlydetection are urgently needed. In the current study; we identify PSP94 as a key upstreamfactor in mediating prostasin (a protein previously reported to be overexpressed in ovariancancer) signaling that regulates prostasin expression and action in ovarian cancer cells.PSP94 is overexpressed in ovarian cancer cell lines and patients; and is significantlycorrelated with prostasin levels. Signaling pathway analysis demonstrated that both PSP94and prostasin; as potential upstream regulators of the Lin28b/Let-7 pathway; regulateLin28b and its downstream partner Let-7 in ovarian cancer cells. Expression of PSP94 andprostasin show a strong correlation with the expression levels of Lin28b/Let-7 in ovarian …,Cell death & disease,2014,*

GML parsing establishes a good basis for future GML data studies andapplications such as storage; compression; query; index and share etc. The engine for GMLgrammar validation is an important component of GML parser; which includes validityverification and consistency verification. The objective of validity verification is to ensureGML data to be well-formed. In this paper; the functional structure of the GML schema-basedparser is discussed; and an algorithm for GML data validity verification is developed andimplemented. Experimental results show that the algorithm is effective and efficient.,Computational Intelligence and Design (ISCID); 2013 Sixth International Symposium on,2013,*
A New Pespective on School Choice with Consent,Qianfeng Tang; Jingsheng Yu,Abstract We re-examine the school choice with consent problem studied by Kesten (2010).Consider that in the student-optimal deferred acceptance algorithm (DA); a set of studentsconsent to waive their priorities at better schools conditional on doing so does not hurtthemselves. We first show that if a student is matched with an underdemanded school (onethat no student desires); then her assignment cannot be improved in Pareto improvements.We then propose an algorithm which iteratively removes such schools and students toimprove the assignments of other students in DA. This algorithm shares the same structureas the EADAM algorithm proposed by Kesten (2010); acheives Pareto efficiency when allstudents consent and achieves constrained efficiency otherwise. We also offer a simplerintuition on consenting incentives and whose assignments should be improved.,*,2013,*
Ground States of Silicon-Multisubstituted Fullerene: First-Principles Calculations and Monte Carlo Simulations,Fan Bing-Bing; Shi Chun-Yan; Zhang Rui; Jia Yu,Abstract We present a systematical study on the possible stable structures of C 60− x Si x (x=1− 12) fullerenes using first-principles calculations combined with Monte-Carlo simulations.The initial fullerenes randomly substituting with silicon atoms are firstly generated and thentheir total energies are calculated quickly. The ground-state structures are found by theannealing process where Si atoms exchange their positions with C atoms. The stablestructures are finally obtained through first-principles calculations with high precision. Forthe cases with a small amount of Si atoms (x≤ 4); results similar to those report previouslyare achieved. Some new stable Si-doped fullerenes with more Si atoms are also predicated.The results show that Si atoms in the C 60− x Si x (x≤ 4) fullerenes have a trend ofsegregation with C atoms.

Evaluating irredundant maximal contained rewritings for XPath queries on views,Rui Zhou; Chengfei Liu; Jianxin Li; Junhu Wang; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract We review the problem of finding contained rewritings (CRs) for XPath queriesusing XPath views. CR is proposed to cater for data integration scenarios; where views areunlikely to be complete due to the limited coverage of data sources; and hence equivalentrewritings are impossible to be found. As a result; we are usually required to find a maximalcontained rewriting (MCR) for a query to provide the best possible answers. An MCR is a setof CRs; and may contain redundant CRs. Obviously; evaluating redundant CRs onmaterialized views is unnecessary. In this paper; we first address how to find the irredundantmaximal contained rewriting (IMCR); ie all the irredundant CRs. We show that the existingapproach ignores a type of situation; and turns out to be not sufficient. As a result; the onlysafe solution is a brute-force pairwise containment check for all the CRs.

Realistic Facial Animation Driven by a Single-Camera Video,Changwei Luo; Jun Yu; Zengfu Wang,Abstract. We describe a system for performance-based facial animation; the system enablesany user to control the facial expressions of a digital avatar by performing facial actions infront of a video camera. Firstly; a muscle-based face model is created and muscle actuationparameters are used to animate the face model. Next; a real-time facial tracking algorithmthat incorporates geometric priors is employed to track facial features of a performer in thevideo. Finally; tracking results are converted to muscle actuation parameters to drive the facemodel. Experimental results show that the synthesized facial animations are quite realistic.Compared with most existing performance-based animation systems; ours only requires avideo camera for performance capture; which makes the system easy to use for ordinaryusers.

A Robust Servo Demodulation Algorithm to Compensate for Head Velocity Induced Error,Wei Xi; Guoxiao Guo; Jie Yu,abstract The fast growing areal density and continuous increasing demand of IOPS andthroughput in hard disk drive present great challenges to servo systems on the performanceof the track-follow accuracy and seek time. A high bandwidth servo system is required tomeet the demand. However; the performance of the servo systems is ultimately limited by theresolution of the position signal which is demodulated form embedded servo sector. Insidethe servo sector; the servo track address combining with the servo bursts provide a globalposition signal of read/write head. The servo track address; which is commonly encoded asgray code; provides coarse position information. Whereas the servo bursts carries theposition error signal (PES) to determine the fine position information.

Prediction of soil water characteristic curve using physically based scaling technique,Liu SY; N Yasufuku; Q Liu; J Yu,ABSTRACT: The soil water characteristic curve (SWCC) is an important hydraulic parameterfor modeling water flow and contaminant transport in the vadose zone. However; directmeasurement of the SWCC is still difficult. The Arya and Paris (AP) model estimates theSWCC from particle-size distribution curve (PSD) based on the shape similarity of the twocurves. They introduced an empirical parameter; α; used to scale pore attributes fromhypothetical formations to natural structures. Several approaches have been used to deriveα. However; the calculation procedures of these approaches are either quite complicated orare developed without paying much attention to the physical significance of the soilproperties. In the present paper the physically based scaling technique (PBS) was applied toderive α for the AP model.

A study on the application of chirped photonic crystal fiber in multiphoton microscopy,Jiali Yu; Haishan Zeng; Harvey Lui; Julia S Skibina; Günter Steinmeyer; Shuo Tang,Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) is a powerful technique for high resolution imaging ofbiological tissues. A specially-designed chirped photonic crystal fiber (CPCF) is introducedfor MPM applications. The CPCF eliminates most pulse broadening effects in a broadtransmission window because its cell-size radial chirp in the cladding structure localizes thereflection of different wavelengths in different resonant layers of the cladding; similar tochirped mirrors. In contrast; traditional hollow core fiber (HCF) consists of several identicalreflective layers that produce substantial higher-order dispersion. The feasibility of applyingthe CPCF for MPM imaging is studied. The propagation properties of the CPCF arecharacterized by autocorrelation traces measured with and without the CPCF; whichconfirms an extremely low dispersion of the CPCF.

Characterization of chirped photonic crystal fiber and its application in multiphoton microscopy,Jiali Yu,Description Multiphoton Microscopy (MPM) is a widely used imaging technique in thebiomedicine field. Fiber-based multiphoton endoscopes are important for in vivo clinicalapplication because they enable minimally invasive imaging. One major challenge for theseendoscopes is the efficient delivery of ultrashort pulses in the near infrared region throughthe optical fibers. MPM requires ultrashort pulses to obtain high peak power for the nonlinearexcitation. However; the optical fibers; can introduce dispersion which can severely broadenthe pulses and reduce the peak power. The purpose of this study is to find a good candidateof optical fibers that can propagate sub-30 fs pulses while maintaining high peak power forthe MPM excitation. In this project; I investigate the feasibility of applying a specially-designed chirped photonic crystal fiber (CPCF) for MPM imaging because CPCF has …,*,2013,*
Random matrix approach to minimum variance portfolio optimization with high frequency data,Jian Yu,In modern portfolio theory; the accuracy and robustness of the covariance estimator plays acritical role in defining the performance of the optimized portfolios. Traditional estimatorssuch as the sample covariance matrix usually perform poorly when the number of observeddaily returns is comparable to the number of assets. Moreover; the strong non-stationaryeffects will further amplify estimation errors and lead to inaccurate investment decisions.High frequency data allows one to consider a short enough history such that the covariancematrix remains relatively unchanged; whilst still potentially offering sufficient historicalsamples for accurate estimation. However; the use of sparse sampling to account for themicrostructure noise places a restriction on the maximum number of intraday observations.The well-known realized covariance estimator for high frequency data will still perform …,*,2013,*

Extratropical Forcing and the Emergence of Central-Pacific El Niño in Recent Decades,J Yu; M Lu; S Kim,Abstract A newly released reanalysis dataset covering the period 1979 to 2009 is analyzedto show that the sea surface temperature (SST) variability in the tropical central Pacific ismore closely related to the SST variability in the tropical eastern Pacific before 1990 butmore closely related to sea level pressure (SLP) variations associated with the North PacificOscillation (NPO) after 1990. Only during the period after 1990 can the NPO excite largeSST variability in the tropical central Pacific. Related to this change; El Niño SouthernOscillation (ENSO) SST anomalies tend to spread from the eastern to central tropical Pacificbefore 1990 in a pattern resembling that associated with the Eastern-Pacific (EP) type ofENSO; but are more closely connected to SST variability in the subtropical north Pacific after1990 with a pattern resembling that of the Central-Pacific (CP) type of ENSO.

Transductive cartoon retrieval by multiple hypergraph learning,Jun Yu; Jun Cheng; Jianmin Wang; Dacheng Tao,Abstract Cartoon characters retrieval frequently suffers from the distance estimation problem.In this paper; a multiple hypergraph fusion based approach is presented to solve thisproblem. We build multiple hypergraphs on cartoon characters based on their features. Inthese hypergraphs; each vertex is a character; and an edge links to multiple vertices. In thisway; the distance estimation between characters is avoided and the high-order relationshipamong characters can be explored. The experiments of retrieval are conducted on cartoondatasets; and the results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve betterperformance than state-of-the-arts methods.,International Conference on Neural Information Processing,2012,*

High performance organic field-effect transistor with oxide/metal bilayer electrodes,Xinge Yu; Junsheng Yu; Wei Huang; Shijiao Han; Yadong Jiang,Pentacene organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) were fabricated by inserting a thin metallicoxide material MoO 3 between pentacene and gold (Au) electrodes as an interlayer.Comparing with the corresponding single layer OFETs without any interlayer; theses OFETswith a thin MoO 3 interlayer showed an obvious enhancement of hole mobility and slightlydecrease of threshold voltage. The improvement of performance was investigated byinterfacial energy level of the organic/metal interface; which showed that the MoO 3interlayer could significantly reduce the injection barrier between Au and pentacene.Moreover; the reduction of the injection barrier leads to a decrease of contact resistance atorganic/metal interface; which improve the performance of the devices.,6th International Symposium on Advanced Optical Manufacturing and Testing Technologies: Optoelectronic Materials and Devices for Sensing; Imaging; and Solar Energy,2012,*
Diminishing of S-shaped JV curves by substrate heating in organic solar cells based on triplet materials,Lin Hui; Jungsheng Yu; Yue Zang; Jian Zhong; Jiang Quan; Lei Zhang,The S-shaped JV curves in planar heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) using tripletmaterial bis [2-(4-tertbutylphenyl) benzothi azolato-N; C 2;] iridium (acetylacetonate)[(t-bt) 2Ir (acac)] as donor and C60 as acceptor were diminished by substrate heating during filmdeposition of (t-bt) 2 Ir (acac) layer. Mobility measurements showed that the disappearanceof S-kinks was attributed to the significant increase of hole mobility in (t-bt) 2 Ir (acac) byheating the substrate during evaporation and thus the decrease of mobility mismatchbetween electrons and holes; leading to the improvement of fill factor (FF). Moreover; thephotocurrent density (J ph) of heated device was remarkable enhanced and showeddecreased space charge limited (SCL) effect due to the balanced charge transport and theincrease of charge collection efficiency (ηCC).

High-precision Absolute Distance Measurements over a Long Range Based on Two Optoelectronic Oscillators,Jinlong Yu; Ju Wang; Wang Miao; Jigui Zhu; Bin Sun; Wenrui Wang; Hao Hu,Abstract: Absolute distance measurement (ADM) over a long range has been studiedintensely over the last several decades; due to its important applications in large-scalemanufacturing and outer space explorations [1-5]. Traditional absolute distancemeasurements utilize detection of time-of-flight information; detection of phase shift; or acombination of the two [6-17]. In this paper; we present a novel scheme for high-precisionADM over a long range based on frequency detection by using two optoelectronic oscillators(OEO) to convert distance information to frequency information. By taking advantage ofaccumulative magnification theory; the absolute error of the measured distance is magnifiedby about 2* 10E5 times; which makes the precision of the measured distance significantlyimproved.

Study on calcium precursors for CaO preparation to capture CO 2 at high temperature,MingMing ZHANG; Chao JI; Ze SUN; Jin WANG; Ping LI; JianGuo YU,As an abundant and cheap material; calcium oxide (CaO) is an efficient sorbent for CO 2capture at high temperature. The carbonation/calcination loop of CaO/CaCO 3 is an effectiveprocess for CO 2 capture and storage (CCS). However; both the gradual decline of the CO 2capture capacity and the poor stability; because of the pore filling and pore closure at thehigh calcination temperature; limit the industrial application of calcium-based sorbents. Inthis paper; study on calcium precursors was carried out in order to obtain CaO sorbents tocapture CO 2 with high efficiency. The candidate materials include seashell materials (oystershells); natural minerals (calcite) and chemical reagents (calcium acetate hydrate).

Variation of the Thermal Features over the Tibetan Plateau in Winter and its Impacts,Y Liu; J Yu; L Li; G Wu,Abstract Due to weaker longwave radiative cooling than over surrounding land area and thelatent heating over the western and southeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP); there exists a weaknegative diabatic heating over the TP in winter. The interannual variation of the TP heatingduring winter and its relationship with atmospheric circulation anomalies are studied bymeans of data diagnoses and numerical simulations. The mode of variation shows that themost prominent variations of winter TP heating come from the abnormal latent heating overthe west and southeast of TP. There appear consistent cyclonic (or anticyclonic) deflectioncirculations over the TP from the upper troposphere down to the lower troposphere when thecolumn-integrated diabatic heating over the TP is above (below) normal; showing anequivalent-barotropic structure.

Optical characteristics of 9; 10-diphenylanthracene nanocrystals fabricated by reprecipitation,Zhaolin Yuan; Junsheng Yu; Wenming Ma; Yadong Jiang,9; 10-Diphenylanthracene (DPA) nanocrystals were prepared using a reprecipitationmethod. Morphologies and Optical properties of DPA nanocrystals were investigated by ascanning electron microscope (SEM); UV-Visible absorption and fluorescence emissionspectra; respectively. The results showed that a large amount of DPA nanocrystals form andhave a width of about 300-500 nm; a length of 500 nm; a thickness of a few tens ofnanometers. Optical properties of the nanocrystals are obviously different from those of DPAmonomer. All absorption peaks for DPA nanocrystals experience a bathochromic shift withrespect to those of DPA monomer due to the formation of J-aggregates in the nanocrystals.The emission peaks of DPA nanocrystals are red-shifted compared with those of the dilutedsolution; which are attributed to the intermolecular force difference between the monomer …,5th International Symposium on Advanced Optical Manufacturing and Testing Technologies: Optoelectronic Materials and Devices for Detector; Imager; Display; and Energy Conversion Technology,2010,*

Automatic tissue arrayer and method for reliable and rapid construction of tissue microarray (TMA) blocks,Ting-Hsuan Chen; Jiun-Hung Yu; Yeong-Shin Tarng,Tissue microarray (TMA) technology is generally used in cancer research for recognizingtumors; and for identifying new diagnostics and therapeutics. Using traditional methods;such as manual and semi-automatic arrayer; to construct TMA blocks may result in missingtissue cores on the TMA slide due to weak compactness between cores and paraffin wax.Furthermore; relying on human eyes for manual alignment is not only time-consuming; butmay also lead to failure in extracting effective tissue cores. In this study; a fully automatictissue arrayer and an automated method; which involves pattern matching and coordinatetransformation; are developed for reliable and rapid construction of TMA blocks. Resultsshowed that the proposed automatic approach with the self-developed arrayer can avoidmissing cores on the TMA section.

Antagonistic Effects of MicroRNAs on Keratinocyte Migration: Implications for Corneal Epithelial Wound Healing,RM Lavker; H Peng; S Getsios; J Yu,Purpose:: Previously; we reported that microRNA-184 (miR-184); the most abundant cornealepithelial miRNA; antagonizes miR-205 to maintain levels of the lipid phosphatase; SHIP2;in corneal epithelium. SHIP2 dephosphorylates PIP3; a critical second messenger in severalcell signaling pathways including Akt. Our studies also indicated that miR-205 enhanced theAkt signaling pathway via SHIP2 suppression leading to increased cell survival. Since theAkt pathway has also been implicated in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and keratinocytemigration; we investigated whether the upstream regulation of SHIP2 levels by miRs-205and-184 plays a role in keratinocyte migration. Methods:: We used antagomirs (Antago) toreduce the levels of miR-184 and miR-205 in corneal epithelial (HCEKs) and epidermal(HEKs) keratinocytes.

Locating Semantically Similar Code Elements via Searching the System Dependence Graph,Xiaoyin Wang; David Lo; Jiefeng Cheng; Lu Zhang; Hong Mei; Jeffrey Xu Yu,ABSTRACT In software maintenance and evolution; it is common that developers want toapply a change to a number of similar places. Due to the size and complexity of the codebase; it is challenging for developers to locate all the places that need the change.Therefore; techniques that can help developers achieve this purpose should be necessary.In this paper; we propose a technique that enables developers to search for semanticallysimilar code elements satisfying user-defined dependence constraints. Our approach allowsdevelopers to make queries involving dependence relationships and textual conditions onthe system dependence graph of the program.

Simulations of solid-fluid coupling with application to crystal entrainment in vigorous convection,J Suckale; LT Elkins-Tanton; J Sethian; J Yu,Abstract Many problems in computational geophysics require the accurate coupling of asolid body to viscous flow. Examples range from understanding the role of highly crystallinemagma for the dynamic of volcanic eruptions to crystal entrainment in magmatic flow and theemplacement of xenoliths. In this paper; we present and validate a numerical method forsolid-fluid coupling. The algorithm relies on a two-step projection scheme: In the first step;we solve the multiple-phase Navier-Stokes or Stokes equation in both domains. In thesecond step; we project the velocity field in the solid domain onto a rigid-body motion byenforcing that the deformation tensor in the respective domain is zero. This procedure is alsoused to enforce the no-slip boundary condition on the solid-fluid interface. We performseveral benchmark computations to validate our computations.

A New Local-Loop Particle Filter Based on the Artificial Fish Algorithm,Jian Yu; Xinyu Li; Guilan Luo,In this paper; we proposed a novel filtering method-Local-loop Particle Filter Based on theArtificial Fish Algorithm (LPF-AF) for nonlinear dynamic systems. Particle filtering algorithmhas been widely used in solving nonlinear/non Gaussian filtering problems. The proposaldistribution is the key issue of the particle filtering; which will greatly influence theperformance of algorithm. In the proposed LPF-AF; the local searching of AF is used toregenerate sample particles; which can make the proposal distribution more closed to theposter distribution.

ISAR Image Reconstruction of Accelerated Motion Using Matching Pursuits,Jingshu Yang; Jian Yu,The problem of inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) image reconstruction of acceleratedmotion is considered. As a result of accelerated motion experienced by the target during theimage integration period; the ISAR image is distorted and the Doppler frequency of the radarechoes produces undesired change. In traditional ISAR imaging; uniform motion is usuallyassumed. When accelerated motions are present; it is not possible to obtain a focusedimage of the target. To solve this problem; the basic idea is to exploit the characteristics ofthe Doppler frequency of every range cell. The radar signal is decomposed by matchingpursuit with a three-parameter chirplet atom. Different point scatterers in cross direction canbe separated in the parameter space. The proposed approach is applied to the pointscatterer simulation and the result demonstrates that it can improve the smeary ISAR …,Information Technology and Computer Science; 2009. ITCS 2009.

A maximum power efficiency eta p of 6.62lm/W and current efficiency of 14.78 cd/A at 745cd/m 2 are obtained from the device. The roll-off percentage of eta p of the pure phosphorescent phosphor layer device is reduced to 5%at a current density of 20 mA/cm 2; which is about 11% for conventional phosphorescentdevices. The low roll-off efficiency is attributed to the phosphorescent material; which has themolecular structure of a strong steric hindrance effect.,Chinese Physics Letters,2009,*

Fast Probabilistic Ranking under x-Relation Model,Lijun Chang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lu Qin,Abstract: The probabilistic top-k queries based on the interplay of score and probability;under the possible worlds semantic; become an important research issue that considersboth score and uncertainty on the same basis. In the literature; many different probabilistictop-k queries are proposed. Almost all of them need to compute the probability of a tuple t_ito be ranked at the j-th position across the entire set of possible worlds. The cost of suchcomputing is the dominant cost and is known as O (kn^ 2); where n is the size of dataset. Inthis paper; we propose a new novel algorithm that computes such probability in O (kn).Subjects: Databases (cs. DB) Cite as: arXiv: 0906.4927 [cs.

Photochemical surface modification of flexible plastic substrate for organic light-emitting diodes,Yadong Jiang; Hui Lin; Shuangling Lou; Junsheng Yu,A method using UV-curable epoxy resin is described to modify organic polymer substrateswithout changing the bulk properties of substrate material. The reagents contain an acrylateor other photoactive group which; when exposed to light of appropriate wavelength;generates highly reactive intermediates that covalently bond with nearly any organicmaterial. Applying epoxy resin onto the surfaces of such materials; the surface propertiescan be modified to achieve greatly increased bond strengths with conventional adhesives.Flexible organic light-emitting diode (FOLED) is fabricated on indium-tin oxide (ITO) plasticsubstrate by inserting a UV-curable epoxy resin as a buffer layer between plastic substrateand ITO film.

By hidden structural information we mean the information that cannot be easilyfound using a traditional query language SQL. In this talk; we discuss how to find hiddenstructural information in a relational database by viewing a relational database as a largedirected graph where nodes represent tuples and edges represent foreign key referencesbetween tuples in the database. We discuss how to find trees and communities in such alarge graph for user-given keywords. We also discuss how to find frequent and additionalkeywords associated with the structures identified in a relational database using SQL.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2009,*
Using invariants of the gravitational gradient tensor as boundary values to solve for the gravitational field,J Yu; D Zhao; H Jin,Abstract The study is motivated by GOCE mission and mainly deals with the invariants of thegravitational gradient tensor. At first; the invariants are introduced; linearization models areestablished starting from the invariants; and the models can be referred as the boundaryvalues on the satellite's orbit. Secondly; the spherical approximations for the models arederived and they can be simply expressed as boundary values of the second derivative ofthe disturbing potential along radial direction. Then based on the spherical approximation;the effects of J2-term are considered so that the accuracies of the boundary values canefficiently be raised. And then errors about combinations of the invariants are estimated. Andstill then it is discussed how to compute the invariants from GOCE mission.

Three-dimensional object recognition based on 3D invariance,Huijuan Yuan; Guohui Qin; Jia Yu,This paper presents a method based on 3D invariant features for the recognition of three-dimensional object. In this method; the projective invariant features are adopted as therepresentative of the 3D invariance. 3D invariant features are the features that will notchange with viewpoints or poses; so they can be used to recognize three-dimensionalobjects. Exact point-line matching is achieved in use of the point-line characteristicsobtained. On this basis; the views relation is established by the 2D projective transformation;and many kinds of 3D invariant features of complicated spatial structures can be neatlyextracted by combining real elements and virtual elements. Therefore the three-dimensionalobject can be recognized. The results indicate that the method could greatly satisfy three-dimensional object recognition.,Fifth International Symposium on Instrumentation Science and Technology,2009,*

We apply this property to two related problems on treepattern rewriting using views. First; given view V and query Q; is it possible for Q to have anequivalent rewriting using V which is the union of two or more tree patterns; but not anequivalent rewriting which is a single pattern? This problem is of both theoretical andpractical importance because; if the answer is no; then; to find an equivalent rewriting of atree pattern using a view; we should use more efficient methods; such as the polynomialtime algorithm of [17]; rather than try to find the union of all contained rewritings and test itsequivalence to Q.

Whenevaluating queries on the Web; it is not feasible to exhaustively examine all objects on theWeb. The local property; studied in this paper; can be informally described as the reversescenario: in order to check if an object participated in the result of a Web query; is it sufficientto examine a bounded portion of the Web? We start our investigation by using the Webmachine proposed by Mendelzon and Milo [1]. We review the genericity; domainindependence and computability of Web queries. We present a syntactic class of local Webqueries and a sound algorithm to check if a query belongs to this class. We then examine …,Asia-Pacific Web Conference,2008,*

Notched Impact Fracture of Nylon6 Using Instrumented Impact Test,Yu-zhu XIONG; Chao-xian WANG; Ying LIU; Jie YU; Ming-jing TU,The impact fracture behavior of nylon6 was studied by instrumented impact test under 23;-10;-50℃. The results showed that the crack initiation work of nylon6 reduced withtemperature decreasing because of the effect of temperature on plastic deformation. Theinertial peak value and the maximum force value were influenced by stiffness and tensilestrength of nylon6. The crack origin formed in sub-layer under 23℃ because the stress inouter layer was released by its plastic deformation and the biggest axial stress moved to sub-layer. Under-10℃ and-50℃; the location of crack origins were in outer layer for the poorplastic deformation of matrix. The break of bunch belt in crack origin might be the importantway of crack initiation in notched impact tests. The quantity of bunch belt became small andits size became big with temperature decreasing.,Plastics,2008,*

Genetic and Statiscal Aspects of Association Mapping.,Chengsong Zhu; Guannan Sun; Jianming Yu,Association mapping holds great promise for the dissection of complex traits. Besides itstechnical merits; association mapping is one of few strategies that utilize in large scale thehigh throughput genomic technologies in sequencing and genotyping and the naturalgenetic diversity. Although appropriate methods have recently been developed for mappingwith diverse germplasm; a thorough understanding of the genetic and statistical properties ofassociation mapping requires further study. We first review the current status of associationmapping in crops and other model species. Then we introduce a new likelihood basedstatistics to quantify the amount genetic variation accounted for by population structure andrelatedness.

Adaptive scheduling for shared window joins over data streams,Cheqing Jin; Aoying Zhou; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Joshua Zhexue Huang; Feng Cao,Abstract Recently a few Continuous Query systems have been developed to cope withapplications involving continuous data streams. At the same time; numerous algorithms areproposed for better performance. A recent work on this subject was to define schedulingstrategies on shared window joins over data streams from multiple query expressions. Inthese strategies; a tuple with the highest priority is selected to process from multiplecandidates. However; the performance of these static strategies is deeply influenced whendata are bursting; because the priority is determined only by static information; such as thequery windows; arriving order; etc. In this paper; we propose a novel adaptive strategywhere the priority of a tuple is integrated with realtime information. A thorough experimentalevaluation has demonstrated that this new strategy can outperform the existing strategies.,*,2007,*

The structures ofthe samples were refined by Rietveld method. Although the carrier concentration in thesamples is constant at different dopant levels; the superconductivity evidently changes. Weattribute decrease in Tc to a charge redistribution in the crystalline lattice. Comparing thechange of the T c value caused by structural influence and carrier concentration; it issuggested that the influence of structural changes on the superconductivity is independentof that induced by carrier concentration.,International Journal of Modern Physics B,2007,*

Microstructure and thermal stability of Al-Mg-Mn alloys by equal channel angular pressing at elevated temperature,Jiang Li Ning; Da Ming Jiang; Bing Yu Qian; Xi Gang Fan; Bao You Zhang; Jie Yu; Xin Mei Zhang,Abstract: Article Preview Article Preview Two Al-Mg-Mn alloys having similar compositionsbut with and without Zr addition were subjected to equal channel angular pressing (ECAP)at 350 C using route BC and a 90 die; followed by water quenching or air cooling. A series ofannealing experiments were conducted at various temperatures from 400 C to 460 C on thewater-quenched alloys. Fine structures with grain size of approximately 1~ 2μm wereobtained in these alloys after 6 passes. The water-quenched alloy containing Zr exhibitedfiner structure compared with the Zr-free alloy in the same cooling condition; which was dueto the existence of Al3Zr dispersoids. And in the air cooling condition; it was found that in theZr-free alloy static recovery occurred; and in partial regions some small grains withoutdislocation inside appeared suggesting the occurrence of static recrystallization.

Indexable PLA for Efficient Similarity Search,QiuxiaChen LeiChen XiangLian YunhaoLiu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,ABSTRACT Similarity-based search over time-series databases has been a hot researchtopic for a long history; which is widely used in many applications; including multimediaretrieval; data mining; web search and retrieval; and so on. However; due to highdimensionality (ie length) of the time series; the similarity search over directly indexed timeseries usually encounters a serious problem; known as the “dimensionality curse”. Thus;many dimensionality reduction techniques are proposed to break such curse by reducingthe dimensionality of time series. Among all the proposed methods; only Piecewise LinearApproximation (PLA) does not have indexing mechanisms to support similarity queries;which prevents it from efficiently searching over very large timeseries databases. Our initialstudies on the effectiveness of different reduction methods; however; show that PLA …,*,2007,*

Stability Analysis of Discrete TS Fuzzy Systems with Standard Fuzzy Partition Inputs,Jian-xiang Yu; Guang Ren; Song-tao Zhang,The stability analysis of discrete TS fuzzy systems is discussed in this paper. First; apiecewise discrete Lyapunov function is constructed in all maximal overlapped-rule groups.Each discrete Lyapunov function lies in its own maximal overlapped-rule group. Then; a newsufficient condition to check the stability of discrete TS fuzzy systems is proposed. Thiscondition only requires finding a common positive definite matrix in each maximaloverlapped-rule group. Compared with former stability analysis approaches; this approachcan not only overcome the defect of finding a common positive definite matrix but alsoreduce the number of solving Lyapunov inequalities largely.

We propose a data mining approach for query refinement using Association Rules(ARs) among keywords being extracted from a document database. We are concerned withtwo issues in this paper. First; instead of using minimum support and minimum confidencewhich has little effectiveness of screening documents; we use maximum support andmaximum confidence. Second; to further reduce the number of rules; we introduce two co-related concepts:“stem rule” and “coverage”. The effectiveness of using ARs to screen isreported as well.,Research and Development in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining: Second Pacific-Asia Conference; PAKDD'98; Melbourne; Australia; April 15-17; 1998; Proceedings,2006,*
Effect of arsenic trioxide on bone marrow stromal cells of patients with multiple myeloma,J Tan; T Liu; HL Zhu; WT Meng; J Yu,Abstract To explore the effect of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) on growth and secretion ofinterleukin-6 (IL-6) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) of bone marrow stromacells (BMSC) from the patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Specimens of bone marrowaspiration from MM patients were used to establish BMSC cultures. BMSC and human MMcell line CZ-1 were cultured together or alone in the absence or presence of As2O3 atvarious concentrations (1-20.0 micromol/L). Cell growth inhibition was assessed by MTTassay; cytokines in the culture supernatants were measured with ELISA. The results showedthat As2O3 had cytostatic effect on CZ-1 with fifty percent growth inhibition (IC50) for 48hours at 2.3 micromol/L. As2O3 did not inhibit the growth of BMSC.

Percentage Fall in FVC at the Methacholine PC20 (ΔFVC) in Cough-Variant Asthma and Classic Asthma,Y Yoo; J Yu; DK Kim; SH Choi; YY Koh,METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of methacholine challenge test data from47 children (CVA group) who were diagnosed as having CVA and from 75 children (CAgroup) who had CA of mild severity. ΔFVC and PC 20 were calculated on the dose-responsecurve to methacholine. RESULTS: The mean (±SD) ΔFVC was significantly (p= 0.001) lowerin the CVA group (14.7±3.4%) than in the CA group (17.1±4.4%); whereas PC 20 was notdifferent between the two groups (geometric mean; range of 1 SD: 4.79 mg/mL; 2.24-10.23vs. 4.17 mg/mL; 1.70-10.23). No significant correlation was found between ΔFVC and PC 20in the CVA group (r= 0.026; p= 0.863) or in the CA group (r=-0.191; p= 0.101).CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that CVA is associated with a lower level of maximalairway response than CA.

Web Community Related Techniques,Yanchun Zhang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Jingyu Hou,Pierrakos et al. presented a way of constructing Web communities using Web logs archivedin a proxy server (Pierrakos et al. 2003; Pierrakos et al. 2003). The overview is given below.First; when users access the WWW; their Web access requests go through a proxy serverwhere the Web logs are archived. The Web logs contain the basic information; such aswhich Web pages are accessed from which IP addresses. Second; based on the archivedWeb logs; the Web pages being accessed are recorded. A Web page can be abstracted as afeature vector where a feature indicates whether the corresponding word appears in theWeb page. The page categories can then be obtained using a hierarchical clustering tocluster Web pages being accessed; where the similarity is based on the words thatfrequently appear in Web pages. The clustering results in a tree structure where a leaf …,Web Communities: Analysis and Construction,2006,*
Affinity and Co-Citation Analysis Approaches,Yanchun Zhang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Jingyu Hou,A Web page similarity usually refers to a certain page space. Since we are concerned aboutclustering Web-searched results in this work; we focus on a page space that is related to theuser's query topics. The ideas and analysis techniques in the following sections; however;could also be used to other concerned Web spaces; such as those in (Weiss et al. 1996) and(Pitkow and Pirolli 1997). In this section; we firstly establish a page source (space) that isrelated to the query topics. Within this page source; we incorporate hyperlink transitivity andpage importance to propose a new page similarity measurement.,Web Communities: Analysis and Construction,2006,*
PageRank Related Algorithms,Yanchun Zhang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Jingyu Hou,It is clear from Chap. 3 that Web search results can be much improved by using theinformation contained in link structure between pages. For example; given a query which isa set of words or other query terms; HITS invokes a traditional search engine to obtain a setof pages relevant to it; expands this set with its inlinks and outlinks; and then attempts to findtwo types of pages; hubs and authorities. Because this computation is carried out at querytime; it is not feasible for today's search engines; which need to handle tens of millions ofqueries per day. The PageRank algorithm was originally proposed by Brin and Page (Brinand L. Page 1998) and incorporated in the search engine Google. In contrast to HITS;PageRank computes a single measure of quality for a page at crawl time. This measure isthen combined with a traditional information retrieval (IR) score at query time; and has the …,Web Communities: Analysis and Construction,2006,*
HITS and Related Algorithms,Yanchun Zhang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Jingyu Hou,The Hyperlink Induced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm is essentially a linkbased approachthat intends to find authority and hub pages from a link induced Web graph. Authorities arethose pages that provide the best source of information on a given topic; while hubs arethose pages that provide collections of links to authorities (Kleinberg 1998). Hubs andauthorities exhibit a mutually reinforcing relationship: A good hub is a page that points tomany good authorities; a good authority is a page that is pointed to by many good hubs. Thealgorithm was implemented by IBM Almaden Research Centre in Clever; a prototype searchengine; and was named the “Clever Algorithm” in an article of Scientific American. Thisalgorithm name is also used in some research papers.,Web Communities: Analysis and Construction,2006,*
Building a Web Community,Yanchun Zhang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Jingyu Hou,Web community is a community on the Web; and is a collection of Web pages created bythose who share the same interests or specific topics. In (Gibson et al. 1998); Gibson et al..presented a view on Web communities that can be found using the HITS algorithm. In theabstract of their paper (Gibson et al. 1998); it states: The communities can be viewed ascontaining a core of central;“authoritative” pages linked together by “hub pages”; and theyexhibit a natural type of hierarchical topic generalization that can be inferred directly from thepattern of linkage.

Multiple-factor analysis of weight gain in very low birth weight infants,YJ Wu; JL Yu; R Gu,Abstract To investigate the correlative factors of weight gain in very low birth weight infants(VLBW). Fifty-one cases of VLBW from July 1998 to March 2004 were analyzedretrospectively. Twenty two cases were small for gestational age (SGA) and 29 cases wereappropriate for gestational age (AGA). The age of first feeding was (2.35+/-2.29) d. Caloricintake was (377.61+/-121.50) kJ/(kg. d)[(90.25+/-29.04) kcal/(kg. d)] and protein intake was(2.18+/-0.83) g/(kg. d). The age of birth weight regained was (7.41+/-3.57) d and the velocityof weight gain was (16.38+/-9.29) g/d or (12.63+/-7.15) g/(kg. d). Single factor analysis foundthat early feeding and caloric supply and protein supply had significant influence on weightgain (P< 0.05). The result of multivariate linear analysis showed that the significant riskfactors were associated with supply of calorie and protein.

Strong erbium photoluminescence from erbium-doped silica layers prepared using excimer VUV lamps,JJ Yu; IW Boyd,Erbium-doped silica layers formed by a low-temperature UV approach using excimer VUVlamps have exhibited a strong 1.53 µm erbium photoluminescence with the intensity beingcomparable to that from the thermally prepared layer while luminescence lifetime is evenslightly longer than the latter. Luminescence peak intensity was found to increase witherbium atomic concentration in the range 0.6–1.2%. The fact that luminescence intensitydepends on the availability of erbium in the silica layer and that the layers prepared by thelow-temperature UV process show strong photoluminescence indicates that luminescencearound 1.53 µm is generated by direct optical excitation of erbium ions in the silica layers.,Electronics Letters,2005,*
Excimer VUV formation of erbium‐doped silica layers,JJ Yu; IW Boyd,Abstract Erbium-doped silica sol–gel layers with post-process excimer VUV irradiation at alow temperature of 400 C have exhibited a strong room temperature Er luminescence at∼1.53 µm. The VUV irradiation has led to the formation of Er oxides in the silica matrix whilesignificantly reducing nonradiative decay channels associated with the OH groups in the sol–gel layers. High-resolution transmission electron micros-copy results revealed the formationof Er 2 O 3 crystallites in the silica layers. The Er–O coordination and crystallisation alteredthe chemical environment of the Er ions in the silica while possibly reducing the quenchingeffect of the Er–Er cross-relaxation; resulting in the strong Er luminescence emitted.Moreover; the low temperature VUV process would not produce the luminescencebackground offset which was found to be present in all the luminescence spectra of the …,physica status solidi (a),2005,*

Defect of TCR-mediated signal pathway of T cells in IDDM patients,HM Li; RQ Zhong; JP Yu; LN Cao; XT Kong; WF Chen,Abstract To study the mechanism responsible for alteration of T cell response in IDDMpatients. T cells from peripheral blood of IDDM patients were activated by anti-TCRantibodies. The level of TCR-mediated signaling pathway was analyzed. T cells from IDDMpatients responded weakly to anti-TCR antibody-induced proliferation; as compared with Tcells from normal subjects (P< 0.05). The defect could be partially remedied by the additionof rIL-2; while the anti-CD28 antibody stimulation did not restore the proliferative response ofanti-TCR-induced cells from IDDM patients (P= 0.03). Unresponsiveness of the T cells fromIDDM patients to anti-TCR antibody may result from a defect in the signaling pathway; theCD28 co-stimulation-signaling pathway is normal. Defect in the TCR signaling pathwayincreases the sensitivity of T cells from IDDM patients to apoptosis or anergy.,Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi= Chinese journal of cellular and molecular immunology,2004,*

AB-QTL analysis for â-glucan content in oats,Jianzhong Yu; Steffen Beuch; Matthias Herrmann; Bernd Hackauf,The advanced-backcross QTL analysis (AB-QTL analysis); as proposed by Tanksley andNelson (1996); was chosen as an directed approach to introduce QTLs for B-glucan contentand other important traits from a genebank accession into cultivar breeding programmes. Inthis presentation first results from an oat AB-QTL project are presented. Three BC2S1populations consisting of 98; 73 and 67 lines; respectively; were derived from the cross' Iltis'xIA H611-447; the latter of which served as a donor for high â-glucan content. In 2003 the firstfield nursery was performed with the 237 BC2S4 families at three locations with tworeplications per location. The most important agronomical and quality traits have beenanalysed. Segregation between lines was evident in yield components and yield; plantheight and quality parameters like â-glucan content.

Holistic Twig Joins on Indexed XML Documents’,Haifeng Jiang Wei Wang Hongjun Lu,Abstract Finding all the occurrences of a twig pat-tern specified by a selection predicate onmultiple elements in an XML document is a core operation for efficient evaluation of XMLqueries. Holistic twig join algorithms were proposed recently as an optimal solution whenthe twig pattern only involves ancestor-descendant relationships. In this paper; we addressthe problem of efficient processing of holistic twig joins on all/partly indexed XMLdocuments. In particular; we propose an algo-rithm that utilizes available indices on elementsets. While it can be shown analytically that the proposed algorithm is as efficient as the ex-isting state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of worst case I/O and CPU cost; experimentalresults on various datasets indicate that the proposed index-based algorithm performssignificantly better than the existing ones; especially when binary structural joins in the …,Proceedings 2003 VLDB Conference: 29th International Conference on Very Large Databases (VLDB),2003,*

Subjects were active; living at home; free frompsychiatric or significant physical disorders; having high Mmi-Mental State (MMS) score andlow Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) score; and showed no major signs of cerebralmfarction on MRI (1.5 T). ERPs were recorded with subjects engaged in auditory oddballtasks. We found no significant correlation between age and P300 component. Sex differ-ence concerning P300 component with aging was also not detected. P300 latency prolon-gation and decreased visual retention (Benton test) were associated with lower MMS …,*,2002,*

Parallel Maintenance of Materialized Views on Personal Computer Clusters.,Weifa Liang; Jeffrey Xu Yu,A data warehouse is a repository of integrated information; which collects and maintains a largeamount of data from multiple distributed; autonomous; and possibly heterogeneous datasources. Often the data are stored in the form of materialized views in order to provide fast accessto the integrated data. How to maintain the warehouse data completely consistently with the remotesource data is a challenging issue in a distributed environment. Transactions containing multipleupdates at one or multiple sources further complicate this consistency issue. Due to the fact thata data warehouse usually contains a very large amount of data and its processing is timeconsuming; it becomes inevitable to introduce parallelism to data warehousing. The popularityand cost-effective parallelism brought by the PC cluster makes it a promising platform for thispurpose.

-Analysis of Multilayer System with Geosynthetic Insertion—Sensitivity Analysis,BB Budkowska; J Yu,The inclusion of a geogrid; in the angular aggregate; results in the development of a newcomposite layer; the modulus of which is higher than the unreinforced material. That resultsfrom the gradual stiffening process of multi-layer structure by the function of interlockingwhen subject to repetitive loading. The analysis of this process is tackled in the framework ofsensitivity theory allowing for the development of a composite layer around the geogrid. Themodified elastic continuum theory was utilized to develop the constitutive model. Theconcept of permanent modulus of deformation was incorporated. The analysis processrequired the deformed geometry updating. The theoretical formulation of sensitivity analysisemployed the adjoint method. It allowed for determination of the permanent modulus ofcomposite layer that was much higher as compared with unreinforced system.Structural …,*,2001,*

The results wereconfirmed by the further electron panmagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments and the threetypes of states (Mn 2+) sub;(Mn 2+) int; and Mn clusters were identified. It was observed thatthe g-factor and the hyperfine structure (HFS) constant increase with the decreasing size ofnanocrystallite. This may result from hybridization of sp 3 electron states of ZnS and 3d 5electron states of Mn by the effects of quantum confinement and the surface states.,Science in China Series A: Mathematics,1999,*

The effects of the position of dispersion compensation fibre on 4× 10 Gb s− 1 WDM systems with different duty cycle,J-J Yu; Kejian Guan; Bojun Yang,Abstract The effects of the position of dispersion compensation fibre on 4× 10Gbs− 1 WDMsystems with different duty cycle are investigated. With the long amplifier spacing and largeinput power; no matter what the duty cycle is; the performance of the system with DCF-first isworse than that with SMF-first. The best performance can be obtained with a duty cycle of0.5; and it is independent of the position of DCF. With the short amplifier spacing and smallinput power; the system performance with NRZ format and DCF-first is better than that ofother systems. It means that NRZ format and DCF-first should be employed in a WDMsystem with short amplifier spacing.,Optical and quantum electronics,1999,*

A Data Mining Model for Query Refinement Revisited,Hanxiong Chen; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Junichi Notoya; Ye Liu; Nobuo Ohbo,Abstract. In this paper we formalize a query refinement model using a data mining approach.The model is a graph based model in which nodes are sets of keywords and edges betweentwo nodes indicate inclusion relationships. Rules are defined as interpretations of edges. Inaddition; supports and confidences are defined as weights associated with nodes andedges; respectively. The properties of this graph are discussed. Since both the keywordspace and the graph can be huge; an algorithm is also presented in this paper by which wecan exclude nodes and edges from a graph and therefore we are able to reduce the numberof rules. We also show that all documents can be possibly retrieved from the so-called stemrule.,IDEAL'98,1998,*

Clinical study on effect of TCM treatment in decreasing frequency of peritoneal dialysis,Da-Qing Guo; Jiang-Yi Yu,Abstract Objective: To evaluate the effect of combined therapy of traditional Chinesemedicine (TCM) treatment and peritoneal dialysis (PD) in improving renal function andreducing the frequency of PD. Methods: Three groups of patients were treated with regularPD; less frequency PD (LFPD) and LFPD plus TCM (LFPD+ TCM) respectively; and thepatients' blood urea nitrogen (BUN); Creatinine (Cr); hemoglobin (Hb) and arterial bloodpressure (BP) were observed. Results: After 3 months of PD+ TCM; the serum BUN; Cr andmean BP of the group lowered and the hemoglobin elevated as compared with those ofpatients after 1 month of PD (P< 0.01). The difference of the above-mentioned criteriabetween PD+ TCM group and LFPD group was significant too; though there was no obviousdifference in comparison of the PD+ TCM group with regular PD group (P> 0.05).

Analysis of loss influence on the generation of soliton trains in a dispersion decreasing fibre,X Zhang; J Yu,Abstract The influence of fibre loss on the generation of high bit rate and high quality solitonpulse trains using dual-frequency beat-signal and dispersion decreasing fibre (DDF) isanalysed theoretically and numerically. The results show that when fibre loss is taken intoaccount; the propagation behaviour of the pulse train is quite different from that when loss isneglected even though the condition Γ (normalized loss)≪ σ0 (equivalent gain of DDF) issatisfied. As a result; when designing experiment work; one must be cautious in neglectingloss.,Optical and quantum electronics,1997,*
Detection of minimal residual disease after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in chronic myeloid leukemia,Y Liu; J Fu; X Yu; Y Chang; W Xue; S Chen; D Lu,OBJECTIVE: To detect minimal residual disease (MRD) after allogeneic bone marrowtransplantation (allo-BMT) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). METHODS: M-bcr/abl mRNAwas assayed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in bone marrowcells from 46 successfully sibling marrow engrafted CML patients. RESULTS: About 70% ofthe patients achieved genetic complete remission in 3 months post allo-BMT. Four patientswere M-bcr/abc mRNA positive at 1.5 to 2 months post allo-BMT and turned to be negative at3 to 9 months post allo-BMT. One patient was still M-bcr/abl (+) after disease-free survival(DFS) for more than 6 years; while another one was M-bcr/abl (-) after DFS for more than 4years. CONCLUSION: RT-PCR is so far the most sensitive method for MRD detection inCML; but its limitation should not be ignored.,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi= Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,1997,*
" Homogenization" of Polymer Blends by Shear Flow,CC Han; S Kim; J-W Yu; JF Douglas; EK Hobbie,Abstract The morphological structure change and the critical temperature shift ofpolystyrene/polybutadiene blends with and without solvent added have been studied bylight scattering; phase contrast microscopy and fluorescene microscopy. The phase diagramshift can be interpreted by a theory of Onuki-Kawasake type and the droplet deformation andmorphological structure change can be calculated by Taylor-Tomotika theory together withthe interfacial tension reduction caused by the phase diagram shift. The mixing/de-mixingprocess and also the miscibility or the" homogenization" in the two phase region for polymerblends can be better understood.,APS March Meeting Abstracts,1997,*

Histopathologic study on the anterosuperior spreading of supraglottic carcinoma,L Wang; J Yu; S Fei,Abstract Pathologic characteristic of supraglottic carcinoma spreading anterosuperiorly in100 cases was investigated by whole-organ sections of the larynx. The results showed that75% of supraglottic carcinomas were found to spread anterosuperiorly. In these cases;carcinoma in the epiglottis-ventricular fold accounted for 90%; epiglottic carcinoma 81.8%;and carcinoma in the ventricular fold 33.3%. Carcinoma in the aryepiglottic fold andarytenoid region was not noted to spread anterosuperiorly. In the cases with anterosuperiorspreading of supraglottic carcinoma; the pre-epiglottic space was most commonly involved;which accounted for 60% of the cases; while the lingual surface of the epiglottis 42%; thevallecula 17%; the base of the tongue 12%; and the anterosuperior part of the thyroidcartilage 7%.,Zhonghua er bi yan hou ke za zhi,1995,*

Scheduling Issues in Partitioned Temporal Join,Jeffrey X Yu; Kian-Lee Tan,One of the major problems of temporal databases is to develop efficient algorithms foroperations that involves the time attributes. An operation that has received much attention inrecent years is the temporal join which matches records from two temporal relations whosetime intervals overlap. Under a partition-based algorithm; temporal data are split intopartitions. During the join process; a partition in one relation only needs to join with some;but not all; partitions of the other relation. In this paper; we address scheduling issues insuch an algorithm. Depending on the orders in which partitions are read; the number of I/Osincurred varies. We propose a three-phase scheduling framework to minimize the number ofI/Os incurred. From the framework; a large number of scheduling strategies can be derived.We also study several representative scheduling strategies and report our findings in this …,*,1995,*

A comparative study on the population urbanized under or outside state plan: different status of mobile urban population and permanent new urban residents in the...,J Xie; J Yu,The introduction of a market economy in China marked a turning point in the urbanizationprocess in China by the coexistence of two types of populations one urbanized under theplanned economy or state plan (PUSP) and the other urbanized outside the state plan(POSP) or under the market economy. The 1990 census identified three types of mobilepopulations: 1) those with permanent residence elsewhere but who stay in one city for morethan 1 year; 2) those away from their permanent residence for more than 1 year but stayingin one city for less than 1 year; and 3) those whose residence is yet to be registered. Twoanti-urbanization movements before the economic reform the relocation of 30 million urbanemployees in the early 1960s and the resettlement of 40 million youths in rural areas in themid-1960s resulted in the drastic increase of the PUSP in the late 1970s and early 1980s …,Chinese journal of population science,1993,*

Rejection of swept-tone interference in PN continuous-wave radar systems by using a novel neural network model,Guiqing He; Juebang Yu; Xiaozhong Pang,In pseudonoise CW radar systems the effect of active interferences is reduced by theinherent processing gain of the system. In the presence of continuous wave interferences;the performance can be improved further by interference rejection techniques; such as useof transform domain notch filters; adaptive phased antenna arrays; time domain adaptivetransversal filters; etc. These techniques are not very effective for rejecting the swept-toneinterference often encountered. A neural network technique is proposed for rejecting abroad class of active interferences including single tone; fast moving swept tone; pulsed CWinterference; etc.,Radar 92.

Relationship between left ventricular end-diastolic compliance and abnormal Doppler mitral filling in patients with coronary artery disease.,BL Cai; LS Gong; JP Ye; JD Yu; WH Qi; HY Ding; ZW Shi,Abstract Left ventricular end-diastolic compliance (LVEDC) and transmitral flow velocitieswere measured in 19 patients with coronary artery disease associated with hypertensionand 10 normal subjects by LV catheterization and pulsed-Doppler echocardiography.LVEDC was much lower in the patient than in the normal subjects (P less than 0.01). Thedata showed that abnormal Doppler diastolic function such as elevated late diastolic peakflow velocity (PVA) and decreased LVEDC occurred in the patients at the same time. Inaddition; the negative correlation of PVA with LVEDC observed in normal controls but not inpatients suggested that in patients with impaired diastolic filling; factors other than thedecreased LVEDC itself must also participate in the development of diastolic dysfunction.,Chinese medical journal,1991,*

Stabilization and structure optimization of asymmetric neural networks,Huanglin Zeng; Juebang Yu,A new approach for stabilizing asymmetric neural networks is suggested in the presentpaper. A nonlinear control system is used as the model of the given neural network; then bydecomposing the interconnection matrix and by using the deremainder control technique;some asymptotically stable outputs can be attained as the network is driven by prescribedinputs. A structure optimization scheme for the network is also suggested following the sametechnique.,Circuits and Systems; 1991. Conference Proceedings; China.; 1991 International Conference on,1991,*

Binocular Dissociation with IBM PC/AT and Nintendo Stereoviewer,Ai-Hou Wang; Ji-Hau Jan; Joseph Jy-Haw Yu; Luke Long-Kuang Lin; Liang-Shi Ko,Clinical tests for evaluation of binocular function depend mainly on binocular dissociation.Techniques of binocular dissociation include stereoscope; such as major amblyoscope;vectograph; such as Titmus; anaglyph; such as TNO and prism bars; such as Lang'sstereotest. Recently; the family video game of Nintendo developed stereo animation throughanother mechanism; alternate occlusive goggles on 60 Hz basis to achieve time separation.We interfaced IBM PC/AT and EGA monitor with this system to make stereograms; of whichthe advantages include (1) color stereograms can be displayed (cf. vectograph andanaglyph);(2) timing can be accurately controlled; which add new quantification to thedifficulty of reading stereograms.,中華民國眼科醫學會雜誌,1990,*
Binocular Dissociation by the Mechanism of Time Separation,Ai-Hou Wang; Ji-Hau Jan; Joseph Jy-Haw Yu; Luke Long-Kuang Lin; Liang-Shi Ko,Abstract Binocular dissociation is the technique used for quantitative evaluation of binocularfunction.(Noorden; 1985) Several methods are now clinically available; such as stereoscope(major amblyoscope); vectograph (Titmus and Randot stereotests); anaglyph (TNO andAwaya aniseikonia test); and prism bars (Lang's stereogram).(March et al; 1980) Recently;Nintendo family video game developed stereo animation; which applied another mechanismfor binocular dissociation. The stereo patterns were shown alternately on the screen in 60Hz and the goggle-stereoviewer was synchronized with the screen to occlude both eyesalternately. We were interested in this system and tried to interface it with IBM PC/AT to makeour own stereograms for both clinical and research works.,*,1990,*

Binary Solvent Additives Treatment Boosts the Efficiency of PTB7: PCBM Polymer Solar Cells to Over 9.5%,Yifan Zheng; Gang Wang; Di Huang; Jaemin Kong; TengHooi Goh; Wei Huang; Junsheng Yu; André D Taylor,Abstract In this work; a 9.5% of power conversion efficiency (PCE) is obtained in the thieno[3; 4-b] thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7):(6; 6)-phenyl-C 70-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70 BM) based polymer solar cell (PSC) by using a novel binary solvent additive of diphenylether (DPE): 1; 8-diiodoctane (DIO). We find that this binary solvent additive approachincreases the PTB7 donor crystallinity using DPE and enhances the PC 70 BM dispersionusing DIO. This amended aggregation results in a better donor/acceptor phase separation.We show that the improved crystallization and face-on orientation preference of PTB7contributes to higher light absorption and charge transport efficiency in the active layer.Moreover; a better D/A phase separation provides more efficient charge extraction andsuppresses the charge recombination; leading to an improved FF> 70%.,Solar RRL,*,*

Neighbor-based Data Weight Collaborative Filtering,Xuesong Yin; Jie Yu; Rongrong Jiang,Abstract: Existing Collaborative Filtering (CF) based recommendation approaches sufferfrom the following issues:(1) the number of resources accessed and evaluated by each useris only such a very small part that leads to sparse rating matrix;(2) dynamic change of userinterest makes recommended resources largely deviate from the need of the user. Toaddress these problems; we develop a novel algorithm titled as neighborbased data weightCF recommendation of learning resources (NARR). Firstly; the neighbor of the user or theneighbor of the resource is selected in terms of the rating matrix; secondly; we compute dataweight for representing dynamic change of user interest; finally; we use neighborrelationship and data weight in the objective of CF-based algorithm to choose learningresources.

Field-effect mobility; sub-threshold slope; andthreshold voltage of FETs are the main parameters that need to be characterized to designcircuits made of amorphous oxide semiconductors. Just as important as these characteristicsis the endurance of FETs over repeated switching cycles; which determines the reliability ofthe transistors. In this study we test the stability of FETs that have a polymer dielectric;parylene; and an oxide semiconductor (ZnO: In2O3). The devices are processedlithographically at low temperatures (T≤ 100 ºC).

Molecular Dynamics simulation of cascades in Fe-0.1% He steel with various empirical interatomic potentials,R Schaeublin; G Yu; J Yu; G Lucas,Full text of publication follows: Helium in the ferritic/martensitic steels foreseen for the futurefusion reactor is an important issue to address as it degrades their mechanical properties.Because of the extremely low solubility of helium in materials; helium atoms tend to clusterwith vacancies in bubbles or to be trapped at defects such as interstitials; dislocations andgrain boundaries; and may promote the formation of voids. The effect of He on subsequentdamage produced by the 14 MeV fusion neutron in pure Fe is investigated by moleculardynamics simulation; as a model for ferritic/martensitic steels; with various empiricalinteratomic potentials. Cascade energies range from 1 to 20 keV and temperatures from 10to 523 K. The resulting number of point defects; clusters of those and their size; and the ratioof helium to self point defects in the clusters are assessed. In a previous study [1] we have …,*,*,*
Slow down density of recoils produced by 14 MeV neutron in LiD,J Yu; J Fikar; R Schaeublin,Full text of publication follows: The slow down density of recoils produced by 14 MeVneutron in LiD is investigated. Of particular interest are the deuterium (D) recoils in theenergy range of 0.1 to 12.444 MeV to bombard the tritium in LiD to induce the fusionreaction. The Deuteron recoil density is the key issue to evaluate whether the fusion reactionrate reaches saturation at the tritium (T) concentration∼ 0.5 x10 22 Tcm-3 in LiD with certaintritium production rate. The slow down density by internal irradiation and the thermaldisplacement mode in LiD is calculated with the Marlowe code. LiD is considered to have abody centre cubic lattice.

Increasing Online Interactivity through the Use of a Database-Driven Lesson,Leaunda S Hemphill; Jing Yu,A common complaint about moving from face-to-face to online instruction is that the latter isnot as engaging and interactive. Online instruction is often static pages where learnerssimply scroll through text-based information. Course design strategies need to be used thattake advantage of the unique technologies available in a distance learning environment.One way to increase student interest and engagement is to use databases to drive theonline instruction (McNeil & Robin; 2000). With a database-driven website; content isentered into a database and connected to a Web server that pulls the information from thedatabase to display on the screen (O'Malley; 2001). Database-driven interaction allowsexchange of text; discussions; and other technologies (Roblyer & Ekhaml; 2000) and can bestored for later use by the instructor to assess student progress; plan new lessons; and …,*,*,*

Synthesis; in vitro and in vivo characterization of rhenium tricarbonyl complexes with different bifunctional tridentate ligands,JY Xia; YX Wang; Sh Q Li; JF Yu; L Tang; DZ Yin,Discovery of new chelating ligands that bind technetium/rhenium strongly is a priority in thequest toward the design and development of site specific radiopharmaceuticals. The currentstudy on the application of Tc/Re carbonyls in radiopharmaceuticals has been focused onthe utility of specific tridentate ligand systems for achieving kinetic inertness and in vivostability. In this paper;(Bis (2-pyridylmethyl)-amino)-ethylamine (1)(Fig. 1);(Bis (2-pyridylmethyl)-amino)-acetic acid (2)(Fig. 1); L (6-amino-hexyl)-pyridyl-2-methyl-amino-acetic acid (3)(Fig. 2); and picolylamine diacetic acid (4)(Fig. 3) that possessed an NNN;NNO and NOO donor atom sets were synthesized; which can be a good selection for theserequirements. The Re (I)-complexes of above four ligands were prepared in good yield with[NEt 4] 2 [ReBr 3 (CO) 3] in water at 75 degree C for 3 h. The complexes were …,*,*,*
Genetic Mechanisms of Genome Changes,Jinyu Wang; Xianran Li; Yanhai Yin; Jianming Yu,Page 1. Genetic Mechanisms of Genome Changes Jinyu Wang 1 ; Xianran Li 1 ; Yanhai Yin 2and Jianming Yu 1 1 Department of Agronomy; 2 Department of Genetics; Development; and CellBiology; Iowa State University; Ames; IA Progress of sequencing technologies has generated ahuge amount of genomic sequences; which provide a great opportunity to address fundamentalquestions about the genome itself. By investigating the Base Composition across SNPs (BCS)within species; our research group has discovered a conserved pattern of BCS among individuals;ie; modern crops all have significantly higher [AT] value than their ancestors. This consistent patternacross multiple species implies BCS is an ideal indicator of genome changes accumulated throughevolution. We hypothesize that the genome divergence is under genetic control.

However; the prevalence of myopia in Chinesechildren increased remarkably in recent years. 3-5 Therefore; the efficacy of Chinese eyeexercise on preventing myopia or alleviating visual fatigue is widely questioned. Evidencefrom clinical trials of high level is needed to clarify that whether Chinese eye exercise iseffective in slowing and preventing myopia progression; or at least in part in easing the …,*,*,*

SIMILARITY COMPUTATION FOR LARGE SCALE SCIENTIFIC DATA SELECTION,Jiangfeng Chen; Jianjun Yu,ABSTRACT Large scale scientific data discovery and selection has recently drawnincreasing attention in the data mining research community. Scientific data selection refersto determine a subset of data to orchestrate a composite resource for a specific task; or toreplace an awkward data service with a similar one that has better QoS. For data selection;one of the popular approaches is to compute the similarity between data set and apply textcategorization algorithm like KNN (K-Nearest Neighbour) to classify them. In this paper; wedescribe a dynamic scientific data selection framework based on similarity computation.Three kinds of data information; such as textual; semantic and structural information; aremodeled to compute data set similarity. The experiment results showed that our frameworkachieved considerable performance on precision metric for dynamic large scale scientific …,*,*,*

Statistical mapping of auditory activity by Manganese-enhanced MRI,X Yu; D Sanes; J Zou; Y Zaim Wadghiri; D Turnbull,Methods The MEMRI protocol is similar to previously described [1]. Briefly; mice wereinjected IP with 0.4 mmole/kg body weight of MnCl2 in saline at postnatal 19 to 21 days;exposed to 24 hr of defined sound stimulation; and then anesthetized with isoflurane (1-1.5% in air) during MRI. Three pure tones (4; 16 and 40 kHz) were used with amplitudemodulated between 65 and 89 dB. To detect the amplitude sensitive neurons; we alsoexposed mice with 40 kHz pure tone at different amplitudes (65; 77 and 89dB Peak).Normally behaving mice were maintained in a free field inside an acoustic isolation chamberduring sound exposure (Mac-1; Industrial Acoustics). MRI was performed on a SMIS consoleinterfaced to a 7T horizontal bore magnet with 250-mT/m actively shielded gradients(Magnex); using a custom mouse head holder and volume coil.

Mn-Enhanced MRI of the Neonatal Mouse Brain,Y Zaim Wadghiri; C Moreno; X Yu; AL Joyner; DH Turnbull,Synopsis Manganese (Mn)-Enhanced MRI (MEMRI) has recently been shown to selectivelyenhance a number of adult mouse brain regions following subcutaneous injection of MnCl2.We tested the sensitivity of a similar MEMRI approach in the early postnatal mouse brain.Postnatal day 1-10 (P1-P10) mice were injected intra-peritoneally with MnCl2; and imagedafter 24-h with 3D T1-weighted spin echo MRI. Compared to previous results in adult mice;we observed maximum MEMRI enhancement in the cerebellum and hippocampus; but notin olfactory bulb or midbrain. MEMRI provides a new approach to image the developingcerebellar foliation patterns in the neonatal mouse.,*,*,*

PBiTree Coding and Efficient Processing of Containment Joins,Wei Wang Haifeng Jiang Hongjun Lu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract This paper addresses issues related to containment join processing in tree-structured data such as XML documents. A containment join takes two sets of XML nodeelements as input and returns pairs of elements such that the containment relationship holdsbetween them. While there are previous algorithms for processing containment joins; theyrequire both element sets either sorted or indexed. This paper proposes a novel andcomplete containment query processing framework based on a new coding scheme;PBiTree code. The PBiTree code allows us to determine the ancestor-descendantrelationship between two elements from their PBiTree-based codes efficiently. We presentalgorithms in the framework that are optimized for various combinations of settings. Inparticular; the newly proposed partitioning based algorithms can process containment …,*,*,*

Without the uniqueness assumption onobserved data elements; many conventional aggregates computation problems need to befurther investigated due to their duplication sensitive nature. In this paper; we present novel;space-efficient; one-scan algorithms to continuously maintain duplicate insensitive ordersketches so that rank-based queries can be approximately processed with a relative rankerror guarantee ǫ in the presence of data duplicates. Besides the space efficiency; theproposed algorithms are time-efficient and highly accurate. Moreover; our techniques maybe immediately applied to the heavy hitter problem against distinct elements and to theexisting fault-tolerant distributed communication techniques.

Intelligent Informatics,Gabriel Pui Cheong Fung; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hongjun Lu; Wei Lai; Xiaodi Huang; Ronald Wibowo; Jiro Tanaka; Jie Lu; Guangquan Zhang; Fengjie Wu,Abstract—Mining textual documents and time series concur-rently; such as predicting themovements of stock prices based on the contents of the news stories; is an emerging topic indata mining community. Previous researches have shown that there is a strong relationshipbetween the time when the news stories are released and the time when the stock pricesfluctuate. In this paper; we propose a systematic framework for predicting the tertiarymovements of stock prices by analyzing the impacts of the news stories on the stocks. To bemore specific; we investigate the immediate impacts of news stories on the stocks based onthe Efficient Markets Hypothesis. Several data mining and text mining techniques are usedin a novel way. Extensive experiments using real-life data are conducted; and encouragingresults are obtained.,*,*,*

Leadership Ranking: Bringing Order to Correlated Time Series,Di Wu; Yiping Ke; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Philip S Yu; Lei Chen,Data streams have emerged as an important research area in recent years due to itsubiquitous presence in various application domains including stock market analysis infinance. Therefore; it has become increasingly demanding to develop efficient techniques todiscover useful patterns from such data streams. Among many issues; analyzing thecorrelation between two data streams is an important technique to study linear co-movements of two data streams [11; 9]. Yet; lagged correlation further captures lagged co-movements between time-evolving streams [4; 6]; which is especially useful for forecastingand monitoring. In empirical finance; the statistics (eg; price; return; volatility) of a securitymay exhibit a lead-lag effect on those of other securities [7]. This information can be used topredict the trends of the led securities. Although the lagged correlation between a pair of …,*,*,*

Multi Reachability Query Processing,Jiefeng Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Bolin Ding,Abstract. There is a need to efficiently navigate on a large graph to find a certain piece ofinformation by some structure constraints. Reachability query could be the main means forsuch a purpose and existing approaches studied an efficient primitive called reachabilityjoin. In this paper; we focus on processing the query containing multi reachability joins (R-joins). We studied the processing ability of the up-to-date alternative that extended thewellknown tree-specific method; namely; twig-stack join algorithm; to be applicable onDAGs. Due to the rapid increasing of the transitive closure size for graphs in stead of trees;however; we found the proposed dynamic programming approach that combines R-joinprimitives into an optimized plan based on cost tends to be superior over the alternative andmore stable in terms of the density of the underneath DAGs than the alternative …,*,*,*

Safe Query Languages for Constraint Databases With Complex Values,Hong-Cheu Liu; X Yu Jeffrey,Database Management Systems are being widely used to support new applications such asengineering design; image or voice data management and spatial information systems. Inorder to model applications involving spatial and/or temporal data; it is necessary to store indatabases infinite collections of items and to evaluate queries on such infinite collections.Spatial data or temporal information and the constraint paradigm have a fundamentalcommonality. Constraints can be geometrically viewed as a set of points in multidimensionalspace that satisfy such constraints. In many applications; spatial or temporal objects aremore intuitively described as constraints. Therefore; constraints can serve as a unifyingparadigm for conceptual representation of spatial or temporal data. In this paper; we focuson the constraint data model and constraint query languages.
