Efficient algorithms for computing Reeb graphs,Harish Doraiswamy; Vijay Natarajan,Abstract The Reeb graph tracks topology changes in level sets of a scalar function and findsapplications in scientific visualization and geometric modeling. We describe an algorithmthat constructs the Reeb graph of a Morse function defined on a 3-manifold. Our algorithmmaintains connected components of the two dimensional levels sets as a dynamic graphand constructs the Reeb graph in O (n log n+ n log g (log log g) 3) time; where n is thenumber of triangles in the tetrahedral mesh representing the 3-manifold and g is themaximum genus over all level sets of the function. We extend this algorithm to constructReeb graphs of d-manifolds in O (n log n (log log n) 3) time; where n is the number oftriangles in the simplicial complex that represents the d-manifold. Our result is a significantimprovement over the previously known O (n 2) algorithm. Finally; we present …,Computational Geometry,2009,67
Identifying robust plans through plan diagram reduction,D Harish; Pooja N Darera; Jayant R Haritsa,Abstract Estimates of predicate selectivities by database query optimizers often differsignificantly from those actually encountered during query execution; leading to poor planchoices and inflated response times. In this paper; we investigate mitigating this problem byreplacing selectivity error-sensitive plan choices with alternative plans that provide robustperformance. Our approach is based on the recent observation that even the complex anddense" plan diagrams" associated with industrial-strength optimizers can be efficientlyreduced to" anorexic" equivalents featuring only a few plans; without materially impactingquery processing quality. Extensive experimentation with a rich set of TPC-H and TPC-DS-based query templates in a variety of database environments indicate that plan diagramreduction typically retains plans that are substantially resistant to selectivity errors on the …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,58

Using topological analysis to support event-guided exploration in urban data,Harish Doraiswamy; Nivan Ferreira; Theodoros Damoulas; Juliana Freire; Cláudio T Silva,The explosion in the volume of data about urban environments has opened up opportunitiesto inform both policy and administration and thereby help governments improve the lives oftheir citizens; increase the efficiency of public services; and reduce the environmental harmsof development. However; cities are complex systems and exploring the data they generateis challenging. The interaction between the various components in a city creates complexdynamics where interesting facts occur at multiple scales; requiring users to inspect a largenumber of data slices over time and space. Manual exploration of these slices is ineffective;time consuming; and in many cases impractical. In this paper; we propose a technique thatsupports event-guided exploration of large; spatio-temporal urban data.

Computing Reeb graphs as a union of contour trees,Harish Doraiswamy; Vijay Natarajan,The Reeb graph of a scalar function tracks the evolution of the topology of its level sets. Thispaper describes a fast algorithm to compute the Reeb graph of a piecewise-linear (PL)function defined over manifolds and non-manifolds. The key idea in the proposed approachis to maximally leverage the efficient contour tree algorithm to compute the Reeb graph. Thealgorithm proceeds by dividing the input into a set of subvolumes that have loop-free Reebgraphs using the join tree of the scalar function and computes the Reeb graph by combiningthe contour trees of all the subvolumes. Since the key ingredient of this method is a series ofunion-find operations; the algorithm is fast in practice. Experimental results demonstrate thatit outperforms current generic algorithms by a factor of up to two orders of magnitude; andhas a performance on par with algorithms that are catered to restricted classes of input …,IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,2013,33
Efficiently approximating query optimizer plan diagrams,Atreyee Dey; Sourjya Bhaumik; Jayant R Haritsa,Abstract Given a parametrized n-dimensional SQL query template and a choice of queryoptimizer; a plan diagram is a color-coded pictorial enumeration of the execution planchoices of the optimizer over the query parameter space. These diagrams have proved to bea powerful metaphor for the analysis and redesign of modern optimizers; and are gainingcurrency in diverse industrial and academic institutions. However; their utility is adverselyimpacted by the impractically large computational overheads incurred when standard brute-force exhaustive approaches are used for producing fine-grained diagrams on high-dimensional query templates. In this paper; we investigate strategies for efficiently producingclose approximations to complex plan diagrams. Our techniques are customized to thefeatures available in the optimizer's API; ranging from the generic optimizers that provide …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,28
A hybrid parallel algorithm for computing and tracking level set topology,Senthilnathan Maadasamy; Harish Doraiswamy; Vijay Natarajan,The contour tree is a topological abstraction of a scalar field that captures evolution in levelset connectivity. It is an effective representation for visual exploration and analysis ofscientific data. We describe a work-efficient; output sensitive; and scalable parallel algorithmfor computing the contour tree of a scalar field defined on a domain that is represented usingeither an unstructured mesh or a structured grid. A hybrid implementation of the algorithmusing the GPU and multi-core CPU can compute the contour tree of an input containing 16million vertices in less than ten seconds with a speedup factor of upto 13. Experimentsbased on an implementation in a multi-core CPU environment show near-linear speedup forlarge data sets.,High Performance Computing (HiPC); 2012 19th International Conference on,2012,20
Output-sensitive construction of Reeb graphs,Harish Doraiswamy; Vijay Natarajan,The Reeb graph of a scalar function represents the evolution of the topology of its level sets.This paper describes a near-optimal output-sensitive algorithm for computing the Reebgraph of scalar functions defined over manifolds or non-manifolds in any dimension. Key tothe simplicity and efficiency of the algorithm is an alternate definition of the Reeb graph thatconsiders equivalence classes of level sets instead of individual level sets. The algorithmworks in two steps. The first step locates all critical points of the function in the domain.Critical points correspond to nodes in the Reeb graph. Arcs connecting the nodes arecomputed in the second step by a simple search procedure that works on a small subset ofthe domain that corresponds to a pair of critical points. The paper also describes a schemefor controlled simplification of the Reeb graph and two different graph layout schemes that …,IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,2012,18
Data polygamy: the many-many relationships among urban spatio-temporal data sets,Fernando Chirigati; Harish Doraiswamy; Theodoros Damoulas; Juliana Freire,Abstract The increasing ability to collect data from urban environments; coupled with a pushtowards openness by governments; has resulted in the availability of numerous spatio-temporal data sets covering diverse aspects of a city. Discovering relationships betweenthese data sets can produce new insights by enabling domain experts to not only test butalso generate hypotheses. However; discovering these relationships is difficult. First; arelationship between two data sets may occur only at certain locations and/or time periods.Second; the sheer number and size of the data sets; coupled with the diverse spatial andtemporal scales at which the data is available; presents computational challenges on allfronts; from indexing and querying to analyzing them. Finally; it is non-trivial to differentiatebetween meaningful and spurious relationships. To address these challenges; we …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,16
Efficient output-sensitive construction of Reeb graphs,Harish Doraiswamy; Vijay Natarajan,Abstract The Reeb graph tracks topology changes in level sets of a scalar function and findsapplications in scientific visualization and geometric modeling. This paper describes a near-optimal two-step algorithm that constructs the Reeb graph of a Morse function defined overmanifolds in any dimension. The algorithm first identifies the critical points of the inputmanifold; and then connects these critical points in the second step to obtain the Reebgraph. A simplification mechanism based on topological persistence aids in the removal ofnoise and unimportant features. A radial layout scheme results in a feature-directed drawingof the Reeb graph. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the Reeb graphconstruction in practice and its applications.,International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation,2008,16
An exploration framework to identify and track movement of cloud systems,Harish Doraiswamy; Vijay Natarajan; Ravi S Nanjundiah,We describe a framework to explore and visualize the movement of cloud systems. Usingtechniques from computational topology and computer vision; our framework allows the userto study this movement at various scales in space and time. Such movements could havelarge temporal and spatial scales such as the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO); which has aspatial scale ranging from 1000 km to 10000 km and time of oscillation of around 40 days.Embedded within these larger scale oscillations are a hierarchy of cloud clusters whichcould have smaller spatial and temporal scales such as the Nakazawa cloud clusters. Thesesmaller cloud clusters; while being part of the equatorial MJO; sometimes move at speedsdifferent from the larger scale and in a direction opposite to that of the MJO envelope.Hitherto; one could only speculate about such movements by selectively analysing data …,IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,2013,15
Urbane: A 3d framework to support data driven decision making in urban development,Nivan Ferreira; Marcos Lage; Harish Doraiswamy; Huy Vo; Luc Wilson; Heidi Werner; Muchan Park; Cláudio Silva,Architects working with developers and city planners typically rely on experience; precedentand data analyzed in isolation when making decisions that impact the character of a city.These decisions are critical in enabling vibrant; sustainable environments but must alsonegotiate a range of complex political and social forces. This requires those shaping thebuilt environment to balance maximizing the value of a new development with its impact onthe character of a neighborhood. As a result architects are focused on two issues throughoutthe decision making process: a) what defines the character of a neighborhood? and b) howwill a new development change its neighborhood? In the first; character can be influencedby a variety of factors and understanding the interplay between diverse data sets is crucial;including safety; transportation access; school quality and access to entertainment.

Topological saliency,Harish Doraiswamy; Nithin Shivashankar; Vijay Natarajan; Yusu Wang,Abstract Topological methods have been successfully used to identify features in scalarfields and to measure their importance. In this paper; we define a notion of topologicalsaliency that captures the relative importance of a topological feature with respect to otherfeatures in its local neighborhood. Features are identified by extreme points of an inputscalar field; and their importance measured by the so-called topological persistence.Computing the topological saliency of all features for varying neighborhood sizes results in asaliency plot that serves as a summary of relative importance of all topological features. Wedevelop a convenient tool for users to interactively select and inspect features using thesaliency plot. We demonstrate the use of topological saliency together with the richinformation encoded in the saliency plot in several applications; including key feature …,Computers & Graphics,2013,13
Exploring Traffic Dynamics in Urban Environments Using Vector‐Valued Functions,Jorge Poco; Harish Doraiswamy; Huy Vo; João LD Comba; Juliana Freire; Cláudio Silva,Abstract The traffic infrastructure greatly impacts the quality of life in urban environments. Tooptimize this infrastructure; engineers and decision makers need to explore traffic data. Indoing so; they face two important challenges: the sparseness of speed sensors that coveronly a limited number of road segments; and the complexity of traffic patterns they need toanalyze. In this paper we take a first step at addressing these challenges. We use New YorkCity (NYC) taxi trips as sensors to capture traffic information. While taxis provide substantialcoverage of the city; the data captured about taxi trips contain neither the location of taxis atfrequent intervals nor their routes. We propose an efficient traffic model to derive speed anddirection information from these data; and show that it provides reliable estimates. Usingthese estimates; we define a time-varying vector-valued function on a directed graph …,Computer Graphics Forum,2015,11
Urban pulse: Capturing the rhythm of cities,Fabio Miranda; Harish Doraiswamy; Marcos Lage; Kai Zhao; Bruno Gonçalves; Luc Wilson; Mondrian Hsieh; Cláudio T Silva,Cities are inherently dynamic. Interesting patterns of behavior typically manifest at severalkey areas of a city over multiple temporal resolutions. Studying these patterns can greatlyhelp a variety of experts ranging from city planners and architects to human behavioralexperts. Recent technological innovations have enabled the collection of enormousamounts of data that can help in these studies. However; techniques using these data setstypically focus on understanding the data in the context of the city; thus failing to capture thedynamic aspects of the city. The goal of this work is to instead understand the city in thecontext of multiple urban data sets. To do so; we define the concept of an “urban pulse”which captures the spatio-temporal activity in a city across multiple temporal resolutions. Theprominent pulses in a city are obtained using the topology of the data sets; and are …,IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,2017,9
Genotet: An interactive web-based visual exploration framework to support validation of gene regulatory networks,Bowen Yu; Harish Doraiswamy; Xi Chen; Emily Miraldi; Mario Luis Arrieta-Ortiz; Christoph Hafemeister; Aviv Madar; Richard Bonneau; Cláudio T Silva,Elucidation of transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) is a fundamental goal in biology;and one of the most important components of TRNs are transcription factors (TFs); proteinsthat specifically bind to gene promoter and enhancer regions to alter target gene expressionpatterns. Advances in genomic technologies as well as advances in computational biologyhave led to multiple large regulatory network models (directed networks) each with a largecorpus of supporting data and gene-annotation. There are multiple possible biologicalmotivations for exploring large regulatory network models; including: validating TF-targetgene relationships; figuring out co-regulation patterns; and exploring the coordination of cellprocesses in response to changes in cell state or environment.

Extraction of robust voids and pockets in proteins,Raghavendra Sridharamurthy; Talha Bin Masood; Harish Doraiswamy; Siddharth Patel; Raghavan Varadarajan; Vijay Natarajan,Abstract Voids and pockets in a protein; collectively called as cavities; refer to empty spacesthat are enclosed by the protein molecule. Existing methods to compute; measure; andvisualize the cavities in a protein molecule are sensitive to inaccuracies in the empiricallydetermined atomic radii. This paper presents a topological framework that enables robustcomputation and visualization of these structures. Given a fixed set of atoms; cavities arerepresented as subsets of the weighted Delaunay triangulation of atom centres. A novelnotion of (ε; π)-stable cavities helps identify cavities that are stable even after perturbing theatom radii by a small value. An efficient method is described to compute these stable cavitiesfor a given input pair of values (ε; π). This approach is used to identify potential pockets andchannels in protein structures.,*,2016,7
Topoangler: Interactive topology-based extraction of fishes,Alexander Bock; Harish Doraiswamy; Adam Summers; Cláudio Silva,We present TopoAngler; a visualization framework that enables an interactive user-guidedsegmentation of fishes contained in a micro-CT scan. The inherent noise in the CT scancoupled with the often disconnected (and sometimes broken) skeletal structure of fishesmakes an automatic segmentation of the volume impractical. To overcome this; ourframework combines techniques from computational topology with an interactive visualinterface; enabling the human-in-the-Ioop to effectively extract fishes from the volume. In thefirst step; the join tree of the input is used to create a hierarchical segmentation of thevolume. Through the use of linked views; the visual interface then allows users tointeractively explore this hierarchy; and gather parts of individual fishes into a coherent sub-volume; thus reconstructing entire fishes.

A GPU-based index to support interactive spatio-temporal queries over historical data,Harish Doraiswamy; Huy T Vo; Cláudio T Silva; Juliana Freire,There are increasing volumes of spatio-temporal data from various sources such as sensors;social networks and urban environments. Analysis of such data requires flexible explorationand visualizations; but queries that span multiple geographical regions over multiple timeslices are expensive to compute; making it challenging to attain interactive speeds for largedata sets. In this paper; we propose a new indexing scheme that makes use of modernGPUs to efficiently support spatio-temporal queries over point data. The index coversmultiple dimensions; thus allowing simultaneous filtering of spatial and temporal attributes. Ituses a block-based storage structure to speed up OLAP-type queries over historical data;and supports query processing over in-memory and disk-resident data.

Anonymizing NYC Taxi Data: Does It Matter?,Marie Douriez; Harish Doraiswamy; Juliana Freire; Cláudio T Silva,The widespread use of location-based services has led to an increasing availability oftrajectory data from urban environments. These data carry rich information that are useful forimproving cities through traffic management and city planning. Yet; it also containsinformation about individuals which can jeopardize their privacy. In this study; we work withthe New York City (NYC) taxi trips data set publicly released by the Taxi and LimousineCommission (TLC). This data set contains information about every taxi cab ride thathappened in NYC. A bad hashing of the medallion numbers (the ID corresponding to a taxi)allowed the recovery of all the medallion numbers and led to a privacy breach for the drivers;whose income could be easily extracted.

Riding from Urban Data to Insight Using New York City Taxis.,Juliana Freire; Cláudio T Silva; Huy T Vo; Harish Doraiswamy; Nivan Ferreira; Jorge Poco,Abstract About half of humanity lives in urban environments today and that number will growto 80% by the middle of this century. Cities are thus the loci of resource consumption; ofeconomic activity; and of innovation. Given our increasing ability to collect; transmit; store;and analyze data; there is a great opportunity to better understand cities; and enable them todeliver services efficiently and sustainably while keeping their citizens safe; healthy;prosperous; and well-informed. But making sense of all the data available is hard. Currently;urban data exploration is often limited to confirmatory analyses consisting of batch-orientedqueries and the exploration of well-defined questions over specific regions. The lack ofinteractivity makes this process both time-consuming and cumbersome. This problem iscompounded in the presence of big; multivariate spatio-temporal data; which is …,IEEE Data Eng.

Topology-based catalogue exploration framework for identifying view-enhanced tower designs,Harish Doraiswamy; Nivan Ferreira; Marcos Lage; Huy Vo; Luc Wilson; Heidi Werner; Muchan Park; Cláudio Silva,Abstract There is a growing expectation for high performance design in architecture whichnegotiates between the requirements of the client and the physical constraints of a buildingsite. Clients for building projects often challenge architects to maximize view quality since itcan significantly increase real estate value. To pursue this challenge; architects typicallymove through several design revision cycles to identify a set of design options which satisfythese view quality expectations in coordination with other goals of the project. However;reviewing a large quantity of design options within the practical time constraints ischallenging due to the limitations of existing tools for view performance evaluation. Thesechallenges include flexibility in the definition of view quality and the ability to handle theexpensive computation involved in assessing both the view quality and the exploration of …,ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG),2015,2
Using maximum topology matching to explore differences in species distribution models,Jorge Poco; Harish Doraiswamy; Marian Talbert; Jeffrey Morisette; Cláudio T Silva,Species distribution models (SDM) are used to help understand what drives the distributionof various plant and animal species. These models are typically high dimensional scalarfunctions; where the dimensions of the domain correspond to predictor variables of themodel algorithm. Understanding and exploring the differences between models helpecologists understand areas where their data or understanding of the system is incompleteand will help guide further investigation in these regions. These differences can alsoindicate an important source of model to model uncertainty. However; it is cumbersome andoften impractical to perform this analysis using existing tools; which allows for manualexploration of the models usually as 1-dimensional curves.

Using physically based rendering to benchmark structured light scanners,Esdras Medeiros; Harish Doraiswamy; Matthew Berger; Claudio T Silva,Abstract Structured light scanning is ubiquituous in 3D acquisition. It is capable of capturinghigh geometric detail at a low cost under a variety of challenging scene conditions. Recentmethods have demonstrated robustness in the presence of artifacts due to globalillumination; such as inter-reflections and sub-surface scattering; as well as imperfectionscaused by projector defocus. For comparing approaches; however; the quantitativeevaluation of structured lighting schemes is hindered by the challenges in obtaining groundtruth data; resulting in a poor understanding for these methods across a wide range ofshapes; materials; and lighting configurations.

Shadow Accrual Maps: Efficient Accumulation of City-Scale Shadows over Time,Fabio Miranda; Harish Doraiswamy; Marcos Lage; Luc Wilson; Mondrian Hsieh; Claudio T Silva,Large scale shadows from buildings in a city play an important role in determining theenvironmental quality of public spaces. They can be both beneficial; such as for pedestriansduring summer; and detrimental; by impacting vegetation and by blocking direct sunlight.Determining the effects of shadows requires the accumulation of shadows over time acrossdifferent periods in a year. In this paper; we propose a simple yet efficient class of approachthat uses the properties of sun movement to track the changing position of shadows within afixed time interval.

GPU Rasterization for Real-Time Spatial Aggregation over Arbitrary Polygons,Eleni Tzirita Zacharatou; Harish Doraiswamy; Anastasia Ailamaki; Claudio Silva; Juliana Freire,ABSTRACT Visual exploration of spatial data relies heavily on spatial aggregation queriesthat slice and summarize the data over different regions. These queries comprisecomputationally-intensive point-inpolygon tests that associate data points to polygonalregions; challenging the responsiveness of visualization tools. This challenge iscompounded by the sheer amounts of data; requiring a large number of such tests to beperformed. Traditional pre-aggregation approaches are unsuitable in this setting since theyfix the query constraints and support only rectangular regions. On the other hand; queryconstraints are defined interactively in visual analytics systems; and polygons can be ofarbitrary shapes.

Exploring Traffic Dynamics in Urban Environments Using Vector-Valued Functions,H Carr; KL Ma; G Santucci; Jorge Poco; Harish Doraiswamy; Huy T Vo; João LD Comba; Juliana Freire; Cláudio T Silva,Yen's ranking loopless shortest paths algorithm [Yen71] computes the k-shortest pathsbetween a source and destination in a graph for a given k. It inductively computes the ithshortest path between two nodes using the common subpaths of the (i− 1)-shortest paths.The algorithm uses the result of the shortest path as starting point; followed by a relaxationprocedure until the distance constraint is met. This algorithm can be used to compute theclosest path as follows: identify a set of k shortest paths; for a large enough k such that the kth shortest path is the closest path. Unfortunately; due to a grid-like structure of the roadnetwork in most part of NYC; the above algorithm doesn't work well. This is because it has tocompute and discard a lot of suboptimal paths. For example; Fig. 1 (b) illustrates the class ofpaths that Yen's algorithm produced for a taxi route shown in Fig. 1 (a). Note that the …,*,*,*
