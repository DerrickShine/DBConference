Twitterstand: news in tweets,Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Hanan Samet; Benjamin E Teitler; Michael D Lieberman; Jon Sperling,Abstract Twitter is an electronic medium that allows a large user populace to communicatewith each other simultaneously. Inherent to Twitter is an asymmetrical relationship betweenfriends and followers that provides an interesting social network like structure among theusers of Twitter. Twitter messages; called tweets; are restricted to 140 characters and thusare usually very focused. We investigate the use of Twitter to build a news processingsystem; called TwitterStand; from Twitter tweets. The idea is to capture tweets thatcorrespond to late breaking news. The result is analogous to a distributed news wire service.The difference is that the identities of the contributors/reporters are not known in advanceand there may be many of them. Furthermore; tweets are not sent according to a schedule:they occur as news is happening; and tend to be noisy while usually arriving at a high …,Proceedings of the 17th acm sigspatial international conference on advances in geographic information systems,2009,656
Scalable network distance browsing in spatial databases,Hanan Samet; Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Houman Alborzi,Abstract An algorithm is presented for finding the k nearest neighbors in a spatial network ina best-first manner using network distance. The algorithm is based on precomputing theshortest paths between all possible vertices in the network and then making use of anencoding that takes advantage of the fact that the shortest paths from vertex u to all of theremaining vertices can be decomposed into subsets based on the first edges on the shortestpaths to them from u. Thus; in the worst case; the amount of work depends on the number ofobjects that are examined and the number of links on the shortest paths to them from q;rather than depending on the number of vertices in the network. The amount of storagerequired to keep track of the subsets is reduced by taking advantage of their spatialcoherence which is captured by the aid of a shortest path quadtree. In particular …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,288
NewsStand: A new view on news,Benjamin E Teitler; Michael D Lieberman; Daniele Panozzo; Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Hanan Samet; Jon Sperling,Abstract News articles contain a wealth of implicit geographic content that if exposed toreaders improves understanding of today's news. However; most articles are not explicitlygeotagged with their geographic content; and few news aggregation systems expose thiscontent to users. A new system named NewsStand is presented that collects; analyzes; anddisplays news stories in a map interface; thus leveraging on their implicit geographiccontent. NewsStand monitors RSS feeds from thousands of online news sources andretrieves articles within minutes of publication. It then extracts geographic content fromarticles using a custom-built geotagger; and groups articles into story clusters using a fastonline clustering algorithm. By panning and zooming in NewsStand's map interface; userscan retrieve stories based on both topical significance and geographic region; and see …,Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGSPATIAL international conference on Advances in geographic information systems,2008,156
A fast all nearest neighbor algorithm for applications involving large point-clouds,Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Hanan Samet; Amitabh Varshney,Abstract Algorithms that use point-cloud models make heavy use of the neighborhoods ofthe points. These neighborhoods are used to compute the surface normals for each point;mollification; and noise removal. All of these primitive operations require the seeminglyrepetitive process of finding the k nearest neighbors (kNNs) of each point. These algorithmsare primarily designed to run in main memory. However; rapid advances in scanningtechnologies have made available point-cloud models that are too large to fit in the mainmemory of a computer. This calls for more efficient methods of computing the kNNs of alarge collection of points many of which are already in close proximity. A fast kNN algorithmis presented that makes use of the locality of successive points whose k nearest neighborsare sought to reduce significantly the time needed to compute the neighborhood needed …,Computers & Graphics,2007,130

Methods for retrievingand processing web documents; extracting and disambiguating georeferences; andidentifying geographic focus are described. A brief overview of STEWARD's queryingcapabilities; as well as the design of an intuitive user interface; are provided.

A fast similarity join algorithm using graphics processing units,Michael D Lieberman; Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Hanan Samet,A similarity join operation AB takes two sets of points A; B and a value¿ R; and outputs pairsof points pA; qB; such that the distance D (p; q)¿. Similarity joins find use in a variety of fields;such as clustering; text mining; and multimedia databases. A novel similarity join algorithmcalled LSS is presented that executes on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU); exploiting itsparallelism and high data throughput. As GPUs only allow simple data operations such asthe sorting and searching of arrays; LSS uses these two operations to cast a similarity joinoperation as a GPU sort-and-search problem. It first creates; on the fly; a set of space-fillingcurves on one of its input datasets; using a parallel GPU sort routine. Next; LSS processeseach point p of the other dataset in parallel. For each p; it searches an interval of one of thespace-filling curves guaranteed to contain all the pairs in which p participates. Using …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008.

Geotagging with local lexicons to build indexes for textually-specified spatial data,Michael D Lieberman; Hanan Samet; Jagan Sankaranarayanan,The successful execution of location-based and feature-based queries on spatial databasesrequires the construction of spatial indexes on the spatial attributes. This is not simple whenthe data is unstructured as is the case when the data is a collection of documents such asnews articles; which is the domain of discourse; where the spatial attribute consists of textthat can be (but is not required to be) interpreted as the names of locations. In other words;spatial data is specified using text (known as a toponym) instead of geometry; which meansthat there is some ambiguity involved. The process of identifying and disambiguatingreferences to geographic locations is known as geotagging and involves using acombination of internal document structure and external knowledge; including a document-independent model of the audience's vocabulary of geographic locations; termed its …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,108
Efficient query processing on spatial networks,Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Houman Alborzi; Hanan Samet,Abstract A framework for determining the shortest path and the distance between every pairof vertices on a spatial network is presented. The framework; termed SILC; uses pathcoherence between the shortest path and the spatial positions of vertices on the spatialnetwork; thereby; resulting in an encoding that is compact in representation and fast in pathand distance retrievals. Using this framework; a wide variety of spatial queries such asincremental nearest neighbor searches and spatial distance joins can be shown to work ondatasets of locations residing on a spatial network of sufficiently large size. The suggestedframework is suitable for both main memory and disk-resident datasets.,Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international workshop on Geographic information systems,2005,107
Path oracles for spatial networks,Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Hanan Samet; Houman Alborzi,Abstract The advent of location-based services has led to an increased demand forperforming operations on spatial networks in real time. The challenge lies in being able tocast operations on spatial networks in terms of relational operators so that they can beperformed in the context of a database. A linear-sized construct termed a path oracle isintroduced that compactly encodes the n 2 shortest paths between every pair of vertices in aspatial network having n vertices thereby reducing each of the paths to a single tuple in arelational database and enables finding shortest paths by repeated application of a singleSQL SELECT operator. The construction of the path oracle is based on the observedcoherence between the spatial positions of both source and destination vertices and theshortest paths between them which facilitates the aggregation of source and destination …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,94
Identification of live news events using Twitter,Alan Jackoway; Hanan Samet; Jagan Sankaranarayanan,Abstract Twitter presents a source of information that cannot easily be obtained anywhereelse. However; though many posts on Twitter reveal up-to-the-minute information aboutevents in the world or interesting sentiments; far more posts are of no interest to the generalaudience. A method to determine which Twitter users are posting reliable information andwhich posts are interesting is presented. Using this information a search through a large;online news corpus is conducted to discover future events before they occur along withinformation about the location of the event. These events can be identified with a highdegree of accuracy by verifying that an event found in one news article is found in othersimilar news articles; since any event interesting to a general audience will likely have morethan one news story written about it. Twitter posts near the time of the event can then be …,Proceedings of the 3rd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Location-Based Social Networks,2011,71
Query processing using distance oracles for spatial networks,Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Hanan Samet,The popularity of location-based services and the need to do real-time processing on themhas led to an interest in performing queries on transportation networks; such as findingshortest paths and finding nearest neighbors. The challenge here is that the efficientexecution of spatial operations usually involves the computation of distance along a spatialnetwork instead of" as the crow flies;" which is not simple. Techniques are described thatenable the determination of the network distance between any pair of points (ie; vertices)with as little as O (n) space rather than having to store the n 2 distances between all pairs.This is done by being willing to expend a bit more time to achieve this goal such as O (log n)instead of O (1); as well as by accepting an error ε in the accuracy of the distance that isprovided. The strategy that is adopted reduces the space requirements and is based on …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2010,61
Determining the spatial reader scopes of news sources using local lexicons,Gianluca Quercini; Hanan Samet; Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Michael D Lieberman,Abstract Information sources on the Internet (eg; Web versions of newspapers) usually havean implicit spatial reader scope; which is the geographical location for which the content hasbeen primarily produced. Knowledge of the spatial reader scope facilitates the constructionof a news search engine that provides readers a set of news sources relevant to the locationin which they are interested. In particular; it plays an important role in disambiguatingtoponyms (eg; textual specifications of geographical locations) in news articles; as theprocess of selecting an interpretation for the toponym often reduces to one of selecting aninterpretation that seems natural in the context of the spatial reader scope. The key todetermining the spatial reader scope of news sources is the notion of local lexicon; which fora location s is a set of concepts such as; but not limited to; names of people; landmarks …,proceedings of the 18th SIGSPATIAL international conference on advances in geographic information systems,2010,57
Distance oracles for spatial networks,Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Hanan Samet,The popularity of location-based services and the need to do real-time processing on themhas led to an interest in performing queries on transportation networks; such as findingshortest paths and finding nearest neighbors. The challenge is that these operations involvethe computation of distance along a spatial network rather than" as the crow flies." In manyapplications an estimate of the distance is sufficient; which can be achieved by use of anoracle. An approximate distance oracle is proposed for spatial networks that exploits thecoherence between the spatial position of vertices and the network distance between them.Using this observation; a distance oracle is introduced that is able to obtain the epsilon-approximate network distance between two vertices of the spatial network. The networkdistance between every pair of vertices in the spatial network is efficiently represented by …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,57
Geotagging: Using proximity; sibling; and prominence clues to understand comma groups,Michael D Lieberman; Hanan Samet; Jagan Sankaranayananan,Abstract Geotagging is the process of recognizing textual references to geographiclocations; known as toponyms; and resolving these references by assigning each lat/longvalues. Typical geotagging algorithms use a variety of heuristic evidence to select thecorrect interpretation for each toponym. A study is presented of one such heuristic whichaids in recognizing and resolving lists of toponyms; referred to as comma groups. Commagroups of toponyms are recognized and resolved by inferring the common threads that bindthem together; based on the toponyms' shared geographic attributes. Three such commonthreads are proposed and studied---population-based prominence; distance-basedproximity; and sibling relationships in a geographic hierarchy---and examples of each arenoted. In addition; measurements are made of these comma groups' usage and variety in …,Proceedings of the 6th Workshop on Geographic Information Retrieval,2010,53
Reading news with maps by exploiting spatial synonyms,Hanan Samet; Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Michael D Lieberman; Marco D Adelfio; Brendan C Fruin; Jack M Lotkowski; Daniele Panozzo; Jon Sperling; Benjamin E Teitler,NewsStand 46 is an example application of a general framework for enabling people to searchfor information with a map-query interface. As such; it is a variant of systems we have been developingfor the past 30 years at the University of Maryland that we call "spatial browsers;" as in Sametet al. 39 and Samet et al. 41 The advantage of the map-query interface is that a map; coupledwith the ability to vary the zoom level at which it is viewed; provides inherent granularity to a searchprocess that facilitates approximate search. This capability distinguishes it from prevalentkeyword-based conventional search methods that provide a limited facility for approximate searchesthat are realized primarily by permitting a match through a subset of the keywords. However;users often lack a firm grasp of which keyword to use; and would thus welcome the search toalso account for synonyms. For queries to spatially referenced data; termed "spatial …,Communications of the ACM,2014,52
MISO: souping up big data query processing with a multistore system,Jeff LeFevre; Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Hakan Hacigumus; Junichi Tatemura; Neoklis Polyzotis; Michael J Carey,Abstract Multistore systems utilize multiple distinct data stores such as Hadoop's HDFS andan RDBMS for query processing by allowing a query to access data and computation in bothstores. Current approaches to multistore query processing fail to achieve the full potentialbenefits of utilizing both systems due to the high cost of data movement and loadingbetween the stores. Tuning the physical design of a multistore; ie; deciding what dataresides in which store; can reduce the amount of data movement during query processing;which is crucial for good multistore performance. In this work; we provide what we believe tobe the first method to tune the physical design of a multistore system; by focusing on whichstore to place data. Our method; called MISO for MultISstore Online tuning; is adaptive;lightweight; and works in an online fashion utilizing only the by-products of query …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,50
Distance join queries on spatial networks,Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Houman Alborzi; Hanan Samet,Abstract The result of a distance join operation on two sets of objects R; S on a spatialnetwork G is a set P of object pairs pq; p É R; q É S such that the distance of an object pairpq is the shortest distance from p to q in G. Several variations to the distance join operationsuch as U n O rdered; I ncremental; topk; S emi-J oin impose additional constraints on thedistance between the object pairs in P; the ordering of object pairs in P; and on thecardinality of P. A distance join algorithm on spatial networks is proposed that works inconjunction with the SILC framework; which is a new approach to query processing onspatial networks. Experimental results demonstrate up to an order of magnitude speed upwhen compared with a prominent existing technique.,Proceedings of the 14th annual ACM international symposium on Advances in geographic information systems,2006,30
Spatio-textual spreadsheets: Geotagging via spatial coherence,Michael D Lieberman; Hanan Samet; Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Jon Sperling,Abstract The spatio-textual spreadsheet is a conventional spreadsheet where spatialattribute values are specified textually. Techniques are presented to automatically find thetextually-specified spatial attributes that are present in spreadsheets. Once the spatialattributes have been identified; an accurate translation of the values of the spatial attributesto their actual geographic locations is needed (known as geotagging). The key observationis that spreadsheets with spatial data exhibit spatial coherence---that is; cells with spatialdata that are nearby in the spreadsheet contain data that share spatial characteristics in thereal world. These techniques also allow richer search engine results by returning actualtuples from spreadsheets instead of simply links to the spreadsheets. Moreover; when thesearch key is a particular location; results in proximity to the query can be provided rather …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2009,19

Opportunistic physical design for big data analytics,Jeff LeFevre; Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Hakan Hacigumus; Junichi Tatemura; Neoklis Polyzotis; Michael J Carey,Abstract Big data analytical systems; such as MapReduce; perform aggressivematerialization of intermediate job results in order to support fault tolerance. When jobscorrespond to exploratory queries submitted by data analysts; these materializations yield alarge set of materialized views that we propose to treat as an opportunistic physical design.We present a semantic model for UDFs that enables effective reuse of views containingUDFs along with a rewrite algorithm that provably finds the minimum-cost rewrite undercertain assumptions.

Indexing methods for moving object databases: games and other applications,Hanan Samet; Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Michael Auerbach,Abstract Moving object databases arise in numerous applications such as traffic monitoring;crowd tracking; and games. They all require keeping track of objects that move and thus thedatabase of objects must be constantly updated. The cover fieldtree (more commonly knownas the loose quadtree and the loose octree; depending on the dimension of the underlyingspace) is designed to overcome the drawback of spatial data structures that associateobjects with their minimum enclosing quadtree (octree) cells which is that the size of thesecells depends more on the position of the objects and less on their size. In fact; the size ofthese cells may be as large as the entire space from which the objects are drawn. The loosequadtree (octree) overcomes this drawback by expanding the size of the space that isspanned by each quadtree (octree) cell c of width w by a cell expansion factor p (p> 0) so …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,15

These articles are then geotagged and clustered so that a setof locations are associated with a cluster and its associated images. For each of theselocations; the images are scored based on the terms associated with the location and theimage's caption. This work differs from traditional work in this area as all topic and locationextraction is automated without the need for user entered content or GPS coordinates.,Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2012,14
COSMOS: A platform for seamless mobile services in the cloud,Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Hakan Hacigumus; Junichi Tatemura,The mobility of today is defined by the multitude of apps; which while working in isolation;can achieve a variety of tasks for the mobile user. The mobility of tomorrow is envisioned asone where mobile apps work together by sharing information to create a seamless mobileexperience; where the focus is the mobility of the user but not the device. A Platform as aService (PaaS) system called COSMOS (stands for Clouddb for Seamless Mobile Services)is proposed to provide the necessary support for seamless mobility.

Roads Belong in Databases,Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Hanan Samet,Abstract The popularity of location-based services and the need to perform real-timeprocessing on them has led to an interest in queries on road networks; such as findingshortest paths and finding nearest neighbors. The challenge here is that the efficientexecution of operations usually involves the computation of distance along a spatial networkinstead of “as the crow flies;” which is not simple. This requires the precomputation of theshortest paths and network distance between every pair of points (ie; vertices) with as littlespace as possible rather than having to store the n 2 shortest paths and distances betweenall pairs. This problem is related to a 'holy grail'problem in databases of how to incorporateroad networks into relational databases.

PhotoStand: a map query interface for a database of news photos,Hanan Samet; Marco D Adelfio; Brendan C Fruin; Michael D Lieberman; Jagan Sankaranarayanan,Abstract PhotoStand enables the use of a map query interface to retrieve news photosassociated with news articles that are in turn associated with the principal locations that theymention collected as a result of monitoring the output of over 10;000 RSS news feeds; madeavailable within minutes of publication; and stored in a PostgreSQL database. The newsphotos are ranked according to their relevance to the clusters of news articles associatedwith locations at which they are displayed. This work differs from traditional work in this fieldas the associated locations and topics (by virtue of the cluster with which the articlescontaining the news photos are associated) are generated automatically without any humanintervention such as tagging; and that photos are retrieved by location instead of just bykeyword as is the case for many existing systems.

Images in news,Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Hanan Samet,A system; called News Stand; is introduced that automatically extracts images from newsarticles. The system takes RSS feeds of news article and applies an online clusteringalgorithm so that articles belonging to the same news topic can be associated with the samecluster. Using the feature vector associated with the cluster; the images from news articlesthat form the cluster are extracted. First; the caption text associated with each of the imagesembedded in the news article is determined. This is done by analyzing the structure of thenews article's HTML page. If the caption and feature vector of the cluster are found to containkeywords in common; then the image is added to an image repository. Additional meta-information are now associated with each image such as caption; cluster features; names ofpeople in the news article; etc. A very large repository containing more than 983k images …,Pattern Recognition (ICPR); 2010 20th International Conference on,2010,10

Enabling query processing on spatial networks,Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Houman Alborzi; Hanan Samet,Recently; we have witnessed the emergence of several web services1that enable users to posesimple spatial queries. However; the query result may not be of much practical use as the distancesprovided do not take into consideration the constraints imposed by the underlying roadnetwork. Query processing on spatial networks is considered computation- ally expensive andprocessing such queries in a realistic time frame remains a challenge. We recently proposedthe SILC framework [2]; a data structure that enables fast and efficient retrieval of the short- estpaths and distances between objects on a spatial network. We demonstrate a system (Figure1) that augments a general purpose spatial database with the SILC framework; thereby providingthe database with the necessary functionalities to perform spatial queries on spatialnetworks. The following are the unique contributions of our system.,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06. Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on,2006,8
A look into twitter hashtag discovery and generation,Eric Krokos; Hanan Samet; Jagan Sankaranarayanan,Abstract Twitter is a micro-blogging site that allows users and companies to post brief piecesof information called Tweets. Some of the tweets contain keywords such as Hashtagsdenoted with a#; essentially one word summaries of either the topic or emotion of the tweet.The goal of this paper is to examine an approach to perform hashtag discovery on Twitterposts that do not contain user labeled hashtags. The process described in this paper isgeared to be as automatic as possible; taking advantage of web information; sentimentanalysis; geographic location; basic filtering and classification processes; to generatehashtags for tweets.

SPDO: High-throughput road distance computations on spark using distance oracles,Shangfu Peng; Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Hanan Samet,In the past decades; shortest distance methods for road networks have been developed thatfocus on how to speed up the latency of a single source-target pair distance query. Largeanalytical applications on road networks including simulations (eg; evacuation planning);logistics; and transportation planning require methods that provide high throughput (ie;distance computations per second) and the ability to “scale out” by using large distributedcomputing clusters. A framework called SPDO is presented which implements an extremelyfast distributed algorithm for computing road network distance queries on Apache Spark.The approach extends our previous work of developing the ε-distance oracle which has nowbeen adapted to use Spark's resilient distributed dataset (RDD).

Exploiting opportunistic physical design in large-scale data analytics,Jeff LeFevre; Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Hakan Hacigumus; Junichi Tatemura; Neoklis Polyzotis; Michael J Carey,Abstract: Large-scale systems; such as MapReduce and Hadoop; perform aggressivematerialization of intermediate job results in order to support fault tolerance. When jobscorrespond to exploratory queries submitted by data analysts; these materializations yield alarge set of materialized views that typically capture common computation amongsuccessive queries from the same analyst; or even across queries of different analysts whotest similar hypotheses. We propose to treat these views as an opportunistic physical designand use them for the purpose of query optimization. We develop a novel query-rewritealgorithm that addresses the two main challenges in this context: how to search the largespace of rewrites; and how to reason about views that contain UDFs (a common feature inlarge-scale data analytics).

Cost exploration of data sharings in the cloud,Samer Al-Kiswany; Hakan Hacıgümüş; Ziyang Liu; Jagan Sankaranarayanan,Abstract Enabling data sharing among mobile apps hosted in the same cloud infrastructurecan provide a competitive advantage to the mobile apps by giving them access to richinformation as well as increasing the revenue for the cloud provider. We introduce a costingtool that allows application owners (ie; consumers) and the cloud service provider to assessthe cost of a desired data sharing. The costing tool enables the consumers to effectivelyexplore the cost space by choosing between alternative configurations of varying dataqualities; specified by the staleness and the accuracy of the data sharing. In other words;staleness and accuracy requirements on the data sharing are used as levers for controllingcosts. These capabilities are implemented in a What-if analysis tool; which has beenintegrated with a large data-sharing platform.

Data-driven decision making (DDD) leaves no part of the knowledge-driven enterpriseimmune to change as long as there is sufficient evidence in the data to support it. Organizationscollect data as logs which may have unknown value; so performing Extract-Transform-Load(ETL) is not feasible due to the high expense of ETL. ETL requires a formal process that is expensiveand requires knowledge apriori of what the data looks like and where the value resides. Logsare typically large; flat; and have low-structure adding to the complexity of ETL for typical databasesince this requires a database design with its structure completely pre-defined. For these reasonsmuch of the data is never evaluated thoroughly and data analysts are needed for …,*,2015,4
WeiboStand: capturing Chinese breaking news using Weibo tweets,Cheng Fu; Hanan Samet; Jagan Sankaranarayanan,Abstract Weibo is the premier microblog service in China; which is nicknamed as the"Chinese Twitter". Weibo messages consist of text messages; short links; images; audio andvideo. Its text is restricted to 140 Chinese characters. Since Twitter is blocked in themainland of China; Weibo is the dominant microblog service in China. The dominance ofWeibo in China makes it an obvious choice for capturing late breaking news. This paperdescribes the implementation of a system for capturing messages corresponding to latebreaking news as well as a visualization tool that can display Weibo news messages on amap interface. There are several technical challenges to building this system. First; methodsto automatically recognize and disambiguate geographical locations in messages written inChinese. Second; due to the lack of a free accessible real-time streaming API as that …,Proceedings of the 7th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Location-Based Social Networks,2014,4
Path oracles for spatial networks,*,One embodiment of the invention is directed to a method including constructing a path-distance oracle that provides both an intermediate vertex of a shortest path between twovertices in a spatial network and an approximate distance between the two vertices. Theconstructing comprises decomposing the spatial network into a set of path-coherent pairs(PCPs) that satisfy at least one predefined property.,*,2014,4
Max-margin clustering: Detecting margins from projections of points on lines,Raghuraman Gopalan; Jagan Sankaranarayanan,Given a unlabelled set of points X ϵ ℝ N belonging to k groups; we propose a method toidentify cluster assignments that provides maximum separating margin among the clusters.We address this problem by exploiting sparsity in data points inherent to margin regions;which a max-margin classifier would produce under a supervised setting to separate pointsbelonging to different groups. By analyzing the projections of X on the set of all possiblelines L in ℝ N; we first establish some basic results that are satisfied only by those lineintervals lying outside a cluster; under assumptions of linear separability of clusters andabsence of outliers. We then encode these results into a pair-wise similarity measure todetermine cluster assignments; where we accommodate non-linearly separable clustersusing the kernel trick. We validate our method on several UCI datasets and on some …,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR); 2011 IEEE Conference on,2011,4

Scalable query processing on spatial networks,Jagan Sankaranarayanan,Abstract Spatial networks (eg; road networks) are general graphs with spatial information(eg; latitude/longitude) information associated with the vertices and/or the edges of thegraph. Techniques are presented for query processing on spatial networks that are basedon the observed coherence between the spatial positions of the vertices and the shortestpaths between them. This facilitates aggregation of the vertices into coherent regions thatshare vertices on the shortest paths between them. Using this observation; a framework;termed SILC; is introduced that precomputes and compactly encodes the n 2 shortest pathand network distances between every pair of vertices on a spatial network containing nvertices. The compactness of the shortest paths from source vertex v is achieved bypartitioning the destination vertices into subsets based on the identity of the first edge to …,*,2008,3

Accessing diverse geo-referenced data sources with the SAND spatial DBMS,Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Egemen Tanin; Hanan Samet; Frantisek Brabec,Abstract The Internet has become the most frequently accessed medium for obtainingvarious types of data. In particular; government agencies; academic institutions; and privateenterprises have published gigabytes of geo-referenced data on the Web. However; toobtain geo-referenced data from the Web successfully; systems must be designed to becapable of understanding the data sets published in different data formats. Also; even if thedata sets are available in a simple known format; they often have poorly defined structures.With these issues in mind; we have developed an Internet-enabled data collection andconversion utility that interfaces with our prototype spatial database system; SAND. Usingthis utility; data can be retrieved from many different sources on the Web and converted intoa format understandable by the SAND spatial database management system.

SMILE: A Data Sharing Platform for Mobile Apps in the Cloud.,Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Hakan Hacigümüs; Haopeng Zhang; Mohamed Sarwat,ABSTRACT We identify an opportunity to share data among mobile apps hosted in thecloud; thus helping users improve their mobile experience; while resulting in cost savings forthe cloud provider. In this work; we propose a platform for sharing data among mobile appshosted in the cloud. A “sharing” is specified by a triple consisting of:(a) a set of data sourcesto be shared;(b) a set of specified transformations on the shared data; and (c) a staleness(freshness) requirement on the shared data. The platform addresses the following two mainchallenges: What sharings to admit into the system under a set of specified constraints; howto implement a sharing at a low cost while maintaining the desired level of staleness. Weshow that reductions in costs are achievable by exploiting the commonalities between thedifferent sharings in the platform. Experimental evaluation is performed with a cloud …,EDBT,2014,1
A platform for seamless context transfers in the mobile cloud,Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Hakan Hacıgümüş,Abstract Mobile users who are on-the-go frequently make use of a variety of apps in order toachieve a task. For example; even the simple task of planning an evening outing with adinner and a movie may involve the use of multiple apps such as maps; movie ticketreservation; restaurant booking; social networking; restaurant and movie reviews; and cabbooking. The most time consuming aspect of task completion for the mobile user is thefrequent context transfers that happens as the result of the user switching between apps.The current state of mobility offers little or no support for context transfers in that the newlyinvoked app is oblivious to the context in which it is invoked (ie; cold state) and it is largelyleft to the user to bring the app to the appropriate context (ie; warm state). We present ourdesign of a commercial platform for enabling seamless context transfers among the apps …,Proceedings of the 12th International ACM Workshop on Data Engineering for Wireless and Mobile Acess,2013,1
Importing abstract spatial data into the SAND database system,Hanan Samet; Frantisek Brabec; Jagan Sankaranarayanan,Abstract The World Wide Web has opened ways to operate large applications by users withsimple client platforms located half way around the world by connecting servers around theworld together. We present a system that makes a centrally stored spatial databaseavailable to off-site users. Regardless of the specific platform available to a user; all theyneed to do is simply establish a link between their client and the server. Unlike well-knownweb-based services such as MapQuest [2] that rely on computational power of the server;our system distributes the workload among the client and the server in such a manner thatthe user will observe the system as being interactive; with minimal delay between the useraction and appropriate response for most types of operations.,Proceedings of the 2004 annual national conference on Digital government research,2004,1
Measuring Spatial Influence of Twitter Users by Interactions,Hong Wei; Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Hanan Samet,Abstract The three ways of interactions in Twitter--retweet; reply; and mention--comprise of alatent dynamic information flow network between users; which can be utilized to determineinfluential users. This paper focuses on determining which Twitter users have greatinfluence on a query location Q in the sense that they are assumed to provide informationthat is of sufficient interest to prompt people at Q to interact with them. Note that an influentialTwitter user who is of great influence on Q may not be necessarily from Q. Therefore; we firstdefine generalized influential Twitter users regardless of whether their location was knownor not; meaning that such generalized influencers on Q can be either from inside Q; oroutside Q; or even unknown. A more interesting subset of generalized influencers is theones whose location is in Q; and termed as local influential Twitter users.

Finding and Tracking Local Twitter Users for News Detection,Hong Wei; Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Hanan Samet,ABSTRACT The popular micro-blogging service; Twitter; hides invaluable information aboutreal world events. Extracting such information; especially local news; exerts a measure ofinfluence over various applications such as situation awareness and disaster recovery.Detecting small; local news is very challenging; however; due to the sparsity of publiclyavailable Tweets on a specific area. In this work; we present a Twitter user-based method tomitigate the data sparsity. In essence; for a given geographical area; we aim to find as manyTwitter users as possible from it and then track their posts to monitor the news happening inthat area. However; only a small fraction of Twitter users provide information about theirlocation; making the location information for most of Twitter users not available. Therefore;we utilize a geotagging procedure to estimate location for unknown-location Twitter users …,*,2017,*

Determining the Spatial Reader Scopes of News Sources Using Local Lexicons,Gianluca Quercini Hanan Samet Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Michael D Lieberman,ABSTRACT Information sources on the Internet (eg web versions of newspapers) usuallyhave an implicit spatial reader scope; termed the audience location which is thegeographical location for which the content has been primarily produced. Knowledge of thespatial reader scope facilitates the construction of a news search engine that providesreaders a set of news sources relevant to the location in which they are interested. Inparticular; it plays an important role in disambiguating toponyms (eg textual specifications ofgeographical locations) in news articles; as the process of selecting an interpretation for thetoponym often reduces to one of selecting an interpretation that seems natural to thosefamiliar with the audience location. The key to determining the spatial reader scope of newssources is the notion of local lexicon; which for a location s is a set of concepts such as …,*,2010,*

Spatial Spreadsheets and Browsers: Sand Internet Browser,Hanan Samet; Houman Alborzi; František Brabec; Frank Morgan; Jagan Sankaranarayanan; Egemen Tanin; Claudio Esperança,Issues that concern the browsing of spatial and nonspatial data typical of geographicalinformation systems (GIS) in a distributed DBMS environment are being investigated. Theseissues include techniques for storage and retrieval of large volumes of vector and rasterdata; their transmission and presentation at multiple resolution levels; query optimizationparadigms which favor incremental (pipelined) evaluation plans; and interoperability. Themain goal of this project is to make possible for client applications to browse vast amounts ofspatial and non-spatial data over a local and/or wide area network at truly interactive rates.The peer-to-peer networking approach as well as the more general client-server approach isbeing considered. We also focus on interaction paradigms that make it unnecessary to resortto conventional query languages such as SQL (although our graphical query paradigm …,*,*,*
Max-margin Clustering: Detecting Margins from Projections of Points on Lines-Supplementary material,Raghuraman Gopalan; Jagan Sankaranarayanan,We provide the results of clustering accuracy for our method across different kernelparameter sets; for cases where the exact number of clusters k is unknown in Table 1. Weused a range of values of k from the minimum to maximum number of clusters in thosedatasets. For synthetic data; 2≤ k≤ 10; for comparison with max-margin clustering methods[1]; 2≤ k≤ 9; and for comparison with discriminative clustering methods [3]; 2≤ k≤ 15. Forcomparisons on real data with maximum margin clustering; only linear kernel was used (inline with the experimental setup of [1]). Clustering accuracy was calculated using thefollowing standard strategy (eg [2]): having access to the true 'labels' of points; we label eachof the resulting clusters with their majority representative label; and count the number ofcorrect classifications made for all clusters.
