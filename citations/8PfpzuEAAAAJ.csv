GLADE: big data analytics made easy,Yu Cheng; Chengjie Qin; Florin Rusu,Abstract We present GLADE; a scalable distributed system for large scale data analytics.GLADE takes analytical functions expressed through the User-Defined Aggregate (UDA)interface and executes them efficiently on the input data. The entire computation isencapsulated in a single class which requires the definition of four methods. The runtimetakes the user code and executes it right near the data by taking full advantage of theparallelism available inside a single machine as well as across a cluster of computingnodes. The demonstration has two goals. First; it presents the architecture of GLADE andhow processing is done by using a series of analytical functions. Second; it comparesGLADE with two different classes of systems for data analytics: a relational database(PostgreSQL) enhanced with UDAs and Map-Reduce (Hadoop). We show how the …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,54
Statistical analysis of sketch estimators,Florin Rusu; Alin Dobra,Abstract Sketching techniques can provide approximate answers to aggregate querieseither for data-streaming or distributed computation. Small space summaries that havelinearity properties are required for both types of applications. The prevalent method foranalyzing sketches uses moment analysis and distribution independent bounds based onmoments. This method produces clean; easy to interpret; theoretical bounds that areespecially useful for deriving asymptotic results. However; the theoretical bounds obscurefine details of the behavior of various sketches and they are mostly not indicative of whichtype of sketches should be used in practice. Moreover; no significant empirical comparisonbetween various sketching techniques has been published; which makes the choice evenharder.

GLADE: a scalable framework for efficient analytics,Florin Rusu; Alin Dobra,Abstract In this paper we introduce GLADE; a scalable distributed framework for large scaledata analytics. GLADE consists of a simple user-interface to define Generalized LinearAggregates (GLA); the fundamental abstraction at the core of GLADE; and a distributedruntime environment that executes GLAs by using parallelism extensively. GLAs are derivedfrom User-Defined Aggregates (UDA); a relational database extension that allows the userto add specialized aggregates to be executed inside the query processor. GLAs extend theUDA interface with methods to Serialize/Deserialize the state of the aggregate required fordistributed computation. As a significant departure from UDAs which can be invoked onlythrough SQL; GLAs give the user direct access to the state of the aggregate; thus allowingfor the computation of significantly more complex aggregate functions.,ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review,2012,31

Turbo-charging estimate convergence in dbo,Alin Dobra; Chris Jermaine; Florin Rusu; Fei Xu,Abstract DBO is a database system that utilizes randomized algorithms to give statisticallymeaningful estimates for the final answer to a multi-table; disk-based query from start tofinish during query execution. However; DBO's" time'til utility"(or" TTU"; that is; the time untilDBO can give a useful estimate) can be overly large; particularly in the case that manydatabase tables are joined in a query; or in the case that a join query includes a veryselective predicate on one or more of the tables; or when the data are skewed. In this paper;we describe Turbo DBO; which is a prototype database system that can answer multi-tablejoin queries in a scalable fashion; just like DBO. However; Turbo DBO often has a muchlower TTU than DBO. The key innovation of Turbo DBO is that it makes use of novelalgorithms that look for and remember" partial match" tuples in a randomized fashion …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,27
Parallel in-situ data processing with speculative loading,Yu Cheng; Florin Rusu,Abstract Traditional databases incur a significant data-to-query delay due to the requirementto load data inside the system before querying. Since this is not acceptable in many domainsgenerating massive amounts of raw data; eg; genomics; databases are entirely discarded.External tables; on the other hand; provide instant SQL querying over raw files. Theirperformance across a query workload is limited though by the speed of repeated full scans;tokenizing; and parsing of the entire file. In this paper; we propose SCANRAW; a noveldatabase physical operator for in-situ processing over raw files that integrates data loadingand external tables seamlessly while preserving their advantages: optimal performanceacross a query workload and zero time-to-query. Our major contribution is a parallel super-scalar pipeline implementation that allows SCANRAW to take advantage of the current …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,24
PF-OLA: a high-performance framework for parallel online aggregation,Chengjie Qin; Florin Rusu,Abstract Online aggregation provides estimates to the final result of a computation during theactual processing. The user can stop the computation as soon as the estimate is accurateenough; typically early in the execution. This allows for the interactive data exploration of thelargest datasets. In this paper we introduce the first framework for parallel onlineaggregation in which the estimation virtually does not incur any overhead on top of theactual execution. We define a generic interface to express any estimation model thatabstracts completely the execution details. We design a novel estimator specifically targetedat parallel online aggregation. When executed by the framework over a massive 8 TB TPC-Hinstance; the estimator provides accurate confidence bounds early in the execution evenwhen the cardinality of the final result is seven orders of magnitude smaller than the …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2014,23
Sketching sampled data streams,Florin Rusu; Alin Dobra,Sampling is used as a universal method to reduce the running time of computations--thecomputation is performed on a much smaller sample and then the result is scaled tocompensate for the difference in size. Sketches are a popular approximation method for datastreams and they proved to be useful for estimating frequency moments and aggregatesover joins. A possibility to further improve the time performance of sketches is to compute thesketch over a sample of the stream rather than the entire data stream. In this paper weanalyze the behavior of the sketch estimator when computed over a sample of the stream;not the entire data stream; for the size of join and the self-join size problems. Our analysis isdeveloped for a generic sampling process. We instantiate the results of the analysis for allthree major types of sampling--Bernoulli sampling which is used for load shedding …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09.

A Survey on Array Storage; Query Languages; and Systems,Florin Rusu; Yu Cheng,Abstract: Since scientific investigation is one of the most important providers of massiveamounts of ordered data; there is a renewed interest in array data processing in the contextof Big Data. To the best of our knowledge; a unified resource that summarizes and analyzesarray processing research over its long existence is currently missing. In this survey; weprovide a guide for past; present; and future research in array processing. The survey isorganized along three main topics. Array storage discusses all the aspects related to arraypartitioning into chunks. The identification of a reduced set of array operators to form thefoundation for an array query language is analyzed across multiple such proposals. Lastly;we survey real systems for array processing. The result is a thorough survey on array datastorage and processing that should be consulted by anyone interested in this research …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1302.0103,2013,18
The dbo database system,Florin Rusu; Fei Xu; Luis Leopoldo Perez; Mingxi Wu; Ravi Jampani; Chris Jermaine; Alin Dobra,Abstract We demonstrate our prototype of the DBO database system. DBO is designed tofacilitate scalable analytic processing over large data archives. DBO's analytic processingperformance is competitive with other database systems; however; unlike any other existingresearch or industrial system; DBO maintains a statistically meaningful guess to the finalanswer to a query from start to finish during query processing. This guess may be quiteaccurate after only a few seconds or minutes; while answering a query exactly may takehours. This can result in significant savings in both user and computer time; since a user canabort a query as soon as he or she is happy with the guess' accuracy.,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,17
Pseudo-random number generation for sketch-based estimations,Florin Rusu; Alin Dobra,Abstract The exact computation of aggregate queries; like the size of join of two relations;usually requires large amounts of memory (constrained in data-streaming) orcommunication (constrained in distributed computation) and large processing times. In thissituation; approximation techniques with provable guarantees; like sketches; are onepossible solution. The performance of sketches depends crucially on the ability to generateparticular pseudo-random numbers. In this article we investigate both theoretically andempirically the problem of generating k-wise independent pseudo-random numbers and; inparticular; that of generating 3-and 4-wise independent pseudo-random numbers that arefast range-summable (ie; they can be summed in sublinear time).

Speculative Approximations for Terascale Distributed Gradient Descent Optimization,Chengjie Qin; Florin Rusu,Abstract Model calibration is a major challenge faced by the plethora of statistical analyticspackages that are increasingly used in Big Data applications. Identifying the optimal modelparameters is a time-consuming process that has to be executed from scratch for everydataset/model combination even by experienced data scientists. We argue that theincapacity to evaluate multiple parameter configurations simultaneously and the lack ofsupport to quickly identify sub-optimal configurations are the principal causes. In this paper;we develop two database-inspired techniques for efficient model calibration. Speculativeparameter testing applies advanced parallel multi-query processing methods to evaluateseveral configurations concurrently.

Parallel online aggregation in action,Chengjie Qin; Florin Rusu,Abstract Online aggregation provides continuous estimates to the final result of acomputation during the actual processing.

In this demonstration; we introduce a generalframework for parallel online aggregation in which estimation does not incur overhead ontop of the actual processing. We define a generic interface to express any estimation modelthat abstracts completely the execution details. We design multiple sampling-basedestimators suited for parallel online aggregation and implement them inside the framework.Demonstration participants are shown how estimates to general SQL aggregation queriesover terabytes of TPC-H data are generated during the entire processing.

Astronomical data processing in extascid,Yu Cheng; Florin Rusu,Abstract Scientific data have dual structure. Raw data are preponderantly ordered multi-dimensional arrays or sequences while metadata and derived data are best represented asunordered relations. Scientific data processing requires complex operations over arrays andrelations. These operations cannot be expressed using only standard linear and relationalalgebra operators; respectively. Existing scientific data processing systems are designed fora single data model and handle complex processing at the application level. EXTASCID is acomplete and extensible system for scientific data processing. It supports both array andrelational data natively. Complex processing is handled by a metaoperator that can executeany user code. As a result; EXTASCID can process full scientific workflows inside thesystem; with minimal data movement and application code.

Formal representation of the SS-DB benchmark and experimental evaluation in EXTASCID,Yu Cheng; Florin Rusu,Abstract Evaluating the performance of scientific data processing systems is a difficult taskconsidering the plethora of application-specific solutions available in this landscape and thelack of a generally-accepted benchmark. The dual structure of scientific data coupled withthe complex nature of processing complicate the evaluation procedure further. SS-DB is thefirst attempt to define a general benchmark for complex scientific processing over raw andderived data. It fails to draw sufficient attention though because of the ambiguous plainlanguage specification and the extraordinary SciDB results. In this paper; we remedy theshortcomings of the original SS-DB specification by providing a formal representation interms of ArrayQL algebra operators and ArrayQL/SciQL constructs. These are the first formalrepresentations of the SS-DB benchmark. Starting from the formal representation; we give …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2015,9

Implementing the palomar transient factory real-time detection pipeline in GLADE: Results and observations,Florin Rusu; Peter Nugent; Kesheng Wu,Abstract Palomar Transient Factory is a comprehensive detection system for theidentification and classification of transient astrophysical objects. The central piece in theidentification pipeline is represented by an automated classifier that distinguishes betweenreal and bogus objects with high accuracy. Given that the classifier has to identify the mostsignificant transients out of a large number of candidates in near real-time; the responsetime it provides is of critical importance.

Similarity Join over Array Data,Weijie Zhao; Florin Rusu; Bin Dong; Kesheng Wu,Abstract Scientific applications are generating an ever-increasing volume of multi-dimensional data that are largely processed inside distributed array databases andframeworks. Similarity join is a fundamental operation across scientific workloads thatrequires complex processing over an unbounded number of pairs of multi-dimensionalpoints. In this paper; we introduce a novel distributed similarity join operator for multi-dimensional arrays. Unlike immediate extensions to array join and relational similarity join;the proposed operator minimizes the overall data transfer and network congestion whileproviding load-balancing; without completely repartitioning and replicating the input arrays.We define formally array similarity join and present the design; optimization strategies; andevaluation of the first array similarity join operator.,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,5

Scalable asynchronous gradient descent optimization for out-of-core models,Chengjie Qin; Martin Torres; Florin Rusu,Abstract Existing data analytics systems have approached predictive model trainingexclusively from a data-parallel perspective. Data examples are partitioned to multipleworkers and training is executed concurrently over different partitions; under varioussynchronization policies that emphasize speedup or convergence.

Many of these frameworks; eg;TensorFlow and BIDMach; implement their compute-intensive primitives in two flavors---asmulti-thread routines for multi-core CPUs and as highly-parallel kernels executed on GPU.Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the most popular optimization method for modeltraining implemented extensively on modern data analytics platforms. While the data-intensive properties of SGD are well-known; there is an intense debate on which of the manySGD variants is better in practice. In this paper; we perform a comprehensive study ofparallel SGD for training generalized linear models. We consider the impact of three factors--computing architecture (multi-core CPU or GPU); synchronous or asynchronous model …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.08800,2018,*

These" dirtyfireballs" would lack prompt GRB emission but could be pursued via their optical afterglow;appearing as transients that fade overnight. Here we report a search for such transients (thatfade by 5-σ in magnitude overnight) in four years of archival photometric data from theintermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF). Our search criteria yielded 50 candidates. Ofthese; two were afterglows to GRBs that had been found in dedicated follow-up observationsto triggers from the Fermi GRB Monitor. Another (iPTF14yb) was a GRB afterglow discoveredserendipitously. Eight were spurious artifacts of reference image subtraction; and one wasan asteroid.

Special issue on in-database analytics,Dan Olteanu; Florin Rusu,Recent years have witnessed a sustained effort towards big data analytics; such asregression; classification; and recommendation; on massive datasets of varied types andformats. Although most of the methods to perform these tasks have been studied before inmachine learning and data mining; scalability and generality have risen as primarychallenges not addressed before. As a result; many libraries; frameworks; and platformshave been recently developed to provide scalable support for distributed and parallelstatistical analytics. While mostly scalable; several of the newly proposed approaches fallshort on generality. In-database solutions seek to reuse and extend the query language andprocessing infrastructure of a database system with generic constructs and operatorsrequired to perform these considerably more complicated tasks. They are generic; but not …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2017,*
Bi-Level Online Aggregation on Raw Data,Yu Cheng; Weijie Zhao; Florin Rusu,In the era of data deluge; massive amounts of raw data are generated at an unprecedentedscale by mobile applications; sensors; and scientific experiments. The vast majority of theseread-only data are stored as application-specific files containing millions–if not billions–ofrecords. Data exploration is the initial step in extracting knowledge from these data.Aggregate statistics are computed in order to assess the quality of the raw data; before athorough investigation on transformed data is performed. The main goal of data explorationis to determine if the time-consuming data transformation and in-depth analysis arenecessary. Thus; data exploration does not have to be exact. As long as accurate estimatesthat guide the decision process are generated; its goal is achieved. This allows for anextensive set of optimization strategies that reduce I/O and CPU utilization to be …,Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2017,*
ArrayUDF: User-Defined Scientific Data Analysis on Arrays,Bin Dong; Kesheng Wu; Surendra Byna; Jialin Liu; Weijie Zhao; Florin Rusu,Abstract User-Defined Functions (UDF) allow application programmers to specify analysisoperations on data; while leaving the data management tasks to the system. This generalapproach enables numerous custom analysis functions and is at the heart of the modern BigData systems. Even though the UDF mechanism can theoretically support arbitraryoperations; a wide variety of common operations--such as computing the moving average ofa time series; the vorticity of a fluid flow; etc.;--are hard to express and slow to execute. Sincethese operations are traditionally performed on multi-dimensional arrays; we propose toextend the expressiveness of structural locality for supporting UDF operations on arrays. Wefurther propose an in situ UDF mechanism; called ArrayUDF; to implement the structurallocality. ArrayUDF allows users to define computations on adjacent array cells without the …,Proceedings of the 26th International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing,2017,*
Incremental View Maintenance over Array Data,Weijie Zhao; Florin Rusu; Bin Dong; Kesheng Wu; Peter Nugent,Abstract Science applications are producing an ever-increasing volume of multi-dimensionaldata that are mainly processed with distributed array databases. These raw arraysare``cooked''into derived data products using complex pipelines that are time-consuming. Asa result; derived data products are released infrequently and become stale soon thereafter.In this paper; we introduce materialized array views as a database construct for scientificdata products. We model the``cooking''process as incremental view maintenance with batchupdates and give a three-stage heuristic that finds effective update plans. Moreover; theheuristic repartitions the array and the view continuously based on a window of past updatesas a side-effect of view maintenance without overhead. We design an analytical cost modelfor integrating materialized array views in queries.

OLA-RAW: Scalable Exploration over Raw Data,Yu Cheng; Weijie Zhao; Florin Rusu,Abstract: In-situ processing has been proposed as a novel data exploration solution in manydomains generating massive amounts of raw data; eg; astronomy; since it providesimmediate SQL querying over raw files. The performance of in-situ processing across aquery workload is; however; limited by the speed of full scan; tokenizing; and parsing of theentire data. Online aggregation (OLA) has been introduced as an efficient method for dataexploration that identifies uninteresting patterns faster by continuously estimating the resultof a computation during the actual processing---the computation can be stopped as early asthe estimate is accurate enough to be deemed uninteresting. However; existing OLAsolutions have a high upfront cost of randomly shuffling and/or sampling the data.

Scalable In-Situ Exploration over Raw Data.,Florin Rusu,Application. The Palomar Transient Factory1 (PTF) project aims to identify and automaticallyclassify transient astrophysical objects such as variable stars and supernovae in real-time. Alist of candidates is extracted from the images taken by the telescope during a night. Theyare stored as a table in one or more FITS2 files. The initial stage in the identification processis to execute a series of aggregate queries over the batch of extracted candidates. Thiscorresponds to data exploration.

Performance Implications of Processing-in-Memory Designs on Data-Intensive Applications,Borui Wang; Martin Torres; Dong Li; Jishen Zhao; Florin Rusu,The popularity of data-intensive applications and recent hardware developments drive the re-emergence of processing-in-memory (PIM) after earlier explorations several decades ago.To introduce PIM into a system; we must answer a fundamental question: what computationlogic should be included into PIM? In terms of computation complexity; PIM can be eitherrelatively simple; fixedfunctional; or fully programmable. The choice of fixedfunctional PIMand programmable PIM has direct impact on performance. In this paper; we explore theperformance implications of fixed-functional PIM and programmable PIM on three data-intensive benchmarks-including a real data-intensive application. Our results show that-withPIMs-we obtain 2.09 x-91.4 x speedup over no PIM cases. However; the fixed-functional PIMand programmable PIM perform differently across applications (with performance …,Parallel Processing Workshops (ICPPW); 2016 45th International Conference on,2016,*
Automatic Identification and Classification of Palomar Transient Factory Astrophysical Objects in GLADE,Weijie Zhao; Florin Rusu; John K Wu; Peter Nugent,Abstract: Palomar Transient Factory is a comprehensive detection system for theidentification and classification of transient astrophysical objects. The central piece in theidentification pipeline is represented by an automated classifier that distinguishes betweenreal and bogus objects with high accuracy. The classifier consists of two components—real-time and offline. Response time is the critical characteristic of the real-time component; whileaccuracy is representative for the offline in-depth analysis. In this paper; we make twosignificant contributions. First; we present an experimental study that evaluates a novelimplementation of the real-time classifier in GLADE—a parallel data processing system thatcombines the efficiency of a database with the extensibility of Map-Reduce.

SCANRAW: A Database Meta-Operator for Parallel In-Situ Processing and Loading,Cheng Yu; Florin Rusu,Resumen Traditional databases incur a significant data-to-query delay due to therequirement to load data inside the system before querying. Since this is not acceptable inmany domains generating massive amounts of raw data (eg; genomics); databases areentirely discarded. External tables; on the other hand; provide instant SQL querying over rawfiles. Their performance across a query workload is limited though by the speed of repeatedfull scans; tokenizing; and parsing of the entire file.,ACM transactions on database systems,2015,*

GLADE: A Highly-Scalable Architecture-Independent Framework for Efficient Analytics,Florin Rusu,2. Declarative with respect to parallelism/distribution. The user should not be burdened withany decisions on parallel execution; including synchronization; amount of parallelism;communication between various nodes. 3. Independence of data representation and I/O.The user should not be burdened with details of how data is made available (disk; memory;cache; etc.); and how data is represented. From user's point of view the data should look likesimple tuples but the framework should have the freedom to select more suitablerepresentations. 4. Allow natural non-relational behavior. A major critique of relationaldatabases is that they are too rigid. Everything must be a tuple or a relation. As long as GLAsare not required to feed data into other operators; it is desirable to allow them to producenon-relational results. 5. Have hand-written code performance.

Scalable HOGWILD! for Big Models,Chengjie Qin; Martin Torres; Florin Rusu,Abstract Existing data analytics systems have approached predictive model trainingexclusively from a data-parallel perspective. Data examples are partitioned to multipleworkers and training is executed concurrently over different partitions; under varioussynchronization policies that emphasize speedup or convergence. Since models withmillions and even billions of features become increasingly common nowadays; modelmanagement becomes an equally important task for effective training. In this paper; wepresent a general framework for parallelizing stochastic optimization algorithms overmassive models that cannot fit in memory. We extend the lock-free HOGWILD!-family ofalgorithms to disk-resident models by vertically partitioning the model offline andasynchronously updating the resulting partitions online. Unlike HOGWILD!; concurrent …,*,*,*
Database Parameter Server,Chengjie Qin; Florin Rusu,Abstract In this work; we propose Database Parameter Server; a database-centric solution tohandle big models. The main idea is to offload the model to secondary storage and leveragedatabase techniques for efficient model training. The model is represented as a table ratherthan as an array attribute. This distinction in model representation changes fundamentallyhow in-database analytics is carried out. By a thorough analysis of popular tasks used inpractice; we identify dot-product as the most critical operator in gradient-based modeltraining. Our main contribution is a parallel dot-product physical database operatoroptimized to execute secondary storage dot-products effectively. Compared to standarddatabase join operators; the proposed dot-product operator is able to produce results in bothblocking and non-blocking fashion; which is required for batch and online training …,*,*,*
Fast Parameter Tuning with Approximations at Scale,Chengjie Qin; Florin Rusu,Abstract. Parameter tuning is a fundamental problem that has to be handled by any Big Dataanalytics system. Identifying the optimal model parameters is an interactive; human-in-the-loop process that requires many hours–if not days and months–even for experienced datascientists. We argue that the incapacity to evaluate multiple parameter configurationssimultaneously and the lack of support to quickly identify sub-optimal configurations are theprincipal causes. In this paper; we develop two database-inspired techniques for efficientparameter tuning. Speculative parameter testing applies advanced parallel multi-queryprocessing methods to evaluate several configurations concurrently and efficiently. Onlineaggregation is applied to identify sub-optimal configurations and halt correspondingconfigurations early in the processing.,*,*,*

The DBO Database System (598),Florin Rusu; Fei Xu; Ravi Jampani; Luis Perez; Mingxi Wu; Chris Jermaine; Alin Dobra,ABSTRACT We demonstrate our prototype of the DBO database system. DBO is designed tofacilitate scalable analytic processing over large data archives. DBO's analytic processingperformance is competitive with other database systems; however; unlike any other existingresearch or industrial system; DBO maintains a statistically meaningful guess to the finalanswer to a query from start to finish during query processing. This guess may be quiteaccurate after only a few seconds or minutes; while answering a query exactly may takehours. This can result in significant savings in both user and computer time; since a user canabort a query as soon as he or she is happy with the guess' accuracy.,*,*,*
