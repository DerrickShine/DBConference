OLTP on hardware islands,Danica Porobic; Ippokratis Pandis; Miguel Branco; Pınar Tözün; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Modern hardware is abundantly parallel and increasingly heterogeneous. Thenumerous processing cores have nonuniform access latencies to the main memory and tothe processor caches; which causes variability in the communication costs. Unfortunately;database systems mostly assume that all processing cores are the same and thatmicroarchitecture differences are not significant enough to appear in critical databaseexecution paths. As we demonstrate in this paper; however; hardware heterogeneity doesappear in the critical path and conventional database architectures achieve suboptimal andeven worse; unpredictable performance. We perform a detailed performance analysis ofOLTP deployments in servers with multiple cores per CPU (multicore) and multiple CPUsper server (multisocket).

ATraPos: Adaptive Transaction Processing on Hardware Islands,Danica Porobic; Erietta Liarou; Pınar Tözün; Anastasia Ailamaki,Nowadays; high-performance transaction processing applications increasingly run onmultisocket multicore servers. Such architectures exhibit non-uniform memory accesslatency as well as non-uniform thread communication costs. Unfortunately; traditional shared-everything database management systems are designed for uniform inter-corecommunication speeds. This causes unpredictable access latencies in the critical path.While lack of data locality may be a minor nuisance on systems with fewer than 4processors; it becomes a serious scalability limitation on larger systems due to accesses tocentralized data structures. In this paper; we propose ATraPos; a storage manager designthat is aware of the non-uniform access latencies of multisocket systems. ATraPos achievesgood data locality by carefully partitioning the data as well as internal data structures (eg …,*,2014,36
Dynamic fine-grained scheduling for energy-efficient main-memory queries,Iraklis Psaroudakis; Thomas Kissinger; Danica Porobic; Thomas Ilsche; Erietta Liarou; Pınar Tözün; Anastasia Ailamaki; Wolfgang Lehner,Abstract Power and cooling costs are some of the highest costs in data centers today; whichmake improvement in energy efficiency crucial. Energy efficiency is also a major designpoint for chips that power whole ranges of computing devices. One important goal in thisarea is energy proportionality; arguing that the system's power consumption should beproportional to its performance. Currently; a major trend among server processors; whichstems from the design of chips for mobile devices; is the inclusion of advanced powermanagement techniques; such as dynamic voltage-frequency scaling; clock gating; andturbo modes. A lot of recent work on energy efficiency of database management systems isfocused on coarse-grained power management at the granularity of multiple machines andwhole queries. These techniques; however; cannot efficiently adapt to the frequently …,Proceedings of the Tenth International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware,2014,11
Micro-architectural Analysis of In-memory OLTP,Utku Sirin; Pinar Tözün; Danica Porobic; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Micro-architectural behavior of traditional disk-based online transaction processing(OLTP) systems has been investigated extensively over thepast couple of decades. Resultsshow that traditional OLTP mostly under-utilize the available micro-architectural resources.In-memory OLTP systems; on the other hand; process all the data in main-memory; andtherefore; can omit the buffer pool. In addition; they usually adopt more lightweightconcurrency control mechanisms; cache-conscious data structures; and cleaner codebasessince they are usually designed from scratch. Hence; we expect significant differences inmicro-architectural behavior when running OLTP on platforms optimized for in-memoryprocessing as opposed to disk-based database systems. In particular; we expect that in-memory systems exploit micro architectural features such as instruction and data caches …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,9
A data-oriented transaction execution engine and supporting tools,Ippokratis Pandis; Pinar Tözün; Miguel Branco; Dimitris Karampinas; Danica Porobic; Ryan Johnson; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Conventional OLTP systems assign each transaction to a worker thread and thatthread accesses data; depending on what the transaction dictates. This thread-to-transactionwork assignment policy leads to unpredictable accesses. The unpredictability forces eachthread to enter a large number of critical sections for the completion of even the simplest ofthe transactions; leading to poor performance and scalability on modern manycorehardware. This demonstration highlights the chaotic access patterns of conventional OLTPdesigns which are the source of scalability problems. Then; it presents a working prototypeof a transaction processing engine that follows a non-conventional architecture; called data-oriented or DORA. DORA is designed around the thread-to-data work assignment policy. Itdistributes the transaction execution to multiple threads and offers predictable accesses …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,8
How to stop under-utilization and love multicores,Anastasia Ailamaki; Erietta Liarou; Pınar Tözün; Danica Porobic; Iraklis Psaroudakis,Hardware trends oblige software to overcome three major challenges against systemsscalability:(1) taking advantage of the implicit/vertical parallelism within a core that isenabled through the aggressive micro-architectural features;(2) exploiting theexplicit/horizontal parallelism provided by multicores; and (3) achieving predictively efficientexecution despite the variability in communication latencies among cores on multisocketmulticores. In this three hour tutorial; we shed light on the above three challenges andsurvey recent proposals to alleviate them. The first part of the tutorial describes theinstruction-and data-level parallelism opportunities in a core coming from the hardware andsoftware side. In addition; it examines the sources of under-utilization in a modern processorand presents insights and hardware/software techniques to better exploit the micro …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,6
The Case For Heterogeneous HTAP,Raja Appuswamy; Manos Karpathiotakis; Danica Porobic; Anastasia Ailamaki,ABSTRACT Modern database engines balance the demanding requirements of mixed;hybrid transactional and analytical processing (HTAP) workloads by relying on i) globalshared memory; ii) system-wide cache coherence; and iii) massive parallelism. Thus;database engines are typically deployed on multi-socket multi-cores; which have been theonly platform to support all three aspects. Two recent trends; however; indicate that thesehardware assumptions will be invalidated in the near future. First; hardware vendors havestarted exploring alternate non-cache-coherent shared-memory multi-core designs due toescalating complexity in maintaining coherence across hundreds of cores. Second; asGPGPUs overcome programmability; performance; and interfacing limitations; they arebeing increasingly adopted by emerging servers to expose heterogeneous parallelism.

Applying HTM to an OLTP system: No free lunch,David Cervini; Danica Porobic; Pınar Tözün; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Transactional memory is a promising way for implementing efficient synchronizationmechanisms for multicore processors. Intel's introduction of hardware transactional memory(HTM) into their Haswell line of processors marks an important step toward mainstreamavailability of transactional memory. Transaction processing systems require execution ofdozens of critical sections to insure isolation among threads; which makes them one of thetarget applications for exploiting HTM. In this study; we quantify the opportunities andlimitations of directly applying HTM to an existing OLTP system that uses fine-grainedsynchronization. Our target is Shore-MT; a modern multithreaded transactional storagemanager that uses a variety of fine-grained synchronization mechanisms to providescalability on multicore processors. We find that HTM can improve performance of the …,Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware,2015,2
More than a network: distributed OLTP on clusters of hardware islands,Danica Porobic; Pınar Tözün; Raja Appuswamy; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Multisocket multicores feature hardware islands-groups of cores that communicatefast among themselves and slower with other groups. With high speed networking becominga commodity; clusters of hardware islands with fast networks are becoming a preferredplatform for high end OLTP workloads. While behavior of OLTP on multisockets is wellunderstood; multi-machine OLTP deployments have been studied only in the geo-distributedcontext where network is much slower. In this paper; we analyze the behavior of differentOLTP designs when deployed on clusters of multisockets with fast networks. Wedemonstrate that choosing the optimal deployment configuration within a multisocket nodecan improve performance by 2 to 4 times. A slow network can decrease the throughput by40% when communication cannot be overlapped with other processing; while having …,Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware,2016,1
Efficient OLTP Architecture for Future Multisocket Multicore Machines,Danica Porobic,Abstract—During the last few years we can observe sharp increase in the number ofprocessing cores on a single chip; as well as number of chips in the single machine.Additionally; communication latencies between these processing elements are becominglonger and more unpredictable. Unfortunately; online transaction processing (OLTP)systems have so far treated underlying hardware as symmetric and homogeneous; whichled to suboptimal and unpredictable performance. In this paper we are analysing twomodern OLTP architectures; H-Store and DORA in the light of multisocket multicorehardware which is becoming increasingly common in enterprise class systems. We go on tosuggest hybrid architecture between these two and show some preliminary performanceresults of an early prototype system. As this hybrid approach has clear limitations; we …,DIAS; I&C; EPFL EDIC-Research Proposal,*,1
Analyzing the impact of system architecture on the scalability of OLTP engines for high-contention workloads,Raja Appuswamy; Angelos C Anadiotis; Danica Porobic; Mustafa K Iman; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Main-memory OLTP engines are being increasingly deployed on multicore serversthat provide abundant thread-level parallelism. However; recent research has shown thateven the state-of-the-art OLTP engines are unable to exploit available parallelism for highcontention workloads. While previous studies have shown the lack of scalability of allpopular concurrency control protocols; they consider only one system architecture---a non-partitioned; shared everything one where transactions can be scheduled to run on any coreand can access any data or metadata stored in shared memory. In this paper; we perform athorough analysis of the impact of other architectural alternatives (Data-oriented transactionexecution; Partitioned Serial Execution; and Delegation) on scalability under high contentionscenarios. In doing so; we present Trireme; a main-memory OLTP engine testbed that …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,*

Performance and Energy Analysis Using Transactional Workloads,Anastasia Ailamaki; Danica Porobic; Utku Sirin,Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) is a multi-billion-dollar industry and one of the mostimportant and demanding database applications. Innovations in OLTP continue to attractsignificant attention from established industry vendors; startups and a plethora of academicgroups worldwide. OLTP applications are characterized by many concurrent requests thattypically read about a dozen and write a handful of data items each. The users of the systemexpect predictably low response times and high availability regardless of the degree ofconcurrency or the size of data. Thus it is not surprising that a lot of innovations focus onimproving the systems to utilize abundant parallelism present in modern multicore serverswhile ensuring efficient utilization of the microarchitectural resources of each processor coreand achieving good energy efficiency.

High Performance Transaction Processing on Non-Uniform Hardware Topologies,Danica Porobic,Transaction processing is a mission critical enterprise application that runs on high-endservers. Traditionally; transaction processing systems have been designed for uniform core-to-core communication latencies. In the past decade; with the emergence of multisocketmulticores; for the first time we have Islands; ie; groups of cores that communicate fastamong themselves and slower with other groups. In current mainstream servers; eachmulticore processor corresponds to an Island. As the number of cores on a chip increases;however; we expect that multiple Islands will form within a single processor in the nearbyfuture. In addition; the access latencies to the local memory and to the memory of anotherserver over fast interconnect are converging; thus creating a hierarchy of Islands within agroup of servers. Non-uniform hardware topologies pose a significant challenge to the …,*,2016,*
Smoothing non-uniform communication latencies for OLTP.,Danica Porobic,Transaction processing applications traditionally run on the high-end servers. Up untilrecently; such servers had uniform core-to-core communication latencies. Now withmultisocket multicores; for the first time we have Islands; ie; groups of cores thatcommunicate very fast with cores that belong to the same group and several times slowerwith cores from other groups. In current mainstream servers; each chip is an Island; as thenumber of cores on a chip increases; however; soon we will identify Islands within a singlechip. How do transaction processing systems perform on these non-uniform platforms?Aren't multisocket multicores just another form of abundant parallelism? We already havetransaction processing systems that scale up on multicores and scale out across machines.Shouldn't one of the existing designs be good enough for hardware Islands?,CIDR,2015,*
Buffer construction with geodetic circular arcs,*,A method with acts for representing a buffer about a feature represented on an ellipsoid orround-object model. The method includes accessing a definition of a buffer stored on one ormore computer readable medium in a format readable by a computer application. Thedefinition of the buffer includes a number of arcs around a feature on an ellipsoid or round-object model. Each of the arcs is defined using three points defined using geodeticcoordinates. The three points includes two endpoints of a given arc and a point on the arcbetween the two endpoints. The method further includes rendering the buffer by renderingthe plurality of arcs. The method further includes displaying the rendered buffer to a user at acomputing system display.,*,2014,*

Testing spatial methods in SQL Server 11.0,Branislav Uzelac; Nemanja Matkovic; Danica Porobic,Abstract Testing of spatial methods in database systems is a complex and demanding taskthat involves three major steps; each with their own challenges. The first step is selection ofdata being used for the tests; the second step is the validation of obtained test results and;finally; the last step is failure analysis and simplification of complex spatial objects involvedin the problem found in the previous step. In this paper; we describe how we have appliedeach of these steps in testing SQL Server 11.0 and present several new approaches weused to get better test coverage; increase test automation and reduce failure investigationtime. Main components of our method are the new spatial data generation framework; noveluse of set theory identities for validation of the spatial operations and the algorithm forautomatic simplification of complex spatial objects found in bug reproduction steps.

Buffer with Arcs on a Round Earth,Michael Kallay; Danica Porobic,The buffer of distance about a geospatial object is the set of all points whose distance fromdoes not exceed. Buffer is one of the most fundamental constructions in geospatialcomputations. For example; it may be used to define the danger zone around the path of ahurricane; or as a query window for selecting all the objects in a database which are in thevicinity of a given object. As long as the modeling of geospatial objects has been restrictedto points and line segments; buffers could only be approximated by polygons. Theintroduction of circular arcs in commercial products such as [Oracle 2001](echoed in draftsfor future versions of international standards such as ISO 19125 and SQL/MM) affords exactrepresentations for planar buffers. The construction and processing of circular arcs relies onage-old geometric constructions in the plane; and these do not easily extend to curved …,*,*,*
