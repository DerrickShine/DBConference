Regular inhaled beta-agonist treatment in bronchial asthma,Malcolm R Sears; D Robin Taylor; CG Print; DC Lake; QINGQING Li; EM Flannery; DM Yates; MK Lucas; GP Herbison,Abstract 89 subjects with stable asthma took part in a double-blind; placebo-controlled;randomised; crossover study of the effects of regular versus on-demand inhaledbronchodilator therapy. The subjects inhaled fenoterol or placebo by a dry powder deliverysystem for 24 weeks. Control of asthma was judged by daily morning and evening peakexpiratory flow rates; symptom diaries; use of additional inhaled bronchodilator; andrequirement for short courses of prednisone. Of 64 subjects who completed the trial; 57showed a clear difference in degree of control of asthma between the fenoterol and placeboperiods: in 17 (30%[95% confidence interval 18· 4-43· 4%]) asthma was better controlledduring regular inhaled bronchodilator treatment; whereas in 40 (70%[56· 6-81· 6%]) controlwas better during placebo treatment with bronchodilator for symptom relief only.

Relation between airway responsiveness and serum IgE in children with asthma and in apparently normal children,MR Sears; B Burrows; EM Flannery; GP Herbison; CJ Hewitt; MD Holdaway,Abstract Background. Although asthma diagnosed by a physician is known to be related toserum IgE levels; it is not known whether there is a relation between the level of IgE andairway hyperresponsiveness to a methacholine challenge. The characteristics ofasymptomatic persons that predispose them to airway hyperresponsiveness are alsounknown. Methods. We studied the relation between the serum total IgE level and airwayhyperresponsiveness in the presence or absence of asthma and other atopic diseases in abirth cohort of children. Data from a questionnaire regarding respiratory symptoms; plusmeasurements of the serum total IgE level and airway responsiveness to inhaledmethacholine; were obtained for 562 11-year-olds in New Zealand.

Four antisocialbehavior trajectory groups were identified among females and males using general growthmixture modeling and included life-course persistent (LCP); adolescent-onset; childhood-limited; and low trajectory groups. During childhood; both LCP females and males werecharacterized by social; familial and neurodevelopmental risk factors; whereas those on theadolescent-onset pathway were not. At age 32; women and men on the LCP pathway wereengaging in serious violence and experiencing significant mental health; physical health;and economic problems. Females and males on the adolescent-onset pathway were alsoexperiencing difficulties at age 32; although to a lesser extent. Although more males than …,Development and psychopathology,2008,652
Long-term relation between breastfeeding and development of atopy and asthma in children and young adults: a longitudinal study,Malcolm R Sears; Justina M Greene; Andrew R Willan; D Robin Taylor; Erin M Flannery; Jan O Cowan; G Peter Herbison; Richie Poulton,Summary Background Breastfeeding is widely advocated to reduce risk of atopy andasthma; but the evidence for such an effect is conflicting. We aimed to assess long-termoutcomes of asthma and atopy related to breastfeeding in a New Zealand birth cohort.Methods Our cohort consisted of 1037 of 1139 children born in Dunedin; New Zealand;between April; 1972; and March; 1973; and residing in Otago province at age 3 years.Children were assessed every 2–5 years from ages 9 to 26 years with respiratoryquestionnaires; pulmonary function; bronchial challenge; and allergy skin tests. History ofbreastfeeding had been independently recorded in early childhood. Findings 504 (49%) of1037 eligible children were breastfed (4 weeks or longer) and 533 (51%) were not.

The relative risks of sensitivity to grass pollen; house dust mite and cat dander in the development of childhood asthma,MR Sears; GP Herbison; MD Holdaway; CJ Hewitt; ERIN M FLANNERY; PA Silva,Summary The associations between skin sensitivity to various common allergens and thedevelopment of childhood asthma were ascertained in a longitudinal study of a birth cohortof New Zealand children up to the age of 13 years. Of 714 children skin-tested; 45.8% weresensitive to at least one of 11 allergens; the most common responses being to rye grasspollen (32.5%); house dust mite (30.1%) and cat dander (13.3%). Allergen-specific relativerisk analysis; controlled for the effect of sensitivity to other allergens; demonstrated thatsensitivity to house dust mite and to cat dander were highly significant independent riskfactors associated with the development of asthma (whether defined as recurrent typicalrespiratory symptoms; increased airway responsiveness; or the concurrent presence ofboth); whereas grass sensitivity was not a significant independent risk factor for asthma.,Clinical & Experimental Allergy,1989,618

Induced sputum cell counts in healthy adults,Jose Belda; Richard Leigh; Krishnan Parameswaran; PAUL M O'BYRNE; Malcolm R Sears; Frederick E Hargreave,Induced sputum cell counts provide a relatively noninvasive method to evaluate thepresence; type; and degree of inflammation in the airways of the lungs. Their interpretationrequires a knowledge of normal values from a healthy population. The objective was toexamine the total and differential cell counts in induced sputum from a sample of healthyadults. A total of 118 healthy nonsmoking adults were studied. None had asthma or airflowobstruction (negative history; FEV1⩾ 80% predicted; ratio of FEV1 to vital capacity[FEV1/VC]⩾ 80%; methacholine PC20⩾ 16 mg/ml). Forty-six were atopic. Sputum inductionproduced an adequate sample in 96 subjects [53 males; mean age (range) 36 (18 to 60) yr].The expectorate was processed within 2 h; sputum was selected; treated with dithiothreitol;filtered; and examined in a hemocytometer for total cell count and viability and on Wright …,American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,2000,402

Recent evidence in mice has identified a “critical window” early in lifewhere gut microbial changes (dysbiosis) are most influential in experimental asthma.However; current research has yet to establish whether these changes precede or areinvolved in human asthma. We compared the gut microbiota of 319 subjects enrolled in theCanadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Study; and show that infants atrisk of asthma exhibited transient gut microbial dysbiosis during the first 100 days of life. Therelative abundance of the bacterial genera Lachnospira; Veillonella; Faecalibacterium; andRothia was significantly decreased in children at risk of asthma. This reduction in bacterialtaxa was accompanied by reduced levels of fecal acetate and dysregulation of …,Science translational medicine,2015,309
Potential masking effects of salmeterol on airway inflammation in asthma,R ANDREW McIVOR; Emilio Pizzichini; Mark O Turner; Patricia Hussack; Frederick E Hargreave; Malcolm R Sears,We hypothesized that regular use of long-acting β-agonists could delay recognition of(“mask”) increasing airway inflammation. We studied steroid-sparing and “masking” effectsof salmeterol versus placebo in 13 asthmatic individuals requiring⩾ 1;500 μ g inhaledcorticosteroid daily. Corticosteroid doses were reduced weekly until criteria were met for anexacerbation or the corticosteroid was fully withdrawn. Subjects were restabilized on theiroriginal dose of inhaled corticosteroid for 4 wk before crossover to the alternative treatment.Subjects maintained symptom and peak expiratory flow (PEF) diaries; and underwentweekly spirometric; methacholine challenge; sputum eosinophil; and serum eosinophilcationic protein (ECP) measurements.

The impact ofchildhood asthma; airway responsiveness; atopy; and smoking on airway remodeling wasinvestigated in a birth cohort studied longitudinally to age 26. A low postbronchodilator ratioof forced exhaled volume in 1 second (FEV1) to vital capacity (VC) at age 18 or 26 was usedas a marker of airway remodeling.“Normal” study members with no history of asthma ever;no wheezing in the last year; and no smoking ever were used to determine sex-and age-specific reference values for this ratio. The lower limit of normal was defined as the meanratio minus 1.96 standard deviation; delimiting the 2.5% of the normal population with thelowest FEV1/VC ratio.

Asthma exacerbations· 1: epidemiology,NW Johnston; MR Sears,Asthma exacerbations may be triggered by a number of atmospheric and domiciliaryenvironmental factors as well as by those encountered in schools and workplaces. Themajority of exacerbations; particularly in children; coincide with respiratory viral infections;most commonly rhinovirus. As most respiratory viruses and many aeroallergens appear inseasonal patterns; asthma exacerbations; particularly those requiring emergency treatment;show analogous seasonal cycles which differ in form in children and adults. While similar inform between the sexes; they differ in amplitude; with boys having higher risks ofexacerbation in childhood and women in adult life.

Objectives In thisstudy we assessed the association between TRAP and mortality in Toronto; Ontario;Canada. Methods We collected nitrogen dioxide samples over two seasons using duplicatetwo-sided Ogawa passive diffusion samplers at 143 locations across Toronto. We calibratedland use regressions to predict NO 2 exposure on a fine scale within Toronto. We usedinterpolations to predict levels of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and ozone levels. We assigned predicted pollution exposures to 2;360 subjects from arespiratory clinic; and abstracted health data on these subjects from medical billings; lungfunction tests; and diagnoses by pulmonologists. We tracked mortality between 1992 and …,Environmental health perspectives,2009,181

Relation between income; air pollution and mortality: a cohort study,Murray M Finkelstein; Michael Jerrett; Patrick DeLuca; Norm Finkelstein; Dave K Verma; Kenneth Chapman; Malcolm R Sears,Background: Community levels of air pollution have been associated with variability inmortality rates; but previous studies have inferred exposure to pollutants on a citywide basis.We investigated mortality in relation to neighbourhood levels of income and air pollution inan urban area. Methods: We identified 5228 people in the Hamilton–Burlington area ofsouthern Ontario who had been referred for pulmonary function testing between 1985 and1999. Nonaccidental deaths that occurred in this group between 1992 and 1999 wereascertained from the Ontario Mortality Registry. Mean household income was estimated bylinking the subjects9 postal codes with the 1996 census. Mean neighbourhood levels of totalsuspended particulates and sulfur dioxide were estimated by interpolation from data from anetwork of sampling stations. We used proportional hazards regression models to …,Canadian Medical Association Journal,2003,178
Descriptive epidemiology of asthma,Malcolm R Sears,Asthma is a substantial health problem among children and adults worldwide; with high andincreasing prevalence rates.; in many countries;' a substantial morbidity-reflected in hospitaladmission rates;* use of medical services; 3 and drug use4-and worrying trends in mortalityrates in some countries. 5 The incidence of asthma (the development of new disease) variesby region and by age; but the global burden of asthma can be approximated from measuredprevalence rates (reflecting incidence; duration; persistence; and recurrence of disease). If10% of children and 5% of adults have asthma; figures that are conservative for westerncountries' but may be overestimates in some developing countries; the global burden ofasthma is in the order of 130 million people. Mortality rates from asthma in almost all westerncountries vary between one and five per 100 000; and result in some 60 000 deaths …,The Lancet,1997,178
Exacerbations of asthma without sputum eosinophilia.,MO Turner; P Hussack; MR Sears; J Dolovich; FE Hargreave,BACKGROUND--Sputum analysis provides a non-invasive method of examining the airwaysecretions of subjects with asthma in order to better understand the inflammatory process.Increased proportions of eosinophils are generally seen in the sputum of subjects withasthma; especially when there is an exacerbation. An unexpected observation in the sputumof subjects with mild exacerbations of asthma is reported. METHODS--Thirty fourconsecutive subjects with symptoms consistent with a mild exacerbation of asthma wererecruited for a treatment study. Inclusion criteria required persistent symptoms of chesttightness; dyspnoea; or wheezing for two weeks (without spontaneous improvement oralteration in dose of inhaled corticosteroid) and a forced expiratory volume in one second(FEV1) that was reversible to more than 75% predicted or known best to ensure the …,Thorax,1995,177
Polymorphism of the beta2-adrenoceptor and the response to long-term beta2-agonist therapy in asthma,RJ Hancox; MR Sears; DR Taylor,Polymorphisms affecting amino acids 16 and 27 of the beta2-adrenoceptor alter receptorregulation in vitro. Whether these polymorphisms alter the response to beta2-agonisttherapy in asthma is unknown. In a previous study of 64 asthmatics; most experienced adeterioration in asthma control during regular inhaled beta2-agonist (fenoterol) treatment;while a minority improved. We have determined the beta2-adrenoceptor genotypes in thesesubjects; to establish whether changes in asthma control during the earlier study wereinfluenced by beta2-adrenoceptor polymorphism. The genotypes coding for amino acids 16and 27 were identified in 60 subjects using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction. Theeffects of regular beta2-agonist treatment on asthma control were compared betweengenotypes. There was no association between genotype and change in overall asthma …,European Respiratory Journal,1998,163
Formoterol as relief medication in asthma: a worldwide safety and effectiveness trial,RA Pauwels; MR Sears; M obot Campbell; C Villasante; S Huang; A Lindh; W Petermann; M Aubier; G Schwabe; T Bengtsson,The aim of the study was to compare the safety and effectiveness of as-needed formoterolwith salbutamol in a large international real-life asthma study. Children and adults (n=18;124) were randomised to 6 months as-needed treatment with open-label formoterol 4.5µg Turbuhaler® or salbutamol 200 µg pressurised metered dose inhaler or equivalent.Primary safety variables were asthma-related and nonasthma-related serious adverseevents (SAE) s and adverse events (AE) s resulting in discontinuation (DAE) s. The primaryefficacy variable was time to first asthma exacerbation. The incidences of AEs; SAEs andDAEs arising from SAEs were not significantly different between treatments. DAEs fornonserious AEs were higher with formoterol. Asthma-related AEs decreased with formoterol(1;098 (12.3%) versus 1;206 (13.5%)); asthma-related SAEs were similar (108 (1.2%) …,European Respiratory Journal,2003,160
Sex differences in factors associated with childhood-and adolescent-onset wheeze,Piush J Mandhane; Justina M Greene; Jan O Cowan; D Robin Taylor; Malcolm R Sears,Rationale: Factors predicting the development of wheeze may differ between sexes andbetween childhood and adolescence. Methods: A New Zealand birth cohort of 1;037children was followed to age 26. For this analysis; those reporting recurrent wheezing at twoor more assessments were classified as “wheezers.” We examined risk factors fordevelopment of wheeze before age 10 (childhood) and subsequently (adolescent-onset) formales and for females separately using Cox regression modeling. Results: Males more oftendeveloped childhood wheeze (p= 0.002) and females adolescent-onset wheeze (p< 0.001).Maternal atopy (asthma or hay fever) was a risk factor for childhood wheeze in both sexes(hazard ratio [HR]; 1.48; p< 0.05 for males; HR; 2.37; p< 0.001 for females). Paternal atopyalso influenced childhood wheeze; significantly for males (HR; 1.72; p= 0.01); and …,American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,2005,156
Longitudinal effects of passive smoking on pulmonary function in New Zealand children,Duane L Sherrill; Fernando D Martinez; Michael D Lebowitz; M David Holdaway; Erin M Flannery; G Peter Herbison; Warren R Stanton; Phil A Silva; Malcolm R Sears,Introduction The effects of passive tobacco smoke exposure on lung function and itspossible association with subsequent development of lung diseases have become majorhealth issues. Despite constant warnings of the health hazards of cigarette smoking; largenumbers of adults continue to expose nonsmokers to both mainstream and sidestreamenvironmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Numerous studies have been conducted recently in aneffort to evaluate the harmful effects of these exposures on both children and adults (1-23).Many investigators have chosen to study passive tobacco smoke effects in children sincethey generally have fewer confounding exposures; such as personal active smoking andwork-related exposures; than adults. In addition; it is believed that children may be moresusceptible to tobacco smoke during the period of lung growth and maturation. However …,American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,1992,155
The September epidemic of asthma hospitalization: school children as disease vectors,Neil W Johnston; Sebastian L Johnston; Geoff R Norman; Jennifer Dai; Malcolm R Sears,Background Viral infections are associated with the majority of asthma exacerbations inchildren and adults. Increased asthma hospitalization rates of children and adults;particularly in the early fall; have been observed to follow school vacations. Objective Wesought to determine the sequence of timing of September asthma hospitalization epidemicsin children and adults and to determine whether school-age children are the primary sourceof transmission of agents that cause them. Methods By using Canadian asthma hospitaladmission data from 1990 to 2002; we examined geographic variation in the timing of fallasthma epidemics and applied mathematical modeling to estimate their exact timing andmagnitude in school-age children; preschool children; and adults; and relation to schoolreturn.

Adverse effects of β-agonists,Malcolm R Sears,Abstract Short-acting β-adrenergic receptor agonists have pharmacologically predictabledose-related and potency-related adverse effects; including tachycardia and tremor; andthey also affect serum potassium and glucose. These effects all show tolerance withcontinued exposure. The potential for arrhythmia is increased by comorbidity andhypoxemia. Nonpharmacologically predictable effects include airway hyperresponsivenessto nonspecific and specific stimuli; including allergen and exercise; and increased airwayinflammation. Genetic variants of the β-adrenergic receptor alter susceptibility to adverseeffects of β-agonists on airway function. The impact of the enantiomers of β-agonists onadverse effects remains unclear. The two epidemics of asthma death among young peoplewere temporally associated with introduction of potent short-acting β-agonists …,Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,2002,151
Adiposity; asthma; and airway inflammation,Christene R McLachlan; Richie Poulton; George Car; Jan Cowan; Susan Filsell; Justina M Greene; D Robin Taylor; David Welch; Avis Williamson; Malcolm R Sears; Robert J Hancox,Background Several studies have found obesity to be associated with an increasedprevalence of asthma. For reasons that remain unclear; this association has often beenreported to be stronger in women than in men. One possible explanation might be that thesestudies have used body mass index to identify adiposity; which might be a less reliablemeasure of body fat in men than in women. Objective We sought to explore the associationbetween body fat percentage measured by means of bioelectrical impedance analysis andasthma; airflow obstruction; and airway inflammation in men and women. MethodsRespiratory questionnaires; spirometry; bronchodilator response; exhaled nitric oxide level;and percentage of body fat were measured in a population-based cohort of approximately1000 individuals at age 32 years. Results There was a significant association between …,Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,2007,149
The β2-Agonist Controversy,Malcolm R Sears; D Robin Taylor,Summary Links between frequent use of inhaled β2-agonists and morbidity and mortalityfrom asthma appear probable. Two mortality epidemics followed the marketing of potentinhaled adrenergic agents. Case-control studies in New Zealand linked mortality withprescription of fenoterol; especially in severe asthma. A Saskatchewan case-control studyconfirmed an association of mortality with fenoterol; and also with frequent use of salbutamol(albuterol). Cardiac effects of β2-agonists do not cause mortality; but frequent use of theseagents may increase the chronic severity of asthma; hence increasing the number ofasthmatic patients at risk of death in an acute attack. Frequent use of β2-agonists mayreduce lung function; increasing airway responsiveness; and impair control of asthma;despite use of inhaled corticosteroids. Mechanisms for this effect may include …,*,1994,149
A longitudinal study of the effects of tobacco and cannabis exposure on lung function in young adults,D Robin Taylor; David M Fergusson; Barry J Milne; L John Horwood; Terrie E Moffitt; Malcolm R Sears; Richie Poulton,Findings When the sample was stratified for cumulative use; there was evidence of a linear relationshipbetween cannabis use and FEV 1 /VC (P < 0.05). In the absence of adjusting for othervariables; increasing cannabis use over time was associated with a decline in FEV 1 /VC withtime; the mean FEV 1 /VC among subjects using cannabis on 900 or more occasions was7.2%; 2.6% and 5.0% less than non-users at ages 18; 21 and 26; respectively. After controllingfor potential confounding factors (age; tobacco smoking and weight) the negative effect of cumulativecannabis use on mean FEV 1 /VC was only marginally significant (P < 0.09). Age (P <0.001); cigarette smoking (P < 0.05) and weight (P < 0.001) were all significant predictors of FEV1 /VC. Cannabis use and daily cigarette smoking acted additively to influence FEV 1 /VC …Conclusions Longitudinal observations over 8 years in young adults revealed a dose …,Addiction,2002,147
Environmental inequality and circulatory disease mortality gradients,Murray M Finkelstein; Michael Jerrett; Malcolm R Sears,Study objective: Studies in Europe and North America have reported that living in adisadvantaged neighbourhood is associated with an increased incidence of coronary heartdisease. The aim of this study was to test the hypotheses that exposure to traffic and airpollution might account for some of the socioeconomic differences in mortality rates in a citywhere residents are covered by universal health insurance. Design: Cohort mortality study.Individual postal codes used to derive:(1) socioeconomic status from census data;(2) meanair pollution levels from interpolation between governmental monitoring stations;(3)proximity to traffic from the geographical information system.

Lessons from the national asthma mortality study: circumstances surrounding death.,HH Rea; MR Sears; R Beaglehole; J Fenwick; RT Jackson; AJ Gillies; TV O'Donnell; PE Holst; RP Rothwell,Abstract The circumstances surrounding all deaths from asthma in New Zealanders under70 years of age between August 1981 and July 1983 have been analysed from informationrecorded or recalled by doctors or relatives of the deceased. Factors which may havereduced the time available for effective treatment of these severe attacks are described todraw attention to ways in which mortality might be reduced. For almost half of the 271 deathsmedical help had not been called before the patient was in extremis. When medical helpwas summoned in sufficient time doctors commonly did not give corticosteroids or used theminadequately. Difficulties in using medical care and noncompliance with asthmamanagement were common particularly in Polynesian patients. In 38% of patients somemedical inadequacy appeared to contribute to poor long-term care and education. Failure …,The New Zealand medical journal,1987,145
Past; present and future—β2-adrenoceptor agonists in asthma management,Malcolm R Sears; Jan Lötvall,Summary The β-adrenoceptor agonists (β-agonists) have been used to relievebronchoconstriction for at least 5000 years. β-agonists are based on adrenaline and earlyforms; such as isoprenaline; lacked bronchial selectivity and had unpleasant side effects.Modern β-agonists are more selective for the β 2-adrenoceptors (β 2-receptors) located inbronchial smooth muscle and have less cardiotoxicity. Traditional β 2-adrenoceptor agonists(β 2-agonists); such as salbutamol; terbutaline and fenoterol; were characterised by a rapidonset but relatively short duration of action. While valuable as reliever medication; their shortduration gave inadequate night-time relief and limited protection from exercise-inducedbronchoconstriction. β 2-agonists with longer durations of action; formoterol and salmeterol;were subsequently discovered or developed.

Relationship between fetal growth and the development of asthma and atopy in childhood,Philip Leadbitter; Neil Pearce; Soo Cheng; Malcolm R Sears; M David Holdaway; Erin M Flannery; G Peter Herbison; Richard Beasley,BACKGROUND A study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between birthanthropometric measures and the subsequent development of asthma; airwayhyperresponsiveness; and atopy in later childhood. METHODS A longitudinal study wasperformed on 734 subjects (71%) from a cohort of children born in Dunedin; New Zealand in1972–73. The birth anthropometric measures were available from hospital records and themain outcome measures of reported asthma; skin prick tests; and methacholinehyperresponsiveness were measured at the age of 13 years; while the serum total IgE wasmeasured at 11 years. RESULTS After adjustment for other factors; infants with a largerhead circumference at birth tended to have higher serum total IgE at 11 years of age (p=0.02) but IgE was not associated significantly with birth length or birth weight.

Relationships of bronchial responsiveness assessed by methacholine to serum IgE; lung function; symptoms; and diagnoses in 11-year-old New Zealand children,Benjamin Burrows; Malcolm R Sears; Erin M Flannery; G Peter Herbison; M David Holdaway,The relationship of bronchial responsiveness (BR); assessed by methacholine challenge; toserum IgE; baseline ventilatory function; and symptoms or diagnoses suggesting an atopicdisorder were examined in 522 11-year-old New Zealand children. BR was assessed by thepresence or absence of a PC 20 25 mg/ml or less and by calculating a continuous index ofthe decline of the FEV 1 during the methacholine test. The latter facilitated multivariateanalyses and revealed significant relationships to predictor variables even in thoseconsidered" nonresponsive" by PC 20 criteria. There was a close relationship of BR to thebaseline FEV 1/vital capacity ratio; seen even in patients with known asthma; but thisrelationship was seen only in subjects with at least moderate levels of serum IgE. There wasa less close relation of BR to percent predicted FEV 1; but this persisted even after …,Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1992,141

Reduced selenium in asthmatic subjects in New Zealand.,A Flatt; N Pearce; Ch D Thomson; MR Sears; MF Robinson; R Beasley,Selenium is an essential component of glutathione peroxidase; an enzyme that helps protectcells against oxidation damage and modulates the lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonicacid metabolism. Low selenium concentrations might therefore influence the inflammatoryprocess in asthma by reducing the activity of glutathione peroxidase. Whole blood andplasma selenium concentrations and glutathione peroxidase activity have been measured in56 asthmatic patients and 59 non-asthmatic control subjects in New Zealand; a country witha low dietary selenium intake and a high prevalence of asthma. When compared with controlsubjects the asthmatic patients had lower values for whole blood selenium concentrations (-4.9; 95% confidence interval-10.2 to 0.4 ng/ml) and glutathione peroxidase activity (-3.3;95% CI-5.8 to-0.8 units/g Hb).

Induced sputum cell counts: their usefulness in clinical practice,L Jayaram; K Parameswaran; MR Sears; FE Hargreave,Airway inflammation is fundamental to the aetiology and persistence of asthma and otherairway conditions. The presence and type of airway inflammation can be difficult to detectclinically; delaying the introduction of appropriate treatment. Induced sputum cell counts area relatively noninvasive; safe and reliable method of identifying airway inflammation. Theycan accurately discriminate eosinophilic airway inflammation from noneosinophilic airwayinflammation; and help guide therapy. Eosinophilic airway inflammation is steroidresponsive whilst noneosinophilic (usually neutrophilic) inflammation generally is not.Macrophages containing haemosiderin can be useful in detecting left ventricular dysfunctionand macrophages containing lipid are suggestive of oropharyngeal reflux withmicroaspiration; both of which can complicate or confuse assessment of airway disease …,European Respiratory Journal,2000,139
Atopy in childhood. II. Relationship to airway responsiveness; hay fever and asthma,MR Sears; B Burrows; GP Herbison; MD Holdaway; EM Flannery,Summary While airway hyperresponsivencss is usually associated with a diagnosis ofasthma or symptoms of wheezing; some individuals with rhinitis show airwayhyperresponsiveness as do some with no symptoms whatsoever. We have studied thecorrelations between symptoms; airway hyperresponsiveness and atopy as determined byskin-prick tests in a cohort of New Zealand children. A total of 662 members of a birth cohortwere studied at age 13 years using a respiratory questionnaire; skin-prick tests to 11common allergens; and an abbreviated validated methacholine challenge test to determineairway responsiveness. Airway hyperresponsiveness (methacholine PC20 FEV 1 leqslant R:less-than-or-eq; slant 8 mg/ml) was strongly correlated with reported asthma and currentwheezing (P< 0.0001) and also with atopy; especially to house dust mite and cat (P< …,Clinical & Experimental Allergy,1993,137
Long-acting β-agonists: a review of formoterol safety data from asthma clinical trials,Malcolm R Sears; Anders Ottosson; Finn Radner; Samy Suissa,The safety of long-acting β 2-agonist (LABA) treatment in asthma has been questionedfollowing reported increased respiratory deaths when salmeterol was added to usualpharmacotherapy. The aim of this study was to examine whether asthma; cardiac or all-cause mortality and morbidity were increased with formoterol use. The analysis included allAstraZeneca randomised controlled parallel-group asthma trials of 3–12-months durationinvolving formoterol. Risks associated with formoterol use compared with non-LABAtreatment; overall and in combination with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS); were assessedusing an intention-to-treat analysis of the rates and rate ratios of deaths and serious adverseevents (SAEs).

Asthma mortality: comparison between New Zealand and England.,MR Sears; HH Rea; RP Rothwell; TV O'Donnell; PE Holst; AJ Gillies; R Beaglehole,Causes for the high mortality from asthma in New Zealand were investigated by comparingdeaths from asthma in caucasian subjects aged 15-64 in New Zealand with those fromasthma in the same age group in two regions in England. There were no significantdifferences in the accuracy of death certification. The verified asthma mortality in NewZealand (4.2/100;000) was over twice that in England. Many characteristics of patients andmanagement; including poor compliance with treatment and deficiencies in long term andemergency care; were qualitatively similar in the two countries. New Zealand had anapparently higher rate of non-preventable deaths from asthma; suggesting a greater severityof asthma in New Zealand. In both countries; however; most deaths were associated withpoor assessment; underestimation of severity and inappropriate treatment (over-reliance …,Br Med J (Clin Res Ed),1986,125

Epidemiology of asthma exacerbations,Malcolm R Sears,Exacerbations of asthma sufficient to require urgent medical intervention are often; but notalways; associated with viral infection; especially rhinovirus; with significant interaction withallergen sensitization and exposure. Seasonal patterns of exacerbations are seenespecially in children; and may be aggravated by lack of adequate maintenance anti-inflammatory drug treatment during the high-risk viral season most well described in theNorthern Hemisphere after school return in September. Age and sex differences in theepidemiology of exacerbations remain less than fully explained; but hormonal influences aredemonstrable. Frequent exacerbations may be an indication of greater severity of disease;significant comorbidities; or poor compliance with therapy.

Associations between birth weight; early childhood weight gain; and adult lung function.,Robert J Hancox; Richie Poulton; Justina M Greene; Christene R McLachlan; Mark S Pearce; Malcolm Sears,Background: Low birth weight is associated with lower values for spirometry in adults but it isunknown if birth weight influences other measures of pulmonary function. It is also unclearwhether post-natal growth affects adult lung function. We assessed the associationsbetween birth weight; post-natal growth and adult lung function in an unselected birth cohortof 1037 children. Methods: Birth weight; weight gain between birth and age 3 years; andlung function at age 32 years were measured. Analyses adjusted for adult height and sexand further adjusted for multiple other potential confounding factors. Results: Birth weightwas positively correlated with spirometric (FEV1 and FVC) and plethysmographic (TLC andFRC) lung function and with lung diffusing capacity. These associations persisted afteradjustment for confounding factors including adult weight; exposure to cigarette smoke in …,Thorax,2008,111

The Netherlands and Canadian Formoterol St...,T Van der Molen; DS Postma; MO Turner; B Meyboomde Jong; JL Malo; K Chapman; R Grossman; CS De Graaff; RA Riemersma; MR Sears,BACKGROUND: The long acting beta 2 agonist formoterol has proved to be an effectivebronchodilator with a prolonged action of 12-14 hours. However; the precise role offormoterol in the maintenance treatment of asthma is still under debate. A study wasperformed to investigate the efficacy and safety of treatment with formoterol for six months insubjects with asthma. METHODS: In a multicentre double blind; placebo controlled; parallelgroup study 239 subjects with mild to moderate asthma were randomly assigned totreatment with either inhaled formoterol 24 micrograms twice daily (n= 125) or placebo (n=114) during eight months. The study consisted of a four week run in period; a 24 weektreatment period; and a four week washout period.

Understanding the September asthma epidemic,Malcolm R Sears; Neil W Johnston,The highly predictable increase in emergency department visits; hospital admissions; andunscheduled physician consultations for childhood asthma in North America everySeptember is uniquely related to school return. Rhinovirus infection is likely the majortrigger; initially affecting asthma in school-age children; followed by similar but lesserincreases in asthma morbidity in younger children and in adults. Low use of asthmamedications during summer may fuel the epidemic; which may be attenuated by the short-term addition of an effective controller therapy.,*,2007,106

Risk factors for hospital admission for asthma from childhood to young adulthood: a longitudinal population study,Finn Rasmussen; D Robin Taylor; Erin M Flannery; Jan O Cowan; Justina M Greene; G Peter Herbison; Malcolm R Sears,Abstract Background: Predictors of hospital admissions for asthma in children and youngadults in a general population are not well defined; because most studies have usedselected subpopulations. Objective: The purpose of this investigation was to determine riskfactors for single and multiple hospital admissions for asthma. Methods: The members of apopulation-based; unselected birth cohort of 1037 New Zealanders answeredquestionnaires and underwent lung function; airway responsiveness; and allergy testing on7 occasions to the age of 26 years. Results: Among the 766 study members (74% of thecohort) who reported wheezing symptoms ever by the age of 26 years; 136 hospitalizationswere reported by 62 individuals (8.3% of those at risk; 6.2% of the total cohort).

Relation of the course of bronchial responsiveness from age 9 to age 15 to allergy.,Benjamin Burrows; Malcolm R Sears; Erin M Flannery; G PETER Herbison; M David Holdaway; Phil A Silva,Bronchial responsiveness to methacholine was measured in a birth cohort of New Zealandchildren at ages 9; 11; 13; and 15. Overall bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) decreasedwith age. While the response at age 9 was significantly related to responsiveness; symptomseverity; and low lung function at age 15; these relationships were much closer whenbronchial response levels after age 9 were taken into account. Also; among children whowere unresponsive to methacholine at age 15; those with previous BHR had more frequentwheeze and lower lung function than those whose previous tests were all unresponsive.Both the overall tendency to BHR and the tendency to retain BHR were closely related tohigh serum IgE levels (determined at age 11) and to positive allergy skin tests (determinedat age 13). These evidences of allergy; closely related to the severity and course of …,American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,1995,104
Infant gut microbiota and the hygiene hypothesis of allergic disease: impact of household pets and siblings on microbiota composition and diversity,Meghan B Azad; Theodore Konya; Heather Maughan; David S Guttman; Catherine J Field; Malcolm R Sears; Allan B Becker; James A Scott; Anita L Kozyrskyj; CHILD Study Investigators,Multiple studies have demonstrated that early-life exposure to pets or siblings affordsprotection against allergic disease; these associations are commonly attributed to the“hygiene hypothesis”. Recently; low diversity of the infant gut microbiota has also beenlinked to allergic disease. In this study; we characterize the infant gut microbiota in relation topets and siblings. The study population comprised a small sub-sample of 24 healthy; fullterm infants from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) birthcohort. Mothers reported on household pets and siblings. Fecal samples were collected at 4months of age; and microbiota composition was characterized by high-throughput signaturegene sequencing. Microbiota richness and diversity tended to be increased in infants livingwith pets; whereas these measures were decreased in infants with older siblings.

However; many constitutional and environmental factors affect FENO;making it difficult to devise reference values. Our aim was to evaluate the relative importanceof factors affecting FENO in a well characterised adult population. Data were obtained from895 members of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study at age 32.The effects of sex; height; weight; lung function indices; smoking; atopy; asthma and rhinitison FENO were explored by unadjusted and adjusted linear regression analyses. The effectof sex on FENO was both statistically and clinically significant; with FENO levelsapproximately 25% less in females.

75 deaths in asthmatics prescribed home nebulisers.,MR Sears; HH Rea; J Fenwick; AJ Gillies; PE Holst; TV O'Donnell; RP Rothwell,The circumstances surrounding the deaths of 75 asthmatic patients who had beenprescribed a domiciliary nebuliser driven by an air compressor pump for administration ofhigh dose beta sympathomimetic drugs were investigated as part of the New Zealandnational asthma mortality study. Death was judged unavoidable in 19 patients who seemedto have precipitous attacks despite apparently good long term management. Delays inseeking medical help because of overreliance on beta agonist delivered by nebuliser wereevident in 12 cases and possible in a further 11; but these represented only 8% of the 271verified deaths from asthma in New Zealanders aged under 70 during the period.

Effects of cannabis on lung function: a population-based cohort study,Robert J Hancox; Richie Poulton; Margaret Ely; David Welch; D Robin Taylor; Christene R McLachlan; Justina M Greene; Terrie E Moffitt; Avshalom Caspi; Malcolm R Sears,The effects of cannabis on lung function remain unclear and may be different from those oftobacco. We compared the associations between use of these substances and lung functionin a population-based cohort (n= 1;037). Cannabis and tobacco use were reported at ages18; 21; 26 and 32 yrs. Spirometry; plethysmography and carbon monoxide transfer factorwere measured at 32 yrs. Associations between lung function and exposure to eachsubstance were adjusted for exposure to the other substance. Cumulative cannabis use wasassociated with higher forced vital capacity; total lung capacity; functional residual capacityand residual volume. Cannabis was also associated with higher airway resistance but notwith forced expiratory volume in 1 s; forced expiratory ratio or transfer factor.

Systemic inflammation and lung function in young adults,Robert J Hancox; Richie Poulton; Justina M Greene; Susan Filsell; Christene R McLachlan; Finn Rasmussen; D Robin Taylor; Michael JA Williams; Avis Williamson; Malcolm R Sears,Background: Impaired lung function is associated with systemic inflammation and is a riskfactor for cardiovascular disease in older adults. It is unknown when these associationsemerge and to what extent they are mediated by smoking; chronic airways disease; and/orestablished atherosclerosis. We explored the association between the forced expiratoryvolume in one second (FEV 1) and the systemic inflammatory marker C-reactive protein(CRP) in young adults. Methods: Associations between spirometric lung function and bloodCRP were assessed in a population based birth cohort of approximately 1000 NewZealanders at ages 26 and 32 years. Analyses adjusted for height and sex to account fordifferences in predicted lung function and excluded pregnant women.

Allergic disorders and attention deficit disorder in children,Rob McGee; Warren R Stanton; Malcolm R Sears,Abstract It has been suggested that children with attention deficit disorder-hyperactivity(ADDH) are likely to show allergic disorders; and that both ADDH and allergic disorders mayshare a common biological background. In a large sample of children from the generalpopulation we found no association between parent; teacher; and self-reports of ADDHbehaviors and a history of allergic disorders (asthma; eczema; rhinitis; and urticaria) at ages9 or 13 years. Similarly; reports of ADDH behaviors at age 13 years were not related to levelof atopic responsiveness by skin test or serum IgE levels. Our findings call into question thehypothesis that there is a relationship between ADDH and allergic disorder.,Journal of abnormal child psychology,1993,84
Spatial analysis for environmental health research: concepts; methods; and examples,Michael Jerrett; Richard Burnett; Mark Goldberg; Malcolm Sears; Daniel Krewski; Rachel Catalan; Pavlos Kanaroglou; Chris Giovis; Norm Finkelstein,Spatial analysis can illuminate environmental health research in two ways. First; spatialanalysis may suggest possible causal factors in disease pathogenesis. Association betweendisease and place may imply that the population living there either possesses inherent traitsthat make it more susceptible to disease or experiences elevated exposure to a risk factorsuch as air pollution. Second; spatial analysis can help identify how populations adapt andrelate to their environment. This knowledge may lead to improved understanding of howpeople perceive and avoid health risks of environmental origin. The potential for spatialanalysis to uncover these aspects of the association between health and the environment islimited by data and methodological problems that are discussed in the article.

Deaths from asthma in New Zealand.,MR Sears; HH Rea; J Fenwick; R Beaglehole; AJ Gillies; PE Holst; TV O'Donnell; RP Rothwell; DC Sutherland,We report the first complete population based study of childhood deaths due to asthma. Alldeaths ascribed to asthma in New Zealand children aged 0-14 were investigated as part of atwo year national study of mortality from asthma. The 16 children who died from asthma alldeveloped asthma by the age of 4; 15 had a family history of asthma; and 12 had associatedatopic disorders. Disturbed pyschosocial relationships were evident in eight families. Sevenchildren died in less than three hours from the onset of their final attack. All children diedoutside hospital. Mortality from asthma in Maori children (3.14 per 100 000) was five timesthat of European children. With hindsight; factors which if avoided could have led to adifferent outcome were identified in eleven cases.

The beta-agonist controversy,D Robin Taylor; Malcolm R Sears; Donald W Cockcroft,BACKGROUND Despite widespread use of adrenergic agents in the management ofasthma for many decades; doubts have emerged concerning the safety and efficacy of long-term inhaled beta-agonist therapy. Various strands of evidence have raised disturbingquestions; and the place of the widely used short-acting beta-agonists; such as fenoterol;orciprenaline; salbutamol; and terbutaline; as well as the newer longer-acting agentssalmeterol and formoterol is being reexamined. Increasing morbidity and mortality rates frombronchial asthma in many countries during the late 1970s and 1980s generated muchconcern.

Increasing asthma mortality—fact or artifact?,Malcolm R Sears,Reported mortality from asthma in young people has gradually increased in severalcountries between the late 1970s and the mid-1980s.'In a review of trends in mortality fromasthma in the United States between 1979 and 1984; Sly* discusses a number of interestingobservations with regard to changing mortality rates. The fundamental question to beanswered; however; is whether the apparent increase in asthma mortality is real or anartifact of certification and coding. If it is real; what is its cause and its cure? Theinterpretation of trends in asthma mortality data was temporarily confused by the introductionof the Ninth Revision of the World Health Organization International Classification ofDiseases into general use in 1979.3 Under the eighth revision; deaths of persons certifiedas dying of asthma but with mention of bronchitis were coded as caused by bronchitis; but …,Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,1988,77
Evolution of asthma through childhood,MR Sears,Abstract The greatest incidence of childhood asthma is among males under 5 years; withdecreasing numbers of new cases with age. Many young children wheeze; but remission iscommon especially in non-atopic children without a family history of allergy or asthma;whose wheezing relates more to infections and environmental tobacco smoke exposure.The prognosis of childhood asthma is best established from population studies; in whichsome two-thirds of wheezy children become symptom-free as adults; whereas follow-upstudies of wheezing children seen in office or specialty clinic practice; who generally havemore severe asthma; show a much greater likelihood (60–80%) of persistence of asthmainto adulthood. Factors predisposing to persistence of childhood asthma include a positivefamily history; development of atopy; environmental exposures to allergens and cigarette …,Clinical and Experimental Allergy,1998,76
Epidemiological trends in asthma,Malcolm R Sears,Many markers of asthma morbidity have shown substantial increases over the past twodecades; including family physician visits; use of anti-asthma medications; emergency roomvisits and hospital admissions. The reported prevalence of diagnosed asthma and ofwheezing has increased; especially in children; with accompanying evidence of increasedatopy and increased airway responsiveness. Allergen exposure and parental smoking aresignificant risk factors for childhood wheezing; whereas the influence of outdoor air pollutionis uncertain. Increasing use of beta-agonist treatment; which appears to increase theseverity of asthma by increasing early and late responses to allergen; may contribute toincreased morbidity and mortality; especially if potent beta-agonists are used. Risk factorsfor asthma mortality include age; smoking; allergy and airway lability; as well as over …,Canadian Respiratory Journal,1996,75
Consequences of long-term inflammation: the natural history of asthma,Malcolm R Sears,The spectrum of clinical asthma is broad; ranging from occasional mild wheezing orcoughing on exertion to severe; persistent disease that occasionally can be fatal. Asthma; bydefinition; is characterized by airway narrowing; which; at least initially; is fully reversible. 51The course of asthma is characterized by apparent remission in some instances; andpersistence and worsening in others. The effects of treatment on the" natural history" ofasthma remain uncertain. The natural history of childhood asthma has been described inmore than 50 studies. 24 Different outcomes have been reported; some studies suggestingthat asthma improves or remits in adolescence and adulthood; and other studies reportingthat most asthma persists; and may worsen with age. Some of the apparent conflict in thereported natural history of childhood asthma is related to the selection of the population in …,Clinics in chest medicine,2000,72
Epidemiology,Malcolm R Sears,This chapter discusses the epidemiology of asthma in children and adults. Asthma; orvariable airflow obstruction; is recognized from a pattern of one or more characteristicsymptoms—including wheeze; cough; chest tightness; and dyspnea—and is best confirmedby the evidence of variable or reversible airflow obstruction accompanying symptoms. Inchildren; asthma-causing nocturnal or postexercise cough may be misdiagnosed asbronchitis or infection. Factors relevant to the development of asthma may be inherent (sex;genetic predisposition; and lung size) or external (diet; exposure to allergens; air pollutionincluding environmental tobacco smoke exposure; infection; socioeconomic status; andregion of residence).

Atopy in childhood. III. Relationship with pulmonary function and airway responsiveness,MR Sears; B Burrows; GP Herbison; EM Flannery; MD Holdaway,Summary The relationship between atopy and pulmonary function in children; and howthese relate directly or indirectly to airway hyperresponsivcness; is uncertain. We haveexamined these relationships in a sample of 13-year-old children. A questionnaire onrespiratory symptoms; skin-prick tests to 11 common allergens; spirometry and anabbreviated methacholine challenge test were completed by 662 members (341 boys) of abirth cohort of New Zealand children followed longitudinally to age 13. There was asignificant relationship between the presence and degree of atopy; and baseline pulmonaryfunction. Low FEV 1/VC ratios were associated with a greater likelihood of airwayresponsiveness; not only in subjects with diagnosed asthma; but also in the full cohort and inthe sub-group of 426 children who denied asthma or current wheeze.

Findings from a cohort study,AM Meldrum; WM Thomson; BK Drummond; MR Sears,A link between dental caries and asthma (either the con- dition per se or the commonly usedanti-asthma inhalant medications) has biological credibility; but there is only limited clinical andepidemiological support for such an as- sociation. The international literature; however; presentsfew studies investigating the relationship between asthma and oral disease. Previous attemptsto investigate the asso- ciation have produced conflicting results and mostly equiv- ocal conclusions[Hyyppa et al.; 1979; Hyyppa and Paunio; 1979; Bjerkeborn et al.; 1987; Kankaala et al.;1998; McDerra et al.; 1998]. Two factors are largely responsible for this current lack ofconsensus. First; both asthma and caries are chronic conditions with variable presentations;complex aetiologies and challenges in diagnosis which complicate attempts to study them.Second; most reported studies have been of cross-sectional design and have in- volved …,Caries research,2001,69
Elevated B cells in sputum of asthmatics. Close correlation with eosinophils.,Joseph C Kidney; ALBERT G Wong; Ann Efthimiadis; Marilyn M Morris; Malcolm R Sears; Jerry Dolovich; Frederick E Hargreave,Sputum examination is a useful noninvasive method to study airway inflammation. Weinvestigated the reproducibility and validity of the measurements of lymphocyte subsets inthe sputum of 11 stable patients with asthma and 10 nonasthmatic smokers. Sputum wasdispersed with 0.1% dithiothreitol. A differential cell count was made with Wright's stain.Aliquots were stained with antibodies to CD19 (B cells); CD3 (T cells); CD4 (helper); CD8(suppressor); and the activation marker CD25 (IL2 receptor) on T-cell subsets and wereassayed by flow cytometry. Sputum from patients with asthma compared with nonasthmaticsubjects had more eosinophils (mean+/-SEM; 32.5+/-8.5 versus 1.3+/-0.5%; p< 0.01) and ahigher proportion of lymphocytes that were B cells (16.2+/-3.2 versus 4.0+/-1.0%; p< 0.01);and these correlated closely with the eosinophils (r= 0.8; p< 0.01).

Physical exercise and resistive breathing training in severe chronic airways obstruction--are they effective?,DT Jones; RJ Thomson; MR Sears,Abstract Twenty-one patients with severe chronic irreversible airflow obstruction (FEV1consistently less than 1.2 l) were allocated randomly to one of two training programmesdesigned to reduce respiratory disability or a placebo training control group. Daily structuredphysical exercise; twice daily inspiratory muscle training by resistive breathing; or dailyplacebo training were undertaken for 10 weeks; and the effects on lung function; exercisecapacity; respiratory symptoms and psychological state compared. Maximal work achievedon a progressive bicycle exercise test was significantly increased in all groups (36%; 23%and 34% respectively) and global improvement in mood also occurred. There was nosignificant change in respiratory symptom score; static lung function tests or 12 min walkingdistance. Neither form of active treatment showed superiority over placebo training.,European journal of respiratory diseases,1985,68

The effect of size and age of subject on airway responsiveness in children.,Peter N Le Souëf; Malcolm R Sears; Duane Sherrill,Methodologies used to assess airway responsiveness (AR) in children administer the samedosage schedule to all children despite the great range in the size of subjects. The aim ofthis study was to examine the hypothesis that the level of AR is size dependent within same-age cohorts and between different ages. Among a birth cohort of 1;037 New Zealandchildren participating in a longitudinal study; 818 had at least two measurements of airwayresponsiveness between ages 9 and 15 yr. Each child performed spirometry and a four-dose methacholine inhalation test. A continuous slope index of methacholineresponsiveness was computed. AR slope indexes were analyzed using longitudinalmethods; which included an indicator variable for subjects who reported having anywheeze.

Leptin; adiponectin; and asthma: findings from a population-based cohort study,Tim JT Sutherland; Malcolm R Sears; Christene R McLachlan; Richie Poulton; Robert J Hancox,Background Obesity is thought to increase the risk of asthma; especially in women. It hasbeen proposed that this association could be due to the immune-modulating effect ofadipokines secreted by adipose tissue. Objective To investigate whether aspects of theasthma phenotype are associated with higher levels of the proinflammatory adipokine leptinand lower levels of the anti-inflammatory adipokine adiponectin in a cross-sectional analysisof a group of young adults. Methods Associations between leptin and adiponectin and adiagnosis of asthma; symptoms of wheeze; bronchodilator response; airflow obstruction; andexhaled nitric oxide were evaluated by logistic or linear regression in a population-basedbirth cohort of approximately 1;000 men and women aged 32 years.

Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis,MR Sears; AR Chang; AJ Taylor,Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis is a rare condition of unknown aetiology which isemerging from obscurity and being more frequently recognized. The case histories of twopatients; one of whom is the oldest reported case in the literature; are described. In one caseextensive fibrosis of interstitial tissue was present and many calcospherites appeared to lieoutside the alveolar spaces. Calcospherites were also found in the bronchial wall of thispatient; and this has not previously been reported. The lungs were analysed for calcium;phosphate; and iron; and detailed respiratory function tests were done in one patient; allresults were similar to those previously reported in this condition.,Thorax,1971,61
Cigarette smoking and allergic sensitization: a 32-year population-based cohort study,Robert J Hancox; David Welch; Richie Poulton; D Robin Taylor; Christene R McLachlan; Justina M Greene; Malcolm R Sears,Background Cigarette smoke has immunosuppressant effects; but its effect on allergicsensitization is unclear. Objective To investigate associations between parental andpersonal smoking and skin prick tests (SPTs) for atopy in a population-based birth cohort of1037 participants followed to adulthood. Methods Parental history of atopic disease;parental smoking; and personal smoking were obtained at multiple assessments betweenbirth and age 32 years. Atopy was assessed by SPTs for 11 common inhaled allergens atages 13 and 32 years. Results Children of atopic parents were less likely to have positiveSPTs at age 13 years if either parent smoked (odds ratio; 0.55; P=. 009). This associationwas not significant after adjusting for breast-feeding history; number of siblings; andchildhood socioeconomic status.

Spatial analysis of air pollution and childhood asthma in Hamilton; Canada: comparing exposure methods in sensitive subgroups,Talar Sahsuvaroglu; Michael Jerrett; Malcolm R Sears; Rob McConnell; Norm Finkelstein; Altaf Arain; Bruce Newbold; Rick Burnett,Variations in air pollution exposure within a community may be associated with asthmaprevalence. However; studies conducted to date have produced inconsistent results;possibly due to errors in measurement of the exposures. A standardized asthma survey wasadministered to children in grades one and eight in Hamilton; Canada; in 1994–95 (N~1467). Exposure to air pollution was estimated in four ways:(1) distance from roadways;(2)interpolated surfaces for ozone; sulfur dioxide; particulate matter and nitrous oxides fromseven to nine governmental monitoring stations;(3) a kriged nitrogen dioxide (NO2) surfacebased on a network of 100 passive NO2 monitors; and (4) a land use regression (LUR)model derived from the same monitoring network.

Trends in asthma mortality in young people in southern Brazil,Jose Miguel Chatkin; Sergio Menna Barreto; Nivaldo Almeida Fonseca; Carlos A Gutiérrez; Malcolm R Sears,Background Mortality from asthma increased and is now declining in some countries; butlittle is known about these trends in South America. Objective We aimed to assess trends inmortality from asthma in southern Brazil in children and young adults. Methods Deathcertificates of 425 people in the state of Rio Grande do Sul aged between 5 and 39 years inwhom asthma was reported to be the underlying cause of death during the period 1970 to1992 were reviewed. Population data were available in 10-year age groups. Testing fortrends in mortality rates was conducted using linear and log-linear regression procedures.Results Asthma mortality rates in the age groups 5 to 19 and 20 to 39 years ranged between0.04 and 0.39/100;000 and 0.28 to 0.75/100;000; respectively; and were nonuniformlydistributed over the study period.

Cats and dogs and the risk of atopy in childhood and adulthood,Piush J Mandhane; Malcolm R Sears; Richie Poulton; Justina M Greene; WY Wendy Lou; D Robin Taylor; Robert J Hancox,Background Exposure to cats and dogs during childhood has been linked to a lower risk ofdeveloping allergies. It remains unclear whether this is due to selective avoidance of pets byfamilies with a history of allergies. The effects of pet ownership in adulthood are unknown.Objectives We sought to assess the association between cat and dog ownership inchildhood and early adulthood and the development of atopy in a population-based birthcohort of 1037 subjects. Methods Ownership of cats or dogs between birth and age 9 yearsand between the ages of 18 and 32 years was reported. Skin prick tests to commonallergens were performed at 13 and 32 years.

Epidemiology of asthma: risk factors for development,Padmaja Subbarao; Allan Becker; Jeffrey R Brook; Denise Daley; Piush J Mandhane; Gregory E Miller; Stuart E Turvey; Malcolm R Sears,This comprehensive review of the recent literature was undertaken to determine the currentstate of knowledge of the risk factors involved in the development of asthma in order to focusinvestigations in a proposed new longitudinal birth cohort study. The origins of asthmaappear to lie in the prenatal and early postnatal period; and renewed investigations in thisperiod with long-term close follow-up and objective phenotypic characterization will help tounravel the role of the multiple putative environmental factors in the development of asthma.It is only after understanding these effects that one can hope to design rational preventionstudies for asthma.,Expert review of clinical immunology,2009,48
Mapping health on the Internet: A new tool for environmental justice and public health research,John C Maclachlan; Michael Jerrett; Tom Abernathy; Malcolm Sears; Martin J Bunch,Abstract This paper examines the prospects for integrating Internet platform GIS or 'web-GIS'into environmental justice and related public health research. Specifically; we documentthe development of a web-GIS created for investigating relationships between health; airquality and socioeconomic factors in Hamilton; Canada. After development of the web-GISsite; we assembled a focus group of public health professionals to test functionality andrender opinions about the potential of the site and geographic information in their programimplementation. Results show overwhelming support for the further integration of GIS intopublic health practice. The results also underscore the potential of web-GIS to alleviateconcerns of cost and data availability that often limit the use of GIS in community debatescentred on environmental justice issues.,Health & place,2007,47
Growing up with asthma.,Malcolm R Sears,Childhood asthma has been regarded as relatively benign and a condition that childrenoften" grow out of." Recently; however; investigators have reported higher prevalence ofasthma in childrenl 2 and more frequent persistence of childhood asthma into adult life. 3Hence further studies on factors predicting remission or persistence of childhood asthma;and the development of adult asthma; are welcomed. Two papers in this week's journaldescribe outcomes of asthma in cohorts ofAustralian children. Both longitudinal studiesbegan in the 1960s and both followed up children recruited at age 7 until their 30s. Onemight therefore expect the findings of the two studies to be similar. Nevertheless; Jenkins etal conclude that" children with asthma reported by their parents were more likely than not tobe free of symptoms as adults"(p 90) 4 while Oswald et al conclude that" many children …,BMJ: British Medical Journal,1994,47
Safety of long-acting β-agonists: are new data really required?,Malcolm R Sears,Despite 20 years of debate; several US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) hearings; black-box warnings; and many descriptive articles and metaanalyses; controversy regarding thesafety of long-acting β-agonist (LABA) treatment in asthma patients continues. This hasresulted in a recent call for another large and definitive safety study. This commentaryfocuses first on data provided in the metaanalysis recently undertaken by the FDA of safetyoutcomes among 60;954 individuals in 110 LABA trials; and second on the sample size thatwould be required for a new definitive study of LABA safety in the presence of mandatorytreatment with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS).

Regular beta-adrenergic agonists: evidence; not reassurance; is what is needed,D Robin Taylor; Malcolm R Sears,In a recent article; Ziment [1] argued strongly that the move against the regular use ofinhaled [beta] agonist drugs in the management of bronchial asthma is unjustified; statingthat" standard practice has not been shown to be inappropriate except in a few parochialstudies" and that arguments to the contrary have promoted a" baseless retreat from thefavorable findings of the overwhelming majority of physicians."While we recognize Ziment's[1] desire to minimize anxiety arising from recent doubts about the role of [beta] agonisttreatment; we are concerned that support for" standard practice" is itself largely" baseless"and dependent on experiential rather than scientific evidence. Indeed; it is one of theparadoxes of regular [beta] agonist use-namely; that immediate beneficial and chronicadverse effects may both occur-which has obscured the real impact of using these agents …,Chest,1994,46

Trends in the prevalence of asthma,Malcolm R Sears,The asthma epidemic of the last few decades may have peaked; studies suggest that theincidence and prevalence of asthma has decreased in some countries in the last few years;although other studies suggest continuing small increases in prevalence. Increasingawareness and changing diagnostic habits make precise evaluation of epidemiologic trendsdifficult in the absence of a gold-standard test for asthma; and on a global basis uncertaintypersists. Trends in prevalence in some populations (eg; immigrants; farming communities)suggest both adverse and beneficial effects of specific environmental factors.

Quality of life during formoterol treatment: comparison between asthma-specific and generic questionnaires. Canadian and the Dutch Formoterol Investigators,T Van der Molen; MR Sears; CS De Graaff; DS Postma; B ft Meyboom-de Jong,This study aimed to investigate the effect of treating patients with moderate asthma withformoterol on quality of life (QoL) and to compare several questionnaires in their ability todetect changes in QoL. In an eight month multicentre; randomized; placebo-controlled trial;patients with asthma using daily inhaled corticosteroids and beta2-agonists (> or= 5inhalations x week (-1)) were randomized to 6 months treatment with formoterol 24 microgbid (by Turbuhaler) or a matching placebo. Patients recorded symptoms (maximal score 21)and peak expiratory flow (PEF) twice daily. QoL was measured with two asthma-specificquestionnaires; the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) and the Living with AsthmaQuestionnaire (LWAQ); and with two generic QoL forms; ie the Short Form 36 (SF36) and thePsychological and General Well-Being scale (PGWB) at randomization and after 6 …,European Respiratory Journal,1998,45
Why are deaths from asthma increasing?,MR Sears,Abstract Asthma mortality rates have declined only slowly since 1960; and recently haveincreased in some countries. Deaths in New Zealand's 5-34 year olds showed a sustainedincrease from 1977 to 1982. In the western United States; asthma mortality in older subjectsincreased from 1979 to 1982. In 15-44 year olds in England and Wales; mortality rates forfemales are now lower than in 1960; but rates for males are not. Current asthma mortalityrates for Canadian 5-34 year olds are twice those reported a decade ago. A 2-year nationalstudy of all New Zealand patients under the age of 70 whose deaths were certified as due to;or related to; asthma found differences in verified asthma mortality rates among races(Maoris 18.9; Pacific Island Polynesians 9.4; and Europeans 3.4 per 100;000); the highernon-European rates explained 36% of the'excess' New Zealand mortality compared with …,European journal of respiratory diseases.

Asthma in seven year old children: a report from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Child Development Study.,MR Sears; DT Jones; PA Silva; A Simpson; SM Williams,Abstract The prevalence of asthma between birth and seven years was determined byquestionnaire in 875 children as part of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Child DevelopmentStudy. From the combinations of asthma and/or wheezing reported in association withbronchitis; hayfever; eczema and allergies; a diagnosis of certain or probable asthma wasmade in 12.6 percent of these children. A further 22.6 percent admitted to wheezing; but adiagnosis of asthma could not be made with any certainty. Bronchitis was reportedfrequently; usually associated with wheezing. Children with more obvious asthma showed amale preponderance and significant differences in body build and school attendancecompared with asymptomatic children.,The New Zealand medical journal,1982,45
Increased peak flow variability in children with asymptomatic hyperresponsiveness,PG Gibson; S Mattoli; MR Sears; J Dolovich; FE Hargreave,The relevance of increased methacholine airway responsiveness detected in children withno current or past symptoms of asthma is not known. We wished to determine whether thepresence of airway hyperresponsiveness in asymptomatic children is also associated withabnormal variability of peak expiratory flow (PEF). In 12 asymptomatic children withmethacholine hyperresponsiveness; we examined the diurnal variation of peak expiratoryflow (PEF) and response to inhaled bronchodilator. Twelve asthmatic children with acomparable range of methacholine hyperresponsiveness; and 12 normal children withoutmethacholine responsiveness; were used as positive and negative controls. The childrenwere aged 11 (range 9-14) yrs.

This report from theInternational Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) examines the agreementbetween the ISAAC video questionnaires on respiratory symptoms and reported asthma.Between December 1993 and April 1995; 4952 children aged 13–14 years in two Canadiancommunities completed sequentially the ISAAC written and video questionnaires at school.The agreement between responses to the two questionnaires for reported wheeze ever;current wheeze; wheeze on exercise; and nocturnal wheeze (the latter three questions …,Pediatric pulmonology,2000,40
Lessons from the national asthma mortality study: deaths in hospital.,RP Rothwell; HH Rea; MR Sears; R Beaglehole; AJ Gillies; PE Holst; TV O'Donnell,Abstract The circumstances surrounding 38 deaths from asthma in hospital in NewZealanders under 70 years of age between August 1981 and July 1983 have beenanalysed. Twelve deaths did not appear to be preventable; all but one occurring in chronicsevere asthmatics despite apparently optimal therapy. Critical delays by patients or relativesin seeking medical help occurred in six cases; and inadequate assessment of severity andundertreatment by medical practitioners prior to the patient reaching hospital was a majorcontributing factor in a further six deaths. In four cases; insufficient speed and indecisivetreatment in the accident and emergency department appeared to contribute to death.

Changing patterns in asthma morbidity and mortality.,MR Sears,Abstract Asthma morbidity and mortality have increased in many countries over the last 10years or more. In some countries; epidemics of deaths have occurred; while others haveshown gradual increases. The New Zealand National Asthma Mortality Study associatedmortality with severe asthma; underassessment of severity; undertreatment withcorticosteroids; overreliance on bronchodilators; discontinuity of medical care and delay inseeking help. Case-control studies of asthma mortality in New Zealand linked prescription offenoterol with a higher risk of death from asthma than prescription of salbutamol; this higherrisk was not negated by adjustment for markers of severity. A study in Saskatchewan;Canada confirmed the increased risk associated with fenoterol use; but also found asignificantly elevated risk associated with salbutamol; especially at higher doses.

Asthma treatment: inhaled beta-agonists.,MR Sears,Abstract Short acting beta-agonists provide symptom relief with a rapid onset ofbronchodilation; and protect against exercise-induced asthma and the early asthmaticresponse to allergen. They remain the most commonly prescribed form of therapy in asthma.However; regular use as maintenance therapy for chronic asthma is no longerrecommended. Frequent use increases airway hyper-responsiveness to allergen andnonspecific challenge; and in some studies has been associated with decreased control ofasthma. Excessive use of short acting beta-agonists is associated with a higher risk of fatalor near-fatal asthma; with a dose-response relationship. High doses of short acting beta-agonist in combination with oxygen and corticosteroid therapy remains the most appropriatetreatment for acute severe asthma in the emergency room situation.

Serum total IgE in normal subjects and the influence of a family history of allergy,MR Sears; CM Chow; DJ Morseth,Summary The purpose of this study was to establish the range of serum totalimmunoglobulin E (IgE) in a healthy population free of personal and family history of allergy;and to determine whether a family history of allergy influenced serum IgE levels. Usingcommercially available Phadebas reagents; the mean serum IgE in eighty-four adults aged17–30 years with no personal or family history of allergy was found to be 38.8 iu/ml. Seventy-five percent of subjects had a serum IgE below 50 iu/ml and in only one subject was serumIgE in excess of 150 iu/ml; which we suggest be taken as the upper limit of normal. Whenhealthy subjects with no personal history but with a family history of allergy were includedwith this normal population; the mean serum IgE in 207 subjects was 95.4 iu/ml and theupper limit of the distribution curve over 200 iu/ml; suggesting an influence of genetic …,Clinical & Experimental Allergy,1980,38

Lung function decline in asthma,MR Sears,Progressive decline in lung function in asthma has been well recognised but not fullyexplained. For example; in a Danish population study (the Copenhagen City Heart Study);three measurements of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) were made over 15yrs in 17;506 subjects; including 1;095 with asthma [1]. Asthmatics showed a decline inFEV1 of 38 mL? yr-1 compared with 22 mL? yr-1 in normal individuals. However;accelerated decline is not invariable. Many asthmatics retain normal or close to normal lungfunction throughout life; showing reversibility from acute worsenings and return to previousfunction.

Predicting asthma outcomes,Malcolm R Sears,This review addresses predictors of remission or persistence of wheezing and asthma fromearly childhood through adulthood. Early childhood wheezing is common; but predictingwho will remit or have persistent childhood asthma remains difficult. By adding parentalhistory of asthma and selected infant biomarkers to the history of recurrent wheezing; theAsthma Predictive Index and its subsequent modifications provide better predictions ofpersistence than simply the observation of recurrent wheeze. Sensitization; especially tomultiple allergens; increases the likelihood of development of classic childhood asthma.Remission is more likely in male subjects and those with milder disease (less frequent andless severe symptoms); less atopic sensitization; a lesser degree of airwayhyperresponsiveness; and no concomitant allergic disease. Conversely; persistence is …,*,2015,27

Is chronic asthma associated with shorter leukocyte telomere length at midlife?,Daniel W Belsky; Idan Shalev; Malcolm R Sears; Robert J Hancox; Hona Lee Harrington; Renate Houts; Terrie E Moffitt; Karen Sugden; Benjamin Williams; Richie Poulton; Avshalom Caspi,Rationale: Asthma is prospectively associated with age-related chronic diseases andmortality; suggesting the hypothesis that asthma may relate to a general; multisystemphenotype of accelerated aging. Objectives: To test whether chronic asthma is associatedwith a proposed biomarker of accelerated aging; leukocyte telomere length. Methods:Asthma was ascertained prospectively in the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health andDevelopment Study cohort (n= 1;037) at nine in-person assessments spanning ages 9–38years. Leukocyte telomere length was measured at ages 26 and 38 years. Asthma wasclassified as life-course-persistent; childhood-onset not meeting criteria for persistence; andadolescent/adult-onset. We tested associations between asthma and leukocyte telomerelength using regression models.

Cohort studies are a powerful observational design for studying exposure–response relationships; but their power depends in part upon the accuracy of the exposureassessment. Objective The purpose of this paper is to summarize and discuss issues thatmake accurate exposure assessment a challenge and to suggest strategies for improvingexposure assessment in longitudinal cohort studies of childhood asthma and allergies.,Environmental health perspectives,2011,23
The addition of long-acting beta-agonists to inhaled corticosteroids in asthma,Malcolm R Sears,Summary The safe use of LABAs; which are clearly effective in many patients with moderateto severe asthma; requires high compliance with ICS therapy; which is best assured if ICSand LABA are provided in a single inhaler.,Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,2011,23
A case for serial examination of sputum inflammatory cells,AG Wong; ID Pavord; MR Sears; FE Hargreave,In the case reported; serial evaluation of sputum inflammatory cell counts made it possible toidentify an unusual series of events in a man with eosinophilic bronchitis. The patient initiallypresented with a productive cough; which did not respond to treatment with antibiotics orhigh-dose inhaled corticosteroids. A diagnosis of eosinophilic bronchitis was made afterdemonstration of intense sputum eosinophilia. When inhaled corticosteroids were stopped;symptoms and sputum eosinophilia became worse and airway hyperresponsivenessdeveloped. Both abnormalities were reversed by a course of prednisone. When theprednisone was stopped the productive cough recurred but on this occasion sputumexamination suggested a different disease process and the symptoms resolved after acourse of co-trimoxazole. The patient has subsequently remained well on no treatment …,European Respiratory Journal,1996,23
Use of anti-asthma drugs in New Zealand.,BARBARA L Sinclair; DW Clark; MALCOLM R Sears,Increased sales of anti-asthma drugs; and a second" epidemic" of asthma mortality; raisedconcerns about the management of asthma in New Zealand. To study this; prescriptionswere obtained from randomly selected pharmacies to identify 235 patients receiving onecommon anti-asthma drug; 175 of whom were willing to be interviewed. The authorsconsidered that 80% had asthma; and only 20% suffered primarily from chronic bronchitis oremphysema. The increased sales of anti-asthma drugs could not therefore be explained bytheir increasing use in treatment of other respiratory disorders. One third of the identifiedasthmatic subjects experienced daily symptoms despite regular drug treatment. Inhaledcorticosteroids were used by only 42% of this group with persistent symptoms.

Bronchial asthma: lack of relationships between allergic factors; illness severity and psychosocial variables in adult patients attending an asthma clinic,Bruce J Spittle; Malcolm R Sears,Synopsis The relationships between illness severity; allergy as indicated by serum totalimmunoglobulin E; and various psychological and social factors were studied in 66 adultasthmatics. No substantial relationships were found between these factors. An earlier onsetof illness before 3 years was associated with a higher serum IgE. These results do notsupport the commonly held concept that asthma is a 'psychosomatic'disorder.,Psychological medicine,1984,22

The evolution of β2-agonists,MR Sears,Abstract β-agonists have been widely used in the treatment of asthma for many years.Although concerns have been expressed over their safety; based largely upon epidemics ofincreased mor tality in asthmatics associated with high doses of isoprenaline in the 1960sand fenoterolin the 1970s and 1980s; the specific β 2-agonists are vital drugs in asthmamanagement. The short-acting β 2-agonists have an important prophylactic role in theprevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction; and are essential in the emergencytreatment of severe asthma. However; little if any benefit seems to be derived from regularuse of short-acting β 2-agonists and regular or frequent use can increase the: severity of thecondition. The development of β 2-agonists with long-acting properties; such as salmeteroland formoterol; has provided advantages over short-acting β-agonists; such as prolonged …,Respiratory medicine,2001,21

Infant gut immunity: a preliminary study of IgA associations with breastfeeding,SL Bridgman; T Konya; MB Azad; MR Sears; AB Becker; SE Turvey; PJ Mandhane; P Subbarao; JA Scott; CJ Field; AL Kozyrskyj; CHILD Study Investigators,Abstract Secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) plays a critical role in gut mucosal immunedefense. Initially provided by breastmilk; IgA production by the infant gut is graduallystimulated by developing gut microbiota. This study reports associations between infantfecal IgA concentrations 4 months after birth; breastfeeding status and other pre/postnatalexposures in 47 infants in the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development cohort.Breastfed infants and first-born infants had higher median fecal IgA concentrations (23.11 v.9.34 µg/g protein; P< 0.01 and 22.19 v. 8.23 µg/g protein; P= 0.04). IgA levels increasedsuccessively with exclusivity of breastfeeding (β-coefficient; 0.37; P< 0.05). This statisticalassociation was independent of maternal parity and household pets.

The effect of cigarette smoking on lung function in young adults with asthma,Robert J Hancox; Andrew R Gray; Richie Poulton; Malcolm R Sears,Rationale: Life-course persistent asthma and tobacco smoking are risk factors forirreversible airflow obstruction. It is often assumed that smoking and asthma have additive ormultiplicative effects on the risk for airflow obstruction; but this has not been demonstrated inprospective studies of children with persistent asthma. Objectives: To investigate the effectsof smoking and asthma on the development of airflow obstruction in a population-basedbirth cohort followed to age 38 years. Methods: Reports of childhood asthma from ages 9;11; and 13 and self-reports of adult asthma at ages 32 and 38 years were used to definechildhood-onset persistent asthma (n= 91); late-onset asthma (n= 93); asthma in remission(n= 85); and nonasthmatic (n= 572) phenotypes.

Inhaled corticosteroids for asthma: common clinical quandaries,Krishnan Parameswaran; Paul M O'Byrne; Malcolm R Sears,This narrative review provides evidence-based explanations to some of the common clinicalconcerns regarding inhaled corticosteroids. Inhaled corticosteroids are the treatment ofchoice for a newly diagnosed asthmatic patient. Better results are obtained when treatmentis initiated as soon as the diagnosis is made. Asthma control can be achieved andmaintained in most patients with a low or moderate dose of inhaled corticosteroidadministered in two daily doses. Longer duration of treatment provides more sustainedbenefits than treatment that is intermittent and for short periods of time. The clinical benefitscan be observed within 24 hours of commencing treatment and may be more pronounced inpatients with an eosinophilic bronchitis. Inhaled corticosteroids provide additional benefitwhen used in conjunction with prednisone in acute severe asthma. Low doses do not …,*,2003,16

Exposure to household furry pets influences the gut microbiota of infants at 3–4 months following various birth scenarios,Hein M Tun; Theodore Konya; Tim K Takaro; Jeffrey R Brook; Radha Chari; Catherine J Field; David S Guttman; Allan B Becker; Piush J Mandhane; Stuart E Turvey; Padmaja Subbarao; Malcolm R Sears; James A Scott; Anita L Kozyrskyj,Early-life exposure to household pets has the capacity to reduce risk for overweight andallergic disease; especially following caesarean delivery. Since there is some evidence thatpets also alter the gut microbial composition of infants; changes to the gut microbiome areputative pathways by which pet exposure can reduce these risks to health. To investigate theimpact of pre-and postnatal pet exposure on infant gut microbiota following various birthscenarios; this study employed a large subsample of 746 infants from the Canadian HealthyInfant Longitudinal Development Study (CHILD) cohort; whose mothers were enrolledduring pregnancy between 2009 and 2012.

Handedness and allergic disorders in a New Zealand cohort,Warren R Stanton; Michael Feehan; Phil A Silva; Malcolm R Sears,Abstract Studies of the proposed association between handedness and allergic disordershave shown results which appear contradictory. In view of differences in the procedures ofthese studies; further tests of the strength of this association are warranted. Results from thisstudy of a large birth cohort of children showed no support for an association betweenhandedness measured at age 7 years and reports of eczema; urticaria; rhinitis; or asthma inlate childhood or early adolescence. There was no significant association found betweenhandedness and reported frequency and duration of symptoms of wheezing; or parentalhelpseeking for these symptoms.

Relevance of birth cohorts to assessment of asthma persistence,Robert J Hancox; Padmaja Subbarao; Malcolm R Sears,Abstract The definition of persistent asthma in longitudinal studies reflects symptomsreported at every assessment with no substantive asymptomatic periods. Early-childhoodwheezing may be transient; especially if it is of viral etiology. Longitudinal studies providegreater opportunity to confirm the diagnosis by variability of symptoms; objectivemeasurements; and therapeutic responses. Several clinical phenotypes of childhoodasthma have been identified; with general consistency between cohorts. Persistentwheezing is often associated with loss of lung function; which is evident from early-childhood and related to persistent inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. Femalesex; atopy; airway responsiveness; and personal smoking; but not exposure toenvironmental tobacco smoke; are risk factors for persistence of childhood asthma into …,Current allergy and asthma reports,2012,13
The epidemiology of asthma exacerbations,NW Johnston; MR Sears,Abstract Asthma exacerbations may be triggered by a number of atmospheric anddomiciliary environmental factors as well as by those encountered in schools andworkplaces. The majority of exacerbations; particularly in children; coincide with respiratoryviral infections; most commonly rhinovirus. As most respiratory viruses and manyaeroallergens appear in seasonal patterns; asthma exacerbations; particularly thoserequiring emergency treatment; show analogous seasonal cycles which differ in form inchildren and adults. While similar in form between the sexes; they differ in amplitude; withboys having higher risks of exacerbation in childhood and women in adult life. Simultaneousexposure of asthmatics with respiratory viral infections to allergens or air pollutants maysignificantly increase the risks of exacerbation.

The safety of long‐acting beta‐agonists: More evidence is needed,Shamsah Kazani; James H Ware; Jeffrey M Drazen; D Robin Taylor; Malcolm R Sears,ABSTRACT There is controversy regarding the possibility that long-acting beta-agonists(LABA) may paradoxically contribute adversely to asthma mortality. While studies and meta-analyses indicate increased risk; epidemiological data indicate a slow fall in asthmamortality since the introduction of LABA. Advocates for LABA propose that mandatorysimultaneous use of inhaled corticosteroids satisfactorily reduce any potential risk. In theface of lingering doubts; others propose that LABA should be withdrawn from use. In this pro–con article; Kazani et al. provide the rationale for a modified randomized controlled trial thatwould define the level of risk more clearly; and provide the basis for a clear judgment to bemade. Sears argues that current knowledge about the risks associated with LABA;especially when prescribed as monotherapy; provides sufficient evidence for clinicians …,Respirology,2010,12
Short-acting beta-agonist research: a perspective,Malcolm R Sears,Asthma mortality increased sharply in New Zealand in 1977; prompting a nationalinvestigation into circumstances of asthma deaths. Subsequent observations of improvedasthma control in subjects withdrawn from regular beta2-agonist treatment raised thequestion of whether asthma severity and; therefore; mortality could relate to frequent beta-agonist use. A randomized controlled trial of regular inhaled fenoterol versus as-neededbronchodilator use showed worsened asthma control during regular treatment despiteconcomitant use of inhaled corticosteroids. Assessment of these findings led to delay in thepublishing of the American Asthma Guidelines; which were modified to suggest caution inusing beta2-agonist treatments. Simultaneously; case control studies in New Zealandsuggested that prescription of fenoterol was a substantial risk factor for asthma mortality …,Canadian respiratory journal,2001,12
An Alternative Method for Comparing and Describing Methacholine Response Curve,Duane L Sherrill; Fernando D Martinez; Malcolm R Sears; Michael D Lebowitz,Tests of nonspecific airway hyperresponsiveness are frequently used in the study of asthmaboth in the clinical settings and in epidemiologic studies. However; standard methods forcharacterizing individual tests and comparing results between subgroups have not beenestablished. The most frequently used method of characterizing response curves is to reportthe dose that results in a 20% fall in FE~ from the initial or baseline FE~ value (PD20FE~).Other investigators have suggested using the response slopes. In this study we demonstratean alternative method of analysis that uses all of each subject's response data; makescomparisons between subgroups; and can include explanatory covariables. This approachis demonstrated using methacholine challenge data obtained in New Zealand children at 9and 11 yr of age. The results showed significant differences between the mean dose …,American Review of Respiratory Disease,1993,12

Thumb-sucking; nail-biting; and atopic sensitization; asthma; and hay fever,Stephanie J Lynch; Malcolm R Sears; Robert J Hancox,BACKGROUND: The hygiene hypothesis suggests that early-life exposure to microbialorganisms reduces the risk of developing allergies. Thumb-sucking and nail-biting arecommon childhood habits that may increase microbial exposures. We tested the hypothesisthat children who suck their thumbs or bite their nails have a lower risk of developing atopy;asthma; and hay fever in a population-based birth cohort followed to adulthood. METHODS:Parents reported children's thumb-sucking and nail-biting habits when their children wereages 5; 7; 9; and 11 years. Atopic sensitization was defined as a positive skin-prick test (≥ 2-mm weal) to≥ 1 common allergen at 13 and 32 years. Associations between thumb-suckingand nail-biting in childhood; and atopic sensitization; asthma; and hay fever at these ageswere assessed by using logistic regression with adjustments for sex and other potential …,Pediatrics,2016,11

Bronchodilator treatment in asthma. Increase in deaths during salmeterol treatment unexplained.,MR Sears; DR Taylor,EDITOR;-Win Castle and colleagues from Glaxo and Allen and Hanbury's describe theresults of a large randomised clinical trial of their bronchodilator; salmeterol. The title of theirpaper includes the phrase" nationwide surveillance study;" which may give the impressionthat it is some form of postmarketing surveillance study. Their study is a postmarketing(phase IV) clinical trial and should not be regarded as any form of postmarketingsurveillance study. The Drug Safety Research Unit is engaged in a postmarketingsurveillance study of comparable size but longer duration. The preliminary results of this withregard to total mortality and mortality from asthma differ remarkably from those described bythe authors. In the Glaxo trial 16787 patients treated with salmeterol were studied for 16weeks. There were 54 deaths from all causes (0.32%); including 12 deaths from asthma …,BMJ: British Medical Journal,1993,11

International trends in asthma mortality,MR Sears,Increasing rates for asthma mortality have been~ eported in many countries over the lastdecade (FIg. I). Through the 1970s; there was generally a gradual reduction in asthmamortality rates in most countries; but this trend reversed through the 1980s; and in somecountries asthma mortality rates in young people have more than doubled. I The increaseshave been more obvious in persons of minority ethnic groups; such as the black populationin the United States2 (Fig. 2) and the Maoris in New Zealand. 3,Allergy and Asthma Proceedings,1991,11
Safety of formoterol in asthma clinical trials: an update,Malcolm R Sears; Finn Radner,Use of long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) in asthma remains controversial; and large safetytrials are in progress. We previously reported safety outcomes with formoterol in 117AstraZeneca asthma trials (78;339 patients; 92% using inhaled corticosteroids (ICS))completed by December 2006; and have now added 32 trials with formoterol (26;124patients; 100% using ICS) completed by December 2011. The primary dataset of 79randomized controlled trials includes 94;684 patients; 67;380 exposed to formoterol; whilethe complete dataset comprises 149 trials and 104;463 patients. There were no new asthma-related deaths in the expanded primary dataset; with 8 asthma-related deaths amongformoterol-randomized and 2 among non-LABA randomized patients (Relative Risk [RR]1.13; 95% CI 0.23–10.9); and 15 vs 9 cardiac-related deaths (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.19–1.22 …,European Respiratory Journal,2013,10

How well do New Zealand patients understand and manage their asthma? A community study.,Barbara L Sinclair; DW Clark; Malcolm R Sears,Abstract Patient understanding of the nature of asthma and of its management wasassessed using an interviewer administered questionnaire in a community sample ofasthmatics identified through prescriptions at randomly selected Dunedin city pharmacies.Of 135 subjects whose histories; and lung function data where available; were consistentwith asthma; 20 did not know they had asthma. Only half could give a simple explanation ofasthma; and many were confused about therapies; especially the use of corticosteroids.Only half demonstrated satisfactory aerosol inhalation technique. Deficiencies in medicalmanagement including lack of lung function monitoring; regular followup and provision of acrisis plan for severe attacks were noted. Patients previously hospitalised more often had acrisis plan and recalled advice on management of asthma; but had little knowledge about …,The New Zealand medical journal,1987,10
The potential to predict the course of childhood asthma,Daniel W Belsky; Malcolm R Sears,Many children experience pre-school or early childhood wheezing. In a significantproportion symptoms disappear as the child grows; but others have persistent andtroublesome asthma which can be life-long. Tools to predict course of disease in youngchildren are a priority for families and clinicians. This review summarizes evidence fromseveral longitudinal population-based birth-cohort studies that have identified risk factors forpersistence and remission of childhood asthma. These factors include clinicalcharacteristics; environmental and other exposures; familial factors; biomarkers of allergicinflammation; measurements of lung function and airway responsiveness; and geneticvariants. This review also introduces the concept of polygenic risk and genetic risk scores;and describes results from a recent study that suggests promise for the use of genetic …,Expert review of respiratory medicine,2014,9
Predicting new and persistent asthma,Malcolm R Sears,Parents of children with asthma often ask;“Will she/he grow out of it?” While many childrendo experience remission (1); longitudinal studies have sometimes provided apparentlyconflicting results. In Australia; only 25% of Tasmanian children with childhood wheezinghad asthma as adults (2); whereas in Melbourne; 70% of those with asthma at age 7 hadasthma at age 35 years (3). However; children with more severe asthma had been added to“enrich” the Melbourne cohort and were considerably more likely to have persistent adultsymptoms; explaining these contradictory reports (4). The frequency of episodes;persistence of airflow obstruction; atopy; and airway responsiveness have all beenconsidered as factors influencing outcomes of childhood asthma (5).

Mortality among subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma at two respiratory disease clinics in Ontario,Murray M Finkelstein; Kenneth R Chapman; R Andrew McIvor; Malcolm R Sears,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are common in Canada and aroundthe world. In 2005; the preva- lence of physician-diagnosed COPD exceeded 7% among bothmen and women 65 years of age or older; while the prevalence of physician- diagnosed asthmaexceeded 8% among Canadians 12 years of age or older (1). Hill et al (2) recently reported aCOPD prevalence of 21% among at-risk subjects; recruited from three Ontario primary careprac- tices; who were 40 years of age or older and who had a smoking history of at least 20pack-years. In a Polish primary care practice; the preva- lence of COPD was 9.3% among patients40 years of age or older (3). COPD is the fourth leading cause of mortality internationally; accountingfor nearly three million deaths annually; and is the only major cause of mortality that is increasingin both developed and developing countries (4).

Accelerated decline in lung function in cigarette smokers is associated with TP53/MDM2 polymorphisms,Robert J Hancox; Richie Poulton; David Welch; Nelly Olova; Christene R McLachlan; Justina M Greene; Malcolm R Sears; Avshalom Caspi; Terrie E Moffitt; Stephen P Robertson; Antony W Braithwaite,Abstract In vitro studies have shown that p53 mediates a protective response against DNAdamage by causing either cell-cycle arrest and DNA repair; or apoptosis. These responseshave not yet been demonstrated in humans. A common source of DNA damage in humansis cigarette smoke; which should activate p53 repair mechanisms. As the level of p53 isregulated by MDM2; which targets p53 for degradation; the G-allele of a polymorphism inintron 1 of MDM2 (rs2279744: G/T); that results in higher MDM2 levels; should be associatedwith a reduced p53 response and hence more DNA damage and corresponding tissuedestruction. Similarly; the alleles of rs1042522 in TP53 that encode arginine (G-allele) orproline (C-allele) at codon 72; which cause increased pro-apoptotic (G-allele) or cell-cyclearrest activities (C-allele); respectively; may moderate p53's ability to prevent DNA …,Human genetics,2009,9
Links between anxiety and allergies: psychobiological reality or possible methodological bias?,Alice M Gregory; Avshalom Caspi; Terrie E Moffitt; Barry J Milne; Richie Poulton; Malcolm R Sears,ABSTRACT The objective of the study was to examine the link between anxiety andallergies to establish whether it reflects a psychobiological reality or a possiblemethodological bias. A cohort of 1;037 children enrolled in the study. Anxiety disorders wereassessed between 11 and 21 years. Anxious personality was assessed at 18 years.Allergies were examined at 21 years by (a) self reports;(b) skin pricks; and (c) serum totalimmunoglobulin E (IgE). Self-reported allergies were predicted by recurrent anxietydisorders (OR [95% CI]= 1.56 [1.06–2.30]; p=. 023) and self-reports of anxious personality(OR [95% CI]= 1.67 [1.17–2.37]; p=. 004): Objectively verified allergies were not. Theseresults suggest that the link between anxiety and allergies may reflect a methodologicalartifact rather than a psychobiological reality.,Journal of personality,2009,9
Deleterious effects of inhaled β-agonists: short-acting and long-acting agents differ,Malcolm R Sears,CHEST/119/5/MAY; 2001 1297 weeks of treatment (J 6.6%) and a within-group worsening ofairway responsiveness (J 1.2 doubling doses) of borderline statistical significance. Incontrast; there were no significant within-group changes in these parameters in asthmaticpatients treated with formoterol or placebo. There was no interaction between the effects ofshort-acting β-agonist and high or low allergen exposure as determined by dust samplesfrom mattress covers assayed for the house dust mite allergen Der p 1. However; the levelsof mite allergen in the subgroup not subject to environmental intervention were not as highas often reported; 24 and so this study does not clearly confirm or negate the suggestion25that regular short-acting β-agonists may exert an adverse effect by enhancingresponsiveness to allergen via mast cell tachyphylaxis.

Systemic inflammation and lung function: A longitudinal analysis,Robert J Hancox; Andrew R Gray; Malcolm R Sears; Richie Poulton,Abstract Background Systemic inflammation is associated with impaired lung function inhealthy adults as well as in patients with lung disease. The mechanism for this association isunknown and it is unclear if systemic inflammation leads to impaired lung function or if poorlung function leads to inflammation. We explored the temporal associations between bloodC-reactive protein (CRP); fibrinogen; and white blood cells; and lung function in youngadults. Methods Spirometry; plethysmography; and diffusion capacity were measured in apopulation-based cohort at ages 32 and 38 years. High-sensitivity CRP; fibrinogen; andwhite blood cells were measured at the same ages. Results Higher levels of CRP and; to alesser extent; fibrinogen were associated with lower lung volumes in cross-sectionalanalyses at both ages 32 and 38 years. Higher CRP and fibrinogen at age 32 were …,Respiratory medicine,2016,8
Are inhaled longacting β 2 agonists detrimental to asthma?,Donald W Cockcroft; Malcolm R Sears,Summary Possible adverse effects of adrenergic bronchodilators in asthma have been thesubject of discussion for more than half a century; with recent intense debate about thesafety of longacting β agonists (LABAs). In this Debate; we consider the issues ofbronchodilator and bronchoprotective tolerance resulting from the frequent use ofbronchodilators; which is noted particularly with shortacting drugs; but has also been shownto occur quicker and to a greater extent with LABAs. Increased allergen responsiveness andmasking allowing inflammation to increase; while symptoms and lung function remainapparently controlled; have also been observed. Studies in which LABAs were used asmonotherapy were associated with increased mortality. However; several studies haveshown the benefits of adding LABAs to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).

Sheepskins and bedding in childhood; and the risk of development of bronchial asthma,EM Flannery; GP Herbison; CJ Hewitt; MD Holdaway; DT Jones; MR Sears,Background: Sheepskin bedding might increase house dust mite exposure and so explainsome of the increasing prevalence or severity of childhood asthma. Methods: Relationshipsbetween use of different types of bedding; and diagnoses of asthma; symptoms of wheezing;skin prick test evidence of house dust mite sensitivity; and airway responsiveness tomethacholine; were examined retrospectively in a birth cohort of children followedlongitudinally to age 15 years. Results: In the whole cohort; no associations were identifiedto suggest a causal relationship between use of any type of bedding and development offeatures of asthma.

A double‐blind comparison of ketotifen and disodium cromoglycate in atopic adult asthmatics,MR Sears,Summary The therapeutic effects of inhaled disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) and orallyadministered ketotifen were compared in thirty atopic asthmatics aged 15-34 years during a22-week double-blind parallel group study. Ketotifen is a cycloheptathio-phene withexperimental antihistaminic; anti-allergic and anti-anaphylactic effects equal or superior tothose of DSCG. During the first 6 weeks of treatment; mean airflow meter readings increasedand bronchodilator use diminished in those receiving DSCG; but no improvement was seenin those given ketotifen. In the next 10 weeks. concomitant therapy was reduced in bothgroups; but this reduction was greater in the group receiving DSCG. No serious adverseeffects occurred. Asthma worsened after abrupt discontinuation of DSCG but not ketotifen.Although a small number of patients may have benefited from ketotifen. its effect on …,Clinical & Experimental Allergy,1983,7

Although a stable microbiome may not beestablished until 1 to 3 years after birth; the infant gut microbiota appears to be an importantpredictor of health outcomes in later life. We obtained stool at one year of age from 173white Caucasian and 182 South Asian infants from two Canadian birth cohorts to gaininsight into how maternal and early infancy exposures influence the development of the gutmicrobiota. We investigated whether the infant gut microbiota differed by ethnicity (referringto groups of people who have certain racial; cultural; religious; or other traits in common)and by breastfeeding status; while accounting for variations in maternal and infantexposures (such as maternal antibiotic use; gestational diabetes; vegetarianism; infant …,Genome medicine,2017,6

The main productsof this fermentation process are short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other intermediatemetabolites including lactate and succinate. Production of these metabolites is dependenton diet and gut microbiota composition. There is increasing evidence for the role of SCFAsin host physiology and metabolic processes as well as chronic inflammatory conditions suchas allergic disease and obesity.

High fecal IgA is associated with reduced Clostridium difficile colonization in infants,Sarah L Bridgman; Tedd Konya; Meghan B Azad; David S Guttman; Malcolm R Sears; Allan B Becker; Stuart E Turvey; Piush J Mandhane; Padmaja Subbarao; James A Scott; Catherine J Field; Anita L Kozyrskyj; CHILD Study Investigators,Abstract Colonization of infants with Clostridium difficile is on the rise. Although bettertolerated by infants than adults; it is a risk factor for future allergic disease. The present studydescribes associations between infant fecal immunoglobulin A (IgA) and colonization with C.difficile in 47 infants enrolled in the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development(CHILD) study. C. difficile colonization was observed in over half (53%) of the infants.Median IgA was lower in infants colonized with C. difficile (10.9 μg versus 25.5 μg per gprotein; p= 0.18). A smaller proportion of infants with IgA in the highest tertile were colonizedwith C. difficile compared to the other tertiles (31.3% versus 64.5%; p= 0.03). In unadjustedanalysis; odds of colonization with C. difficile was reduced by 75%(OR 0.25 95% CI 0.07;0.91 p= 0.04) among infants with IgA in the highest tertile compared to those in the other …,Microbes and Infection,2016,5
The relationship between body fat and respiratory function in young adults,Tim JT Sutherland; Christene R McLachlan; Malcolm R Sears; Richie Poulton; Robert J Hancox,The relationship between adiposity and respiratory function is poorly understood. Moststudies investigating this have used indirect measures of body fat and few have assessedhow changes in adiposity influence lung function. Body fat measured by bio-electricalimpedance analysis; body mass index; waist circumference; spirometry; bodyplethysmography and transfer factor were measured at ages 32 and 38 years in 361 non-smoking; non-asthmatic participants from a population-based birth cohort. Higherpercentage body fat was associated with lower spirometric and plethysmographic lungvolumes; but not with airflow obstruction; or transfer factor at 32 years. Changes in adipositybetween ages 32 and 38 years were inversely associated with changes in lung volumes.These associations were generally stronger in men than women; but an association …,European Respiratory Journal,2016,5

Step-up therapy in uncontrolled asthma: choices and outcomes,Malcolm R Sears,Guidelines for the management of mild to moderate persistent asthma that remainssuboptimally controlled despite use of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) indicate 2 step-upoptions: adding a long-acting b-agonist (LABA) to an existing ICS; or increasing the dose ofICS. 1 Randomized controlled clinical trials have shown that both currently available LABAs;formoterol and salmeterol; when added to ICS; improve symptom control and lung function;and reduce exacerbations compared with higher doses of ICS alone. 2; 3 Combinations ofICS with LABA in a single inhaler have become widely used as regular maintenance therapyin asthma. More recently; ICS combined with formoterol; which is both rapid-acting and long-acting; has been used for both maintenance and reliever therapy with improvement incontrol despite significant reduction in total ICS exposure. 4 New ultra-long-acting b …,Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,2009,5

MIASMA: Asthma Exacerbation Reduction With Salmeterol,Malcolm R Sears,I thank Drs. Shrewsbury and Pyke of GlaxoWellcome for their comments on my editorialabout short-and long-acting-agonists. Their comments highlight one of the major limitationsof their meta-analysis1 in assessing the effects of salmeterol on exacerbations; namely thatthe studies included had not been specifically designed to address that end-point. Theminimal and nonsignificant reduction in exacerbations associated with use of salmeterol(2.73% for any exacerbation and 2.42% for severe exacerbations) was in comparison with atleast doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid; as they correctly point out. A comparablestudy to the Formeterol and Corticosteroids Establishing Therapy Study; 2 which assessedthe effect on exacerbations of adding formoterol to a fixed dose of corticosteroid; was notavailable for salmeterol.

Is it safe to use long-acting beta-agonists in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? Implications of recent trials and meta-analyses,Malcolm R Sears,AbsTRACT The safety of long‑acting β‑agonists (LABAs) has been hotly debated for severalyears; with surveil‑lance studies suggesting increased risk of mortality; especially with use ofLABA without inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Meta‑analyses of selected trials; especially thosedominated by one large study; report significantly increased risks for mortality and SeriousAdverse Events (SAEs). Review of all of the available evidence from clinical trials; and meta‑analyses using different selection criteria; suggests that LABA with ICS in fact significantlyreduces SAEs. The risk of mortality is more difficult to assess; but post‑hoc analyses suggestthe risk is increased with LABA monotherapy and not with concomitant use of ICS. In bothasthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; concomitant use of ICS should beconsidered best practice whenever LABAs are used.,Pol Arch Med Wewn,2008,4

Is Chronic Use of β 2-Agonists Detrimental in the Treatment of Asthma?,D Robin Taylor; Malcolm R Sears,Abstract A plethora of recent reviews testify to the controversy that has been generated inrecent years by laboratory; clinical and epidemiological data challenging the wisdom ofregular use of the short-acting β 2-agonists which traditionally have formed the mainstay oftreatment for bronchial asthma [1–5]. Although all national and international guidelines forthe management of asthma now recommend anti-inflammatory therapy for most patients withchronic symptoms [6–9]; short-acting β 2-agonists are still the most widely prescribed andmost frequently used form of asthma treatment; and so the issue remains an important one.The prompt symptom relief afforded by these agents; together with the apparent lessening ofside-effects such as tremor and tachycardia as more selective agents became available; ledto almost universal acceptance of β 2-agonist therapy in any required dosage to control …,Asthma: Epidemiology; Anti-Inflammatory Therapy and Future Trends,2000,2

Thusthe difference between the two fenoterol protocols could be easily explained by differencesin glucocorticosteroid therapy." This statement was based on a misinterpretation of Table 2in the Lancet paper of Sears and colleagues (2). In fact; patients maintained the same doseof inhaled corticosteroid through both arms of the crossover study.

Asthma mortality: comparison between New Zealand and England.,MR Sears; HH Rea,A post hoc comparison of our findings (22 November; p 1342) with those of the only similarstudy in another country4 was logical; provided we allowed for ethnic and age differences inmortality (by excluding non-caucasians and confining the comparison to 15-64 year olds asstudied in England). The interval between the two studies is unlikely to have altered thecomparison materially; as the increase in mortality in New Zealand had occurred before1979; when the study was conducted in England; and continued through 1981-3; when theNew Zealand study was conducted. The" single radical difference" in therapeutic policybetween the two studies-the use of bronchodilator nebulisers at home-contributed onlyslightly to New Zealand mortality. Delay due to overreliance on a home nebuliser was afactor in; at most; 8% of fatal cases.

Patterns of allergic sensitization and atopic dermatitis from 1 to 3 years: effects on allergic diseases,C Dharma; DL Lefebvre; MM Tran; WYW Lou; P Subbarao; AB Becker; PJ Mandhane; SE Turvey; MR Sears,Background While allergic sensitization and atopic dermatitis (AD) are known to increasethe risk for allergic diseases; the impact of different temporal and clinical patterns ofsensitization and AD is less well defined. Objective We investigated patterns of sensitizationand AD from early infancy to age 3; and the differential risk of developing allergic diseaseswithin each pattern in a general cohort. Methods Children (n= 2629) from the CanadianHealthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Study underwent skin prick tests andwere assessed clinically for AD at ages 1 and 3 years. We applied an unsupervised latentclass analysis (LCA) to the following 5 factors at these ages: AD; food sensitization; inhalantsensitization; poly-sensitization to foods and poly-sensitization to inhalants.

Blood eosinophils and lung function decline in young adults,Robert Hancox; Ian Pavord; Malcolm Sears,Background: Eosinophilic airway inflammation and airway remodelling are characteristicfeatures of asthma; but the association between them is unknown. Aim: To test thehypothesis that blood eosinophil counts would be associated with the development ofairflow obstruction in a population-based cohort of 1037 young adults. Methods: Bloodeosinophils and spirometry were measured at ages 21; 26; 32; and 38 years. Associationsbetween spirometry and eosinophil counts were analysed using linear mixed models withfixed effects for age and random effects for participants to accommodate repeated measures;with adjustment for sex; cumulative tobacco smoking; childhood and adult asthma; andspirometric measures at age 18. We further analysed associations between meaneosinophil counts and changes in spirometry from ages 21 to 38 years. Results: Higher …,*,2017,1
Presence of Archaea in the Indoor Environment and Their Relationships with Housing Characteristics,Sepideh Pakpour; James A Scott; Stuart E Turvey; Jeffrey R Brook; Timothy K Takaro; Malcolm R Sears; John Klironomos,Abstract Archaea are widespread and abundant in soils; oceans; or human and animalgastrointestinal (GI) tracts. However; very little is known about the presence of Archaea inindoor environments and factors that can regulate their abundances. Using a quantitativePCR approach; and targeting the archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA genes in floor dustsamples; we found that Archaea are a common part of the indoor microbiota; 5.01±0.14 (log16S rRNA gene copies/g dust; mean±SE) in bedrooms and 5.58±0.13 in common rooms;such as living rooms. Their abundance; however; was lower than bacteria: 9.20±0.32 and9.17±0.32 in bedrooms and common rooms; respectively. In addition; by measuring a broadarray of environmental factors; we obtained preliminary insights into how the abundance oftotal archaeal 16S rRNA gene copies in indoor environment would be associated with …,Microbial ecology,2016,1
The effects of infant feeding practices on food sensitization in a Canadian birth cohort,Maxwell M Tran; Wei Hao Dai; Diana L Lefebvre; Padmaja Subbarao; Allan B Becker; Piushkumar J Mandhane; Stuart E Turvey; Wen-Yi Lou; Malcolm R Sears,RESULTS Most parents introduced CMP early (0-6 months 48%; 7-12 months 48%;≥ 12months 4%) but delayed introduction of egg (0-6 months 6%; 7-12 months 76%;≥ 12months 19%) and particularly peanut (0-6 months 1%; 7-12 months 41%;≥ 12 months58%). At age 1 year; 10% of children were food-sensitized; with highest prevalence of eggwhite sensitization (6%). Early introduction of CMP; egg; and peanut was protective againstsensitization to the corresponding food allergens. Introducing egg before age 1 significantlyreduced the odds of developing sensitization to any of the three tested food allergens (0-6months adjOR 0.33; 95% CI 0.12-0.90; 7-12 months adjOR 0.47; 95% CI 0.31-0.73); afteradjusting for study center; parental atopy; and parental ethnicity.

Current mouse modelresearch has identified the early life gut microbiota as a potential therapeutic target for theprevention of asthma and atopic diseases [2–4]. We hypothesize that the early life gutmicrobiota could play a similar preventative role against atopic disease development inhumans. Methods 1262 children enrolled in the Canadian Healthy Infant LongitudinalDevelopment (CHILD) Study with complete skin prick test and wheeze data at one year weregrouped into four clinically relevant phenotypes: atopy+ wheeze; atopy only; wheeze only;and control.

Prevalence and correlates of a ‘knee’pattern on the maximal expiratory flow‐volume loop in young adults,Hayden H Shin; Malcolm R Sears; Robert J Hancox,Methods Flow-volume loops from an unselected birth cohort of 1037 individuals at ages 18;26; 32 and 38 years were visually inspected for a knee pattern. Associations with asthmadiagnoses; smoking history; body mass index (BMI) and spirometry were assessed. ResultsThe knee pattern was found in approximately two thirds of men and women at age 18. Theprevalence decreased with age; but it was more likely to persist in women. The knee wasmore common after bronchodilator and was associated with higher forced expiratory volumein 1 s/forced vital capacity ratios and mid-expiratory flow rates. There was no associationwith smoking; except for an inverse correlation in men at age 18. No association was foundwith BMI. Women with asthma were less likely to have a knee at both ages 18 and 38;whereas men with asthma showed an inverse association at age 18. Conclusions A knee …,Respirology,2014,1

As an extension; one could posit that a lessdiverse gut microbiome in the infant; also linked with the development of allergic disease;would be a function of fewer microbes in the home environment. Piglet studies; however;indicate that greater microbe diversity in the environment actually leads to reduced diversityof the gut microbiota. In this study; we characterize the infant gut microbiota in relation toenvironmental factors traditionally associated with the hygiene hypothesis.

Clinicians should consider both the therapies and management strategiesemployed. Adjustable maintenance dosing; where patients step-up or step-down theirmedication depending on symptom level; has been proposed to improve asthma control in areal-life setting. To implement adjustable maintenance dosing; patients require aPersonalised Asthma Action Plan; detailing instructions agreed between patient andclinician on how they should adjust their dose in line with asthma variations to preventdeterioration in control.

Regular β-Adrenergic Agonists-To the Editor,Malcolm R Sears; D Robin Taylor,Dr. Govindaraj rightly argues that no therapeutic agent or modality should be abovesuspicion until the real cause of increased morbidity and mortality from asthma isdetermined. We have assembled evidence that strongly suggests that high doses of β-agonists used long term (in contrast to short-term use in acute severe asthma where highdoses are both necessary and safe 1) can have a deleterious effect on chronic asthma. 2; 3We are surprised that Dr. Govindaraj rejects our findings as being “based on nothing moresubstantial than laboratory evidence obtained from mild asthmatics in remission.” Wellconducted; randomized; controlled clinical trials provide a more secure basis fordetermination of beneficial and harmful effects of drugs than do epidemiologic trends; evenwhen (as in this instance) these trends are consistent with the experimental data.,Chest,1995,1
Regularly inhaled β-agonists in stable asthma,Malcolm R Sears; D Robin Taylor,In 1992; we published a short review of several studies that purported to show the beneficialeffects of regularly inhaled [3-agonists in asthma. We pointed out the methodologicaldeficiencies of many of the studies cited? Regrettably; the recent article by Heino (JALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL 1994; 93: 80-4) is yet another that is inadequate to answer theimportant question about the safety of regularly inhaled [3-agonists. The bold title of thearticle cannot be justified on the basis of the data it contains. In essence; the study reportedby Heino is a nonrandomized; uncontrolled; reportedly single-blind investigation of minimalduration in which the effect of withdrawing twice-daily low-dose inhaled salbutamol inpatients with stable asthma taking moderate doses of inhaled corticosteroids was monitored.Characteristics of asthma at baseline are inadequately described; but given the mean …,Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1995,1

How much atopy is attributable to common childhood environmental exposures? A population-based birth cohort study followed to adulthood,Hayden H Shin; Stephanie J Lynch; Andrew R Gray; Malcolm R Sears; Robert J Hancox,Abstract Background The rising prevalence of atopic diseases implies a strong influence ofenvironmental determinants. Epidemiological studies have identified several early lifeexposures that appear to influence the risk of developing atopic sensitization; but thecombined influence of these exposures is unknown. We sought to estimate the proportion ofatopy that could be attributed to common childhood exposures associated with atopicsensitization in adolescence and young adulthood. Methods Atopic sensitization wasmeasured by skin-prick tests for common aeroallergens in a population-based New Zealandbirth cohort at ages 13 and 32 years. The independent effects of previously identified riskand protective factors for atopic sensitization were assessed using multiple logisticregression. Population attributable fractions were calculated for atopic sensitization in …,International Journal of Epidemiology,2017,*

Early life pet ownership protects against asthma in childhood. Wesought to determine whether the E/B ratio predicts infant wheeze and whether this ratio ismodified by pet ownership. Methods: The study comprised a sub-sample of 1;023 infantsfrom the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) birth cohort. Infantmedication use; pet ownership; birth mode; antibiotic treatment and breastfeeding statuswere assessed by questionnaire.

Is the Aging Airway Less Responsive to Treatment?,Malcolm R Sears,The effect of age and sex on the incidence and prevalence of asthma and its natural historyare well recognized; but the effects of age and sex on response to treatments are less welldefined. In young people; especially children; treatment generally results in normal lungfunction and lifestyle. In older persons; symptoms may be more persistent; and lung functionless than optimal. More hospitalizations and deaths from asthma occur in older subjects;who may also experience a greater annual decline in lung function (1–3). Is this related tothe duration of asthma and its effect on airway pathology; airway remodeling; developmentof “resistance” to pharmacological agents; or other reasons?

These early life alterations werecharacterized by significant reductions in four bacterial genera and a decreased productionof microbial derived metabolites. We hypothesize that this early life gut microbial dysbioticstate is also associated with asthma diagnosed in children by three years of age and aim toidentify additional bacterial populations that might be contributing to this asthmaticphenotype.

Infant gut microbiota and the development of wheeze in early childhood,Scarlet M Salas; Meghan B Azad; Tedd Konya; David S Guttman; Allan B Becker; Malcolm R Sears; James A Scott; Anita L Kozyrskyj; CHILD Study Investigators,Background Commensal gut microbes play an important role in human development andlifelong health. There is increasing evidence that disruption of the infant gut microbiota maybe linked to the development of childhood allergy and asthma-related outcomes; includingwheezing. Our objective was to investigate the association of infant gut microbiota diversityand composition with development of wheeze in early childhood. Methods The studypopulation included 160 infants enrolled at the Winnipeg site of the Canadian Healthy InfantLongitudinal Development Study (CHILD) population-based birth cohort. Standardizedquestionnaires were completed by mothers at 3; 6 and 12 months after birth; and reportedon breastfeeding and occurrence of infant wheezing.

The burden of asthma in Canadian children and adolescents of South Asian descent,Joost Moerman; Felix Ratjen; Padmaja Subbarao; Malcolm Sears; Sonia Anand; Sanja Stanojevic,The prevalence of asthma and wheezing symptoms vary greatly geographically andbetween different ethnic groups. We aim to compare asthma prevalence in South AsianCanadians (SAC); the general Canadian population (GCP) and a population in South Asia(SA). We hypothesize the prevalence of asthma in SAC group to be smaller than theprevalence in the GCP group; but greater than the prevalence in the SA group. Data from theInternational Study for Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) were analyzed from 5centers in Canada. A validated surname algorithm based on 200 known South Asiansurnames was used to determine ethnicity.

15: What is the role of long-acting b2-agonists in the treatment of asthma?,MR Sears,During the last decade; guidelines for the management of asthma have emphasized thetreatment of airway inflammation. The focus of therapy has been the use of inhaledcorticosteroids; currently the most effective antiinflammatory medication available. A seriesof studies have shown no benefit; and in some a deleterious effect; from regular treatmentwith short-acting inhaled bronchodilators; which until recently was the mainstay of asthmatherapy. Short-acting b-agonists are now recommended asrescue'therapy; treatingsymptoms as the need arises; although they still remain widely used as initial and adjuncttherapy in asthma management. Over the last few years; recommendations have againchanged; this time away from high doses of inhaled corticosteroids; as concerns have beenraised about adverse systemic effects.

Natural history of childhood asthma: Author's reply,Malcolm R Sears,EDrroR;-In his editorial Malcolm R Sears concludes that two thirds of children with asthmawill outgrow it (especially those with mild asthma).'This statement is primarily basedon thework of Mark A Jenkins and colleagues; 2 but it does not reflect several other solid researchfindings that show that asthma persists into adulthood in half of the children who have it. 3-5The study ofJenkins and colleagues is presented as a prospective study based on the 1968Tasmanian asthma survey. In this survey Tasmanian parents were retrospectively askedwhether their children; then at school; had ever suffered fromasthma or wheezy bronchitis.Jenkins and colleagues did a follow up study 23 years later (again partly retro-spectively) inwhich a random sample of the original population was asked whether they suffered or hadpreviously suffered from asthma.

8. f3 Agonists,Malcolm R Sears,Conclusions Asthma is a complex inflammatory disease involving many types of cells. Theinitiating steps in this inflammation are far from clear but antigen presentation to Tlymphocytes is of crucial importance. The interaction between genetic factors; which maydetermine atopic status and predisposition to airway hyperresponsiveness; andenvironmental factors; including allergen exposure; viral infections; and atmosphericpollutants in early life; these drugs (214; 243). However; the nature of steroid resistanceawaits studies of patients who are not taking large amounts of P agonists. In general;patients with asthma respond well to these drugs and failure of response usually means thatthe patient has chronic airflow limitation rather than asthma (244) or some other reason for apoor response.,J Invest Dermatol,1990,*

Recurrent nocturnal near fatal asthma in a young man.,MR Sears; CG Dunckley,Abstract A young man who suffered multiple near fatal nocturnal asthmatic attacks; includingat least three episodes of respiratory arrest; was found to be symptomatically unaware ofmarked increases in airway obstruction; and failed to perceive bronchoconstriction inducedby methacholine challenge. Intensive antiasthma treatment monitored by regular peakexpiratory flow measurements abolished the nocturnal attacks; which recurred twice whentreatment lapsed.

Not only is the clinical diagnosis of capsulitis not consistently accurate butneither is the clinical exclusion of integrity of the rotator cuff. No mention is made ofarthrography or magnetic resonance imaging in the patients examined; and I presume thatthe radiological evidence to which they refer was related to plain radiography. Suchevidence; even if expertly interpreted; would exclude a large tear of the rotator cuff but notnecessarily a lesser one.

However; their paper does contain other surprises;some of which might have concerned an ethics committee had one been consulted.'Firstly;children presenting to a casualty depart-ment with peak flow rates as low as 15% of theirbest value were not immediately admitted for treatment and observation but weredischarged after being given one dose of nebulised salbutamol with a 50% likelihood ofreceiving placebo rather than corticosteroid treatment.

Management of asthma,MR Sears,Recent advances in understanding mechanisms of asthma; ready availa- bility of means for monitoringairway function and improved drug therapy have changed some concepts of the managementof asthma. No longer is the goal merely relief of symptoms; but restoration of normal lungfunc- tion. 'Living with asthma' should be the exception rather than an accepted norm. The principlesof management are to: 1. Establish that the symptoms are due to asthma. 2. Establish the patternof airways obstruction. 3. Establish major aetiological fac- tors. 4. Establish the degree ofreversi- bility. 5. Maintain normal lung function or maximal reversibility with the minimum necessarytherapy. 6.

Evaluation of the airflowmeter in the assessment of airways obstruction.,MR Sears,Abstract The airflowmeter; a new inexpensive instrument measuring severity of airwaysobstruction in arbitrary units; was found to correlate well with standard respiratory functiontests; and to be more sensitive than FEV1 in detecting changes in obstruction. Despite thedistortion of maximal expiratory flow-volume relationship induced by the resistance of themeter; and the considerable variability between instruments; the airflowmeter should proveuseful for regular monitoring of patients with variable airways obstruction.,The New Zealand medical journal,1976,*

Many have shown a stronger association in women; with only weak or non-significant associations in men. Most studies have relied on body mass index to determineoverweight & obesity; which may be a less reliable measure of body fat in men than women.Methods: A population based cohort of approximately 1000 individuals aged 32 yearsunderwent measurements of body fat percent by bioelectrical impedance analysis;spirometry; bronchodilator response and exhaled nitric oxide and answered detailedrespiratory questionnaires. Results: In women there was a significant association betweenbody fat percent and asthma (p= 0. 043); airflow obstruction (p= 0. 046) but notbronchodilator response (p= 0.86).

What is the Role of Long‐Acting β2‐Agonists in the Treatment of Asthma?,MR Sears,During the last decade; guidelines for the management of asthma have emphasized thetreatment of airway inflammation. The focus of therapy has been the use of inhaledcorticosteroids; currently the most effective antiinflammatory medication available. A seriesof studies have shown no benefit; and in some a deleterious effect; from regular treatmentwith short-acting inhaled bronchodilators; which until recently was the mainstay of asthmatherapy. Short-acting b-agonists are now recommended asrescue'therapy; treatingsymptoms as the need arises; although they still remain widely used as initial and adjuncttherapy in asthma management. Over the last few years; recommendations have againchanged; this time away from high doses of inhaled corticosteroids; as concerns have beenraised about adverse systemic effects.

Using the Canadian HealthyInfant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Study's home environment dataset (Takaro et al;2015); we explored the relationship between the presence of window condensation andmould; leaks; and plants. Mould and leaks were associated with increased windowcondensation (OR= 3.39; OR= 1.25); whereas plants had no effect when we controlled forseason; study centre; humidification; and frequency of window openings. Subsequentanalyses of the CHILD dataset will explore time-activity behaviours in relation to moisture;and the presence of plantrelated fungal species in dust samples.,*,*,*

The Natural History of Childhood Asthma,Malcolm R Sears,The increasing interest in the natural history of childhood asthma reflects a number ofsomewhat puzzling observations. Asthma remains a common childhood illness; with asubstantial morbidity and occasional mortality. There is consensus that the prevalence ofchildhood asthma and of atopy is increasing; and a less well sup-ported perception that theseverity of asthma has also increased. It is unclear whether there has been a correspondinggreater likelihood of persistence of childhood asthma into adulthood. The impact oftreatment on the 'natural history'of childhood asthma has not been systematically studied.Most studies have reported the outcome of childhood asthma over the second and thirddecade; examining trends from midchildhood into adulthood. Only recently have studiesaddressed the natural history of asthma or wheezing illnesses occurring in infancy and …,Asthma and Rhinitis; Second Edition,*,*

Leukotriene-receptor antagonists and related compounds,RA McIvor; E Pizzichini; MO Turner; P Hussack; FE Hargreave; MR Sears,The identification of the structure of the cysteinyl leukotrienes; C 4; D4 and E4; and theirpotential importance in the pathogenesis of asthma has led to development of severalclasses of drugs collectively known as the antileukotrienes. Some inhibit the synthesis ofleukotrienes by effector cells of asthma; and it is theoretically possible to stop theirproduction by inhibition of any of the enzymes in their biosynthetic pathway. However; theonly enzyme that has been selectively inhibited is 5—lipoxygenase (5—LO).”(Zileuton; a S-LO inhibitor; may not be marketed in Canada; because it must be administered 4 times dailyand requires monitoring of liver enzymes.) It has also been possible to interrupt leukotiieneformation by preventing the binding of arachidonic acid to the 5—LO activating protein.”Some pharmaceutical molecules are being investigated to modify the function of this …,*,*,*
