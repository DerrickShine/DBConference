The Gamma database machine project,David J.  DeWitt; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Donovan A.  Schneider; Allan Bricker; H-I Hsiao; Rick Rasmussen,The design of the Gamma database machine and the techniques employed in itsimplementation are described. Gamma is a relational database machine currently operatingon an Intel iPSC/2 hypercube with 32 processors and 32 disk drives. Gamma employs threekey technical ideas which enable the architecture to be scaled to hundreds of processors.First; all relations are horizontally partitioned across multiple disk drives; enabling relationsto be scanned in parallel. Second; parallel algorithms based on hashing are used toimplement the complex relational operators; such as join and aggregate functions. Third;dataflow scheduling techniques are used to coordinate multioperator queries. By usingthese techniques; it is possible to control the execution of very complex queries with minimalcoordination. The design of the Gamma software is described and a thorough …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and data engineering,1990,880
Staggered striping in multimedia information systems,Steven Berson; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Richard Muntz; Xiangyu Ju,Abstract Multimedia information systems have emerged as an essential component of manyapplication domains ranging from library information systems to entertainment technology.However; most implementations of these systems cannot support the continuous display ofmultimedia objects and suffer from frequent disruptions and delays termed hiccups. This isdue to the low I/O bandwidth of the current disk technology; the high bandwidth requirementof multimedia objects; and the large size of these objects that almost always requires them tobe disk resident. One approach to resolve this limitation is to decluster a multimedia objectacross multiple disk drives in order to employ the aggregate bandwidth of several disks tosupport the continuous retrieval (and display) of objects.

Hybrid-Range Partitioning Skate y: A New Deelustering Strategy for Multiprocessor 8 atabase Machines,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; David J DeWitt,ABSTRACT-In shared-nothing multiprocessor database machines; the relational operatorsthat form a query are executed on the processors where the relations they reference arestored. In general; as the number of processors over which a relation is declustered isincreased; the execution time for the query is decreased because more processors areused; each of which has to process fewer tuples. However; for some queries increasing thedegree of declustering actually increases the query's response time as the result ofincreased overhead for query startup; communication; and termination. In general; thedeclustering strategy selected for a relation can have a significant impact on the overallperformance of the system. This paper presents the hybrid-range partitioning strategy; a newdeclustering strategy for multiprocessor database machines. In addition to describing its …,*,1990,187
Continuous retrieval of multimedia data using parallelism,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Luis Ramos,Most implementations of workstation-based multimedia information systems cannot supporta continuous display of high resolution audio and video data and suffer from frequentdisruptions and delays termed hiccups. This is due to the low I/O bandwidth of the currentdisk technology; the high bandwidth requirement of multimedia objects; and the large size ofthese objects; which requires them to be almost always disk resident. A parallel multimediainformation system and the key technical ideas that enable it to support a real-time display ofmultimedia objects are described. In this system; a multimedia object across several diskdrives is declustered; enabling the system to utilize the aggregate bandwidth of multipledisks to retrieve an object in real-time. Then; the workload of an application is distributedevenly across the disk drives to maximize the processing capability of the system. To …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1993,183

On configuring a single disk continuous media server,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Seon Ho Kim; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract The past decade has witnessed a proliferation of repositories that store and retrievecontinuous media data types; eg; audio and video objects. These repositories are expectedto play a major role in several emerging applications; eg; library information systems;educational applications; entertainment industry; etc. To support the display of a videoobject; the system partitions each object into fixed size blocks. All blocks of an object residepermanently on the disk drive. When displaying an object; the system stages the blocks ofthe object into memory one at a time for immediate display. In the presence of multipledisplays referencing different objects; the bandwidth of the disk drive is multiplexed amongrequests; introducing disk seeks. Disk seeks reduce the useful utilization of the diskbandwidth and result in a lower number of simultaneous displays (throughput). This …,ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review,1995,103
A performance analysis of alternative multi-attribute declustering strategies,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; David J DeWitt; Waheed Qureshi,Abstract During the past decade; parallel database systems have gained increasedpopularity due to their high performance; scalability and availability characteristics. With thepredicted future database sizes and the complexity of queries; the scalability of thesesystems to hundreds and thousands of processors is essential for satisfying the projecteddemand. Several studies have repeatedly demonstrated that both the performance andscalability of a paralel database system is contingent on the physical layout of data acrossthe processors of the system. If the data is not declustered properly; the execution of anoperator might waste resources; reducing the overall processing capability of the system.With earlier; single attribute declustering strategies; such as those found in Tandem;Teradata; Gamma; and Bubba parallel database systems; a selection query including a …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1992,100
On multimedia repositories; personal computers; and hierarchical storage systems,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract The past decade has witnessed a proliferation of personal computers at homes;businesses; classrooms; libraries; etc. Most often; these systems are used to disseminateinformation. Recently; multimedia repositories have added to the excitement of thisinformation age by allowing a user to retrieve and manipulate continuous media data types(audio and video objects). The design and implementation of these systems is challengingdue to both the large size of objects that constitute this media type and their continuousbandwidth requirement. Compression in combination with the availability of fast CPUs (forreal-time decompression) provide effective support for a continuous display of those objectswith high bandwidth requirement.

Heraclitus: Elevating deltas to be first-class citizens in a database programming language,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Richard Hull; Dean Jacobs,Abstract Traditional database systems provide a user with the ability to query andmanipulate one database state; namely the current database state. However; in severalemerging applications; the ability to analyze “what-if” scenarios in order to reason about theimpact of an update (before committing that update) is of paramount importance. Exampleapplications include hypothetical database access; active database management systems;and version management; to name a few. The central thesis of the Heraclitus paradigm is toprovide flexible support for applications such as these by elevating deltas; which representupdates proposed against the current database state; to be first-class citizens. Heraclitus[Alg; C] is a database programming language that extends C to incorporate the relationalalgebra and deltas.

Design and implementation of scalable continuous media servers,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Richard Muntz,Abstract During the past decade; the information technology has evolved to store andretrieve continuous media data types; eg; audio and video clips. Unlike the traditional datatypes (eg; text); continuous media consists of a sequence of quanta; either audio samples orvideo frames; that convey meaning when presented at a pre-specified rate. A challengingtask when implementing these servers is to guarantee retrieval and delivery of a clip at itspre-specified rate. Continuous media servers are expected to play a major role in manyapplication domains including library information systems; entertainment technology;educational applications; etc. The focus of this study is on the disk subsystem of a server andtechniques that both enhance its performance and ensure its scalability.

Object Placement in Parallel Hypermedia Systems.,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Luis Ramos; Zubair Asad; Waheed Qureshi,Abstract During the past few years; hypermedia systems have emerged as an essentialcomponent of many application domains ranging from software engineering to libraryinformation systems. This is primarily due to the capability of these systems to manage andrepresent irregularly structured information; and to provide a userfriendly interface forinformation retrieval by providing a browsing capability. However; most stand-aloneimplementation of these systems (based on a workstation) cannot support a “real-time”display of audio and video objects. This is due to the low I/O bandwidth of the current disktechnology and the large size of these objects which requires them to be almost always diskresident. With the predicted size and bandwidth requirements of future multi-media objects;this limitation must be resolved if hypermedia systems are to be the wave of future. This …,VLDB,1991,70
Pipelining mechanism to minimize the latency time in hierarchical multimedia storage managers,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Ali Dashti; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract An emerging area of database system research is to provide support for continuousmedia data types (digital audio and video). These data types are expected to play a majorrole in applications such as library information systems; scientific databases; entertainmenttechnology; etc. They require both a high volume of storage and a high bandwidthrequirement for their continuous display. The storage organization of systems that supportthese data types is expected to be hierarchical; consisting of one or more tertiary storagedevices; several disk drives; and some memory. The database resides permanently on thetertiary storage device. The disk drives store a number of frequently accessed objects; whilethe memory is used to stage a small fraction of a referenced object for immediate display.When a user references an object that is tertiary resident; if the system elects to …,Computer communications,1995,69
BG: A Benchmark to Evaluate Interactive Social Networking Actions.,Sumita Barahmand; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Abstract BG is a benchmark that rates a data store for processing interactive socialnetworking actions using a pre-specified service level agreement; SLA. An example SLAmay require 95% of issued requests to observe a response time faster than 100milliseconds. BG computes two different ratings named SoAR and Socialites. In addition; itelevates the amount of unpredictable data produced by a data store to a first class metric;including it as a key component of the SLA and quantifying it as a part of the benchmarkingprocess. One may use BG for a variety of purposes ranging from comparing different datastores with one another; evaluating alternative physical data organization techniques givena data store; quantifying the performance characteristics of a data store in the presence offailures (either CP or AP in CAP theorem); among others.

An H2O device isconfigured with a high bandwidth wireless communication component; a powerfulprocessor; and gigabytes of storage. A key challenge of this environment is how to placedata across H2O devices in order to enhance startup latency; defined as the delay observedfrom when a user requests a clip; to the onset of its display. Our primary contribution is anovel replication technique that enhances startup latency; while minimizing the total storagespace required from an environment consisting of N H2O devices. This technique is basedon the following intuition: The first few blocks of a clip are required more urgently than its …,IEEE Transactions on Multimedia,2004,62
Simultaneous processing of read and write requests using optimized storage partitions for read and write request deadlines,*,The disk scheduling system supports the processing of simultaneous storage device readand write requests in a video server environment; thereby supporting both video-on-demandand non-linear editing applications. Read requests are the result of movie viewing; whilewrite requests are the result of video clip editing or movie authoring procedures. Due to real-time demands of movie viewing; read requests have to be fulfilled within certain deadlines;otherwise they are considered lost. Since the data to be written into the storage device isstored in main memory buffers (or write buffers); write requests can be postponed untilcritical read requests are processed. However; write requests still have to be proceededwithin reasonable delays and without the possibility of indefinite postponement. This is dueto the physical constraint of the limited size of the main memory buffers. The new process …,*,2000,57
Placement of continuous media in multi-zone disks,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Seon Ho Kim; Cyrus Shahabi; Roger Zimmermann,ABSTRACT For applications with large data sets; eg; video servers; magnetic disks haveestablished themselves as the mass storage device of choice. A technique to increase thestorage capacity of disks is zoning. A side-effect of zoning is that it introduces a disk drivewith variable transfer rates. This chapter describes techniques to support a continuousdisplay of constant-bit rate video and audio objects using a multi-zone disk drive. Ascompared to previous approaches; the proposed techniques provide the average transferrate of each magnetic disk (instead of its minimum transfer rate). In addition; we describe aconfiguration planner that logically manipulates the zoning information of a disk drive tosupport the performance criteria of an application. We present performance numbers froman experimental prototype to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.,Multimedia Information Storage and Management,1996,55

Continuous display using heterogeneous disk-subsystems,Roger Zimmermann; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Abstract A number of recent technological trends have made data intensive applicationssuch as continuous media (audio and video) servers a reality. These servers store andretrieve a large volume of data using magnetic disks. Servers consisting of heterogeneousdisk drives have become a fact of life for several reasons. First; disks are mechanicaldevices that might fail. The failed disks are almost alwaysreplaced with new models.Second; the currenttechnological trend for these devices is one of annual increase in bothperformance and storage capacity. Older disk models are discontinued because they cannotcompete with the newer ones in the commercial arena. With a heterogeneous disksubsystem; the system should support continuous display while managing resourcesintelligently in order to maximize their utilization.

A comparison of alternative encoding mechanisms for web services,Min Cai; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Rolfe Schmidt; Saihong Song,Abstract A web service is a modular application that is published; advertised; discovered;and invoked across a network; ie; an intranet or the Internet. It is based on a “software-as-services” model and may participate as a component of other web services and applications.Binary and XML are two popular encoding/decoding mechanisms for network messages.Binary encoding is used when performance is critical and XML encoding is employed wheninteroperability with other web services and applications is essential. With each; one mayemploy compression to reduce message size prior to its transmission across the network.These decisions have a significant impact on response time and throughput.

Real time scheduling of prioritized disk requests,*,A single queue is utilized for scheduling of prioritized requests having specific deadlines inwhich to be serviced. New requests are initially inserted into the single queue based uponoptimal SCAN order. Once the new request is inserted; the deadlines of all the requests inthe queue are checked in order to insure each request deadline is met. In the event adeadline violation is identified; the queue is reorganized by identifying the lowest priorityrequest currently to be processed prior to the request with the deadline violation. If morethan one request with the lowest priority exists; the lowest priority request with the greatestdeadline slack is selected. Ultimately; the selected request is moved to the tail of the queue;or removed from the queue and considered lost if its deadline is violated with a queue tailplacement. This process is repeated until the queue is in a state with no deadline …,*,2000,44
Placement of data in multi-zone disk drives,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Douglas Ierardi; Dongho Kim; Roger Zimmermann,Abstract This paper describes a placement technique for the layout of les across the surfaceof a multizone magnetic disk drive to maximize its bandwidth. It argues for a le system thatmonitors the frequency of access to the les and modi es the placement of les in order torespond to an evolving pattern of le accesses. Such a le system is particularly useful forrepositories whose primary functionality is to disseminate information; such as the World-Wide-Web along with thousands of ftp sites that render documents; graphic pictures; images;audio clips; and full-motion video available on the Internet.

On disk scheduling and data placement for video servers,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Seon Ho Kim; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Magnetic disks have established themselves as the mass storage device of choicefor data intensive applications; including video servers.

Device independence and extensibility in gesture recognition,Jacob Eisenstein; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Leana Golubchik; Cyrus Shahabi; Donghui Yan; Roger Zimmermann,Gesture recognition techniques often suffer from being highly device-dependent and hard toextend. If a system is trained using data from a specific glove input device; that system istypically unusable with any other input device. The set of gestures that a system is trained torecognize is typically not extensible; without retraining the entire system. We propose anovel gesture recognition framework to address these problems. This framework is based ona multi-layered view of gesture recognition. Only the lowest layer is device dependent; itconverts raw sensor values produced by the glove to a glove-independent semanticdescription of the hand. The higher layers of our framework can be reused across gloves;and are easily extensible to include new gestures.

Physical database design in multiprocessor database systems,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; David J Dewitt,ABSTRACT In shared—nothing multiprocessor database machines; relations arehorizontally declustered across multiple processors in order to obtain a lower response timeand a higher throughput from the system. Several alternative strategies exist for horizontallydeclustering a relation. However. the performance tradeoffs of these declustering strategieswith respect to the diﬂ'erent storage and access structures have not been previouslyexamined. Thus; a database administrator for such a system has no choice but to guess howmany processors a relation should be declustered across and what declustering strategy ismost appropriate. These are important decisions since they have a signiﬁcant impact on theresponse time and throughput of the system.

Most of the current research onhand gesture recognition for Human-Computer Interaction rely on either the NeuralNetworks or Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). In this paper; we compare differentapproaches for gesture recognition and highlight the major advantages of each. We showthat gestures recognition based on the Bio-mechanical characteristic of the hand providesan intuitive approach which provides more accuracy and less complexity.,International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction,2009,27

HERA: Heterogeneous Extension of RAID.,Roger Zimmermann; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Abstract A number of recent technological trends have made data intensive applicationssuch as continuous media (audio and video) servers a reality. These servers store andretrieve a large volume of data using magnetic disks. Servers consisting of multiple nodesand large arrays of heterogeneous disk drives have become a fact of life for several reasons.First; magnetic disks might fail. Failed disks are almost always replaced with newer diskmodels because the current technological trend for these devices is one of annual increasein both performance and storage capacity. Second; storage requirements are everincreasing; forcing servers to be scaled up progressively. In this study we present HERA; aframework that enables parity-based data protection for heterogeneous storage systems.Based on the novel Disk Merging approach HERA provides a low cost solution for …,PDPTA,2000,26
A comparison of two physical data designs for interactive social networking actions,Sumita Barahmand; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Jason Yap,Abstract This paper compares the performance of an SQL solution that implements arelational data model with a document store named MongoDB. We report on theperformance of a single node configuration of each data store and assume the database issmall enough to fit in main memory. We analyze utilization of the CPU cores and the networkbandwidth to compare the two data stores. Our key findings are as follows. First; for thosesocial networking actions that read and write a small amount of data; the join operator of theSQL solution is not slower than the JSON representation of MongoDB. Second; with a mix ofactions; the SQL solution provides either the same performance as MongoDB or outperformsit by 20%. Third; a middle-tier cache enhances the performance of both data stores as queryresult look up is significantly faster than query processing with either system.,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Information & Knowledge Management,2013,24
Disk scheduling in video editing systems,Walid G.  Aref; Ibrahim Kamel; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Modern video servers support both video-on-demand and nonlinear editing applications.Video-on-demand servers enable the user to view video clips or movies from a videodatabase; while nonlinear editing systems enable the user to manipulate the content of thevideo database. Applications such as video and news editing systems require that theunderlying storage server be able to concurrently record live broadcast information; modifyprerecorded data; and broadcast an authored presentation. A multimedia storage server thatefficiently supports such a diverse group of activities constitutes the focus of this study. Anovel real-time disk scheduling algorithm is presented that treats both read and writerequests in a homogeneous manner in order to ensure that their deadlines are met.

Object placement in parallel object-oriented database systems,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; David Wilhite; Kaiming Lin; Xiaoming Zhao,Parallelism is a viable solution to constructing high performance object-oriented databasesystems. In parallel systems based on a shared-nothing architecture; the database ishorizontally declustered across multiple processors; enabling the system to employ multipleprocessors to speedup the execution time of a query. The placement of objects across theprocessors has a significant impact on the performance of queries that traverse a fewobjects. The paper describes and evaluates a greedy algorithm for the placement of objectsacross the processors of a system. Moreover; it describes two alternative availabilitystrategies and quantifies their performance tradeoff using a trace-driven simulation study.,Data Engineering; 1994.

Optimal balanced assignments and a parallel database application,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Robert R Meyer; Gary L Schultz; Jonathan Yackel,In parallel database systems; distribution of the data among the processors has a significantimpact on the response time and throughput of the system. The benefits of parallelism (usingmultiple processors to execute a query) must be balanced against its costs (communication;startup; and termination overhead). We formalize the problem of minimizing overhead whilepartitioning data uniformly across the processors. We derive lower bounds on thesecombinatorial problems and demonstrate how processors may be optimally assigned so asto achieve these lower bounds for a number of problem classes.

Evaluation of 802.11 a for Streaming Data in Ad-hoc Networks,Samip Bararia; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Shyam Kapadia,Advances in communication and processing have made ad-hoc networks of wirelessdevices a reality. One application is home entertainment systems where multiple Home-to-Home (H20) devices collaborate as peers to stream audio and video clips to a household. Inthis study; we investigate the feasibility of IEEE 802.11 a protocol in combination with bothTCP and UDP to realize a H20 device. Challenges include lossy connections; unfairallocation of bandwidth between multiple simultaneous transmissions; and the exposednode limitation [22];[19];[13];[4].

Greedy cache management techniques for mobile devices,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Shahin Shayandeh,Mobile devices are configured with one or more wireless cards that provide limited radio-range and unreliable transmission. These energy-constrained devices are configured with afixed amount of storage. A device may set aside a fraction of its local storage as a cache tominimize use of the network when servicing requests; enhancing metrics such as startuplatency and data availability. In this paper; we focus on a repository of continuous media(audio and video) clips and study several greedy cache management techniques and theircache hit rates. This metric reflects what percentage of requests for clips is serviced when amobile device is disconnected from the network. The device becomes network detached dueto factors such as residing in a densely populated geographical location with over committednetwork bandwidth or travels to geographical areas with no base station coverage.

Gumball: a race condition prevention technique for cache augmented sql database management systems,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Jason Yap,Abstract Query intensive applications augment a Relational Database Management System(RDBMS) with a middle-tier cache to enhance performance. An example is memcached inuse by very large well known sites such as Facebook. In the presence of updates to thenormalized tables of the RDBMS; invalidation based consistency techniques delete theimpacted key-value pairs residing in the cache. A subsequent reference for these key-valuepairs observes a cache miss; recomputes the new values from the RDBMS; and inserts thenew key-value pairs in the cache. These techniques suffer from race conditions that result incache states that produce stale data. The Gumball Technique (GT) addresses this limitationby preventing race conditions. Experimental results show GT enhances the accuracy of anapplication hundreds of folds and; in some cases; may reduce system performance …,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM SIGMOD Workshop on Databases and Social Networks,2012,21
Implementation of delayed updates in Heraclitus,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Richard Hull; Dean Jacobs,Abstract The Heraclitus languages are database programming languages that giveprominence to “delayed updates” or deltas; which are first-class values representing sets ofproposed updates; such as inserts and deletes; to the underlying persistent store. Deltas canbe created; inspected and combined without committing to the given updates. Deltas areuseful for realizing advanced database features that manipulate virtual database states inaddition to the currently stored state; examples include supporting rule-based triggers;hypothetical reasoning; and concurrent transaction processing systems. This paperintroduces Heraclitus [Alg]; a relational algebra extended by deltas; and the HERALDsystem that implements it.

On scheduling atomic and composite continuous media objects,Cyrus Shahabi; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Surajit Chaudhuri,In multiuser multimedia information systems (eg; movie-on-demand; digital-editing);scheduling the retrievals of continuous media objects becomes a challenging task. This isbecause of both intra and inter lobject time dependencies. Intraobject time dependencyrefers to the real-time display requirement of a continuous media object. Interobject timedependency is the temporal relationships defined among multiple continuous media objects.In order to compose tailored multimedia presentations; a user might define complex timedependencies among multiple continuous media objects with various lengths and displaybandwidths. Scheduling the retrieval tasks corresponding to the components of such apresentation in order to respect both inter and intra task time dependencies is the focus ofthis study. To tackle this task scheduling problem (CRS); we start with a simpler …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2002,20
Disk scheduling for displaying and recording video in nonlinear news editing systems,Walid G Aref; Ibrahim Kamel; Thirumale N Niranjan; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Unlike video-on-demand servers; non-linear editing systems enable the user to manipulatethe content of the video database. Applications such as news editing systems require thatthe underlying storage server be able to concurrently record live broadcast information;modify pre-recorded data; and broadcast an authored presentation. A multimedia storageserver that efficiently supports such a diverse group of activities constitutes the focus of thisstudy. Our contribution is a novel real-time disk scheduling algorithm that treats both readand write requests in a homogeneous manner in order to ensure that their deadlines aremet. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm offers low violations of readdeadlines; reduces buffer requirements; and improves the throughput of the storage serverby enhancing the utilization of available disk bandwidth.,Multimedia Computing and Networking 1997,1997,20

Continuous display of presentations sharing clips,Cyrus Shahabi; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Abstract Databases were introduced to remove redundancy from conventional file systemsand encourage sharing; which resulted in update anomalies when information wasmodified. With presentations (movies) sharing clips (sequence of frames); continuousdisplay becomes challenging as well. Continuous display requires the system to retrieve theinformation with no disruptions or delays (hiccups) once a display is initiated. To ensure acontinuous display using a multi-disk hardware platform; a video object is striped intosubobjects. The system enforces a regular schedule on retrieval of each subobject bycontrolling the placement of the subobjects across the disks. Now if different presentationsshare subobjects; each presentation will enforce its own restrictions on the placement of thedata; resulting in an irregular schedule. We investigate approaches to render a schedule …,Multimedia Systems,1995,19
Techniques to quantify SCSI-2 disk subsystem specifications for multimedia,S Ghandeharizadeh; James Stone; Roger Zimmermann,Abstract Magnetic disk technology has established itself as the mass storage device ofchoice in the commercial arena. Most often; the operating system of a hardware platform thatemploys this device (eg; a UnixTM-based workstation) hides its physical attributes byconceptualizing it as an array of blocks. This abstraction expedites program developmenttime because the programmer is no longer concerned with the working details of the massstorage device. Moreover; the nal program is portable as long as a new target platformprovides an identical abstraction of its magnetic disk drive. This paradigm is e ective forthose applications with no real-time constraints. However; certain applications (eg;multimedia) cannot tolerate signi cant variations in the service time of the disk drive. Theymust estimate the service time of the disk accurately in order to both support real-time …,*,1995,19
An evaluation of alternative continuous media replication techniques in wireless peer-to-peer networks,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Tooraj Helmi,Abstract This study investigates a novel streaming architecture consisting of home-to-homeonline (H2O) devices that collaborate to provide on-demand access to a large selection ofaudio and video clips. An H2O device consists of a high bandwidth wireless communicationcomponent; a powerful processor; and gigabytes of storage. This study investigates threefamilies of replication strategies for a H2O cloud. We evaluate these using analytical models.The obtained results demonstrate the superiority of one strategy that determines the numberof replicas for a clip i based on (a) the bandwidth required to display clip i> proportional tothe bandwidth required by the other clips in the database; and (b) the square root of thefrequency of access to the clips.,Proceedings of the 3rd ACM international workshop on Data engineering for wireless and mobile access,2003,17
An evaluation of alternative disk scheduling techniques in support of variable bit rate continuous media,Jaber A Al-Marri; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Abstract A number of recent studies have investigated scheduling techniques in support ofvariable bit rate (VBR) video. When compared with constant bit rate (CBR) video; VBR has alower storage and bandwidth requirement while providing the same quality of images.However; a VBR video clip might exhibit a significant variance in the bit rate required tosupport its continuous display. The previous studies have proposed techniques to supportthe display of a VBR clip from two different perspectives: disk storage subsystem and thenetwork. In this study; we propose a taxonomy of VBR disk scheduling techniques thatincludes those proposed for the network. The results demonstrate that a new class of diskscheduling techniques; termed Atomic—VR 2 VITAL; is superior. Algorithms used torepresent this class were adopted from the networking literature.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,1998,17
Buffer sharing in video-on-demand servers,Weifeng Shi; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Abstract This paper describes a buffer sharing technique that strikes a balance between theuse of disk bandwidth and memory in order to maximize the performance of a video-on-demand server. We make the key observation that the configuration parameters of thesystem should be independent of the physical characteristics of the data (eg; popularity of aclip). Instead; the configuration parameters are fixed and our strategy adjusts itselfdynamically at run-time to support a pattern of access to the video clips.,ACM Sigmetrics Performance Evaluation Review,1997,17
Comparison of replication strategies for content availability in C2P2 networks,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Shyam Kapadia; Bhaskar Krishnamachari,Abstract This study investigates alternative continuous media replication techniques andtheir impact on content availability in a mobile car-to-car peer-to-peer (C2P2) network ofdevices. Using aggregate availability latency as a metric; we compare a simple randomreplication mechanism with a family of techniques that compute the degree of replication foreach title based on its popularity; ie; frequency of access. We use a simulation study alongwith some supporting analytical analysis for this comparison. Obtained results demonstratethe following key lesson. When total storage capacity of the network is significantly largerthan the clip repository size; a random replication technique is sufficient. Otherwise; there isa large parameter space where the frequency-based replication schemes provide superiorperformance.,Proceedings of the 6th international conference on Mobile data management,2005,16
Continuous display of video objects using multi-zone disks,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Seon Ho Kim; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Video servers are expected to play an important role in a number of applicationdomains; eg; library information systems; entertainment industry; scienti c applications; etc. Achallenging task when implementing these systems is to ensure a continuous display ofaudio and video objects. If special precautions are not taken; the display of an object may suer from frequent disruptions and delays; termed hiccups. A second challenging task is to congure a system to meet the performance requirements of an application: its desired number ofsimultaneous displays and the waiting tolerance of a display. For applications with largedata sets; eg; video servers; magnetic disks have established themselves as mass storagedevice of choice. A technique to increase the storage capacity of disks is zoning. A side-e ectof zoning is that it introduces a disk drive with variable transfer rates. This paper describes …,Second International Baltic Workshop on DB and IS,1995,16

Analysis of clustering techniques to detect hand signs,J Eisenstein; S Ghandeharizadeh; L Huang; C Shahabi; G Shanbhag; R Zimmermann,The term multimedia has a different meaning to different communities. The computerindustry uses this term to refer to a system that can display audio and video clips. Generallyspeaking; a multimedia system supports multiple presentation modes to convey information.Humans have five senses: sight; hearing; touch; smell and taste. In theory; a system basedon this generalized definition must be able to convey information in support of all senses.This would be a step towards virtual environments that facilitate total recall of an experience.This study builds on our previous work with audio and video servers and explores hapticdata in support of touch and motor skills. It investigates the use of clustering techniques torecognize hand signs using haptic data. An application of these results is communicationdevices for the hearing impaired.,Intelligent Multimedia; Video and Speech Processing; 2001. Proceedings of 2001 International Symposium on,2001,15
CAMP: a cost adaptive multi-queue eviction policy for key-value stores,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Sandy Irani; Jenny Lam; Jason Yap,Abstract Cost Adaptive Multi-queue eviction Policy (CAMP) is an algorithm for a generalpurpose key-value store (KVS) that manages key-value pairs computed by applications withdifferent access patterns; key-value sizes; and varying costs for each key-value pair. CAMPis an approximation of the Greedy Dual Size (GDS) algorithm in that its eviction policy is aseffective as GDS. At the same time; its implementation is as efficient at LRU. Similar to animplementation of LRU using queues; it adapts to changing workload patterns based on thehistory of requests for different key-value pairs. It is superior to LRU because it considersboth the size and cost of key-value pairs to maximize the utility of the available memoryacross competing applications. We compare CAMP with both LRU and an alternative thatrequires human intervention to partition memory into pools and assign grouping of key …,Proceedings of the 15th International Middleware Conference,2014,14
Nam: a network adaptable middleware to enhance response time of web services,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Christos Papadopoulos; Parikshit Pol; Runfang Zhou,Web services are an emerging software technology that employ XML to share and exchangedata. They may serve as wrappers for legacy data sources; integrate multiple remote datasources; filter information by processing queries (function shipping); etc. With those thatinteract with an end user; a fast response time might be the difference between a frustratedand a satisfied user. A Web service may employ a loss-less compression technique; eg; Zip;XMill; etc.; to reduce the size of an XML message in order to enhance its transmission time.This saving might be outweighed by the overhead of compressing the output of a Webservice at a server and decompressing it at a client. The primary contribution of this paper isNAM; a middleware that strikes a compromise between these two factors in order toenhance response time.

Anexperimental prototype system has been designed and implemented; and an analysis of itsperformance conducted. Previous approaches to sharing in this environment typically relyon the use of a global; integrated conceptual database schema; users and applications mustpose queries at this new level of abstraction to access remote information.

An example is memcached which is in use by very largewell-known sites such as Facebook. A key challenge of such systems is how to maintain thestate of the cache consistent with that of the database in the presence of updates. With SQLbased database management systems (DBMSs) that support query change notificationmechanism; one possible approach would require the cache manager to a) register queriesused to compute a key-value pair with the DBMS to subscribe for notifications when thequery result sets change; and b) delete the cached key-value pair (s) once notified of achange by the DBMS. This approach is independent of how the application updates thedatabase; eliminating application specific software for cache consistency.

The clusters are logically defined across a plurality of disk drives instead of beingphysically defined so that two consecutive subobjects comprising the data object may be onthe same disks. The subobjects are assigned to the disks so that the first fragment of onesubobject is k disks apart from the drive that contains the first fragment of the precedingsubobject; where k is a fixed stride.,*,1998,13

Our solution space comprises of afamily of popularity based replication schemes each characterized by an exponent n.

These include;how to: share the same content among multiple editors; support continuous display of theedited content for each editor; support complex editing operations; compute the set ofchanges (deltas) proposed by an editor; compare the deltas proposed by multiple editors;etc. It is beyond the focus of this paper to report on each challenge and its related solutions.Instead; we focus on one challenge; namely how to support continuous display of the editedcontent for each editors; and techniques for physical organization of data to address thischallenge.,*,2000,12
An Algorithm for Disk Space Management to Minimize Seeks,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Doug Ierardi; Roger Zimmermann,Abstract. The past decade has witnessed a proliferation of repositories whose workloadconsists of queries that retrieve information. These repositories provide on-line access tovast amount of data and serve as an integral component of many applications; eg; libraryinformation systems; scienti c applications; and the entertainment industry. Their storagesubsystems are expected to be hierarchical; consisting of memory; magnetic disk drives;optical disk drives; and tape libraries. The database itself resides permanently on the tape.Files are staged and selectively cached on either the magnetic or optical disk drives; andlater deleted when the available space of a device is exhausted. This behavior will generallycause fragmentation of the disk space over a period of time; resulting in a non-contiguouslayout of disk {resident les.

Strong consistency in cache augmented SQL systems,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Jason Yap; Hieu Nguyen,Abstract Cache augmented SQL; CASQL; systems enhance the performance of simpleoperations that read and write a small amount of data from big data. They do so by lookingup the results of computations that query the database in a key-value store (KVS) instead ofprocessing them using a relational database management system (RDBMS). These systemsincur undesirable race conditions that cause the KVS to produce stale data. This paperpresents the IQ framework that provides strong consistency with no modification to theRDBMS. It consists of two non-blocking leases; Inhibit (I) and Quarantine (Q). Ratingsobtained from a social networking benchmark named BG show the proposed framework hasminimal impact on system performance while providing strong consistency guarantees.,Proceedings of the 15th International Middleware Conference,2014,11

D-Zipfian: a decentralized implementation of Zipfian,Sumita Barahmand; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Abstract Zipfian distribution is used extensively to generate workloads to test; tune; andbenchmark data stores. This paper presents a decentralized implementation of thistechnique; named D-Zipfian; using N parallel generators to issue requests. A request is areference to a data item from a fixed population of data items. The challenge is for eachgenerator to reference a disjoint set of data items. Moreover; they should finish atapproximately the same time by performing work proportional to their processing capability.Intuitively; D-Zipfian assigns a total probability of 1/N to each of the N generators andrequires each generator to reference data items with a scaled probability. In the case ofheterogeneous generators; the total probability of each generator is proportional to itsprocessing capability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of D-Zipfian using empirical …,Proceedings of the Sixth International Workshop on Testing Database Systems,2013,10
Cooperative caching techniques for continuous media in wireless home networks,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Shahin Shayandeh,Abstract With wide spread deployment of wireless home networks; management of dataacross devices is becoming increasingly important. This is especially true for continuousmedia (audio and video clips) because they are large in size and are streamed at a pre-specified rate to support a display free from disruptions and delays.

An Evaluation of Two Policies for Placement of Continuous Media in Multi-hop Wireless Networks,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Tooraj Helmi; Taehee Jung; Shyam Kapadia; Shahin Shayandeh,Abstract This paper focuses on a greedy data placement strategy for a mesh network of peer-to-peer devices that collaborate to stream continuous media; audio and video clips. Thegreedy placement strategy; termed Simple; strives to maximize the number of referencesserved by the local storage of a peer. We analyze two policies to realize this placement:Frequency-based and Byte-hit. The first sorts clips based on their access frequency;assigning the frequently accessed clips to each node. Byte-hit computes the frequency ofaccess to each byte of a clip; sorts clips based on this value; and assigns those with thehighest byte-hit value to each node. Both have the same complexity and almost identicalimplementations. A simulation study shows Byte-hit is superior to Frequency-based for tworeasons. First; it maximizes the number of peers that can simultaneously display their …,Proceedings of the Twelfth International Conference on Distributed Multimedia Systems,2006,10
Controlled buffer sharing in continuous media servers,Weifeng Shi; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Abstract Continuous media servers manage delay sensitive data such as audio and videoclips. Once a server initiates the display of a clip on behalf of a client; it must deliver the datato the client in a manner that prevents data starvation. Otherwise; its display may suffer fromdisruptions and delays; termed hiccups. A hiccup-free display is important to a number ofapplications such as video-on-demand for entertainment; distance learning; newsdissemination; etc. Buffer sharing enables a server to trade memory for disk bandwidth toservice multiple clients by sharing data in memory; using a single disk stream. However; anuncontrolled buffer sharing scheme may reduce system performance. This paper presentsControlled Buffer Sharing (CBS) as a novel framework that facilitates sharing and supportsboth a hiccup-free display and VCR operations. It includes a configuration planner and a …,Multimedia Tools and Applications,2004,10
A framework for conceptualizing structured video,Martha L Escobar-Molano; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Video has been available in a variety of formats since the late 1800s: In the 1870sEadweard Muybridge created a series of photographs to display a horse in motion [Enc92].Thomas Edison patented a motion picture camera in 1887 [Enc92]. Needless to say; videohas enjoyed more than a century of research and development to evolve to its presentformat. During the 1980s; digital video started to become of interest to computer scientists.Repositories containing digital video clips started to emerge. This has resulted in a growinginterest for a system that supports queries that manipulate and retrieve digital video basedon their content. There are two alternative approaches to represent video: stream-based andstructured [Gha95]. With the stream-based approach; a video clip is represented as asequence of frames that must be displayed at a certain rate (eg; 30 frames per second) …,Proc.

Stream-based versus structured video objects: issues; solutions; and challenges,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Abstract An emerging area of database system research is to investigate techniques thatensure a continuous display of video objects. As compared to the traditional data types; eg;text; a video object must be retrieved at a prespecified rate. If it is retrieved at a lower ratethen its display may suffer from frequent disruptions and delays; termed hiccups.

Alternative representations and abstractions for moving sensors databases,Jacob Eisenstein; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Cyrus Shahabi; Gautam Shanbhag; Roger Zimmermann,Abstract Moving sensors refers to an emerging class of data intensive applications thatinpacts disciplines such as communication; health-care; scientific applications; etc. Theseapplications consist of a fixed number of sensors that move and produce streams of data asa function of time. They may require the system to match these streams against storedstreams to retrieve relevant data (patterns). With communication; for example; a speakingimpaired individual might utilize a haptic glove that translates hand signs into written(spoken) words. The glove consists of sensors for different finger joints. These sensorsreport their location and values as a function of time; producing streams of data. Thesestreams are matched against a repository of spatio-temporal streams to retrieve thecorresponding English character or word. The contributions of this study are two fold.

On Configuring Hierarchical Storage Structures,Ali Esmail Dashti; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Abstract The rapid progress in mass storage technology is enabling designers to implementlarge databases for a variety of applications. The possible configurations of the hierarchicalstorage structures (HSS) are numerous and result in various tradeoffs; eg; storage cost;throughput; initial latency; etc. A naive design might waste system resources and result inhigh cost. For example; one naive design decision is to add disk caches for thoseapplications whose bandwidth is already satisfied by the tertiary storage device and cantolerate a high latency. In this study; we introduce a configuration planner for HSS in supportof video-ondemand applications. The input to the planner are the number of simultaneousdisplays required by the target application (ie; throughput); database size; and expectedpattern of access to the objects.

An overview of techniques to support continuous retrieval of multimedia objects,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Cyrus Shahabi; Luis Ramos,Abstract Multimedia information systems have emerged as an essential component of manyapplication domains ranging from library information systems to entertainment technology.However; most implementations of these systems (based on a workstation) cannot support acontinuous display of multimedia objects and suffer from frequent disruptions and delaystermed hiccups. This is due to the low I/O bandwidth of the current disk technology; the highbandwidth requirement of multimedia objects; and the large size of these objects whichrequires them to be almost always disk resident. One approach to resolve this limitation is todecluster a multimedia object across multiple disk drives in order to employ the aggregatebandwidth of several disks to support its continuous retrieval (and display). To supportsimultaneous display of several multimedia objects for different users; the system can …,ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News,1993,9

An evaluation of location-demographic replacement policies for zebroids,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Shyam Kapadia,Abstract In an ad-hoc network of mobile devices; a device is termed a zebroid when it carriesa data item residing on a server-device to a client-device referencing that item. The systememploys a zebroid when its travel path intersects that of the server and the client and thisinformation is known in advance. The motivation for use of a zebroid is to minimize the delayincurred by the client for the referenced data item; termed the availability latency. This paperconsiders the performance of alternative policies that manage the identity of data itemsassigned to a zebroid when its storage is exhausted. One novel policy is LoDeR thatmanages storage of zebroids based on the demographics of a geographical region wherethe zebroid rendezvous with the client.

Staggered striping: A flexible technique to display continuous media,Steven Berson; Richard Muntz; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Xiangyu Ju,Abstract During the past decade; information technology has evolved to where it iseconomically viable to store and retrieve continuous media data types; eg; audio and videoobjects. Systems that support this data type are expected to play a major role in manyapplications including library information systems; entertainment technology; andeducational applications. The objects of this new data type should be retrieved at a pre-specified bandwidth. If an object is retrieved at a rate lower than its pre-specified bandwidththen its display will suffer from frequent disruptions and delays termed hiccups. This paperdescribes staggered striping as a novel technique to support a hiccup-free retrieval ofcontinuous media data types. Its design is based on a multidisk architecture.

An evaluation of two domical block replacement techniques for streaming media in wireless home networks,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Shahin Shayandeh,Wireless mesh home networks are deployed widely due to their ease of installation andeconomical prices. A typical network may consist of a handful of devices such as PCs;laptops; wireless consumer electronic devices; and game consoles. Devices may share databy making the state of their caches dependent on one another using a cooperative cachingtechnique such as Domical. This sharing of data at the edges of the network reduces theload on the infrastructure outside of the household; freeing it to service other requests. In thispaper; we analyze two local cache replacement techniques designed to enhance averagestartup latency of streaming media. Both pre-stage a fraction of a clip on a device inanticipation of its future reference in order to display the prefetch portion while streaming itsremainder in the background.

An on-line reorganization framework for SAN file systems,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Shan Gao; Chris Gahagan; Russ Krauss,Abstract While the cost per megabyte of magnetic disk storage is economical; organizationsare alarmed by the increasing cost of managing storage. Storage Area Network (SAN)architectures strive to minimize this cost by consolidating storage devices. A SAN is aspecial-purpose network that interconnects different data storage devices with servers.While there are many definitions for a SAN; there is a general consensus that it providesaccess at the granularity of a block and is typically used for database applications. In thisstudy; we focus on SAN switches that include an embedded storage management softwarein support of virtualization. We describe an On-line Re-organization Environment; ORE; thatcontrols the placement of data to improve the average response time of the system.

An evaluation of availability latency in carrier-based wehicular ad-hoc networks,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Shyam Kapadia; Bhaskar Krishnamachari,Abstract On-demand delivery of audio and video clips in peer-to-peer vehicular ad-hocnetworks is an emerging area of research. Our target environment uses data carriers; termedzebroids; where a mobile device carries a data item on behalf of a server to a client therebyminimizing its availability latency. In this study; we quantify the variation in availabilitylatency with zebroids as a function of a rich set of parameters such as car density; storageper device; repository size; and replacement policies employed by zebroids. Using analysisand extensive simulations; we gain novel insights into the design of carrier-based systems.Significant improvements in latency can be obtained with zebroids at the cost of a minimaloverhead. These improvements occur even in scenarios with lower accuracy in thepredictions of the car routes.

A cost driven disk scheduling algorithm for multimedia object retrieval,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; LiGuo Huang; Ibrahim Kamel,This paper describes a novel cost-driven disk scheduling algorithm for environmentsconsisting of multipriority requests. An example application is a video-on-demand (VOD)system that provides high and low quality services; termed priority 2 and 1; respectively.Customers ordering a high quality (priority 2) service pay a higher fee and are assigned ahigher priority by the underlying system. Our proposed algorithm minimizes costs bymaintaining one-queue and managing requests intelligently in order to meet the deadline ofas many priority 1 requests as possible while maximizing the number of priority 2 requeststhat meet their deadline. Our algorithm is general enough to accommodate an arbitrarynumber of priority levels.

Extensions of BG for testing and benchmarking alternative implementations of feed following,Sumita Barahmand; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Dobromir Montauk,Abstract Social networking sites are cloud service providers for person-to-personcommunication. Feed following is a key service where a member follows activity streams ofother members and entities such as fan pages. A follower receives a personalized fusion ofstreams produced by those followed. There are alternative definitions of the quality of feeddisplayed to a follower that might be impacted by the highly variable fan-out of the followsgraphs. This makes both an implementation of feed following and a validation of itscorrectness as big data challenges. This paper presents extensions of an interactive socialnetworking benchmark named BG with feed following actions. An implementation of theseactions is agnostic to a data store and can be customized for different data models anddesigns.

Their storagesubsystem is expected to be hierarchical consisting of memory; disk drives; and one or moretertiary storage devices. The database resides permanently on the tertiary storage devicesand objects are swapped onto the magnetic disk drives on demand (and deleted once thedisk storage capacity is exhausted).

Cache replacement with memory allocation,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Sandy Irani; Jenny Lam,Abstract In the generalized caching problem; items can have varying costs and sizes. Weconsider a variant of this problem in which the cache management policy must not onlyspecify which items to evict to make room for an incoming item (cache replacement); butmust also specify a location in memory where each object can be placed contiguously(memory allocation). The problem is motivated by current implementations of key-valuestores in large commercial databases with high read-to-write ratio such as those maintainedby Facebook and Twitter. We propose a simple algorithm and show that if the algorithm isgiven some additional memory to account for fragmentation; it is competitive against anoffline optimal algorithm that does not specify memory layout.(The optimal algorithm needsonly to ensure that the sum of the sizes of the items in the cache does not exceed the total …,*,2014,5
Expedited rating of data stores using agile data loading techniques,Sumita Barahmand; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Abstract To benchmark and rate a data store; one must repeat experiments that impose adifferent amount of load on the data store.

This paper presents several agile data loadingtechniques to expedite the rating process. These techniques include generating the diskimage of the database once and re-using it; restoring the updated data items to their originalvalue; maintaining in-memory state of the database across different experiments to avoidrepeated loading of the database all together; and a hybrid of the third technique incombination with the other two. These techniques are general purpose and apply to avariety of cloud benchmarks.

A comparison of block-based and clip-based cooperative caching techniques for streaming media in wireless home networks,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Shahin Shayandeh,Abstract Wireless home networks are widely deployed due to their low cost; ease ofinstallation; and plug-and-play capabilities with consumer electronic devices. Participatingdevices may cache continuous media (audio and video clips) in order to reduce the demandfor outside-the-home network resources and enhance the average delay incurred from whena user references a clip to the onset of its display (startup latency). In this paper; we focus ona home network consisting of a handful of devices configured with a mass storage device tocache data. A cooperative caching technique may manage the available cache space at thegranularity of either a clip or individual blocks of a clip. The primary contribution of this paperis to evaluate these two alternatives using realistic specifications of a wireless homenetwork; identifying factors that enable one to outperform the other.,International Conference on Wireless Algorithms; Systems; and Applications,2009,5

To share or not to share storage in Mesh Networks: A System Throughput Perspective,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Shahin Shayandeh; Tooraj Helmi,While the cost per megabyte of storage is economical; sharing storage might be expensivebecause delivery of a clip occupying the shared storage requires bandwidth. This isespecially true for mesh networks where devices are constrained by the radio-range andbandwidth of their wireless networking card. Assuming a device; termed a peer; isconfigured with a mass storage device; it may share either all; a fraction; or none of itsstorage. When a peerdoes not shares its storage; it stores clips with the objective to enhancea local criterion such as number of clip requests serviced using its mass storage device.When a peer shares its storage; it may store clips to optimize a global metric such as thetotal number of devices that may display their clips simultaneously; termed systemthroughput.

On scheduling atomic and composite multimedia objects,Cyrus Shahabi; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Surajit Chaudhuri,Abstract In multi-user multimedia information systems (eg; movie-on-demand; digital-editing); scheduling the retrievals of continuous media objects becomes a challenging task.This is because of both intra and inter object time dependencies. Intra-object timedependency refers to the real-time display requirement of a continuous media object. Inter-object time dependency is the temporal relationships de ned among multiple continuousmedia objects. In order to compose tailored multimedia presentations; a user might de necomplex time dependencies among multiple continuous media objects having variouslength and display bandwidth requirement.

An Analysis of BG’s Implementation of the Zipfian Distribution,Jason Yap; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Sumita Barahmand,This research note reports on the behavior of BG's implementation of the Zipfian distribution[2] with different exponents that control its degree of skew. We focus on how BG generatesrequests while preserving the intended distribution. We conclude with an analysis of thedegree of skew with the different exponents for the Zipfian distribution. BG [1] is a benchmarkthat emulates a member of a social networking site performing an interactive action such asviewing another member's profile; inviting a member to be friends; confirming friendshiprequests and others. One may utilize a Zipfian distribution to emulate the frequency at whicha member issues a social networking action. Assuming M is the number of members; theprobability of member i issuing an action is: pi (M; θ)= 1 i (1− θ)∑ M m= 1 (1 m (1− θ)) wherethe exponent θ characterizes the Zipfian distribution. The value of θ is greater than zero …,*,2013,4
Materialized Views and Key-Value Pairs in a Cache Augmented SQL System: Similarities and Differences,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Jason Yap,Abstract In the era of no “one-size-fits-all”; organizations extend a relational databasemanagement system (RDBMS) with a key-value store (KVS) to enhance the velocity of bigdata applications with a high read to write ratio. A popular in-memory KVS is memcached inuse by well known Internet destinations such as YouTube and Wikipedia. Its simple interfaceprovides put; get; and delete of key-value pairs computed using tabular data. A key questionis how do these key-value pairs compare with materialized views in a RDBMS.

Cosar: A precis cache manager,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Jason Yap; Showvick Kalra; Jorge Gonzalez; Elham Keshavarzian; Igor Shvager; Felipe Carino; Esam Alwagait,Abstract Précis is a class of cache managers that stores and retrieves the final results of atime consuming operation that may use data from disparate sources. Examples include theresults of an aggregate query; serialized instances of a data structure that contains results ofdifferent queries and computations used to generate a dynamic HTML page; etc. It is a highthroughput; low latency key-value cache manager designed to scale a large data intensiveweb application. Example systems include memcached and COSt AwaRe (COSAR) cachemanager. In this paper; we present the implementation details of COSAR and its variants ofLRU; LRU-2; and GreedyDual-Size cache replacement techniques. We compare COSARwith memcached that employs the classical LRU replacement technique; showing the meritsof its proposed replacement techniques.,*,2009,4
High Performance Parallel Database Management Systems,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Shan Gao; Chris Gahagan; Russ Krauss,Abstract Parallelism is the key to realizing high performance; scalable; fault tolerantdatabase management systems. With the predicted future database sizes and complexity ofqueries; the scalability of these systems to hundreds and thousands of nodes is essential forsatisfying the projected demand. This paper describes three key components of a highperformance parallel database management system. First; data partitioning strategies thatdistribute the workload of a table across the available nodes while minimizing the overheadof parallelism. Second; algorithms for parallel processing of a join operator. Third; ORE as aframework that controls the placement of data to respond to changing workloads andevolving hardware platforms.,*,2003,4

A comparison of alternative continuous display techniques with heterogeneous multi-zone disks,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Seon Ho Kim,Abstract A number of recent technological trends have made data intensive applicationssuch as continuous media (audio and video) servers a reality. These servers are expected toplay an important role in applications such as video-on-demand; digital library; news-on-demand; distance learning; etc. Continuous media applications are data intensive and mightrequire storage subsystems that consist of hundreds of (multi-zone) disk drives. With thecurrent technological trends; a homogeneous disk subsystem might evolve to consist of aheterogeneous collection of disk drives. Given such a storage subsystem; the system mustcontinue to support a hiccup-free display of audio and video clips. This study describesextensions of four continuous display techniques for multi-zone disk drives to aheterogeneous platform.

A comparison of flashcache with IQ-twemcached,Yazeed Alabdulkarim; Marwan Almaymoni; Ziwen Cao; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Hieu Nguyen; Lingnan Song,Person-to-person cloud service providers such as Facebook use Host-side (HsC) andApplication-side (AsC) caches to enhance performance. Using Facebook's Flashcache asthe representative of HsC and IQ-Twemcached as the representative of AsC; this studyquantifies their tradeoffs using both a read-heavy and a write-heavy workload. Obtainedresults show Flashcache provides significant benefit for I/O intensive workloads; eg; read-heavy workloads when the application working set does not fit in memory. IQ-Twemcachedis most suitable for those workloads that fully utilize the CPU of the server hosting thedatabase management system. For some workloads; the performance enhancementobserved with the two caches deployed together is several folds higher than the sum of theperformance benefit realized by each cache individually.,Data Engineering Workshops (ICDEW); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,3

An evaluation of the hibernate object-relational mapping for processing interactive social networking actions,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Ankit Mutha,Abstract With object-oriented programming languages; Object Relational Mapping (ORM)frameworks such as Hibernate have gained popularity due to their ease of use andportability to different relational database management systems. Hibernate implements theJava Persistent API; JPA; and frees a developer from authoring software to address theimpedance mismatch between objects and relations. In this paper; we evaluate theperformance of Hibernate by comparing it with a native JDBC implementation using abenchmark named BG.

An analysis of two cooperative caching techniques for streaming media in residential neighborhoods,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Shahin Shayandeh; Yasser Altowim,Abstract Domical is a recently introduced cooperative caching technique for streamingmedia (audio and video clips) in wireless home networks. It employs asymmetry of theavailable link bandwidths to control placement of data across the caches of different devices.A key research question is what are the merits of this design decision. To answer thisquestion; we compare Domical with DCOORD; a cooperative caching technique that ignoresasymmetry of network link bandwidths in its caching decisions. We perform a qualitative andquantitative analysis of these two techniques. The quantitative analysis focuses on startuplatency defined as the delay incurred from when a device references a clip to the onset of itsdisplay. Obtained results show Domical enhances this metric significantly when comparedwith DCOORD inside a wireless home network. The qualitative analysis shows DCOORD …,Submitted for consideration,2009,3

A case for a mobility based admission control policy,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Tooraj Helmi; Shyam Kapadia; Bhaskar Krishnamachari,ABSTRACT Ad hoc networks of wireless devices such as Car-to-Car Peer-to-Peer Networks(C2P2) are an emerging technology. Entertainment applications that manipulate continuousmedia; audio and video clips; push the limits of these networks due to their stringentrequirements. These challenges are magnified by environmental characteristics such asdynamic wireless network connections; mobility; multi-hop nature of the network and thepossible lack of a fixed infrastructure. In these networks; an intelligent admission controlpolicy enhances Quality of Service (QoS) observed by the users of the system. This papermakes the case for a decentralized Mobility based ADmission Control (MAD) policy.

Admission Control and QoS for Continuous Media Displays in Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks of Devices,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Shyam Kapadia; Bhaskar Krishnamachari,Abstract—We consider continuous media delivery over a mobile ad-hoc network of vehiclesequipped with car-to-car peer-topeer (C2P2) devices. While the provision of high-bandwidthcontinuous media content with tight QoS requirements is challenging even in staticnetworks; it is considerably more challenging when the network topology is dynamic due tonode mobility. In this paper; we develop a unified client-centric; distributed admission controlframework for such a C2P2 network. Under this framework; we develop several admissioncontrol strategies; namely; server count-based admission (SC); server bandwidthbasedadmission (SB); path bandwidth-based admission (PB); and finally a mobility-basedadmission (MAD [4]) policy; which can be further enhanced using a second-level sampling-based admission policy.

Design of a scalable multimedia storage manager,Steven Berson; Ali Dashti; S Ghandeharizadeh,Abstract During the past decade; the information technology has evolved to store andretrieve continuous media data types; eg; audio and video objects. Unlike the traditionaldata types (eg; text); this new data type requires its objects to be retrieved at a pre-speci edbandwidth. If its objects are retrieved at a rate lower than its pre-speci ed bandwidth then adisplay will su er from frequent disruptions and delays termed hiccups. Storage managersthat support a hiccup-free retrieval of continuous media data types are commonly referred toas multimedia storage managers. They are expected to play a major role in manyapplications including library information systems; entertainment technology; educationalapplications; etc. For the past three years; we have been investigating the design of amultimedia storage manager.

Optimal processor assignment for parallel database design,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Robert R Meyer; Gary L Schultz; Jonathan Yackel,Abstract. The computing time benefits of parallelism in database systems (achieved by usingmultiple processors to execute a query) must be weighed against communication; startup;and termination overhead costs that increase as a function of the number of processorsused. We consider problems of minimizing overhead subject to allocating data among theprocessors according to specified loads. We present lower bounds for these combinatorialproblems and demonstrate how processors may be optimally assigned for some problemclasses. 1. Introduction. In highly-parallel database machines (eg; Gamma [2]; Bubba [1];Non-Stop SQL [12]; XPRS [11] and Volcano [6]) relations are partitioned across multipleprocessors.(Livny et al [9] and Ries and Epstein [10] introduced the related concept of"horizontal" partitioning.)

Each data item may be based on data in adata store. In response to each request to put a data item into the data cache server; the datacache server may determine whether any of the data in the data store on which the data itemis based has or may have changed; put the data item into the data cache memory if none ofthe data in the data store on which the data item is based has been determined to have ormaybe to have changed; and not put the data item into the data cache memory if data in thedata store on which the data item is based has been determined to have or maybe to havechanged.,*,2017,2
On Scalability of Two NoSQL Data Stores for Processing Interactive Social Networking Actions,Sumita Barahmand; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Jia Li,This paper quantifies the scalability of a document store named MongoDB and an extensiblestore named HBase for processing simple operations using a social networking benchmarknamed BG (www. bgbenchmark. org). We report on the vertical and the horizontal scalabilityof both data stores. We quantify speedup and scaleup characteristics of each data store'sSocial Action Rating (SoAR). SoAR is the highest observed throughput with a data storewhile satisfying a Service Level Agreement (SLA) such as 95% of requests observing aresponse time of 100 milliseconds or faster. While the speedup experiments maintain a fixsized social graph and vary the number of nodes; the scaleup experiments vary both thesize of the social graph and the number of nodes proportionally.

This is specially true forcontinuous media (audio and video clips) which are large in size and delay sensitive.Caching of clips across wireless devices may improve user experience; measurable bydifferent Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as throughput and startup latency. Moreover;caching at the edge of the network reduces the demand for the infrastructure outside thehome.

On the complexity of coordinated display of multimedia objects,Martha L Escobar-Molano; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Abstract A multimedia presentation can be represented as a collection of objects withtemporal constraints that define when the objects are rendered. The display of apresentation is termed coordinated when the display of its objects respects the pre-specifiedtemporal constraints. Otherwise; the display might suffer from failures that translate intomeaningless scenarios. For example; a chase scene between a dinosaur and a jeepbecomes meaningless if the system fails to render the dinosaur when displaying the scene.A previous study (ML Escobar-Molano et al.; IEEE Trans. Knowledge Data Eng. 8 (3)(1996)508–511) introduced a resource scheduling technique that guarantees a coordinateddisplay of a presentation for single-disk architectures.

The challenging is due to the low I/O bandwidth of the current disktechnology; the high bandwidth requirement of multimedia objects; and the large size ofthese objects which requires them to be almost always disk resident.

On Expedited Rating of Data Stores,Sumita Barahmand; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Abstract To rate a data store is to compute a value that describes the performance of thedata store with a database and a workload. A common performance metric of interest is thehighest throughput provided by the data store given a pre-specified service level agreementsuch as 95% of requests observing a response time faster than 100 ms. This is termed theaction rating of the data store. This paper presents a framework consisting of two searchtechniques with slightly different characteristics to compute the action rating. With both; toexpedite the rating process; the framework employs agile data loading techniques andstrategies that reduce the duration of conducted experiments.

These includegenerating the disk image of the database once and reusing it many times; restoring theupdated data items to their original value in between experiments; and maintaining in-memory state of the database across different experiments to avoid repeated loading of thedatabase all together. BG may use a hybrid of the proposed techniques when evaluating adata store.

Multi-layer gesture recognition: An experimental evaluation,Jacob Eisenstein; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Leana Golubchik; Cyrus Shahabi; Donghui Yan; Roger Zimmermann,Abstract Gesture recognition techniques often suffer from being highly device-dependentand hard to extend. If a system is trained using data from a specific glove input device; thatsystem is typically unusable with any other input device. The set of gestures that a system istrained to recognize is typically not extensible; without retraining the entire system. Wepropose a novel gesture recognition framework to address these problems. This frameworkis based on a multi-layered view of gesture recognition. Only the lowest layer is devicedependent; it converts raw sensor values produced by the glove to a glove-independentsemantic description of the hand. The higher layers of our framework can be reused acrossgloves; and are easily extensible to include new gestures.

In order to help us understand the multiuserperformance of the multiprocessor Gamma database machine [DEWI90]; we began bystudying the performance of a single processor version of this system. In this paper; wedescribe some of the factors that affect the performance of DBMS in a multiuser environment.We refer the interested reader to [GHAN90] for more details. For these experiments; theGamma software was run on a VAX 11/750 with 2 megabytes of memory and a 330megabyte Fujistu disk drive. An 8 Kbyte disk page was used and the buffer pool was set at61 pages. A second processor was used to simulate users submitting queries. In a DBMS …,ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review,1990,1
High Performance Parallel DBMS,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Shan Gao; Chris Gahagan; Russ Krauss,Abstract Parallelism is the key to realizing high performance; scalable; fault tolerantdatabase management systems. With the predicted future database sizes and complexity ofqueries; the scalability of these systems to hundreds and thousands of processors isessential for satisfying the projected demand. This chapter describes three key componentsof a high performance parallel database management system. First; data partitioningstrategies that distribute the workload of a table across the available nodes while minimizingthe overhead of parallelism. Second; algorithms for parallel processing of a join operator.Third; ORE as a framework that controls the placement of data to respond to changingworkloads and evolving hardware platforms.,*,*,1
BG: A scalable benchmark for interactive social networking actions,Yazeed Alabdulkarim; Sumita Barahmand; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Abstract BG is a benchmark that rates a data store for processing interactive socialnetworking actions such as view a member profile and extend a friend invitation to amember. It elevates the amount of stale; inconsistent; and erroneous (termed unpredictable)data produced by a data store to a first class metric; quantifying it as a part of thebenchmarking phase. It summarizes the performance of a data store in one metric; SocialAction Rating (SoAR). SoAR is defined as the highest throughput provided by a data storewhile satisfying a pre-specified service level agreement; SLA.,Future Generation Computer Systems,2018,*
SQL Query to Trigger Translation: A Novel Transparent Consistency Technique for Cache Augmented SQL Systems,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Jason Yap,Organizations enhance the velocity of simple operations that read and write a small amountof data from big data by extending a SQL system with a key-value store (KVS). The resultingsystem is suitable for workloads that issue simple operations and exhibit a high read to writeratio; eg; interactive social networking actions. A popular distributed in-memory KVS ismemcached in use by organizations such as Facebook and YouTube. This study presentsSQL query to trigger translation (SQLTrig) as a novel transparent consistency technique thatmaintains the key-value pairs of the KVS consistent with the tabular data in the relationaldatabase management system (RDBMS). SQLTrig provides physical data independence;hiding the representation of data (either as rows of a table or key-value pairs) from theapplication developers.

Teleporting Failed Writes with Cache Augmented Data Stores,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Haoyu Huang; Hieu Nguyen,Abstract Cache Augmented Data Stores enhance the performance of workloads that exhibita high read to write ratio by extending a persistent data store (PStore) with a cache. Whenthe PStore is unavailable; today's systems result in failed writes. With the cache available;we propose TARDIS; a family of techniques that teleport failed writes by buffering them in thecache and persisting them once the PStore becomes available. TARDIS preservesconsistency of the application reads and writes by processing them in the context of bufferedwrites. Given a fixed amount of memory; variants of TARDIS may store a different amount ofbuffered writes. We quantify this using the popular memcached and Redis in-memory key-value stores.,*,2017,*
The subset assignment problem for data placement in caches,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Sandy Irani; Jenny Lam,Abstract We introduce the subset assignment problem in which items of varying sizes areplaced in a set of bins with limited capacity. Items can be replicated and placed in anysubset of the bins. Each (item; subset) pair has an associated cost. Not assigning an item toany of the bins is not free in general and can potentially be the most expensive option. Thegoal is to minimize the total cost of assigning items to subsets without exceeding the bincapacities. The subset assignment problem models the problem of managing a cachecomposed of banks of memory with varying cost/performance specifications. The ability toreplicate a data item in more than one memory bank can benefit the overall performance ofthe system with a faster recovery time in the event of a memory failure. For this setting; thenumber n of data objects (items) is very large and the number d of memory banks (bins) is …,Algorithmica,2016,*

SQL Query To Trigger Translation: A Novel Consistency Technique for Cache Augmented SQL Systems,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Jason Yap,Abstract Middle-tier caches enhance the performance of applications that exhibit a high readto write ratio and employ a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). Typically;the cache is a Key Value Store (KVS) that stores and retrieves key-value pairs computedusing the normalized tabular data. An example KVS is memcached in use by very large wellknown sites such as Facebook. A challenge of Cache Augmented SQL RDBMSs (CASQL) ishow to maintain the cached key-value pairs consistent with the database in the presence ofupdates to the RDBMS. The SQLTrig framework addresses this challenge by translatingSQL queries to triggers on the fly. Updates to the RDBMS invoke the triggers to eitherinvalidate or refresh the impacted key-value pairs. SQLTrig supports key-value pairs thatcorrespond to either a SQL query and its result set (QR) or an application specified key …,*,2013,*
A data aware admission control technique for social live streams (SOLISs),Sumita Barahmand; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,A SOcial LIve Stream; SOLIS; is a live stream produced by a device whose owner is sharingthe stream with her friends; granting each friend to perform time shifted viewing for a pre-specified duration. The system buffers this chase data to facilitate its browsing and display.In the presence of many Solis; memory may overflow and prevent display of some chasedata. This paper presents a novel data-aware admission control; DA-AdmCtrl; technique thatsummarizes chase data pro-actively to maximize the number of admissible SOLISs with nomemory overflow. It is designed for use with multi-core CPUs and maximizes utility of datawhenever the user's level of satisfaction (utility) with different data formats is available.,Multimedia (ISM); 2012 IEEE International Symposium on,2012,*

Often times; theowner of the road network data (eg; a transport authority) provides its database to third-partyquery services; which are responsible for answering shortest path queries posed by theirclients. The issue arising here is that a query service might be returning sub-optimal pathseither purposely (in order to serve its own purposes like computational savings orcommercial reasons) or because it has been compromised by Internet attackers who falsifythe results. Therefore; for the above applications to succeed; it is essential that eachreported path is accompanied by a proof; which allows clients to verify the path's …,Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Data Engineering,2010,*
An Evaluation of Three Domical Block Replacement Techniques for Streaming Media in Wireless Home Networks,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Shahin Shayandeh,Abstract Wireless mesh home networks are deployed widely due to their ease of installationand economical prices. A typical network may consist of a handful of devices such as PCs;laptops; wireless consumer electronic devices; and game consoles. Devices may share databy making the state of their caches dependent on one another using a cooperative cachingtechnique such as Domical. This sharing of data at the edges of the network reduces theload on the infrastructure outside of the household; freeing it to service other requests. In thispaper; we analyze three local cache replacement techniques designed to enhance averagestartup latency of streaming media. All three pre-stage a fraction of a clip on a device inanticipation of its future reference in order to display the prefetch portion while streaming itsremainder in the background.

8Real-Time Spatiotemporal Databases to Support Human Motor Skills,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,The term multimedia has a different meaning for different groups. The computer in-dustryuses this term to refer to a system that can display audio-and videoclips. Generally speaking;a multimedia system supports multiple modes of presentation to convey information.Humans have five senses: sight; hearing; touch; Smell; and taste. Thus; in theory; a systembased on this generalized definition must be able to convey information to all senses. Thiswould be a step toward virtual environments that facilitate total recall of an experience. Thischapter explores touch and motor skills as an extension of a multimedia informationmanagement system. Driven by virtual reality applications; the early 1990s witnessed agrowing interest in haptic devices.

Resource scheduling for coordinated display of structured presentations using a multi-disk architecture,Martha L Escobar-Molano; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,A structured presentation consists of a collection of objects (3-D representations) with spatialand temporal constraints along with rendering features such as shading and the audiences'viewpoint. A challenging task is to schedule the retrieval of objects from disk to display apresentation in real-time. The study introduces a taxonomy of such scheduling techniquesand three techniques to support the display of structured presentations assuming a multi-disk architecture. These heuristics are evaluated using a simulation study to quantify theirtrade-offs. The results are compared with a theoretical minimum; demonstrating that one ofthe proposed techniques provides a performance almost identical to this minimum.,Multimedia Database Management Systems; 1996.; Proceedings of International Workshop on,1996,*
Coordinated Display of Structured Presentations Using a Multi-Disk Architecture,Martha L Escobar-Molano; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Abstract With the structured approach to representing video clips; a presentation consists ofa collection of background objects and actors (3-D representations) constrained usingspatial and temporal constructs along with rendering features (eg; shading; audiences' viewpoint). While the spatial constraints de ne the position of displayed objects on the screen; thetemporal constraints describe when the objects are rendered. As compared with analternative approach (termed stream-based) that conceptualizes a video clip as a sequenceof frames; the structured approach provides for both re-usability of objects in otherpresentations and e ective query processing techniques for retrieval of relevant data. Thedisplay of a structured presentation is termed coordinated when the display of its objectsrespects its pre-speci ed temporal and spatial constraints. Otherwise; the display might su …,*,1996,*

Our prior research in this area has included a middleware thatdecides when to compress the output of a WS in order to enhance response time. Morerecently; we have described the use of multiple replicas of a Web service in order toexpedite the processing time of a query. This is most effective for those WSs that areupdated rarely. We investigated the alternative scheduling and allocation policies. Weshowed that a policy that schedules WS replicas on-demand is better than one thatschedules WS replicas when the query plan is initiated. We also showed that LeastResponse Time (LRT) policy performance is superior to other policies.,*,*,*

A web service is a modular application that is published; advertised; discovered;and invoked across a network; ie; an intranet or the Internet. It is bascd on a “software-as-scrviccs" model and may participatc as a component of other web services and applications.Binary and XML are two popular encoding/decoding mechanisms for network messages.Binary encoding is used when performance is critical and XML encoding is employed wheninteroperability with other web services and applications is essential. With each; one mayemploy compression to reduce message size prior to its transmission across the network.These decisions have a significant impact on response time and throughput. This paperreports on our experiences with a decision support benchmark;'l l'CH; using thesealternatives on different hardware platforms. We focus on queries and make the following …,*,*,*

page 2,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract The past decade has witnessed a proliferation of personal computers at homes;businesses; classrooms; libraries; etc. Most often; these systems are used to disseminateinformation. Recently; multimedia repositories have added to the excitement of thisinformation age by allowing a user to retrieve and manipulate continuous media data types(audio and video objects). The design and implementation of these systems is challengingdue to both the large size of objects that constitute this media type and their continuousbandwidth requirement. Compression in combination with the availability of fast CPUs (forreal-time decompression) provide effective support for a continuous display of those objectswith a high bandwidth requirement. Hierarchical storage structures (consisting of RAM; diskand tertiary storage devices) provide a cost-effective solution for the large size of their …,*,*,*

Trojans Cache: A Case for Novel Replacement Algorithms Beyond LRU,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Jason Yap; Showvick Kalra; Jorge Gonzalez; Igor Shvager; Elham Keshavarzian,Executive Summary Introduced more than a quarter of a century ago; the LRU algorithm hashad a profound impact on different facets of computer industry ranging from operatingsystems to database management systems and proxy web cache servers. With advances inprocessor; storage and networking technology; the traditional LRU algorithm is no longersuitable for a growing number of enterprise applications. This is because LRU lacksconcepts such as admission control and cost associated with retrieving a cached data item.Using Trojans Cache configured with main memory only; this white paper demonstrates thelimitations of LRU and compares it with an alternative that is faster and more efficient.,*,*,*

A Comparison of Alternative Techniques to Estimate Response Time for Data Placement,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Shan Gao; Chris Gahagan,Abstract Technological advances in networking; mass storage devices; processor andinformation technology have resulted in a variety of data services in diverse applicationssuch as e-commerce; health-care; scientific applications; etc. While the cost of purchasingtechnology is becoming cheaper; the same cannot be stated about the cost of managing aninformation infrastructure. In order to reduce this cost; one needs tools that empower systemadministrators to explain and reason about a storage subsystem's past performance; eg;response time. Ideally; an administrator would employ these tools to speculate on bothphysical organization of data and hardware changes. With a hypothetical change; one mayuse the previously observed response times to quantify the expected enhancements. In thisstudy; we investigate linear regression; a M/D/1 queuing model and SEER as three …,*,*,*
SGER: REAL-TIME SPATIO-TEMPORAL DATABASES IN SUPPORT OF HUMAN MOTOR SKILLS,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,The goal of this research project is to investigate human motor skills and their representationin a spatiotemporal database management system. An example application is to detect handsigns performed by the hearing impaired. This effort poses several multi-faceted challenges.First; the captured data is continuous media and must be rendered in a timely manner inorder to simulate a movement. If a system delivers the data at a slower rate than its pre-specified rate without special precautions (eg; prefetching); the user might observe logicalerrors that result in undesirable behavior; eg; with chopsticks; either one or both sticks mightfall out of place. Second; the movement of a limb; say a hand; when performing the sameactivity is slightly different across multiple repetition of that activity. We intend to investigatethe first by exploring the design and implementation of real-time spatio-temporal …,*,*,*

Admission Control and QoS for Continuous Media Displays in MANETs,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Shyam Kapadia,Abstract—We consider continuous media delivery over a mo-bile ad-hoc network of vehiclesequipped with car-to-car peer-topeer (C2P2) devices. While the provision of high-bandwidthcontinuous media content with tight QoS requirements is challenging even in staticnetworks; it is considerably more challenging when the network topology is dynamic due tonode mobility. In this paper; we develop a unified client-centric; distributed admission controlframework for such a C2P2 network. Under this framework; we develop several admissioncontrol strategies; namely; server count-based admission (SC); server bandwidthbasedadmission (SB); path bandwidth-based admission (PB); and finally a mobility-basedadmission (MAD [4]) policy; which can be further enhanced using a second-level sampling-based admission policy. We also develop QoS utility models to quantify the performance …,*,*,*

Proteus: A System for Execution of Dynamically Composed Web Services Using GXA,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Craig Knoblock; Christos Papadopoulos; Cyrus Shahabi; José Luis Ambite; Snehal Thakkar,The goal of this project is to utilize the GXA framework (ie; WS-Inspection; WS-Routing; andWS-Referral) to develop Proteus1; a system to: a) dynamically compose plans that integrateweb services; b) execute a plan as efficiently as possible in the presence of failures and webservice migrations; and c) monitor and show the status of different components at runtime.As a motivating example; consider the problem of identifying a building in an image. Thiscan be done by combining web services for imagery (ie; TerraService) with services for theproperty tax sites and online phone books (see the description of our previous work; SectionB). One could write a program to integrate information from the appropriate web services tosolve this query for a given area; but the challenge is that there are approximately athousand property tax sites and hundreds of telephone books for the US and each of …,*,*,*
On the Complexity of Resource Scheduling for Coordinated Display of Structured Presentations,Martha L Escobar-Molano; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Abstract With the structured approach to representing video clips; a presentation consists ofa collection of background objects and actors (3-D representations) constrained usingspatial and temporal constructs along with rendering features (eg; shading; audiences' viewpoint). While the spatial constraints de ne the position of displayed objects on the screen; thetemporal constraints describe when the objects are rendered. As compared with analternative approach (termed stream-based) that conceptualizes a video clip as a sequenceof frames; the structured approach provides for both re-usability of objects in otherpresentations and e ective query processing techniques for retrieval of relevant data. Thedisplay of a structured presentation is termed coordinated when the display of objectsrespects the pre-speci ed temporal and spatial constraints. Otherwise; the display might …,*,*,*
An Overview of Sangam: A System for Integrating Data to Investigate Stimulus-Circuitry-Gene Coupling,Mayank Saxena; Sung-ah Kim; Gully Burns; Arshad M Khan; Jianwen Su; Youssef Hamadi; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Abstract. Sangam is an eScience collaboration between Neuroscientists and ComputerScientists to realize an environment that enables Neuroscientists to investigate “stimulus-circuitry-gene coupling”; that is; how particular types of stressful stimuli are sensed by braincircuits; and how these activated circuits trigger gene expression in discrete brain regions.Sangam is designed to bring together diverse information related to the stress response inmammals. We focus on stress as an eScience initiative since the integration of relevantmolecular; cellular; and systems-level data may help reveal the basic biologicalmechanisms that are impaired in anxiety and stress-related disorders. Sangam employsWeb Services as a building block to facilitate this vision. In this paper; we provide anoverview of Sangam; its final vision; and our plans to fulfill this vision.,*,*,*

Web services as tools within a scientific knowledge engineering environment,GAPC Burns; WC Cheng; N Zhang; S Ghandeharizadeh,Abstract Neuroscience poses a number of challenges to the concept of “software and dataas a service” advocated by Web Services. A primary one is the heterogeneity of the datasources at a conceptual level. In this paper; we describe a knowledge engineering system(called 'NeuroScholar') that acts as a Web Service (WS) for knowledge models based on thepublished neuroscientific literature. It incorporates several existing web services into aframework that empowers a neuroscientist to represent the neural basis of a predefinedphysiological phenomenon (eg: stress).
