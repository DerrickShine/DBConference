Probase: A probabilistic taxonomy for text understanding,Wentao Wu; Hongsong Li; Haixun Wang; Kenny Q Zhu,Abstract Knowledge is indispensable to understanding. The ongoing information explosionhighlights the need to enable machines to better understand electronic text in humanlanguage. Much work has been devoted to creating universal ontologies or taxonomies forthis purpose. However; none of the existing ontologies has the needed depth and breadthfor universal understanding. In this paper; we present a universal; probabilistic taxonomythat is more comprehensive than any existing ones. It contains 2.7 million conceptsharnessed automatically from a corpus of 1.68 billion web pages. Unlike traditionaltaxonomies that treat knowledge as black and white; it uses probabilities to modelinconsistent; ambiguous and uncertain information it contains. We present details of how thetaxonomy is constructed; its probabilistic modeling; and its potential applications in text …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,392
Predicting Query Execution Time: Are Optimizer Cost Models Really Unusable?,Wentao Wu; Yun Chi; Shenghuo Zhu; Junichi Tatemura; Hakan Hacıgümüs; Jeffrey F Naughton,Predicting query execution time is useful in many database management issues includingadmission control; query scheduling; progress monitoring; and system sizing. Recently theresearch community has been exploring the use of statistical machine learning approachesto build predictive models for this task. An implicit assumption behind this work is that thecost models used by query optimizers are insufficient for query execution time prediction. Inthis paper we challenge this assumption and show while the simple approach of scaling theoptimizer's estimated cost indeed fails; a properly calibrated optimizer cost model issurprisingly effective. However; even a well-tuned optimizer cost model will fail in thepresence of errors in cardinality estimates. Accordingly we investigate the novel idea ofspending extra resources to refine estimates for the query plan after it has been chosen …,Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE'13),2013,77
K-symmetry model for identity anonymization in social networks,Wentao Wu; Yanghua Xiao; Wei Wang; Zhenying He; Zhihui Wang,Abstract With more and more social network data being released; protecting the sensitiveinformation within social networks from leakage has become an important concern ofpublishers. Adversaries with some background structural knowledge about a targetindividual can easily re-identify him from the network; even if the identifiers have beenreplaced by randomized integers (ie; the network is naively-anonymized). Since there existsnumerous topological information that can be used to attack a victim's privacy; to resist suchstructural re-identification becomes a great challenge. Previous works only investigated aminority of such structural attacks; without considering protecting against re-identificationunder any potential structural knowledge about a target. To achieve this objective; in thispaper we propose k-symmetry model; which modifies a naively-anonymized network so …,Proceedings of the 13th international conference on extending database technology,2010,77
Efficiently indexing shortest paths by exploiting symmetry in graphs,Yanghua Xiao; Wentao Wu; Jian Pei; Wei Wang; Zhenying He,Abstract Shortest path queries (SPQ) are essential in many graph analysis and mining tasks.However; answering shortest path queries on-the-fly on large graphs is costly. To onlineanswer shortest path queries; we may materialize and index shortest paths. However; astraightforward index of all shortest paths in a graph of N vertices takes O (N 2) space. In thispaper; we tackle the problem of indexing shortest paths and online answering shortest pathqueries. As many large real graphs are shown richly symmetric; the central idea of ourapproach is to use graph symmetry to reduce the index size while retaining the correctnessand the efficiency of shortest path query answering. Technically; we develop a framework toindex a large graph at the orbit level instead of the vertex level so that the number of breadth-first search trees materialized is reduced from O (N) to O (| Δ|); where| Δ|≤ N is the …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,66
Towards predicting query execution time for concurrent and dynamic database workloads,Wentao Wu; Yun Chi; Hakan Hacígümüş; Jeffrey F Naughton,Abstract Predicting query execution time is crucial for many database management tasksincluding admission control; query scheduling; and progress monitoring. While a number ofrecent papers have explored this problem; the bulk of the existing work either considersprediction for a single query; or prediction for a static workload of concurrent queries; whereby" static" we mean that the queries to be run are fixed and known. In this paper; weconsider the more general problem of dynamic concurrent workloads. Unlike most previouswork on query execution time prediction; our proposed framework is based on analyticmodeling rather than machine learning. We first use the optimizer's cost model to estimatethe I/O and CPU requirements for each pipeline of each query in isolation; and then use acombination queueing model and buffer pool model that merges the I/O and CPU …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,42
Symmetry-based structure entropy of complex networks,Yang-Hua Xiao; Wen-Tao Wu; Hui Wang; Momiao Xiong; Wei Wang,Abstract Precisely quantifying the heterogeneity or disorder of network systems is importantand desired in studies of behaviors and functions of network systems. Although variousdegree-based entropies have been available to measure the heterogeneity of real networks;heterogeneity implicated in the structures of networks can not be precisely quantified yet.Hence; we propose a new structure entropy based on automorphism partition. Analysis ofextreme cases shows that entropy based on automorphism partition can quantify thestructural heterogeneity of networks more precisely than degree-based entropies. We alsosummarized symmetry and heterogeneity statistics of many real networks; finding that realnetworks are more heterogeneous in the view of automorphism partition than what havebeen depicted under the measurement of degree-based entropies; and that structural …,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,2008,34
iMecho: an associative memory based desktop search system,Jidong Chen; Hang Guo; Wentao Wu; Wei Wang,Abstract Traditional desktop search engines only support keyword based search that needsexact keyword matching to find resources. However; users generally have a vague picture ofwhat is stored but forget the exact location and keywords of the resource. According toobservations of human associative memory; people tend to remember things from somememory fragments in their brains and these memory fragments are connected by memorycues of user activity context. We developed iMecho (My Memory Echo); an associativememory based desktop search system; which exploits such associations and contexts toenhance traditional desktop search. Desktop resources are connected with semantic linksmined from explicit and implicit user activities according to specific access patterns. Usingthese semantic links; associations among memory fragments can be built or rebuilt in a …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,33

Structure-based graph distance measures of high degree of precision,Yanghua Xiao; Hua Dong; Wentao Wu; Momiao Xiong; Wei Wang; Baile Shi,Abstract In recent years; evaluating graph distance has become more and more important ina variety of real applications and many graph distance measures have been proposed.Among all of those measures; structure-based graph distance measures have become theresearch focus due to their independence of the definition of cost functions. However;existing structure-based graph distance measures have low degree of precision becauseonly node and edge information of graphs are employed in these measures. To improve theprecision of graph distance measures; we define substructure abundance vector (SAV) tocapture more substructure information of a graph. Furthermore; based on SAV; we proposeunified graph distance measures which are generalization of the existing structure-basedgraph distance measures. In general; the unified graph distance measures can evaluate …,Pattern Recognition,2008,28
Personalization as a service: the architecture and a case study,Hang Guo; Jidong Chen; Wentao Wu; Wei Wang,Abstract Cloud computing has become a hot topic in the IT industry. Great efforts have beenmade to establish cloud computing platforms for enterprise users; mostly small businesses.However; there are few researches about the impact of cloud computing over individualusers. In this paper we focus on how to provide personalized services for individual users inthe cloud environment. We argue that a personalized cloud service shall compose of twoparts. The client side program records user activities on personal de-vices such as PC.Besides that; the user model is also computed on the client side to avoid server overhead.The cloud side program fetches the user model periodically and adjusts its resultsaccordingly. We build a personalized cloud data search engine prototype to prove our idea.,Proceedings of the first international workshop on Cloud data management,2009,25
Uncertainty Aware Query Execution Time Prediction,Wentao Wu; Xi Wu; Hakan Hacıgümüş; Jeffrey Naughton,Abstract Predicting query execution time is a fundamental issue underlying many databasemanagement tasks. Existing predictors rely on information such as cardinality estimates andsystem performance constants that are difficult to know exactly. As a result; accurateprediction still remains elusive for many queries. However; existing predictors provide asingle; point estimate of the true execution time; but fail to characterize the uncertainty in theprediction. In this paper; we take a first step towards providing uncertainty information alongwith query execution time predictions. We use the query optimizer's cost model to representthe query execution time as a function of the selectivities of operators in the query plan aswell as the constants that describe the cost of CPU and I/O operations in the system. Bytreating these quantities as random variables rather than constants; we show that with low …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,17

With these links; associations among memory fragmentscan be built or rebuilt in a user's brain during a search. The personalized ranking schemeuses these links together with a user's personal preferences to rank results by bothrelevance and importance.

Efficient algorithms for node disjoint subgraph homeomorphism determination,Yanghua Xiao; Wentao Wu; Wei Wang; Zhenying He,Abstract Recently; great efforts have been dedicated to researches on the management oflarge-scale graph-based data; where node disjoint subgraph homeomorphism relationbetween graphs has been shown to be more suitable than (sub) graph isomorphism in manycases; especially in those cases where node skipping and node mismatching are desired.However; no efficient algorithm for node disjoint subgraph homeomorphism determination(ndSHD) has been available. In this paper; we propose two computationally efficient ndSHDalgorithms based on state spaces searching with backtracking; which employ manyheuristics to prune the search spaces. Experimental results on synthetic data sets show thatthe proposed algorithms are efficient; require relatively little time in most of cases; can scaleto large or dense graphs; and can accommodate to more complex fuzzy matching cases.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2008,14
Sampling-Based Query Re-Optimization,Wentao Wu; Jeffrey F Naughton; Harneet Singh,Abstract Despite of decades of work; query optimizers still make mistakes on" difficult"queries because of bad cardinality estimates; often due to the interaction of multiplepredicates and correlations in the data. In this paper; we propose a low-cost post-processingstep that can take a plan produced by the optimizer; detect when it is likely to have madesuch a mistake; and take steps to fix it. Specifically; our solution is a sampling-based iterativeprocedure that requires almost no changes to the original query optimizer or queryevaluation mechanism of the system. We show that this indeed imposes low overhead andcatches cases where three widely used optimizers (PostgreSQL and two commercialsystems) make large errors.,Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data (SIGMOD'16),2016,11
Revisiting differentially private regression: Lessons from learning theory and their consequences,Xi Wu; Matthew Fredrikson; Wentao Wu; Somesh Jha; Jeffrey F Naughton,Abstract: Private regression has received attention from both database and securitycommunities. Recent work by Fredrikson et al.(USENIX Security 2014) analyzed thefunctional mechanism (Zhang et al. VLDB 2012) for training linear regression models overmedical data. Unfortunately; they found that model accuracy is already unacceptable withdifferential privacy when $\varepsilon= 5$. We address this issue; presenting an explicitconnection between differential privacy and stable learning theory through which asubstantially better privacy/utility tradeoff can be obtained. Perhaps more importantly; ourtheory reveals that the most basic mechanism in differential privacy; output perturbation; canbe used to obtain a better tradeoff for all convex-Lipschitz-bounded learning tasks. Sinceoutput perturbation is simple to implement; it means that our approach is potentially …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.06388,2015,7
基于权重信息挖掘社会网络中的隐含社团,吴文涛， 肖仰华， 何震瀛， 汪卫， 余韬,[摘要]: 社团结构是一种普遍存在于各类真实网络中的结构特性. 挖掘网络的社团结构对于理解网络的功能与行为有着重要作用. 然而; 现有的各种社团挖掘算法仅仅基于网络拓扑结构信息;而忽视了蕴涵于真实社会网络边权信息中丰富的语义信息. 目前普遍使用的基于模块性最大化的社团挖掘算法倾向于将小社团合并; 这使得语义上丰富的小社团容易湮灭于基于拓扑结构信息所挖掘出的大社团中. 而挖掘出这些隐含于大社团中的有着丰富语义内涵的小社团对于加深社会网络语义层面的理解有着重要作用. 为此; 提出一个接近线性复杂度的有权网络社团挖掘算法.通过充分利用权重信息; 算法可以将社会网络划分为富含语义信息的粒度较细且相对较小的隐含社团. 通过对基于DBLP 作者合作网络的实证分析; 证实了新算法的有效性和高效性.,*,2009,7
On Debugging Non-Answers in Keyword Search Systems.,Akanksha Baid; Wentao Wu; Chong Sun; AnHai Doan; Jeffrey F Naughton,ABSTRACT Handling non-answers is desirable in information retrieval systems. Current e-commerce websites usually try to suppress the somewhat dreaded message that no resultshave been found. Possible solutions include; for example; augmenting the data withsynonyms and common misspellings based on query logs. Nonetheless; this is onlyachievable if we can know the cause of the non-answers. Under the hood; most e-commercedata sits in some structured format. Debugging non-answers in the underlying KWS-Ssystems is therefore not trivial—non-answers in a KWS-S system could be a problem of thedata (eg; absence of some keywords); the schema (eg; missing key-foreign-key joins); ordue to empty join results from one of possibly several joins in the generated SQL queries.

Different from other desktop search engines; iMecho ranksresults not only by the content of the query; but also the context of the query. It employs anHidden Markov Model (HMM)-based user model; which is learned from user's activity logs;to estimate the query context when he submits the query.

Context-aware Search for Personal Information Management Systems,Jidong Chen; Wentao Wu; Hang Guo; Wei Wang,Abstract With the fast growth of disk capacity in personal computers; keyword search overpersonal data (aka desktop search) is becoming increasingly important. Nonetheless;desktop search has been shown to be more challenging than traditional Web search.Modern commercial Web search engines heavily rely on structural information (ie;hyperlinks between Web pages) to rank their search results. However; such information isnot available in the circumstance of desktop search. Therefore; state-of-the-art desktopsearch systems such as Google Desktop Search usually leverage pure text-based rankingapproaches (eg; TF-IDF); which often fail to give promising rankings due to themisinterpretation of user intention. We observed that in desktop search; the semantics ofkeyword queries are often context-aware; ie; they are related to the current activity state …,Proceedings of the 12th SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM'12),2012,3
Mlog: Towards declarative in-database machine learning,Xupeng Li; Bin Cui; Yiru Chen; Wentao Wu; Ce Zhang,Abstract We demonstrate MLog; a high-level language that integrates machine learning intodata management systems. Unlike existing machine learning frameworks (eg; TensorFlow;Theano; and Caffe); MLog is declarative; in the sense that the system manages all datamovement; data persistency; and machine-learning related optimizations (such as databatching) automatically. Our interactive demonstration will show audience how this isachieved based on the novel notion of tensoral views (TViews); which are similar torelational views but operate over tensors with linear algebra. With MLog; users cansuccinctly specify not only simple models such as SVM (in just two lines); but alsosophisticated deep learning models that are not supported by existing in-database analyticssystems (eg; MADlib; PAL; and SciDB); as a series of cascaded TViews.

An overreaction to the broken machine learning abstraction: The ease. ml vision,Ce Zhang; Wentao Wu; Tian Li,Abstract After hours of teaching astrophysicists TensorFlow and then see them;nevertheless; continue to struggle in the most creative way possible; we asked; What is thepoint of all of these efforts? It was a warm winter afternoon; Zurich was not gloomy at all;while Seattle was sunny as usual; and Beijing's air was crystally clear. One of the authorsstormed out of a Marathon meeting with biologists; and our journey of overreaction begins.We ask; Can we build a system that gets domain experts completely out of the machinelearning loop?

Ease. ml: towards multi-tenant resource sharing for machine learning workloads,Tian Li; Jie Zhong; Ji Liu; Wentao Wu; Ce Zhang,Abstract We present ease. ml; a declarative machine learning service platform. With ease.ml; a user defines the high-level schema of an ML application and submits the task via aWeb interface. The system then deals with the rest; such as model selection and datamovement. The ultimate question we hope to understand is that; as a" service provider" thatmanages a shared cluster of machines running machine learning workloads; what is theresource sharing strategy that maximizes the global satisfaction of all our users? This paperdoes not completely answer this general question; but focuses on solving the first technicalchallenge we were facing when trying to build ease. ml. We observe that resource sharing isa critical yet subtle issue in this multi-tenant scenario; as we have to balance betweenefficiency and fairness.

MLBench: How Good Are Machine Learning Clouds for Binary Classification Tasks on Structured Data?,Yu Liu; Hantian Zhang; Luyuan Zeng; Wentao Wu; Ce Zhang,Abstract We conduct an empirical study of machine learning functionalities provided bymajor cloud service providers; which we call machine learning clouds. Machine learningclouds hold the promise of hiding all the sophistication of running large-scale machinelearning: Instead of specifying how to run a machine learning task; users only specify whatmachine learning task to run and the cloud figures out the rest. Raising the level ofabstraction; however; rarely comes free-a performance penalty is possible. How good; then;are current machine learning clouds on real-world machine learning workloads?

Semantic Bootstrapping: A Theoretical Perspective,Wentao Wu; Hongsong Li; Haixun Wang; Kenny Q Zhu,Knowledge acquisition is an iterative process. Most previous work has focused onbootstrapping techniques based on syntactic patterns; that is; each iteration finds moresyntactic patterns for subsequent extraction. However; syntactic bootstrapping is incapableof resolving the inherent ambiguities in the syntactic patterns. The precision of the extractedresults is thus often poor. On the other hand; semantic bootstrapping bootstraps directly onknowledge rather than on syntactic patterns; that is; it uses existing knowledge tounderstand the text and acquire more knowledge. It has been shown that semanticbootstrapping can achieve superb precision while retaining good recall. Nonetheless; theworking mechanism of semantic bootstrapping remains elusive. In this paper; we present adetailed analysis of semantic bootstrapping from a theoretical perspective. We show that …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,1
Towards Interactive Debugging of Rule-based Entity Matching.,Fatemah Panahi; Wentao Wu; AnHai Doan; Jeffrey F Naughton,ABSTRACT Entity Matching (EM) identifies pairs of records referring to the same real-worldentity. In practice; this is often accomplished by employing analysts to iteratively design andmaintain sets of matching rules. An important task for such analysts is a “debugging” cycle inwhich they make a modification to the matching rules; apply the modified rules to a labeledsubset of the data; inspect the result; and then perhaps make another change. Our goal is tomake this process interactive by minimizing the time required to apply the modified rules. Wefocus on a common setting in which the matching function is a set of rules where each rule isin conjunctive normal form (CNF). We propose the use of “early exit” and “dynamicmemoing” to avoid unnecessary and redundant computations. These techniques create anew optimization problem; and accordingly we develop a cost model and study the …,EDBT,2017,1

Will You Be in Hospital Next Year: Leveraging Machine Learning in Improving Healthcare,Xiang Peng; Wentao Wu; Jia Xu,Abstract According to some recent study from the American Hospital Association; more than71 million individuals in the United States are admitted to hospitals each year. However; aconsiderable number of hospital admissions turn out to be unnecessary; and studies haveshown that much money (eg; over $30 billion in 2006) has been wasted on suchunnecessary admissions. In this paper; we study the problem of predicting how many days apatient will spend in a hospital in the next year.

Towards Incremental Grounding in Tuffy,Wentao Wu; Junming Sui; Ye Liu,ABSTRACT Markov Logic Networks (MLN) have become a powerful framework in logicaland statistical modeling. However; most of the current MLN implementations are in-memory;and cannot scale up to large data sets. Only recently; Tuffy addresses the scalability issue byusing a pure RDB-based implementation. Inference in Tuffy could be divided into twostages: grounding and search. The grounding stage substitutes evidence into MLN rules toobtain a set of ground clauses; which is used in the search stage to find the most likely worldof the MLN. However; the ground clauses will change if underlying evidence is updated; andredoing grounding from scratch to obtain the new set of ground clauses is costly. In thispaper; we study the problem of incremental grounding in Tuffy. We propose a 2-phaseupdate algorithm; which divides the update procedure into two stages. The first stage tries …,*,2011,*

Understanding Data Races in MySQL,Wentao Wu; Jiexing Li; Tao Feng; Xiaofeng Zhan,Abstract Data races are notorious for their close relationship to many painful concurrencybugs that are very difficult to locate. On the other hand; it is both impossible andunnecessary to forbid every data race in large software systems; by locking every sharedvariable. It is impossible since we cannot afford for the performance deterioration by lockingeverything. It is unnecessary since most of the data races are actually benign; ie; they do notcompromise program's correctness. In this paper; we study the behavior of data races insideMySQL; a modern database management system. We collect a large set of data racesreported by Helgrind; after running a benchmark on MySQL that contains SQL queryworkloads coming from typical database applications. We then carefully examine theseraces and work out a taxonomy on programming paradigms that can cause data races. To …,*,*,*
Sampling-Based Cardinality Estimation Algorithms: A Survey and An Empirical Evaluation,Wentao Wu,Abstract Cardinality estimation is a fundamental problem that has been studied for severaldecades in database community. It has wide applications in many database managementissues such as query optimization; query monitoring; query progress indicator; queryexecution time prediction; and approximate query answering. Existing cardinality estimationtechniques can generally fall into two categories: i) methods based on histograms; and ii)methods based on sampling. Methods based on one-dimensional histograms currentlydominate in the implementation of modern database systems (specifically; query optimizers);due to their simplicity and light overhead. However; they have inherent difficulty in estimatingqueries over more than one columns/tables; especially when data correlation exists.Samplingbased techniques; on the other hand; do not have such limitations.
