Excitability in a quantum dot semiconductor laser with optical injection,D Goulding; SP Hegarty; O Rasskazov; S Melnik; M Hartnett; G Greene; JG McInerney; D Rachinskii; G Huyet,Abstract We experimentally analyze the dynamics of a quantum dot semiconductor laseroperating under optical injection. We observe the appearance of single-and double-pulseexcitability at one boundary of the locking region. Theoretical considerations show that thesepulses are related to a saddle-node bifurcation on a limit cycle as in the Adler equation. Thedouble pulses are related to a period-doubling bifurcation and occur on the samehomoclinic curve as the single pulses.,Physical review letters,2007,163
The linewidth enhancement factor α of quantum dot semiconductor lasers,Sergey Melnik; Guillaume Huyet; Alexander V Uskov,We show that the various techniques commonly used to measure the linewidthenhancement factor can lead to different values when applied to quantum dotsemiconductor lasers. Such behaviour is a direct consequence of the intrinsiccapture/escape dynamics of quantum dot materials and of the free carrier plasma effects.This provides an explanation for the wide range of values experimentally measured and thelinewidth re-broadening recently measured,Opt.

The unreasonable effectiveness of tree-based theory for networks with clustering,Sergey Melnik; Adam Hackett; Mason A Porter; Peter J Mucha; James P Gleeson,Abstract We demonstrate that a tree-based theory for various dynamical processesoperating on static; undirected networks yields extremely accurate results for severalnetworks with high levels of clustering. We find that such a theory works well as long as themean intervertex distance ℓ is sufficiently small—that is; as long as it is close to the value of ℓin a random network with negligible clustering and the same degree-degree correlations.We support this hypothesis numerically using both real-world networks from variousdomains and several classes of synthetic clustered networks. We present analyticalcalculations that further support our claim that tree-based theories can be accurate forclustered networks; provided that the networks are “sufficiently small” worlds.,Physical Review E,2011,101
Cascades on a class of clustered random networks,Adam Hackett; Sergey Melnik; James P Gleeson,Abstract We present an analytical approach to determining the expected cascade size in abroad range of dynamical models on the class of random networks with arbitrary degreedistribution and nonzero clustering introduced previously in [MEJ Newman; Phys. Rev. Lett.103; 058701 (2009)]. A condition for the existence of global cascades is derived as well as ageneral criterion that determines whether increasing the level of clustering will increase; ordecrease; the expected cascade size. Applications; examples of which are provided; includesite percolation; bond percolation; and Watts' threshold model; in all cases analytical resultsgive excellent agreement with numerical simulations.,Physical Review E,2011,84
How clustering affects the bond percolation threshold in complex networks,James P Gleeson; Sergey Melnik; Adam Hackett,Abstract The question of how clustering (nonzero density of triangles) in networks affectstheir bond percolation threshold has important applications in a variety of disciplines. Recentadvances in modeling highly clustered networks are employed here to analytically study thebond percolation threshold. In comparison to the threshold in an unclustered network withthe same degree distribution and correlation structure; the presence of triangles in thesemodel networks is shown to lead to a larger bond percolation threshold (ie clusteringincreases the epidemic threshold or decreases resilience of the network to random edgedeletion).,Physical Review E,2010,80
Accuracy of mean-field theory for dynamics on real-world networks,James P Gleeson; Sergey Melnik; Jonathan A Ward; Mason A Porter; Peter J Mucha,Abstract Mean-field analysis is an important tool for understanding dynamics on complexnetworks. However; surprisingly little attention has been paid to the question of whethermean-field predictions are accurate; and this is particularly true for real-world networks withclustering and modular structure. In this paper; we compare mean-field predictions tonumerical simulation results for dynamical processes running on 21 real-world networks anddemonstrate that the accuracy of such theory depends not only on the mean degree of thenetworks but also on the mean first-neighbor degree. We show that mean-field theory cangive (unexpectedly) accurate results for certain dynamics on disassortative real-worldnetworks even when the mean degree is as low as 4.,Physical Review E,2012,76
Multi-stage complex contagions,Sergey Melnik; Jonathan A Ward; James P Gleeson; Mason A Porter,The spread of ideas across a social network can be studied using complex contagionmodels; in which agents are activated by contact with multiple activated neighbors. Theinvestigation of complex contagions can provide crucial insights into social influence andbehavior-adoption cascades on networks. In this paper; we introduce a model of a multi-stage complex contagion on networks. Agents at different stages—which could; for example;represent differing levels of support for a social movement or differing levels of commitmentto a certain product or idea—exert different amounts of influence on their neighbors. Wedemonstrate that the presence of even one additional stage introduces novel dynamicalbehavior; including interplay between multiple cascades; which cannot occur in single-stagecontagion models. We find that cascades—and hence collective action—can be driven …,Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science,2013,61
Systemic risk in banking networks without Monte Carlo simulation,James P Gleeson; TR Hurd; Sergey Melnik; Adam Hackett,Abstract An analytical approach to calculating the expected size of contagion events inmodels of banking networks is presented. The method is applicable to networks witharbitrary degree distributions; permits cascades to be initiated by the default of one or morebanks; and includes liquidity risk effects. Theoretical results are validated by comparisonwith Monte Carlo simulations; and may be used to assess the stability of a given bankingnetwork topology.,Advances in Network Analysis and its Applications; Mathematics in Industry.

Analytical results for bond percolation and k-core sizes on clustered networks,James P Gleeson; Sergey Melnik,Abstract An analytical approach to calculating bond percolation thresholds; sizes of k-cores;and sizes of giant connected components on structured random networks with nonzeroclustering is presented. The networks are generated using a generalization of Trapman's [P.Trapman; Theor. Popul. Biol. 71; 160 (2007)] model of cliques embedded in treelike randomgraphs. The resulting networks have arbitrary degree distributions and tunable degree-dependent clustering. The effect of clustering on the bond percolation thresholds fornetworks of this type is examined and contrasted with some recent results in the literature.For very high levels of clustering the percolation threshold in these generalized Trapmannetworks is increased above the value it takes in a randomly wired (unclustered) network ofthe same degree distribution. In assortative scale-free networks; where the variance of the …,Physical Review E,2009,31
Dynamics on modular networks with heterogeneous correlations,Sergey Melnik; Mason A Porter; Peter J Mucha; James P Gleeson,We develop a new ensemble of modular random graphs in which degree-degreecorrelations can be different in each module; and the inter-module connections are definedby the joint degree-degree distribution of nodes for each pair of modules. We present ananalytical approach that allows one to analyze several types of binary dynamics operatingon such networks; and we illustrate our approach using bond percolation; site percolation;and the Watts threshold model. The new network ensemble generalizes existing models (eg;the well-known configuration model and Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi networks) byallowing a heterogeneous distribution of degree-degree correlations across modules; whichis important for the consideration of nonidentical interacting networks.,Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science,2014,29
Limitations of discrete-time approaches to continuous-time contagion dynamics,Peter G Fennell; Sergey Melnik; James P Gleeson,Abstract Continuous-time Markov process models of contagions are widely studied; not leastbecause of their utility in predicting the evolution of real-world contagions and in formulatingcontrol measures. It is often the case; however; that discrete-time approaches are employedto analyze such models or to simulate them numerically. In such cases; time is discretizedinto uniform steps and transition rates between states are replaced by transitionprobabilities. In this paper; we illustrate potential limitations to this approach. We show howdiscretizing time leads to a restriction on the values of the model parameters that canaccurately be studied. We examine numerical simulation schemes employed in theliterature; showing how synchronous-type updating schemes can bias discrete-timeformalisms when compared against continuous-time formalisms. Event-based simulations …,Physical Review E,2016,22
Kramers’ law for a bistable system with time-delayed noise,D Goulding; S Melnik; D Curtin; T Piwonski; J Houlihan; JP Gleeson; G Huyet,Abstract We demonstrate that the classical Kramers' escape problem can be extended todescribe a bistable system under the influence of noise consisting of the superposition of awhite Gaussian noise with the same noise delayed by time τ. The distribution of timesbetween two consecutive switches decays piecewise exponentially; and the switching ratesfor 0< t< τ and τ< t< 2 τ are calculated analytically using the Langevin equation. These ratesare different since; for the particles remaining in one well for longer than τ; the delayed noiseacquires a nonzero mean value and becomes negatively autocorrelated. To account forthese effects we define an effective potential and an effective diffusion coefficient of thedelayed noise.,Physical Review E,2007,21
Analytical solution for a class of network dynamics with mechanical and financial applications,Pavel Krejčí; Harbir Lamba; Sergey Melnik; Dmitrii Rachinskii,Abstract We show that for a certain class of dynamics at the nodes the response of a networkof any topology to arbitrary inputs is defined in a simple way by its response to a monotoneinput. The nodes may have either a discrete or continuous set of states and there is no limiton the complexity of the network. The results provide both an efficient numerical method andthe potential for accurate analytic approximation of the dynamics on such networks. Asillustrative applications; we introduce a quasistatic mechanical model with objectsinteracting via frictional forces and a financial market model with avalanches and criticalbehavior that are generated by momentum trading strategies.,Physical Review E,2014,12
Network cloning unfolds the effect of clustering on dynamical processes,Ali Faqeeh; Sergey Melnik; James P Gleeson,Abstract We introduce network L-cloning; a technique for creating ensembles of randomnetworks from any given real-world or artificial network. Each member of the ensemble is anL-cloned network constructed from L copies of the original network. The degree distributionof an L-cloned network and; more importantly; the degree-degree correlation between andbeyond nearest neighbors are identical to those of the original network. The density oftriangles in an L-cloned network; and hence its clustering coefficient; is reduced by a factorof L compared to those of the original network. Furthermore; the density of loops of any fixedlength approaches zero for sufficiently large values of L. Other variants of L-cloning allow usto keep intact the short loops of certain lengths. As an application; we employ these networkcloning methods to investigate the effect of short loops on dynamical processes running …,Physical Review E,2015,9
KURZWEIL INTEGRAL REPRESENTATION OF INTERACTING PRANDTL-ISHLINSKII OPERATORS,Pavel Krejcı; Harbir Lamba; Sergey Melnik; Dmitrii Rachinskii,Abstract. We consider a system of operator equations involving play and Prandtl-Ishlinskiihysteresis operators. This system generalizes the classical mechanical models ofelastoplasticity; friction and fatigue by introducing coupling between the operators. We showthat under quite general assumptions the coupled system is equivalent to one effectivePrandtl-Ishlinskii operator or; more precisely; to a discontinuous extension of the Prandtl-Ishlinskii operator based on the Kurzweil integral of the derivative of the state function. Thiseffective operator is described constructively in terms of the parameters of the coupledsystem. Our result is based on a substitution formula which we prove for the Kurzweilintegral of regulated functions integrated with respect to functions of bounded variation. Thisformula allows us to prove the composition rule for the generalized (discontinuous) …,*,2014,8
Illiquidity and Insolvency: a Double Cascade Model of Financial Crises,Thomas R Hurd; Davide Cellai; Huibin Cheng; Sergey Melnik; Quentin Shao,Abstract: The scope of financial systemic risk research encompasses a wide range ofchannels and effects; including asset correlation shocks; default contagion; illiquiditycontagion; and asset firesales. For example; insolvency of a given bank will create a shockto the asset side of the balance sheet of each of its creditor banks and under somecircumstances; such" downstream''shocks can cause further insolvencies that may build upto create what is called an insolvency or default cascade. On the other hand; fundingilliquidity that hits a given bank will create a shock to the liability side of the balance sheet ofeach of its debtor banks. Under some circumstances; such" upstream''shocks can causeilliquidity in further banks that may build up to create an illiquidity cascade.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1310.6873,2013,8
Site percolation in clustered random networks,Adam Hackett; James P Gleeson; Sergey Melnik,Abstract. In [1] a model was introduced for the creation of a class of random networks withnonzero clustering. Within this model the degree distribution and clustering spectrum of anetwork are prescribed; and as such can be fitted to given real-world data. Here we presentan analytical approach to site percolation in these networks. Theoretical predictions for thecritical site occupation probability and the fractional size of the giant connected componentare shown to match well with numerical simulations on both real and synthetic networks. Wealso demonstrate the application of our approach to Newman's triangle-based model ofclustered random networks [2].,Int. J. Complex Systems in Science,2011,7
Double Cascade Model Of Financial Crises,Thomas R Hurd; Davide Cellai; Sergey Melnik; Quentin H Shao,The scope of financial systemic risk research encompasses a wide range of interbankchannels and effects; including asset correlation shocks; default contagion; illiquiditycontagion; and asset fire sales. This paper introduces a financial network model thatcombines the default and liquidity stress mechanisms into a “double cascade mapping”. Theprogress and eventual result of the crisis is obtained by iterating this mapping to its fixedpoint. Unlike simpler models; this model can therefore quantify how illiquidity or default ofone bank influences the overall level of liquidity stress and default in the system. Large-network asymptotic cascade mapping formulas are derived that can be used for efficientnetwork computations of the double cascade. Numerical experiments then demonstrate thatthese asymptotic formulas agree qualitatively with Monte Carlo results for large finite …,International Journal of Theoretical and Applied Finance,2016,6
Emergence of coexisting percolating clusters in networks,Ali Faqeeh; Sergey Melnik; Pol Colomer-de-Simón; James P Gleeson,Abstract It is commonly assumed in percolation theories that at most one percolating clustercan exist in a network. We show that several coexisting percolating clusters (CPCs) canemerge in networks due to limited mixing; ie; a finite and sufficiently small number ofinterlinks between network modules. We develop an approach called modular messagepassing (MMP) to describe and verify these observations. We demonstrate that theappearance of CPCs is an important source of inaccuracy in previously introducedpercolation theories; such as the message passing (MP) approach; which is a state-of-the-art theory based on the belief propagation method. Moreover; we show that the MMP theoryimproves significantly over the predictions of MP for percolation on synthetic networks withlimited mixing and also on several real-world networks. These findings have important …,Physical Review E,2016,4
A framework for analyzing contagion in assortative banking networks,Thomas R Hurd; James P Gleeson; Sergey Melnik,We introduce a probabilistic framework that represents stylized banking networks with theaim of predicting the size of contagion events. Most previous work on random financialnetworks assumes independent connections between banks; whereas our frameworkexplicitly allows for (dis) assortative edge probabilities (ie; a tendency for small banks to linkto large banks). We analyze default cascades triggered by shocking the network and findthat the cascade can be understood as an explicit iterated mapping on a set of edgeprobabilities that converges to a fixed point. We derive a cascade condition; analogous tothe basic reproduction number R 0 in epidemic modelling; that characterizes whether or nota single initially defaulted bank can trigger a cascade that extends to a finite fraction of theinfinite network. This cascade condition is an easily computed measure of the systemic …,PloS one,2017,3

Whilebulk and quantum well semiconductor lasers are usually extremely unstable when submittedto back reflection; quantum dot semiconductor lasers exhibit a reduced sensitivity. Using arate equation approach; we show that this behaviour is the result of a relatively low butnonzero line-width enhancement factor and strongly damped relaxation oscillations.,Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) Conference Series,2004,2
Exact analytical solution of irreversible binary dynamics on networks,Edward Laurence; Jean-Gabriel Young; Sergey Melnik; Louis J Dubé,Abstract In binary cascade dynamics; the nodes of a graph are in one of two possible states(inactive; active); and nodes in the inactive state make an irreversible transition to the activestate; as soon as their precursors satisfy a predetermined condition. We introduce a set ofrecursive equations to compute the probability of reaching any final state; given an initialstate; and a specification of the transition probability function of each node. Because thenaive recursive approach for solving these equations takes factorial time in the number ofnodes; we also introduce an accelerated algorithm; built around a breath-first searchprocedure. This algorithm solves the equations as efficiently as possible in exponential time.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.02721,2017,1
Simple and accurate analytical calculation of shortest path lengths,Sergey Melnik; James P Gleeson,Abstract: We present an analytical approach to calculating the distribution of shortest pathslengths (also called intervertex distances; or geodesic paths) between nodes in unweightedundirected networks. We obtain very accurate results for synthetic random networks withspecified degree distribution (the so-called configuration model networks). Our methodallows us to accurately predict the distribution of shortest path lengths on real-worldnetworks using their degree distribution; or joint degree-degree distribution. Compared tosome other methods; our approach is simpler and yields more accurate results. In order toobtain the analytical results; we use the analogy between an infection reaching a node in $n $ discrete time steps (ie; as in the susceptible-infected epidemic model) and that nodebeing at a distance $ n $ from the source of the infection.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1604.05521,2016,1

For the widely used G. 729A speech coding algorithm; the entire signal ofeach participant must be fully decoded before they can be mixed. This represents asignificant processing time cost. This report describes how a partial decode of the gainparameters encoded in the bit-stream can be used to identify silence and speech volumelevels. A simple speech recognition heuristic is proposed. We also describe a more involveddecode that would produce a standard energy value comparable with output from othercodecs.,*,2010,*
