A survey of large-scale analytical query processing in MapReduce,Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Enterprises today acquire vast volumes of data from different sources and leveragethis information by means of data analysis to support effective decision-making and providenew functionality and services. The key requirement of data analytics is scalability; simplydue to the immense volume of data that need to be extracted; processed; and analyzed in atimely fashion. Arguably the most popular framework for contemporary large-scale dataanalytics is MapReduce; mainly due to its salient features that include scalability; fault-tolerance; ease of programming; and flexibility. However; despite its merits; MapReduce hasevident performance limitations in miscellaneous analytical tasks; and this has given rise toa significant body of research that aim at improving its efficiency; while maintaining itsdesirable properties.

Efficient processing of top-k spatial keyword queries,João B Rocha-Junior; Orestis Gkorgkas; Simon Jonassen; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Given a spatial location and a set of keywords; a top-k spatial keyword queryreturns the k best spatio-textual objects ranked according to their proximity to the querylocation and relevance to the query keywords. There are many applications handling hugeamounts of geotagged data; such as Twitter and Flickr; that can benefit from this query.Unfortunately; the state-of-the-art approaches require non-negligible processing cost thatincurs in long response time. In this paper; we propose a novel index to improve theperformance of top-k spatial keyword queries named Spatial Inverted Index (S2I). Our indexmaps each distinct term to a set of objects containing the term. The objects are storeddifferently according to the document frequency of the term and can be retrieved efficiently indecreasing order of keyword relevance and spatial proximity. Moreover; we present …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2011,163
Reverse top-k queries,Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Yannis Kotidis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Rank-aware query processing has become essential for many applications that return to theuser only the top-k objects based on the individual user's preferences. Top-k queries havebeen mainly studied from the perspective of the user; focusing primarily on efficient queryprocessing. In this work; for the first time; we study top-k queries from the perspective of theproduct manufacturer. Given a potential product; which are the user preferences for whichthis product is in the top-k query result set? We identify a novel query type; namely reversetop-k query; that is essential for manufacturers to assess the potential market and impact oftheir products based on the competition. We formally define reverse top-k queries andintroduce two versions of the query; namely monochromatic and bichromatic. We firstprovide a geometric interpretation of the monochromatic reverse top-k query in the …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,125
On efficient top-k query processing in highly distributed environments,Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg; Michalis Vazirgiannis,Abstract Lately the advances in centralized database management systems show a trendtowards supporting rank-aware query operators; like top-k; that enable users to retrieve onlythe most interesting data objects. A challenging problem is to support rank-aware queries inhighly distributed environments. In this paper; we present a novel approach; calledSPEERTO; for top-k query processing in large-scale peer-to-peer networks; where thedataset is horizontally distributed over the peers. Towards this goal; we explore theapplicability of the skyline operator for efficiently routing top-k queries in a large super-peernetwork. Relying on a thresholding scheme; SPEERTO returns the exact resultsprogressively to the user; while the number of queried super-peers and transferred data isminimized. Finally; we propose different variations of SPEERTO that allow balancing …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,98
Determining time of queries for re-ranking search results,Nattiya Kanhabua; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Recent work on analyzing query logs shows that a significant fraction of queries aretemporal; ie; relevancy is dependent on time; and temporal queries play an important role inmany domains; eg; digital libraries and document archives. Temporal queries can bedivided into two types: 1) those with temporal criteria explicitly provided by users; and 2)those with no temporal criteria provided. In this paper; we deal with the latter type of queries;ie; queries that comprise only keywords; and their relevant documents are associated toparticular time periods not given by the queries. We propose a number of methods todetermine the time of queries using temporal language models. After that; we show how toincrease the retrieval effectiveness by using the determined time of queries to re-rank thesearch results. Through extensive experiments we show that our proposed approaches …,International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries,2010,96
Top-k spatial keyword queries on road networks,João B Rocha-Junior; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract With the popularization of GPS-enabled devices there is an increasing interest forlocation-based queries. In this context; one interesting problem is processing top-k spatialkeyword queries. Given a set of objects with a textual description (eg; menu of a restaurant);a query location (latitude and longitude); and a set of query keywords; a top-k spatialkeyword query returns the k best objects ranked in terms of both distance to the querylocation and textual relevance to the query keywords. So far; the research on this problemhas assumed Euclidean space. In order to process such queries efficiently; spatio-textualindexes combining R-trees and inverted files are employed. However; for most realapplications; the distance between the objects and query location is constrained by a roadnetwork (shortest path) and cannot be computed efficiently using R-trees. In this paper …,Proceedings of the 15th international conference on extending database technology,2012,84
DESENT: Decentralized and distributed semantic overlay generation in P2P networks,Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Norvag; Michalis Vazirgiannis,The current approach in web searching; ie; using centralized search engines; rises issuesthat question their future applicability: 1) coverage and scalability; 2) freshness; and 3)information monopoly. Performing web search using a P2P architecture that consists of theactual web servers has the potential to tackle those issues. In order to achieve the desiredperformance and scalability; as well as enhancing search quality relative to centralizedsearch engines; semantic overlay networks (SONS) connecting peers storing semanticallyrelated information can be employed. The lack of global content/topology knowledge in aP2P system is the key challenge in forming SONS; and this paper describes anunsupervised approach for decentralized and distributed generation of SONS (DESENT).Through simulations and analytical cost models we verify our claims regarding …,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,2007,82
Efficient processing of top-k spatial preference queries,João B Rocha-Junior; Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Top-k spatial preference queries return a ranked set of the k best data objectsbased on the scores of feature objects in their spatial neighborhood. Despite the wide rangeof location-based applications that rely on spatial preference queries; existing algorithmsincur non-negligible processing cost resulting in high response time. The reason is thatcomputing the score of a data object requires examining its spatial neighborhood to find thefeature object with highest score. In this paper; we propose a novel technique to speed upthe performance of top-k spatial preference queries. To this end; we propose a mapping ofpairs of data and feature objects to a distance-score space; which in turn allows us to identifyand materialize the minimal subset of pairs that is sufficient to answer any spatial preferencequery. Furthermore; we present a novel algorithm that improves query processing …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,59
Monochromatic and bichromatic reverse top-k queries,Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Yannis Kotidis; Kjetil Norvag,Nowadays; most applications return to the user a limited set of ranked results based on theindividual user's preferences; which are commonly expressed through top-k queries. Fromthe perspective of a manufacturer; it is imperative that her products appear in the highestranked positions for many different user preferences; otherwise the product is not visible topotential customers. In this paper; we define a novel query type; namely the reverse top-kquery; that covers this requirement:“Given a potential product; which are the userpreferences that make this product belong to the top-k query result set?.” Reverse top-kqueries are essential for manufacturers to assess the impact of their products in the marketbased on the competition. We formally define reverse top-k queries and introduce twoversions of the query; monochromatic and bichromatic. First; we provide a geometric …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,57
Improving temporal language models for determining time of non-timestamped documents,Nattiya Kanhabua; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Taking the temporal dimension into account in searching; ie; using time of contentcreation as part of the search condition; is now gaining increasingly interest. However; in thecase of web search and web warehousing; the timestamps (time of creation or creation ofcontents) of web pages and documents found on the web are in general not known or cannot be trusted; and must be determined otherwise. In this paper; we describe approachesthat enhance and increase the quality of existing techniques for determining timestampsbased on a temporal language model. Through a number of experiments on temporaldocument collections we show how our new methods improve the accuracy of timestampingcompared to the previous models.,International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries,2008,57
Fast group recommendations by applying user clustering,Eirini Ntoutsi; Kostas Stefanidis; Kjetil Nørvåg; Hans-Peter Kriegel,Abstract Recommendation systems have received significant attention; with most of theproposed methods focusing on personal recommendations. However; there are contexts inwhich the items to be suggested are not intended for a single user but for a group of people.For example; assume a group of friends or a family that is planning to watch a movie or visita restaurant. In this paper; we propose an extensive model for group recommendations thatexploits recommendations for items that similar users to the group members liked in the past.We do not exhaustively search for similar users in the whole user base; but we pre-partitionusers into clusters of similar ones and use the cluster members for recommendations. Weefficiently aggregate the single user recommendations into group recommendations byleveraging the power of a top-k algorithm. We evaluate our approach in a real dataset of …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2012,55

Identifying the most influential data objects with reverse top-k queries,Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg; Yannis Kotidis,Abstract Top-k queries are widely applied for retrieving a ranked set of the k most interestingobjects based on the individual user preferences. As an example; in online marketplaces;customers (users) typically seek a ranked set of products (objects) that satisfy their needs.Reversing top-k queries leads to a query type that instead returns the set of customers thatfind a product appealing (it belongs to the top-k result set of their preferences). In this paper;we address the challenging problem of processing queries that identify the top-m mostinfluential products to customers; where influence is defined as the cardinality of the reversetop-k result set. This definition of influence is useful for market analysis; since it is directlyrelated to the number of customers that value a particular product and; consequently; to itsvisibility and impact in the market. Existing techniques require processing a reverse top-k …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,51
SemanticRank: ranking keywords and sentences using semantic graphs,George Tsatsaronis; Iraklis Varlamis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract The selection of the most descriptive terms or passages from text is crucial forseveral tasks; such as feature extraction and summarization. In the majority of the cases;research works propose the ranking of all candidate keywords or sentences and then selectthe top-ranked items as features; or as a text summary respectively. Ranking is usuallyperformed using statistical information from text (ie; frequency of occurrence; inversedocument frequency; co-occurrence information). In this paper we present SemanticRank; agraph-based ranking algorithm for keyword and sentence extraction from text. The algorithmconstructs a semantic graph using implicit links; which are based on semantic relatednessbetween text nodes and consequently ranks nodes using different ranking algorithms.Comparative evaluation against related state of the art methods for keyword and …,Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Computational Linguistics,2010,51
Branch-and-bound algorithm for reverse top-k queries,Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg; Yannis Kotidis,Abstract Top-k queries return to the user only the k best objects based on the individual userpreferences and comprise an essential tool for rank-aware query processing. Assuming astored data set of user preferences; reverse top-k queries have been introduced forretrieving the users that deem a given database object as one of their top-k results. Reversetop-k queries have already attracted significant interest in research; due to numerous real-life applications such as market analysis and product placement. Currently; the most efficientalgorithm for computing the reverse top-k set is RTA. RTA has two main drawbacks whenprocessing a reverse top-k query:(i) it needs to access all stored user preferences; and (ii) itcannot avoid executing a top-k query for each user preference that belongs to the result set.To address these limitations; in this paper; we identify useful properties for processing …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD international conference on management of data,2013,50
A study of opinion mining and visualization of hotel reviews,Eivind Bjørkelund; Thomas H Burnett; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Travel websites like TripAdvisor are nowadays important tools for travelers whendeciding which hotels to stay in; and what restaurants and tourist attractions to visit. In thispaper; we study opinion mining applied on data from travel review sites. We also describehow the results of sentiment analysis of textual reviews can be visualized using GoogleMaps; providing possibilities for users to easily detect good hotels and good areas to stay in.More advanced features also provides for faceted and filtered visualization. An evaluation ofthe techniques presented; shows high accuracy in opinion mining; and that the prototypecan help detect hotel features and possible reasons for changes in opinion as well as show"good" and" bad" geographical areas based on hotel reviews.,Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Information Integration and Web-based Applications & Services,2012,50
K-AP: generating specified K clusters by efficient affinity propagation,Xiangliang Zhang; Wei Wang; Kjetil Norvag; Michele Sebag,The Affinity Propagation (AP) clustering algorithm proposed by Frey and Dueck (2007)provides an understandable; nearly optimal summary of a data set. However; it suffers twomajor shortcomings: i) the number of clusters is vague with the user-defined parametercalled self-confidence; and ii) the quadratic computational complexity. When aiming at agiven number of clusters due to prior knowledge; AP has to be launched many times until anappropriate setting of self-confidence is found. The re-launched AP increases thecomputational cost by one order of magnitude. In this paper; we propose an algorithm;called K-AP; to exploit the immediate results of K clusters by introducing a constraint in theprocess of message passing. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation; K-AP was shown to be able to directly generate K clusters as user defined; with a negligible …,Data mining (ICDM); 2010 IEEE 10th international conference on,2010,46
Multi-step classification approaches to cumulative citation recommendation,Krisztian Balog; Heri Ramampiaro; Naimdjon Takhirov; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Knowledge bases have become indispensable sources of information. It istherefore critical that they rely on the latest information available and get updated every timenew facts surface. Knowledge base acceleration (KBA) systems seek to help humansexpand knowledge bases like Wikipedia by automatically recommending edits based onincoming content streams. A core step in this process is that of identifying relevant content;ie; filtering documents that would imply modifications to the attributes or relations of a giventarget entity. We propose two multi-step classification approaches for this task that consist oftwo and three binary classification steps; respectively. Both methods share the same initialcomponent; which is concerned with the identification of entity mentions in documents; whilesubsequent steps involve identification of documents being relevant and/or central to a …,Proceedings of the 10th Conference on Open Research Areas in Information Retrieval,2013,45
WikiPop: personalized event detection system based on Wikipedia page view statistics,Marek Ciglan; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract In this paper; we describe WikiPop service; a system designed to detect significantincrease of popularity of topics related to users' interests. We exploit Wikipedia page viewstatistics to identify concepts with significant increase of the interest from the public. Daily;there are thousands of articles with increased popularity; thus; a personalization is in orderto provide the user only with results related to his/her interest. The WikiPop system allows auser to define a context by stating a set of Wikipedia articles describing topics of interest. Thesystem is then able to search; for the given date; for popular topics related to the userdefined context.,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,44
DYFRAM: dynamic fragmentation and replica management in distributed database systems,Jon Olav Hauglid; Norvald H Ryeng; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract In distributed database systems; tables are frequently fragmented and replicatedover a number of sites in order to reduce network communication costs. How to fragment;when to replicate and how to allocate the fragments to the sites are challenging problemsthat has previously been solved either by static fragmentation; replication and allocation; orbased on a priori query analysis. Many emerging applications of distributed databasesystems generate very dynamic workloads with frequent changes in access patterns fromdifferent sites. In such contexts; continuous refragmentation and reallocation cansignificantly improve performance. In this paper we present DYFRAM; a decentralizedapproach for dynamic table fragmentation and allocation in distributed database systemsbased on observation of the access patterns of sites to tables. The approach performs …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2010,39
AGiDS: A grid-based strategy for distributed skyline query processing,João B Rocha-Junior; Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Skyline queries help users make intelligent decisions over complex data; wheredifferent and often conflicting criteria are considered. A challenging problem is to supportskyline queries in distributed environments; where data is scattered over independentsources. The query response time of skyline processing over distributed data depends onthe amount of transferred data and the query processing cost at each server. In this paper;we propose AGiDS; a framework for efficient skyline processing over distributed data. Ourapproach reduces significantly the amount of transferred data; by using a grid-based datasummary that captures the data distribution on each server. AGiDS consists of two phases tocompute the result: in the first phase the querying server gathers the grid-based summary;whereas in the second phase a skyline request is sent only to the servers that may …,International Conference on Data Management in Grid and P2P Systems,2009,39
On the modeling of entities for ad-hoc entity search in the web of data,Robert Neumayer; Krisztian Balog; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract The Web of Data describes objects; entities; or “things” in terms of their attributesand their relationships; using RDF statements. There is a need to make this wealth ofknowledge easily accessible by means of keyword search. Despite recent research efforts inthis direction; there is a lack of understanding of how structured semantic data is bestrepresented for text-based entity retrieval. The task we are addressing in this paper is ad-hoc entity search: the retrieval of RDF resources that represent an entity described in thekeyword query. We build upon and formalise existing entity modeling approaches within agenerative language modeling framework; and compare them experimentally using astandard test collection; provided by the Semantic Search Challenge evaluation series.

Efficient execution plans for distributed skyline query processing,João B Rocha-Junior; Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract In this paper; we study the generation of efficient execution plans for skyline queryprocessing in large-scale distributed environments. In such a setting; each server storesautonomously a fraction of the data; thus all servers need to process the skyline query. Anexecution plan defines the order in which the individual skyline queries are processed ondifferent servers; and influences the performance of query processing. Querying serversconsecutively reduces the amount of transferred data and the number of queried servers;since skyline points obtained by one server prune points in the subsequent servers; but alsoincreases the latency of the system. To address this trade-off; we introduce a novelframework; called SkyPlan; for processing distributed skyline queries that generatesexecution plans aiming at optimizing the performance of query processing. Thus; we …,Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2011,36
Temporal information retrieval,Nattiya Kanhabua; Roi Blanco; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Temporal dynamics and how they impact upon various components of informationretrieval (IR) systems have received a large share of attention in the last decade. Inparticular; the study of relevance in information retrieval can now be framed within the so-called temporal IR approaches; which explain how user behavior; document content andscale vary with time; and how we can use them in our favor in order to improve retrievaleffectiveness. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of temporal IR approaches;centered on the following questions: what are temporal dynamics; why do they occur; andwhen and how to leverage temporal information throughout the search cycle andarchitecture. We first explain the general and wide aspects associated to temporal dynamicsby focusing on the web domain; from content and structural changes to variations of user …,Foundations and Trends® in Information Retrieval,2015,34
Exploiting time-based synonyms in searching document archives,Nattiya Kanhabua; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Query expansion of named entities can be employed in order to increase theretrieval effectiveness. A peculiarity of named entities compared to other vocabulary terms isthat they are very dynamic in appearance; and synonym relationships between termschange with time. In this paper; we present an approach to extracting synonyms of namedentities over time from the whole history of Wikipedia. In addition; we will use their temporalpatterns as a feature in ranking and classifying them into two types; ie; time-independent ortime-dependent. Time-independent synonyms are invariant to time; while time-dependentsynonyms are relevant to a particular time period; ie; the synonym relationships change overtime. Further; we describe how to make use of both types of synonyms to increase theretrieval effectiveness; ie; query expansion with time-independent synonyms for an …,Proceedings of the 10th annual joint conference on Digital libraries,2010,34
Using temporal language models for document dating,Nattiya Kanhabua; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract In order to increase precision in searching for web pages or web documents; takingthe temporal dimension into account is gaining increased interest. A particular problem forweb documents found on the Internet is that in general; no trustworthy timestamp isavailable. This is due to its decentralized nature and the lack of standards for time and date.In previous work we have presented techniques for solving this problem. In this paper; wepresent a tool for determining the timestamp of a non-timestamped document (using file;URL or text as input) using temporal language models. We also outline how this tool will bedemonstrated.,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2009,32
Supporting temporal text-containment queries in temporal document databases,Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract In temporal document databases and temporal XML databases; temporal text-containment queries are a potential performance bottleneck. In this paper we describe howto manage documents and index structures in such databases in a way that makes temporaltext-containment querying feasible. We describe and discuss different index structures thatcan improve such queries. Three of the alternatives have been implemented in the V2temporal document database system; and the performance of the index structures is studiedusing temporal web data. The results show that even a very simple time-indexing approachcan reduce query cost by up to three orders of magnitude.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2004,31
Algorithms for temporal query operators in XML databases,Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract We have in a previous paper introduced the new query operators that are neededin order to support an XML query language that supports temporal operations. The queryoperators make it possible to query historical versions; retrieve documents valid at a certaintime; query changes to documents; etc. In this paper; we describe algorithms for execution ofthe query operators; and we also discuss document content indexing for more efficientexecution of the operators.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2002,31
Extracting named entities and synonyms from wikipedia,Christian Bøhn; Kjetil Nørvåg,In many search domains; both contents and searches are frequently tied to named entitiessuch as a person; a company or similar. An example of such a domain is a news archive.One challenge from an information retrieval point of view is that a single entity can havemore than one way of referring to it. In this paper we describe how to use Wikipedia contentsto automatically generate a dictionary of named entities and synonyms that are all referringto the same entity. This dictionary can subsequently be used to improve search quality; forexample using query expansion. Through an experimental evaluation we show that with ourapproach; we can find named entities and their synonyms with a high degree of accuracy.,Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA); 2010 24th IEEE International Conference on,2010,30
An experimental study on unsupervised graph-based word sense disambiguation,George Tsatsaronis; Iraklis Varlamis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Recent research works on unsupervised word sense disambiguation report anincrease in performance; which reduces their handicap from the respective supervisedapproaches for the same task. Among the latest state of the art methods; those that usesemantic graphs reported the best results. Such methods create a graph comprising thewords to be disambiguated and their corresponding candidate senses. The graph isexpanded by adding semantic edges and nodes from a thesaurus. The selection of the mostappropriate sense per word occurrence is then made through the use of graph processingalgorithms that offer a degree of importance among the graph vertices. In this paper weexperimentally investigate the performance of such methods. We additionally evaluate anew method; which is based on a recently introduced algorithm for computing similarity …,International Conference on Intelligent Text Processing and Computational Linguistics,2010,29
On community detection in real-world networks and the importance of degree assortativity,Marek Ciglan; Michal Laclavík; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Graph clustering; often addressed as community detection; is a prominent task inthe domain of graph data mining with dozens of algorithms proposed in recent years. In thispaper; we focus on several popular community detection algorithms with low computationalcomplexity and with decent performance on the artificial benchmarks; and we study theirbehaviour on real-world networks. Motivated by the observation that there is a class ofnetworks for which the community detection methods fail to deliver good communitystructure; we examine the assortativity coefficient of ground-truth communities and show thatassortativity of a community structure can be very different from the assortativity of theoriginal network. We then examine the possibility of exploiting the latter by weighting edgesof a network with the aim to improve the community detection outputs for networks with …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2013,28

Temporal query operators in XML databases,Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract The contents of an XML database or an XML/Web data warehouse is seldom static.New documents are created; documents are deleted; and more important: documents areupdated. In many cases; we want to be able to search in historical versions; retrievedocuments valid at a certain time; query changes to documents; etc. This can be supportedby extending the system with temporal database features.

Distributed top-k query processing by exploiting skyline summaries,Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Recently; a trend has been observed towards supporting rank-aware queryoperators; such as top-k; that enable users to retrieve only a limited set of the mostinteresting data objects. As data nowadays is commonly stored distributed over multipleservers; a challenging problem is to support rank-aware queries in distributed environments.In this paper; we propose a novel approach; called DiTo; for efficient top-k processing overmultiple servers; where each server stores autonomously a fraction of the data. Towards thisgoal; we exploit the inherent relationship of top-k and skyline objects; and we employ theskyline objects of servers as a data summarization mechanism for efficiently identifying theservers that store top-k results. Relying on a thresholding scheme; DiTo retrieves the top-kresult set progressively; while the number of queried servers and transferred data is …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2012,27
Efficient search based on content similarity over self-organizing P2P networks,Christos Doulkeridis; Akrivi Vlachou; Kjetil Nørvåg; Yannis Kotidis; Michalis Vazirgiannis,Abstract The advent of the World Wide Web has made an enormous amount of informationavailable to everyone and the widespread use of digital equipment enables end-users(peers) to produce their own digital content. This vast amount of information requiresscalable data management systems. Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems have so far been wellestablished in several application areas; with file-sharing being the most prominent. Thenext challenge that needs to be addressed is (more complex) data sharing; managementand query processing; thus facilitating the delivery of a wide spectrum of novel data-centricapplications to the end-user; while providing high Quality-of-Service.

Concurrency Control in Distributed Object-Oriented Database Systems.,Kjetil Nørvåg; Olav Sandstå; Kjell Bratbergsengen,Abstract Simulating distributed database systems is inherently difficult; as there are manyfactors that may influence the results. This includes architectural options as well as workloadand data distribution. In this paper we present the DBsim simulator and some simulationresults. The DBsim simulator architecture is extendible; and it is easy to change parametersand configuration. The simulation results in this paper is a comparison of performance andresponse times for two concurrency control algorithms; timestamp ordering and two-phaselocking. The simulations have been run with different number of nodes; network types; datadeclustering and workloads. The results show that for a mix of small and long transactions;the throughput is significantly higher for a system with a timestamp ordering scheduler thanfor a system with a two-phase locking scheduler.

We enhance recommendations withthe notion of support to model the confidence of the recommendations. Moreover; wepropose partitioning users into clusters of similar ones. This way; recommendations for usersare produced with respect to the preferences of their cluster members without extensivelysearching for similar users in the whole user base. Finally; we leverage the power of a top-kalgorithm for locating the top-k group recommendations.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2012,26
Monitoring reverse top-k queries over mobile devices,Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract In typical mobile applications; mobile users seek points of interest in their vicinity(eg; nearby restaurants) that best match their preferences. We assume a set of points ofinterest described by a combination of static and dynamic attributes; and a set of mobileusers mi; each associated with a weighting vector wi; which expresses mi's preferences overthe aforementioned attribute set. The best points of interest for each mobile user correspondto the results of a top-k query; defined by the weighting vector wi; which is performed overthe combined set of static and dynamic attributes. The dynamic attribute is the currentdistance between the mobile user and the point of interest. Under these assumptions; thepotential customers of a given point of interest q are the mobile users whose weightingvectors wi belong to the reverse top-k set of q. In this paper; we define the distance-based …,Proceedings of the 10th ACM International Workshop on Data Engineering for Wireless and Mobile Access,2011,26
Learning to rank search results for time-sensitive queries,Nattiya Kanhabua; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Retrieval effectiveness of temporal queries can be improved by taking into accountthe time dimension. Existing temporal ranking models follow one of two main approaches: 1)a mixture model linearly combining textual similarity and temporal similarity; and 2) aprobabilistic model generating a query from the textual and temporal part of documentindependently. In this paper; we propose a novel time-aware ranking model based onlearning-to-rank techniques. We employ two classes of features for learning a rankingmodel; entity-based and temporal features; which are derived from annotation data. Entity-based features are aimed at capturing the semantic similarity between a query and adocument; whereas temporal features measure the temporal similarity. Through extensiveexperiments we show that our ranking model significantly improves the retrieval …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,25
Temporal expertise profiling,Jan Rybak; Krisztian Balog; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract We introduce the temporal expertise profiling task: identifying the skills andknowledge of an individual and tracking how they change over time. To be able to captureand distinguish meaningful changes; we propose the concept of a hierarchical expertiseprofile; where topical areas are organized in a taxonomy. Snapshots of hierarchical profilesare then taken at regular time intervals. Further; we develop methods for detecting andcharacterizing changes in a person's profile; such as; switching the main field of research ornarrowing/broadening the topics of research. Initial results demonstrate the potential of ourapproach.,European Conference on Information Retrieval,2014,22
Efficient distributed top-k query processing with caching,Norvald H Ryeng; Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Recently; there has been an increased interest in incorporating in databasemanagement systems rank-aware query operators; such as top-k queries; that allow users toretrieve only the most interesting data objects. In this paper; we propose a cache-basedapproach for efficiently supporting top-k queries in distributed database managementsystems. In large distributed systems; the query performance depends mainly on the networkcost; measured as the number of tuples transmitted over the network. Ideally; only the ktuples that belong to the query result set should be transmitted. Nevertheless; a servercannot decide based only on its local data which tuples belong to the result set. Therefore; inthis paper; we use caching of previous results to reduce the number of tuples that must befetched over the network. To this end; our approach always delivers as many tuples as …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2011,22
Skyline-based peer-to-peer top-k query processing,Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Norvag; Michalis Vazirgiannis,Due to applications and systems such as sensor networks; data streams; and peer-to-peer(P2P) networks; data generation and storage become increasingly distributed. Therefore achallenging problem is to support best-match query processing in highly distributedenvironments. In this paper; we present a novel framework for top-k query processing inlarge-scale P2P networks; where the dataset is horizontally distributed to peers. Ourproposed framework returns the exact results to the user; while minimizing the number ofqueried super-peers and transferred data. Through simulations we demonstrate thefeasibility of our approach in terms of overall response time.,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,22
Log-only temporal object storage,Kjetil Norvag; Kjell Bratbergsengen,As main memory capacity increases; more of the database read requests will be satisfiedfrom the buffer system. Consequently; the amount of disk write operations relative to diskread operations will increase. This calls for a focus on write optimized storage managers.We show how the Vagabond object storage manager uses no-overwrite sequential writing oflong blocks to achieve high write performance. Vagabond also supports versioned/temporalobjects; with the no-overwrite policy used; this does not imply any extra cost. Large objects;eg; video and matrices; are divided into large chunks. This makes it easy to achieve highread and write bandwidth. This is important; since in many application areas; high databandwidth is just as important as high transaction throughput. The buffer system inVagabond is object based; rather than page based. This gives better utilization of main …,Database and Expert Systems Applications; 1997.

Temporality in online food recipe consumption and production,Tomasz Kusmierczyk; Christoph Trattner; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract In this paper; we present work-in-progress of a recently started research effort thataims at understanding the hidden temporal dynamics in online food communities. In thiscontext; we have mined and analyzed temporal patterns in terms of recipe production andconsumption in a large German community platform. As our preliminary results reveal; thereare indeed a range of hidden temporal patterns in terms of food preferences and inparticular in consumption and production. We believe that this kind of research can beimportant for future work in personalized Web-based information access and in particularrecommender systems.,Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web,2015,21
Contextual recommendations for groups,Kostas Stefanidis; Nafiseh Shabib; Kjetil Nørvåg; John Krogstie,Abstract Recommendation systems have received significant attention; with most of theproposed methods focusing on recommendations for single users. Recently; there are alsoapproaches aiming at either group or context-aware recommendations. In this paper; weaddress the problem of contextual recommendations for groups. We exploit a hierarchicalcontext model to extend a typical recommendation model to a general context-aware onethat tackles the information needs of a group. We base the computation of contextual grouprecommendations on a subset of preferences of the users that present the most similarbehavior to the group; that is; the users with the most similar preferences to the preferencesof the group members; for a specific context. This subset of preferences includes the oneswith context equal to or more general than the given context.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2012,20
The SemSets model for ad-hoc semantic list search,Marek Ciglan; Kjetil Nørvåg; Ladislav Hluchý,Abstract The amount of semantic data on the web has been growing rapidly in recent years.One of the key challenges triggered by this growth is the ad-hoc querying; ie; the ability toretrieve answers from semantic resources using natural language queries. This facilitatesinteraction with semantic resources for the users so they can benefit from the knowledgecovered by semantic data without the complexities of semantic query languages. In thispaper; we focus on semantic queries; where the aim is to retrieve objects belonging to a setof semantically related entities. An example of such an ad-hoc type query is" Apolloastronauts who walked on the Moon". In order to address the task; we propose the SemSetsretrieval model that exploits and combines traditional document-based information retrieval;link structure of the semantic data and entity membership in semantic sets; in order to …,Proceedings of the 21st international conference on World Wide Web,2012,20
Peer-to-peer similarity search over widely distributed document collections,Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg; Michalis Vazirgiannis,Abstract This paper addresses the challenging problem of similarity search over widelydistributed ultra-high dimensional data. Such an application is retrieval of the top-k mostsimilar documents in a widely distributed document collection; as in the case of digitallibraries. Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems emerge as a promising solution to delve with contentmanagement in cases of highly distributed data collections. We propose a self-organizingP2P approach in which an unstructured P2P network evolves into a super-peer architecture;with super-peers responsible for peers with similar content. Our approach is based ondistributed clustering of peer contents; thus managing to create high quality clusters thatspan the entire network. More importantly; we show how to efficiently process similarityqueries capitalizing on the newly constructed; clustered super-peer network.

DyST: dynamic and scalable temporal text indexing,Kjetil Norvag; Albert Overskeid N Nybo,An increasing number of documents in companies and other organizations are now onlyavailable electronically; and exist in several versions updated at different times. In order toprovide efficient support for temporal text-containment queries (query for all versions ofdocuments that contained one or more particular words at a particular time) temporal text-indexes are needed. In this paper we present DyST; a dynamic and scalable temporal textindex. The goal of DyST is to provide the same efficiency in terms of search cost and spaceusage as the previous approaches developed for small and medium document databases;while at the same time providing only logarithmically increasing search cost for very largedatabases. We present the architecture of DyST and describe how inserts and searches areperformed. Based on a prototype we also present an evaluation of performance based on …,Temporal Representation and Reasoning; 2006. TIME 2006. Thirteenth International Symposium on,2006,19

The representation and visualization of bibliographic databases as graphsand the application of data mining techniques can help us uncover interesting knowledgeregarding how the publication records of authors evolve over time. In this paper we proposea novel methodology to model bibliographical databases as Power Graphs; and mine themin an unsupervised manner; in order to learn basic author types and their properties throughclustering. The methodology takes into account the evolution of the co-authorshipinformation; the volume of published papers over time; as well as the impact factors of thevenues hosting the respective publications. As a proof of concept of the applicability andscalability of our approach; we present experimental results in the DBLP data.,International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries,2011,18
News Item Extraction for Text Mining inWeb Newspapers,Randi Oyri,Web newspapers provide a valuable resource for information. In order to benefit more fromthe available information; text mining techniques can be applied. However; because eachnewspaper page often covers a lot of unrelated topics; page-based data mining will notalways give useful results. In order to improve on complete-page mining; we present anapproach based on extracting the individual news items from the web pages and miningthese separately. Automatic news item extraction is a difficult problem; and in this paper wealso provide strategies solving that task. We study the quality of the news item extraction;and also provide results from clustering the extracted news items.,Web Information Retrieval and Integration; 2005. WIRI'05. Proceedings.

Inorder to efficiently manage temporal document versions; a temporal document databasesystem should be employed. In this paper; we describe the V2 temporal document databasesystem; which supports storage; retrieval; and querying of temporal documents.

APSkyline: improved skyline computation for multicore architectures,Stian Liknes; Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract The trend towards in-memory analytics and CPUs with an increasing number ofcores calls for new algorithms that can efficiently utilize the available resources. This need isparticularly evident in the case of CPU-intensive query operators. One example of such aquery with applicability in data analytics is the skyline query. In this paper; we present APSkyline; a new approach for multicore skyline query processing; which adheres to the partition-execute-merge framework. Contrary to existing research; we focus on the partitioning phaseto achieve significant performance gains; an issue largely overlooked in previous work inmulticore processing. In particular; APS kyline employs an angle-based partitioningapproach; which increases the degree of pruning that can be achieved in the executephase; thus significantly reducing the number of candidate points that need to be checked …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2014,17
A comparison of time-aware ranking methods,Nattiya Kanhabua; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract When searching a temporal document collection; eg; news archives or blogs; thetime dimension must be explicitly incorporated into a retrieval model in order to improverelevance ranking. Previous work has followed one of two main approaches: 1) a mixturemodel linearly combining textual similarity and temporal similarity; or 2) a probabilistic modelgenerating a query from the textual and temporal part of a document independently. In thispaper; we compare the effectiveness of different time-aware ranking methods by using amixture model applied to all methods.

Space-efficient support for temporal text indexing in a document archive context,Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Support for temporal text-containment queries (query for all versions of documentsthat contained one or more particular words at a particular time t) is of interest in a number ofcontexts; including web archives; in a smaller scale temporal XML/web warehouses; andtemporal document database systems in general. In the V2 temporal document databasesystem we employed a combination of full-text indexes and variants of time indexes toperform efficient text-containment queries. That approach was optimized for moderatelylarge temporal document databases. However; for “extremely large databases” the indexspace usage of the approach could be too large. In this paper; we present a more space-efficient solution to the problem: the interval-based temporal text index (ITTX).

Bandwidth-constrained distributed skyline computation,Akrivi Vlachou; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Skyline queries have been studied in centralized systems; but also in distributedenvironments; such as web information systems and peer-to-peer networks. Most of theexisting work focuses on efficient processing of skyline queries that return the exact andcomplete result set. In this paper; we study skyline computation in a distributed environmentunder the assumption of a given upper bound on the bandwidth consumption. Supportingsuch a constraint is very important in a mobile environment; where data transmissions maylead to deterioration of query processing performance; while imposing high cost for themobile device in terms of energy consumption. Therefore; the cost of transferring all datapoints that may contribute to the skyline result set to the querying server is often prohibitive.Our target is; given an upper bound of bandwidth consumption; to maximize the quality of …,Proceedings of the Eighth ACM International Workshop on Data Engineering for Wireless and Mobile Access,2009,16
On saying enough already! in mapreduce,Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract The MapReduce framework for parallel processing of massive data sets hasattracted considerable attention recently; mainly due to its salient features that includescalability; simplicity; and fault-tolerance. However; despite its merits; MapReduce follows abrute-force approach; which often results in performing redundant work. This is particularlyevident in the case of rank-aware queries; such as top-k; where a bounded set of k tuplescomprise the result set. To process such queries in MapReduce; the input data needs to beaccessed in its entirety; in order to produce the correct result set. To address this limitation oflack of early termination; in this paper; we investigate on different techniques that allowefficient processing of rank-aware queries; without accessing the input data exhaustively.We present various individual approaches that can be combined and demonstrate their …,Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Cloud Intelligence,2012,15
When simple is (more than) good enough: Effective semantic search with (almost) no semantics,Robert Neumayer; Krisztian Balog; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Using keyword queries to find entities has emerged as one of the major searchtypes on the Web. In this paper; we study the task of ad-hoc entity retrieval: keyword searchin a collection of structured data. We start with a baseline retrieval system that constructspseudo documents from RDF triples and introduce three extensions: preprocessing of URIs;using two-fielded retrieval models; and boosting popular domains. Using the query sets ofthe 2010 and 2011 Semantic Search Challenge; we show that our straightforward approachoutperforms all previously reported results; some generated by far more complex systems.,European Conference on Information Retrieval,2012,15
Processing of rank joins in highly distributed systems,Christos Doulkeridis; Akrivi Vlachou; Kjetil Nørvåg; Yannis Kotidis; Neoklis Polyzotis,In this paper; we study efficient processing of rank joins in highly distributed systems; whereservers store fragments of relations in an autonomous manner. Existing rank-join algorithmsexhibit poor performance in this setting due to excessive communication costs or highlatency. We propose a novel distributed rank-join framework that employs data statistics;maintained as histograms; to determine the subset of each relational fragment that needs tobe fetched to generate the top-k join results. At the heart of our framework lies a distributedscore bound estimation algorithm that produces sufficient score bounds for each relation;that guarantee the correctness of the rank-join result set; when the histograms are accurate.Furthermore; we propose a generalization of our framework that supports approximatestatistics; in the case that the exact statistical information is not available.

Context-based caching and routing for P2P web service discovery,Christos Doulkeridis; Vassilis Zafeiris; Michalis Vazirgiannis; Emmanouel A Giakoumakis,Abstract In modern heterogeneous environments; such as mobile; pervasive and ad-hocnetworks; architectures based on web services offer an attractive solution for effectivecommunication and inter-operation. In such dynamic and rapidly evolving environments;efficient web service discovery is an important task. Usually this task is based on theinput/output parameters or other functional attributes; however this does not guarantee thevalidity or successful utilization of retrieved web services. Instead; non-functional attributes;such as device power features; computational resources and connectivity status; thatcharacterize the context of both service providers and consumers play an important role tothe quality and usability of discovery results. In this paper we introduce context-awareness inweb service discovery; enabling the provision of the most appropriate services at the right …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2007,15
The Persistent Cache: Improving OID indexing in temporal object-oriented database systems,Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract In a temporal OODB; an OID index (OIDX) is needed to map from OID to thephysical location of the object. In a transaction time temporal OODB; the OIDX should alsoindex the object versions. In this case; the index entries; which we call object descriptors(OD); also include the commit timestamp of the transaction that created the object version.The OIDX in a non-temporal OODB only needs to be updated when an object is created; butin a temporal OODB; the OIDX have to be updated every time an object is updated. We havein a previous study shown that this can be a potential bottleneck; and in this report; wepresent the Persistent Cache (PCache); a novel approach which reduces the index updateand lookup costs in temporal OODBs. In this report; we develop a cost model for thePCache; and use this to show that the use of a PCache can reduce the average access …,VLDB,1999,15
SemaFor: semantic document indexing using semantic forests,George Tsatsaronis; Iraklis Varlamis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Traditional document indexing techniques store documents using easily accessiblerepresentations; such as inverted indices; which can efficiently scale for large documentsets. These structures offer scalable and efficient solutions in text document managementtasks; though; they omit the cornerstone of the documents' purpose: meaning. They alsoneglect semantic relations that bind terms into coherent fragments of text that conveymessages. When semantic representations are employed; the documents are mapped to thespace of concepts and the similarity measures are adapted appropriately to better fit theretrieval tasks. However; these methods can be slow both at indexing and retrieval time. Inthis paper we propose SemaFor; an indexing algorithm for text documents; which usessemantic spanning forests constructed from lexical resources; like Wikipedia; and …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,14
Distributed semantic overlay networks,Christos Doulkeridis; Akrivi Vlachou; Kjetil Nørvåg; Michalis Vazirgiannis,Abstract Semantic Overlay Networks (SONs) have been recently proposed as a way toorganize content in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. The main objective is to discover peerswith similar content and then form thematically focused peer groups. Efficient contentretrieval can be performed by having queries selectively forwarded only to relevant groupsof peers to the query. As a result; less peers need to be contacted; in order to answer aquery. In this context; the challenge is to generate SONs in a decentralized and distributedmanner; as the centralized assembly of global information is not feasible. Differentapproaches for exploiting the generated SONs for content retrieval have been proposed inthe literature; which are examined in this chapter; with a particular focus on SONinterconnections for efficient search.

Multidimensional routing indices for efficient distributed query processing,Christos Doulkeridis; Akrivi Vlachou; Kjetil Nørvåg; Yannis Kotidis; Michalis Vazirgiannis,Abstract Traditional routing indices in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks are mainly designed fordocument retrieval applications and maintain aggregated one-dimensional valuesrepresenting the number of documents that can be obtained in a certain direction in thenetwork. In this paper; we introduce the concept of multidimensional routing indices (MRIs);which are suitable for handling multidimensional data represented by minimum boundingregions (MBRs). Depending on data distribution on peers; the aggregation of the MBRs maylead to MRIs that exhibit extremely poor performance; which renders them ineffective. Thus;focusing on a hybrid unstructured P2P network; we analyze the parameters for buildingMRIs of high selectivity. We present techniques that boost the query routing performance bydetecting similar peers and grouping and reassigning these peers to other parts of the …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,14

The approach does not require any type of training; since itexploits only WordNet to devise the implicit semantic links between text words. The paperpresents a prototype on-line demo of the measure; that can provide word-to-wordrelatedness values; even for words of different part of speech. In addition the demo allowsfor the computation of relatedness between text segments.,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2009,14

This is of interest in a number ofapplication; both temporal document databases as well as web archiving systems andtemporal XML warehouses. In this paper; we describe the architecture and theimplementation of V2; a temporal document database system that supports storage;retrieval; and querying of temporal documents.

The Vagabond temporal OID index: An index structure for OID indexing in temporal object database systems,Kjetil Norvag,In an object database system using logical OIDs; an OID index (OIDX) is necessary to mapfrom logical OID to the physical location of an object. In a temporal object database system(TODB); this OIDX also contains the timestamps of the object versions. OIDX maintenancecan be very costly; and can easy become the bottleneck of such a system. The main reasonfor this; is that in a TODB the OIDX needs to be updated every time an object is updated. Inorder to reduce the access costs; a new index structure; particularly suitable to TODBrequirements; is necessary. In this paper; we describe an OIDX for TODBs; the VagabondTemporal OID Index (VTOIDX). The main goals of the VTOIDX are: 1) support for temporaldata; while still having index performance close to a non-temporal (one-version) databasesystem; 2) efficient object-relational operation; and 3) flexible tertiary storage migration of …,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2000 International,2000,14
VAGABOND-The Design and Analysis of a Temporal Object Database Management System,Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Storage costs are rapidly decreasing; making it feasible to store larger amounts ofdata in databases. However; the increase in disk performance is much lower than theincrease in memory and CPU performance; and we have an increasing secondary storageaccess bottleneck. Even though this is not a new situation; the advent of very large mainmemory has made new storage approaches possible.,*,2000,14
Efficient use of signatures in object-oriented database systems,Kjetil Nørväg,Abstract Signatures are bit strings; generated by applying some hash function on some or allof the attributes of an object. The signatures of the objects can be stored separately from theobjects themselves; and can later be used to filter out candidate objects during a perfectmatch query. In an object-oriented database system (OODB) using logical object identifiers(OIDs); an object identifier index (OIDX) is needed to map from logical OID to the physicallocation of the object. In this paper we show how signatures can be stored in the OIDX; andused to reduce the average object access cost in a system. We also extend this approach totransaction time temporal OODBs (TOODB); where this approach is even more beneficial;because maintaining signatures comes virtually for free. We develop a cost model that weuse to analyze the performance of the proposed approaches; and this analysis shows that …,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,1999,14

The SOWES approach to P2P web search using semantic overlays,Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg; Michalis Vazirgiannis,Abstract Peer-to-peer (P2P) Web search has gained a lot of interest lately; due to the salientcharacteristics of P2P systems; namely scalability; fault-tolerance and load-balancing.However; the lack of global knowledge in a vast and dynamically evolving environment likethe Web presents a grand challenge for organizing content and providing efficientsearching. Semantic overlay networks (SONs) have been proposed as an approach toreduce cost and increase quality of results; and in this paper we present an unsupervisedapproach for distributed and decentralized SON construction; aiming to support efficientsearch mechanisms in unstructured P2P systems.,Proceedings of the 15th international conference on World Wide Web,2006,11
Temporal XML data warehouses: Challenges and solutions,K Norvag,Abstract Increasing amounts of data is stored in XML. In order to facilitate more efficientquerying on this data; and in particular on data from several sources (for example Websites); data can be loaded into an XML data warehouse. Often; we want to query historicaldocument versions; or query changes between document versions. This can be facilitated bya temporal XML data warehouse (XML-DW). In this paper; we study some of the challengeswe meet in an XMLDW; in particular those related to consistency; and propose how thesechallenges can be met. We also identify some problems that are difficult to solveautomatically in a temporal XML-DW. Many of the issues described in this paper are alsoapplicable in a broader context; for example for general Web warehouses storing on HTMLweb pages.,*,2002,11
Robust aggregation in peer-to-peer database systems,Norvald H Ryeng; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Peer-to-peer database systems (P2PDBs) aim at providing database services withnode autonomy; high availability and loose coupling between participating nodes bybuilding the DBMS on top of a peer-to-peer network. A key feature of current peer-to-peersystems is resilience to churn in the overlay network layer. A major challenge in P2PDBs isto provide similar robustness in the data and query processing layer. In this paper we inparticular describe how aggregation queries in P2PDBs can be handled in order to reducethe impact of churn on accuracy of results. We perform a formal study of data loss andaccuracy of such queries; and describe new approaches that increase the accuracy ofaggregation queries in P2PDBs under churn.,Proceedings of the 2008 international symposium on Database engineering & applications,2008,10
Peer-to-Peer Clustering for Semantic Overlay Network Generation.,Michalis Vazirgiannis; Kjetil Nørvåg; Christos Doulkeridis,Abstract. The peer-to-peer (P2P) paradigm presents an attractive solution for applicationsthat require scalability; fault-tolerance and autonomy. P2P systems in their basicunstructured form suffer high costs when it comes to efficiently locating content; mainly dueto the lack of global knowledge. It is therefore crucial to organize content in an unsupervisedway by creating groups of peers with similar content; in order to support efficient searchmechanisms. In this paper; we discuss the need for content organization in unstructured P2Pnetworks and present the requirements that must be fulfilled by any approach. We proposeP2P clustering as a potential solution to Semantic Overlay Network (SON) generation fororganizing P2P networks; and we present our unsupervised approach for decentralizedSON creation towards this end.,PRIS,2006,10
Optimizing OID indexing cost in temporal object-oriented database systems,Kjetil Nørvåg; Kjell Bratbergsengen,Abstract In object-oriented database systems (OODB) with logical OIDs; an OID index (OIDX)is needed to map from OID to the physical location of the object. In a transaction timetemporal OODB; the OIDX should also index the object versions. In this case; the indexentries; which we call object descriptors (OD); also include the commit timestamp of thetransaction that created the object version. In this report; we develop an analytical model forOIDX access costs in temporal OODBs. The model includes the index page buffer as well asan OD cache. We use this model to study access cost and optimal use of memory for indexpage buffer and OD cache; with different access patterns. The results show that 1) the OIDXaccess cost can be high; and can easy become a bottleneck in large temporal OODBs; 2)the optimal OD cache size can be relatively large; and 3) the gain from using an optimal …,In Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Foundations of Data Organization; FODO'98,1998,10
A hybrid approach for estimating document frequencies in unstructured P2P networks,Robert Neumayer; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Scalable search and retrieval over numerous web document collections distributedacross different sites can be achieved by adopting a peer-to-peer (P2P) communicationmodel. Terms and their document frequencies are the main components of text informationretrieval and as such need to be computed; aggregated; and distributed throughout thesystem. This is a challenging problem in the context of unstructured P2P networks; since thelocal document collections may not reflect the global collection in an accurate way. Thismight happen due to skews in the distribution of documents to peers. Moreover; centralassembly of the total information is not a scalable solution due to the excessive cost ofstorage and maintenance; and because of issues related to digital rights management. Inthis paper; we present an efficient hybrid approach for aggregation of document …,Information Systems,2011,9
The vagabond approach to logging and recovery in transaction-time temporal object database systems,Kjetil Norvag,In most current database systems; data is updated in-place. In order to support recovery andincrease performance; write-ahead logging is used. This logging defers the in-placeupdates. However; sooner or later; the updates have to be applied to the database. Even ifthis is done as a batch operation; it can result in many nonsequential writes. In order to avoidthis; another approach is to eliminate the database completely and use a log-only approach.In this case; the log is written contiguously to the disk; in a no-overwrite way using largeblocks. When using the log-only approach keeping previous versions comes almost for free;and this approach is therefore particularly interesting for transaction-time temporal objectdatabase systems. Although the log-only approach in its basic form is relativelystraightforward; it is not trivial to support features such as steal/no-force buffer …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2004,9
Issues in transaction-time temporal object database systems,Kjetil Norvag,Abstract Object database systems (ODBs) are an attractive alternative to relational databasesystems; especially in application areas where the modeling power or performance ofrelational database systems is insufficient. These applications typically maintain largeamounts of data. Frequently; some of the data is temporal data. For the temporal data; thewhole history of the individual objects is kept; and data is never deleted. The area oftemporal ODBs is still immature; and there are many design issues that need to be solved inorder to be able to achieve the desired performance. In this paper; some temporal ODBresearch issues and possible solutions related to object storage; object management; mainmemory buffering; and language bindings are discussed.,Journal of Database Management,2001,9
Understanding and predicting online food recipe production patterns,Tomasz Kusmierczyk; Christoph Trattner; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Studying online food patterns has recently become an active field of research.While there are a growing body of studies that investigate how online food in consumed;little effort has been devoted yet to understand how online food recipes are being created.To contribute to this lack of knowledge in the area; we present in this paper the results of alarge-scale study that aims at understanding how historical; social and temporal factorsimpact on the online food creation process. Several experiments reveal the extent to whichvarious factors are useful in predicting future recipe production.,Proceedings of the 27th acm conference on hypertext and social media,2016,8
QUEST: query expansion using synonyms over time,Nattiya Kanhabua; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract A particular problem of searching news archives with named entities is that they arevery dynamic in appearance compared to other vocabulary terms; and synonymrelationships between terms change with time. In previous work; we proposed an approachto extracting time-based synonyms of named entities from the whole history of Wikipedia. Inthis paper; we present QUEST (Qu ery E xpansion using S ynonyms over T ime); a systemthat exploits time-based synonyms in searching news archives. The system takes as input anamed entity query; and automatically determines time-based synonyms for a given querywrt. time criteria. Query expansion using the determined synonyms can be employed inorder to improve the retrieval effectiveness.,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2010,8
An analytical study of object identifier indexing,Kjetil Nørvåg; Kjell Bratbergsengen,Abstract To avoid OID index retrieval becoming a bottleneck; efficient buffering strategies areneeded to minimize the number of disk accesses. In this paper; we develop analytical costmodels which we use to find optimal sizes of the index page buffer and the index entrycache; for different memory sizes; index sizes; and access patterns. Because existing bufferhit estimation models are not applicable for index page buffering in the case of tree basedindexes; we have also developed an analytical model for index page buffer performance.The cost gain from using the results in this paper is typically in the order of 200–300%. Thus;the results should be of valuable use in optimizers and tools for configuration and tuning ofobject-oriented database systems.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,1998,8
A burstiness-aware approach for document dating,Dimitrios Kotsakos; Theodoros Lappas; Dimitrios Kotzias; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Nattiya Kanhabua; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract A large number of mainstream applications; like temporal search; event detection;and trend identification; assume knowledge of the timestamp of every document in a giventextual collection. In many cases; however; the required timestamps are either unavailableor ambiguous. A charac-teristic instance of this problem emerges in the context of largerepositories of old digitized documents. For such doc-uments; the timestamp may becorrupted during the digiti-zation process; or may simply be unavailable. In this paper; westudy the task of approximating the timestamp of a doc-ument; so-called document dating.We propose a content-based method and use recent advances in the domain of termburstiness; which allow it to overcome the drawbacks of pre-vious document datingmethods; eg the fix time partition strategy.

Site-autonomous distributed semantic caching,Norvald H Ryeng; Jon Olav Hauglid; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Semantic caching augments cached data with a semantic description of the data.These semantic descriptions can be used to improve execution time for similar queries byretrieving some data from cache and issuing a remainder query for the rest. This is animprovement over traditional page caching; since caches are no longer limited to only basetables but are extended to contain intermediate results. In large-scale distributed databasesystems; using a central server with complete knowledge of the system will be a seriousbottleneck and single point of failure. In this paper; we propose a distributed semanticcaching method where sites make autonomous caching decisions based on locallyavailable information; thereby reducing the need for centralized control. We implement themethod in the DASCOSA-DB distributed database system prototype and use this …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2011,7
Efficient and robust database support for data-intensive applications in dynamic environments,Jon Olav Hauglid; Kjetil Nørvåg; Norvald H Ryeng,Abstract Requirements from new types of applications call for new database systemsolutions. Computational science applications performing distributed computations on Gridnetworks with requirements for efficient storage and query solutions are now emerging. Forthis purpose we have developed DASCOSA-DB; a P2P-based distributed database system;which in addition to providing location-transparent storage and querying; also includesnovel features like efficient partial restartof queries and redistribution of query operators inthe context of failure; dynamic refragmentation and allocation; and distributed semanticcaching. In this demo; the novel features will be demonstrated; combined with a moregeneral description of the architecture and demonstration of the distributed query processingcapabilities.,Proceedings of the 2009 IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering,2009,7
Granularity reduction in temporal document databases,Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract With rapidly decreasing storage costs; temporal document databases are now aviable solution in many contexts. However; storing an ever-growing database can still be toocostly; and as a consequence it is desirable to be able to physically delete old versions ofdata. Traditionally; this has been performed by an operation called vacuuming; where theoldest versions are physically deleted or migrated from secondary storage to less costlytertiary storage. In temporal document databases on the other hand; it is often moreappropriate to remove intermediate versions instead of removing the oldest versions. Wecall this operation granularity reduction. In this paper we describe the concept of granularityreduction; and present six strategies for selecting the document versions to eliminate. Threeof the strategies have been implemented in the V2 temporal document database system …,Information Systems,2006,7
Improving space-efficiency in temporal text-indexing,Kjetil Nørvåg; Albert Overskeid Nybø,Abstract Support for temporal text-containment queries is of interest in a number of contexts.In previous papers we have presented two approaches to temporal text-indexing; the V2Xand ITTX indexes. In this paper; we first present improvements to the previous techniques.We then perform a study of the space usage of the indexing approaches based on bothanalytical models and results from indexing temporal text collections. These results show forwhat kind of document collections the different techniques should be employed. The resultsalso show that regarding space usage; the new ITTX/VIDPI technique proposed in this paperis in most cases superior to V2X; except in the case of patterns of high number of newdocuments relative to number of updated documents.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2005,7
Write optimized object-oriented database systems,K Norvag; Kjell Bratbergsengen,In a database system; read operations are much more common than write operations; andconsequently; database systems have been read optimized. As the size of main memoryincreases; more of the database read requests will be satisfied front the buffer system; andthe amount of disk write operations relative to disk read operations will increase. This callsfor a focus on write optimized database systems. In this paper; we present solutions to thisproblem. We describe in detail the data structures and algorithms needed to realize a writeoptimized object-oriented database system in the context of Vagabond; an OODB currentlybeing implemented at our department. In Vagabond; focus has been to provide support forapplications which have earlier used file systems because of the limited data bandwidth incurrent database systems; typical examples are supercomputing applications and …,Computer Science Society; 1997.

We visualize a person's expertise profile on a timeline; where we detect andcharacterize changes in the focus or topics of expertise. It is possible to zoom in on a giventime period in order to examine the underlying data that is used as supporting evidence. It isalso possible to perform visual and quantitative comparison of two arbitrarily selected timeperiods in a highly interactive environment. We invite profile owners to evaluate and fine-tune their profiles; and to leave feedback.,Proceedings of the 37th international ACM SIGIR conference on research & development in information retrieval,2014,6
Discovering influential data objects over time,Orestis Gkorgkas; Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract In applications such as market analysis; it is of great interest to productmanufacturers to have their products ranked as highly as possible for a significant number ofcustomers. However; customer preferences change over time; and product manufacturersare interested in monitoring the evolution of the popularity of their products; in order todiscover those products that are consistently highly ranked. To take into account thetemporal dimension; we define the continuous influential query and present algorithms forefficient processing and retrieval of continuous influential data objects. Furthermore; ouralgorithms support incremental retrieval of the next continuous influential data object in anatural way. To evaluate the performance of our algorithms; we conduct a detailedexperimental study for various setups.,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2013,6
Collection ranking and selection for federated entity search,Krisztian Balog; Robert Neumayer; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Entity search has emerged as an important research topic over the past years; butso far has only been addressed in a centralized setting. In this paper we present an attemptto solve the task of ad-hoc entity retrieval in a cooperative distributed environment. Wepropose a new collection ranking and selection method for entity search; called AENN. Thekey underlying idea is that a lean; name-based representation of entities can efficiently bestored at the central broker; which; therefore; does not have to rely on sampling. Thisrepresentation can then be utilized for collection ranking and selection in a way that thenumber of collections selected and the number of results requested from each collection isdynamically adjusted on a per-query basis. Using a collection of structured datasets in RDFand a sample of real web search queries targeting entities; we demonstrate that our …,International Symposium on String Processing and Information Retrieval,2012,6
Learning to select a time-aware retrieval model,Nattiya Kanhabua; Klaus Berberich; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Time-aware retrieval models exploit one of two time dimensions; namely;(a)publication time or (b) content time (temporal expressions mentioned in documents). Weshow that the effectiveness for a temporal query (eg; illinois earthquake 1968) dependssignificantly on which time dimension is factored into ranking results. Motivated by this; wepropose a machine learning approach to select the most suitable time-aware retrieval modelfor a given temporal query. Our method uses three classes of features obtained fromanalyzing distributions over two time dimensions; a distribution over terms; and retrievalscores within top-k result documents. Experiments on real-world data with crowdsourcedrelevance assessments show the potential of our approach.,Proceedings of the 35th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2012,6
Peer-to-peer query processing over multidimensional data,Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg; Yannis Kotidis,Applications that require a high degree of distribution and loosely-coupled connectivity areubiquitous in various domains; including scientific databases; bioinformatics; andmultimedia retrieval. In all these applications; data is typically voluminous andmultidimensional; and support for advanced query operators is required for effectivequerying and efficient processing. To address this challenge; we adopt a hybrid P2Parchitecture and propose novel indexing and query processing algorithms. We present ascalable framework that relies on data summaries that are distributed and maintained asmultidimensional routing indices. Different types of data summaries enable efficientprocessing of a variety of advanced query operators.,*,2012,6
Efficient community detection using power graph analysis,George Tsatsaronis; Matthias Reimann; Iraklis Varlamis; Orestis Gkorgkas; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Understanding the structure of complex networks and uncovering the properties oftheir constituents has been for many decades at the center of study of several fundamentalsciences; such as discrete mathematics and graph theory. Especially during the previousdecade; we have witnessed an explosion in complex network data; with two cornerstoneparadigms being the biological networks and the social networks. The large scale; but alsothe complexity; of these types of networks constitutes the need for efficient graph miningalgorithms. In both examples; one of the most important tasks is to identify closely connectednetwork components comprising nodes that share similar properties. In the case ofbiological networks; this could mean the identification of proteins that bind together to carrytheir biological function; while in the social networks; this can be seen as the identification …,Proceedings of the 9th workshop on Large-scale and distributed informational retrieval,2011,6
Fast detection of size-constrained communities in large networks,Marek Ciglan; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract The community detection in networks is a prominent task in the graph data mining;because of the rapid emergence of the graph data; eg; information networks or socialnetworks. In this paper; we propose a new algorithm for detecting communities in networks.Our approach differs from others in the ability of constraining the size of communities beinggenerated; a property important for a class of applications. In addition; the algorithm isgreedy in nature and belongs to a small family of community detection algorithms with thepseudo-linear time complexity; making it applicable also to large networks. The algorithm isable to detect small-sized clusters independently of the network size. It can be viewed ascomplementary approach to methods optimizing modularity; which tend to increase the sizeof generated communities with the increase of the network size.

PROQID: Partial restarts of queries in distributed databases,Jon Olav Hauglid; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract In a number of application areas; distributed database systems can be used toprovide persistent storage of data while providing efficient access for both local and remotedata. With an increasing number of sites (computers) involved in a query; the probability offailure at query time increases. Recovery has previously only focused on database updateswhile query failures have been handled by complete restart of the query. This technique isnot always applicable in the context of large queries and queries with deadlines. In thispaper we present an approach for partial restart of queries that incurs minimal extra networktraffic during query recovery. Based on results from experiments on an implementation of thepartial restart technique in a distributed database system; we demonstrate its applicabilityand significant reduction of query cost in the presence of failures.,Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2008,6
A performance evaluation of log-only temporal object database systems,Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract An alternative to in-place updating of data is to eliminate the database completely;and use a log-only approach. The log is written contiguously to the disk; in a no-overwriteway; in large blocks. The log-only approach is particularly interesting for transaction timeobject database systems (TODB); because keeping previous versions of objects is a featurethat comes for free. One of the objections against log-only databases has been that the readcost will be prohibitively high because of loss of clustering. However; in our comparison ofthe performance of log-only and in-place update TODBs; the analysis shows that with theworkload we expect to be typical for future TODBs; the logonly approach is highlycompetitive with the traditional inplace update approach.,ssdbm,2000,6
The Vagabond parallel temporal object-oriented database system: Versatile support for future applications,Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract. In this paper; we discuss features future database systems should support; todeliver the required functionality and performance to future applications. The most importantfeatures are efficient support for: 1) large objects; 2) isochronous delivery of data; 3) querieson large data sets; 4) write optimization; 5) full text indexing; 6) multidimensional data; 7)sparse data; and 8) temporal data support/version management. To be able to support thesefeatures efficiently; in one integrated system; new database architectures are needed. Wedescribe an architecture suitable for this purpose; the Vagabond Parallel Temporal Object-Oriented Database systems.

Improved and optimized partitioning techniques in database query processing,Kjell Bratbergsengen; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract In this paper we present two improvements to the partitioning process: 1) A newdynamic buffer management strategy is employed to increase the average block size of I/O-transfers to temporary files; and 2) An optimal switching between three different variants ofthe partitioning methods that ensures minimal partitioning cost. The expected performancegain resulting from the new management strategy is about 30% for a reasonable resourceconfiguration. The performance gain decreases with increasing available buffer space. Thedifferent partitioning strategies (partial partitioning or hybrid hashing; one pass partitioning;and multipass partitioning) are analyzed; and we present the optimal working range forthese; as a function of operand volume and available memory.,British National Conference on Databases,1997,6
On the use of semantic knowledge bases for temporally-aware entity retrieval,Krisztian Balog; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract In this paper; we propose the development of entity retrieval models that aretemporally-aware. Using a classification scheme of entity-oriented information needsproposed in prior work; we discuss how the addition of temporal expressions would affectretrieval results for each of these query types. We describe the design of a retrievalframework that is capable of catering for a range of these information needs and identifymain challenges at the component level.,Proceedings of the fifth workshop on Exploiting semantic annotations in information retrieval,2012,5
Evaluation of feature combination approaches for text categorisation,Robert Neumayer; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Text categorisation relies heavily on feature selection. Both the possible reductionin dimensionality as well as improvements in classification performance are highlydesirable. To the end of feature selection for text; a range of different methods have beendeveloped; each having unique properties and selecting different features. However; itremains unclear which of them can be combined and what benefits this brings with it. In thispaper we present correlation methods for the analysis of feature rankings and evaluate thecombination of features according to these metrics. We further show results of an extensivestudy of feature selection approaches using a wide range of combination methods. Weperformed experiments on 19 test collections and report our findings.,International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems,2011,5

In particular; we introduce the Omiotis measure; which capturesthe semantic relatedness between text segments and enables the thematic organization ofthe bibliographic data stored in online databases. Experimental evaluation demonstratesthat Omiotis can significantly improve the performance of several data mining tasks; such aspublications' classification and clustering; compared to existing approaches; even whenconsidering a limited amount of information; ie; the paper titles.,Proceedings of the eleventh international workshop on Web information and data management,2009,5

Ourmain contribution is a method that translates a check-in activity into an information need;which is in turn addressed with an appropriate information card. This task is challengingbecause of the large number of possible activities and related information needs; whichneed to be addressed in a mobile dashboard that is limited in size.

FOODWEB-studying food consumption and production patterns on the web,Christoph Trattner; Tomasz Kusmierczyk; Kjetil Nørvåg,Food is a central part of our daily lives and is one of the most important factors that shapeour health and wellbeing. Although research on individual food preferences has existed as awell-established field of study for several decades; there has been very little attentiondevoted to understanding recipe consumption and production patterns on the World WideWeb. To contribute to knowledge in this area; we recently initiated “FOODWEB”; a researchproject that studies traces of users online with the goal of better understanding how weconsume and produce food. Contrary to classic nutrition research; our methodology in theFOODWEB project is rather pragmatic. Rather than relying on time consuming andexpensive user surveys; which are commonly used in nutrition research; we intend to minetraces of users online (eg from online food forums).

Maximizing influence of spatio-textual objects based on keyword selection,Orestis Gkorgkas; Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract In modern applications; spatial objects are often annotated with textual descriptions;and users are offered the opportunity to formulate spatio-textual queries. The result set ofsuch a query consists of spatio-textual objects ranked according to their distance from adesired location and to their textual relevance to the query. In this context; a challengingproblem is how to select a set of at most b keywords to enhance the description of thefacilities of a spatial object; in order to make the object appear in the top-k results of as manyusers as possible. In this paper; we formulate this problem; called Best-terms and we showthat it is NP-hard. Hence; we present a baseline algorithm that provides an approximatesolution to the problem. Then; we introduce a novel algorithm for keyword selection thatgreatly improves the efficiency of query processing.

A framework for grouping and summarizing keyword search results,Orestis Gkorgkas; Kostas Stefanidis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract With the rapid growth of the Web; keyword-based searches become extremelyambiguous. To guide users to identify the results of their interest; in this paper; we consideran alternative way for presenting the results of a keyword search. In particular; we propose aframework for organizing the results into groups that contain results with similar content andrefer to similar temporal characteristics. Moreover; we provide summaries of results as hintsfor query refinement. A summary of a result set is expressed as a set of popular keywords inthe result set. Finally; we report evaluation results of the effectiveness of our approach.,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2013,4
Time-based query performance predictors,Nattiya Kanhabua; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Query performance prediction is aimed at predicting the retrieval effectiveness thata query will achieve with respect to a particular ranking model. In this paper; we study queryperformance prediction for a ranking model that explicitly incorporates the time dimensioninto ranking. Different time-based predictors are proposed as analogous to existing keyword-based predictors. In order to improve predicting performance; we combine differentpredictors using linear regression and neural networks. Extensive experiments areconducted using queries and relevance judgments obtained by crowdsourcing.,Proceedings of the 34th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in Information Retrieval,2011,4
Aggregation of document frequencies in unstructured P2P networks,Robert Neumayer; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems have been recently proposed for providing search andinformation retrieval facilities over distributed data sources; including web data. Terms andtheir document frequencies are the main building blocks of retrieval and as such need to becomputed; aggregated; and distributed throughout the system. This is a tedious task; as thelocal view of each peer may not reflect the global document collection; due to skeweddocument distributions. Moreover; central assembly of the total information is not feasible;due to the prohibitive cost of storage and maintenance; and also because of issues relatedto digital rights management. In this paper; we propose an efficient approach for aggregatingthe document frequencies of carefully selected terms based on a hierarchical overlaynetwork. To this end; we examine unsupervised feature selection techniques at the …,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2009,4

Taxonomy Caching: A Scalable Low-Cost Mechanism for Indexing Remote,Kjetil Nørvåg; Christos Doulkeridis; Michalis Vazirgiannis,Abstract High storage capacity and support for wireless internet is now available in anincreasingly higher number of mobile devices. These devices can be connected in a P2Pnetwork; thus enabling sharing of resources (which can be both files and services) with otherusers participating in the network. An important challenge is to enable capabilities for findingrelevant resources stored at other devices. In this paper; we present an approach to improveP2P search that is particularly suitable for connections with limited bandwidth; as in the caseof portable devices.

Semantic overlays for P2P web searching,Kjetil Nørvåg; Christos Doulkeridis; Michalis Vazirgiannis,ABSTRACT Peer-to-peer (P2P) web search has gained a lot of interest lately; due to thesalient characteristics of P2P systems; namely scalability; fault-tolerance and load-balancing. However; the lack of global knowledge in a vast and dynamically evolvingenvironment like the Web presents a grand challenge for organizing content and providingefficient searching mechanisms. Semantic overlay networks (SONs) have been proposed asan approach to reduce cost and increase quality of results in unstructured P2P systems; andin this paper we present SOWES; an approach for distributed SON construction inunstructured P2P networks. Efficient searching strategies for web content based on thecreated semantic overlays are presented and the performance of our approach is evaluatedthrough simulation experiments.,Technical Report; AUEB,2005,4
Creating synthetic temporal document collections,Kjetil Nørvåg; Albert Overskeid Nybø,Abstract In research in temporal document databases; large temporal document collectionsare necessary in order to be able to compare and evaluate new strategies and algorithms.Large temporal document collections are not easily available; and an alternative is to createsynthetic document collections. In this paper we will describe how to generate synthetictemporal document collections; how this is realized in the TDocGen temporal documentgenerator; and we will also present a study of the quality of the document collections createdby TDocGen.,*,2004,4
Algorithms for granularity reduction in temporal document databases,Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract With rapidly decreasing storage costs temporal document databases is now aviable solution in many contexts. However; storing an ever growing database can still be toocostly; and as a consequence it is desirable to be able to physically delete old versions.Traditionally; this has been performed by an operation called vacuuming; where the oldestversions are physically deleted (or migrated from secondary storage to cheaper tertiarystorage). However; in temporal document databases it is more appropriate to removeintermediate versions instead of removing the oldest versions. We call this operationgranularity reduction. In this paper we describe six approaches to granularity reduction; anddiscuss advantages and disadvantages of these approaches. Three of the approaches havebeen implemented into the V2 temporal document database system; and in this context …,*,2003,4
Supporting temporal text-containment queries,Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract In temporal document databases and temporal XML databases; temporal text-containment queries are a potential performance bottleneck. In this paper we describe howto manage documents and index structures in such databases in way that makes temporaltext-containment querying feasible. We describe and discuss different index structures thatcan improve such queries. Three of the alternatives have been implemented into the V2temporal document database system; and the performance of the index structures is studiedusing temporal web data. The results show that even a very simple time-indexing approachcan reduce query cost by up to three orders of magnitude.,*,2002,4
A comparative study of log-only and in-place update based temporal object database systems,Kjetil Nørvåg,ABSTRACT In most current database systems; data is updated in-place. In order to supportrecovery and increase performance; writeahead logging is used. This logging defers the in-place updates; ho w ever sooner or later; the updates have to be applied to the database.This often results in non-sequential writing of lots of pages; creating a write bottlenec k. Toavoid this; another approach is to eliminate the database completely; and use a log-onlyapproach. The log is written contiguously to the disk; in a no-overwrite way; in large blocks.The log-only approach is particularly interesting for transaction-time object databasesystems (TODBs). While previous approaches to TODBs have been page based; ie; whenan object has been modified; the whole page the object resides on has to be written back;our approach is object based.

Design issues in transaction-time temporal object database systems,Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract In a transaction-time temporal object database system (ODB) an object updatecreates a new object version; but the old versions are still accessible. Each object versionhas an associated timestamp; and this versioning; related to time; is supported andmaintained by the system. The system also provides support for querying the temporal data.The area of temporal ODBs is still immature; and there are many design issues that need tobe solved. In this paper; we discuss some issues and possible solutions derived from thedesign of the Vagabond temporal ODB. This includes physical object storage; clustering oftemporal objects; OID indexing; and language bindings in a temporal ODB.,*,2000,4
Finding the Most Diverse Products using Preference Queries.,Orestis Gkorgkas; Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg,ABSTRACT In this paper; given a product database and a set of customer preferences; weaddress the problem of discovering a bounded set of r diverse products that attract theinterests of different customers. This problem finds numerous applications in electronicmarketplaces; eg; for selecting the products that are placed in the home page of an onlineshop. Existing approaches to tackle this problem fall short because they ignore customerpreferences; and instead rely solely on products' attributes. We model this problem as adiversity problem; where each product is represented by its reverse top-k result set; andseek r products that maximize their diversity value. Since the problem is NP-hard; we employa greedy algorithm that takes as input the reverse top-k result sets of all candidate products.To further improve performance; we also design a more efficient approximate algorithm …,EDBT,2015,3
Ranking distributed knowledge repositories,Robert Neumayer; Krisztian Balog; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Increasingly many knowledge bases are published as Linked Data; driving theneed for effective and efficient techniques for information access. Knowledge repositoriesare naturally organised around objects or entities and constitute a promising data source forentity-oriented search. There is a growing body of research on the subject; however; it isalmost always (implicitly) assumed that a centralised index of all data is available. In thispaper; we address the task of ranking distributed knowledge repositories—a vitalcomponent of federated search systems—and present two probabilistic methods based ongenerative language modeling techniques. We present a benchmarking testbed based onthe test suites of the Semantic Search Challenge series to evaluate our approaches. In ourexperiments; we show that both our ranking approaches provide competitive performance …,International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries,2012,3
TRUMIT: A tool to support large-scale mining of text association rules,Robert Neumayer; George Tsatsaronis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Due to the nature of textual data the application of association rule mining in textcorpora has attracted the focus of the research scientific community for years. In this paperwe demonstrate a system that can efficiently mine association rules from text. The systemannotates terms using several annotators; and extracts text association rules between termsor categories of terms. An additional contribution of this work is the inclusion of novelunsupervised evaluation measures for weighting and ranking the importance of the textrules. We demonstrate the functionalities of our system with two text collections; a set ofWikileaks documents; and one from TREC-7.,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2011,3
Learning to find interesting connections in wikipedia,Marek Ciglan; Étienne Rivière; Kjetil Nørvåg,To help users answer the question; what is the relation between (real world) entities orconcepts; we might need to go well beyond the borders of traditional information retrievalsystems. In this paper; we explore the possibility of exploiting the Wikipedia link graph as aknowledge base for finding interesting connections between two or more given concepts;described by Wikipedia articles. We use a modified Spreading Activation algorithm toidentify connections between input concepts. The main challenge in our approach lies inassessing the strength of a relation defined by a link between articles. We propose twoapproaches for link weighting and evaluate their results with a user evaluation. Our resultsshow a strong correlation between used weighting methods and user preferences; resultsindicate that the Wikipedia link graph can be used as valuable semantic resource.,Web Conference (APWEB); 2010 12th International Asia-Pacific,2010,3
DASCOSA: database support for computational science applications,Kjetil Norvag,Computational science is a rapidly growing multidisciplinary field that uses advancedcomputing capabilities to understand and solve complex problems. So far; grid computinghas gained some maturity with respect to the actual computation. However; the managementof data in grid networks is still a very immature area.

Fine-granularity signature caching in object database systems,Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract In this paper; we present the SigCache approach. In contrast to traditional signaturefiles where signatures are stored in separate files; signatures are in our approach storedtogether with their objects. In addition; the most frequently accessed signatures are stored ina main memory signature cache (SigCache). When using the signatures stored in theSigCache as a filter during perfect match queries; the number of objects that actually have tobe retrieved during perfect match queries can be reduced. The increase in update cost isinsignificant; because the signatures are much smaller than the objects.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2001,3
Online Food Recipe Title Semantics: Combining Nutrient Facts and Topics,Tomasz Kusmierczyk; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Dietary pattern analysis is an important research area; and recently the availabilityof rich resources in food-focused social networks has enabled new opportunities in that field.However; there is a little understanding of how online textual content is related to actualhealth factors; eg; nutritional values. To contribute to this lack of knowledge; we present anovel approach to mine and model online food content by combining text topics with relatednutrient facts. Our empirical analysis reveals a strong correlation between them and ourexperiments show the extent to which it is possible to predict nutrient facts from meal name.,Proceedings of the 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2016,2
Efficient processing of exploratory top-k joins,Orestis Gkorgkas; Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract In this paper; we address the problem of discovering a ranked set of k distinct mainobjects combined with additional (accessory) objects that best fit the given preferences. Thisproblem is challenging because it considers object combinations of variable size; whereobjects are combined only if the combination produces a higher score; and thus becomesmore preferable to a user. In this way; users can explore overviews of combinations that aremore suited to their preferences than single objects; without the need to explicitly specifywhich objects should be combined. We model this problem as a rank-join problem whereeach combination is represented by a set of tuples from different relations and we call therespective query eXploratory Top-k Join query. Existing approaches fall short to tackle thisproblem because they impose a fixed size of combinations; they do not distinguish on …,Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2014,2
Temporal classifiers for predicting the expansion of medical subject headings,George Tsatsaronis; Iraklis Varlamis; Nattiya Kanhabua; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Ontologies such as the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and the Gene Ontology(GO) play a major role in biology and medicine since they facilitate data integration and theconsistent exchange of information between different entities. They can also be used toindex and annotate data and literature; thus enabling efficient search and analysis.Unfortunately; maintaining the ontologies manually is a complex; error-prone; and time andpersonnel-consuming effort. One major problem is the continuous growth of the biomedicalliterature; which expands by almost 1 million new scientific papers per year; indexed byMedline. The enormous annual increase of scientific publications constitutes the task ofmonitoring and following the changes and trends in the biomedical domain extremelydifficult. For this purpose; approaches that try to learn and maintain ontologies …,International Conference on Intelligent Text Processing and Computational Linguistics,2013,2

On the selectivity of multidimensional routing indices,Christos Doulkeridis; Akrivi Vlachou; Kjetil Nørvåg; Yannis Kotidis; Michalis Vazirgiannis,Abstract Recently; the problem of efficiently supporting advanced query operators; such asnearest neighbor or range queries; over multidimensional data in widely distributedenvironments has attracted much attention. In unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) networks;peers store data in an autonomous manner; thus multidimensional routing indices (MRI) arerequired; in order to route user queries efficiently to only those peers that may contribute tothe query result set. Focusing on a hybrid unstructured P2P network; in this paper; weanalyze the parameters for building MRI of high selectivity. In the case where similar dataare located at different parts of the network; MRI exhibit extremely poor performance; whichrenders them ineffective. We present algorithms that boost the query routing performance bydetecting similar peers and reassigning these peers to other parts of the hybrid network in …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,2

Query Operators in Temporal XML Databases,Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract The amount of data available in XML is rapidly increasing and at the same time theprice of mass storage is rapidly decreasing; and this makes it possible to store largeramounts of data. The contents of a database or data warehouse are seldom static. Newdocuments are created; documents are deleted and; more important; documents areupdated. In many cases; one wants to be able to search in historical (old) versions; retrievedocuments that were valid at a certain time; query changes to documents; and so forth.(Notethat although this process is somewhat similar to general document versioningmaintenance; the aspect of time makes possibilities and appropriate solutions different.) The“easiest” way to do this is to store all versions of all documents in the database and use amiddleware layer to convert temporal query language statements into conventional …,*,2005,2
The V2 Temporal Document Database System.,Kjetil Nørvåg,1. INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION One of the advantages of XML is that the document itselfcon- tains information that is normally associated with a schema. This makes it possible to domore precise queries; compared to what has been previously possible with unstructureddata. It also has advan- tages for long-term storage of data: even though the schema haschanged; the data itself can contain sufficient information about the contents; so that meaningfulqueries can be applied to the data. This is of increasing importance as storage costs are rapidlydecreasing and it feasible to store larger amounts of data in databases; includ- ing previous versionsof data. If documents as well as DTDs/schemas are stored in a suitable temporal databasesystem; it is also possible to make queries based on the actual DTD/schema that was valid atthe time a particular document was stored. In order to efficiently manage the temporal …,WWW (Posters),2003,2
A study of object declustering strategies in parallel temporal object database systems,Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract In a transaction-time temporal object database management system (TODBMS);updating an object creates a new version of the object; but the old version is still accessible.A TODBMS will store large amounts of data; and in order to provide the necessarycomputing power and data bandwidth; a parallel system based on a shared-nothingarchitecture is necessary. In order to benefit from a parallel architecture; a suitabledeclustering of the objects over the nodes in the system is important. In this paper; we studythree low-cost declustering algorithms:(1) declustering based on the hash value of the OIDof the objects;(2) range partitioning based on the timestamp of the objects; and (3) a newhybrid algorithm; where current object versions are declustered according to the hash valueof the OID; and the historical versions are range partitioned based on timestamp.

Signature caching in parallel object database systems,Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract In many application areas; the access pattern is navigational and a large fraction ofthe accesses are perfect match accesses/queries on one or more words in text strings in theobjects. One example of such an application area is XML data stored in object databasesystems. Such systems will frequently store large amounts of data; and in order to providethe necessary computing power and data bandwidth; a parallel system based on a shared-nothing architecture can be necessary. In this paper; we describe how the signature cacheapproach can significantly reduce the average object access cost in parallel object databasesystems.,Information and Software Technology,2002,2
Object and log management in temporal log-only object database systems,Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract We have previously studied the possible performance gain from using the log-onlyapproach to realize temporal object database systems. Although the log-only approach in itsbasic form is relatively straightforward; it is not trivial to support features such as steal/no-force buffer management; fuzzy checkpointing; and fast commit. In this paper; we describe indetail algorithms and strategies for object and log management that make support for thesefeatures possible.,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2001,2
Optimal object descriptor caching in temporal object database systems,Kjetil Nørvåg; Kjell Bratbergsengen,Abstract In object database systems (ODBs) with logical OIDs; an OID index (OIDX) isneeded to map from OID to the physical location of the object. In a transaction-time temporalODB; the OIDX should also index the object versions. In this case; the index entries; whichwe call object descriptors (OD); also include the commit timestamp of the transaction thatcreated the object version. In this chapter; we present an analytical model for OIDX accesscosts in temporal ODBs. The model is used to study access costs and optimal use of thememory for buffering index pages and ODs; with different access patterns.,*,2000,2

An efficient index structure for OID indexing in parallel temporal object-oriented database systems,Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract. In an object-oriented database system based on logical OIDs; an OID index (OIDX)is necessary to convert from logical OID to physical location. In a temporal objectorienteddatabase system (TOODB); this OIDX also contains the timestamps of the object versions.We have in a previous paper studied OIDX performance with a relatively simple index. Thestudies have shown that OIDX maintenance can be quite costly; especially objects updates;because in a temporal OODB; the OIDX needs to be updated every time an object isupdated. This has convinced us that a new index structure; particularly suitable to TOODBrequirements; is necessary. In this report; we describe an efficient OID index structure forTOODBs; which we call The Vagabond Temporal OID Index (VTOIDX). The main goals ofthe VTOIDX is 1) support for temporal data; while still having index performance close to a …,*,1999,2
Exploratory product search using top-k join queries,Orestis Gkorgkas; Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Given a relation that contains main products and a set of relations corresponding toaccessory products that can be combined with a main product; the Exploratory Top-k Joinquery retrieves the k best combinations of main and accessory products based on userpreferences. As a result; the user is presented with a set of k combinations of distinct mainproducts; where a main product is combined with accessory products only if the combinationhas a better score than the single main product. We model this problem as a rank-joinproblem; where each combination is represented by a tuple from the main relation and a setof tuples from (some of) the accessory relations. The nature of the problem is challengingbecause the inclusion of accessory products is not predefined by the user; but instead allpotential combinations (joins) are explored during query processing in order to identify …,Information Systems,2017,1
Efficient high utility itemset mining using buffered utility-lists,Quang-Huy Duong; Philippe Fournier-Viger; Heri Ramampiaro; Kjetil Nørvåg; Thu-Lan Dam,Abstract Discovering high utility itemsets in transaction databases is a key task for studyingthe behavior of customers. It consists of finding groups of items bought together that yield ahigh profit. Several algorithms have been proposed to mine high utility itemsets usingvarious approaches and more or less complex data structures. Among existing algorithms;one-phase algorithms employing the utility-list structure have shown to be the most efficient.In recent years; the simplicity of the utility-list structure has led to the development ofnumerous utility-list based algorithms for various tasks related to utility mining. However; amajor limitation of utility-list based algorithms is that creating and maintaining utility-lists aretime consuming and can consume a huge amount of memory. The reasons are thatnumerous utility lists are built and that the utility-list intersection/join operation to construct …,Applied Intelligence,2017,1
Efficient processing of top-k joins in MapReduce,Mei Saouk; Christos Doulkeridis; Akrivi Vlachou,Top-k join is an essential tool for data analysis; since it enables selective retrieval of the kbest combined results that come from multiple different input datasets. In the context of BigData; processing top-k joins over huge datasets requires a scalable platform; such as thewidely popular MapReduce framework. However; such a solution does not necessarily implyefficient processing; due to inherent limitations related to MapReduce. In particular; theseinclude lack of an early termination mechanism for accessing only subset of input data; aswell as an appropriate load balancing mechanism tailored to the top-k join problem. Apartfrom these issues; a significant research problem is how to determine the subset of theinputs that is guaranteed to produce the correct top-k join result.

Mining correlations on massive bursty time series collections,Tomasz Kusmierczyk; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Existing methods for finding correlations between bursty time series are limited tocollections consisting of a small number of time series. In this paper; we present a novelapproach for mining correlation in collections consisting of a large number of time series. Inour approach; we use bursts co-occurring in different streams as the measure of theirrelatedness. By exploiting the pruning properties of our measure we develop new indexingstructures and algorithms that allow for efficient mining of related pairs from millions ofstreams.

Top-k queries,Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg; Yannis Kotidis,Abstract Recently there has been an increased interest in database management systems toincorporate and support more flexible query operators; such as top-k; that produce results ofspecified cardinality; thus avoiding huge and overwhelming result sets. Top-k queriesretrieve the objects that best match the user requirements by employing user-specifiedscoring functions that result in an ordered set of objects containing the best k objects only[30; 75]. In this chapter; efficient processing of top-k queries in peer-to-peer systems isstudied. To this end; the applicability of the skyline operator is investigated for efficientlyanswering top-k queries for a wide class of scoring functions; indicating user-specifiedpreferences; in large P2P networks.,*,2012,1

The costs incurred when the distributed index isupdated becomes a bottleneck. Current distributed indexing methods are designed forindexing and retrieving single tuples; giving a very high update cost. In this paper wepresent a new approach to efficient peer-to-peer range indexing that employs indexing ofranges to reduce average update costs as well as providing efficient data localization anddecoupling from data placement policies. Based on results from experiments; wedemonstrate the applicability and significantly reduced update cost of the new approach.,Digital Information Management; 2008. ICDIM 2008.

An Analytical Study of Object Identifier Indexing,Kjetil Norvag; Kjell Bratbergsengen,АННОТАЦИЯ: To avoid OID index retrieval becoming a bottleneck; efficient bufferingstrategies are needed to minimize the number of disk accesses. In this paper; we developanalytical cost models which we use to find optimal sizes of the index page buffer and theindex entry cache; for different memory sizes; index sizes; and access patterns. Becauseexisting buffer hit estimation models are not applicable for index page buffering in the caseof tree based indexes; we have also developed an analytical model for index page bufferperformance. The cost gain from using the results in this paper is typically in the order of 200-300%. Thus; the results should be of valuable use in optimizers and tools for configurationand tuning of object-oriented database systems.,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,1998,1

Determining Impact of Social Media Badges through Joint Clustering of Temporal Traces and User Features,Tomasz Kusmierczyk; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract: Badges are a common; and sometimes the only; method of incentivizing users toperform certain actions on online sites. However; due to many competing factors influencinguser temporal dynamics; it is difficult to determine whether the badge had (or will have) theintended effect or not. In this paper; we introduce two complementary approaches fordetermining badge influence on users. In the first one; we cluster users' temporal traces(represented with point processes) and apply covariates (user features) to regularize results.In the second approach; we first classify users' temporal traces with a novel statisticalframework; and then we refine the classification results with a semi-supervised clustering ofcovariates.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.01716,2017,*

Towards Building a Knowledge Base of Monetary Transactions from a News Collection,Jan R Benetka; Krisztian Balog; Kjetil Norvag,We address the problem of extracting structured representations of economic events from alarge corpus of news articles; using a combination of natural language processing andmachine learning techniques. The developed techniques allow for semi-automaticpopulation of a financial knowledge base; which; in turn; may be used to support a range ofdata mining and exploration tasks. The key challenge we face in this domain is that thesame event is often reported multiple times; with varying correctness of details. We addressthis challenge by first collecting all information pertinent to a given event from the entirecorpus; then considering all possible representations of the event; and finally; using asupervised learning method; to rank these representations by the associated confidencescores.

Estimating query difficulty for news prediction retrieval,Nattiya Kanhabua; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract News prediction retrieval has recently emerged as the task of retrieving predictionsrelated to a given news story (or a query). Predictions are defined as sentences containingtime references to future events. Such future-related information is crucially important forunderstanding the temporal development of news stories; as well as strategies planning andrisk management. The aforementioned work has been shown to retrieve a significantnumber of relevant predictions. However; only a certain news topics achieve good retrievaleffectiveness. In this paper; we study how to determine the difficulty in retrieving predictionsfor a given news story. More precisely; we address the query difficulty estimation problem fornews prediction retrieval. We propose different entity-based predictors used for classifyingqueries into two classes; namely; Easy and Difficult. Our prediction model is based on a …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,*

Query Operators,Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg; Yannis Kotidis,Abstract Emerging applications over distributed; loosely coupled datasets require advancedquery processing primitives that go beyond exact match queries. Such applications oftenneed to handle multidimensional data; whether these dimensions are related to specificattributes of the data objects or are the result of advanced feature extraction algorithms.Querying multidimensional data is challenging even in a centralized domain. In this chapterwe introduce fundamental query types that are commonly used in processingmultidimensional data. We first discuss similarity search based on range queries andhighlight their relation to nearest neighbor queries. Top-k queries; that rank data objectsbased on some scoring function are also discussed. We conclude our exposition with therecently introduced skyline query; as a generalization of ranking using many different …,*,2012,*

Subspace Skyline Queries,Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg; Yannis Kotidis,Abstract Skyline queries help users make intelligent decisions over complex data; whendifferent and often conflicting criteria are considered. Such queries return a set of data pointsthat are not dominated by any other point on all dimensions. Skyline queries have beenstudied in centralized systems and more recently in distributed environments; such as webinformation systems and peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. Skyline query processing in P2Pnetworks poses inherent challenges and demands non-traditional techniques due to thedistribution of content and the lack of global knowledge. Distributed skyline processingshould minimize transfer of globally dominated data points. Moreover; peers that do notstore any global skyline points; ideally should not be contacted at all.

Similarity Search in Metric Spaces,Akrivi Vlachou; Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg; Yannis Kotidis,Abstract Similarity search in metric spaces has attracted much attention recently due tonumerous applications; including multimedia retrieval and scientific data management.Several centralized indexing methods have been proposed to support efficient similaritysearch in metric spaces. In this chapter; a distributed framework termed SIMPEER [49] ispresented for efficient similarity search in P2P systems that extends the basic concepts of anefficient approach that has been previously proposed for centralized systems. SIMPEERdynamically clusters peer data; in order to build distributed routing information at super-peerlevel. The usage of carefully designed distributed data summaries guarantees that all similarobjects to the query are retrieved; without necessarily flooding the network during queryprocessing.

Query Planning in the PORDaS P2P Database System.,Kjetil Nørvåg; Eirik Eide; Odin Hole Standal,ABSTRACT: Computational science is a rapidly growing multidisciplinary field that has aneed for scalable; distributed; and efficient data management. In our research; we see thepeer-to-peer (P2P) paradigm a possible solution to some of the problems in distributed datamanagement. P2P has already proved to be suitable in contexts like file sharing; distributedcomputations; and distributed search. In our research we are aiming at using P2P to solvesome problems in the domain of distributed databases. In this paper we 1) present PORDaS;a distributed DBMS based on P2P techniques; 2) describe query processing and queryplanning in PORDaS; and 3) present results from an experimental evaluation of differentquery planning variants.,Journal of Digital Information Management,2008,*
Schema-assisted peer selection for XML querying in unstructured P2P systems,Christos Doulkeridis; Kjetil Nørvåg; Michalis Vazirgiannis,Abstract XML is emerging as the de-facto standard for semistructured contents andmetadata. Searching this content in mobile environments is challenging; since centralizedapproaches are not appropriate in a very dynamic environment with limited resourcesavailable for keeping a centralized index up-to-date. A more appropriate solution is toorganize the mobile devices in an unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) network. The mainchallenge in the context of unstructured P2P is to determine the peers that might storedocuments matching a query; ie; peer selection. In this paper; we propose a summarycaching method for increasing the efficiency and recall of peer selection during XMLquerying. Our approach is based on caching parts of XML schemas along the query path; toenable subsequent jumps to remote peers storing content relevant to the query.

Buffer performance modeling in the context of unclustered index accesses with non-uniform access pattern,Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Cost models are powerful tools for analyzing algorithms; and important in cost-based query optimization. With increasing amounts of main memory available; it is importantto include buffer performance in the models. In this paper; we describe and validate (1)buffer models for fine-granularity caching in buffers with locking; and (2) a buffer model fornodes in multiway-tree indexes in the context of unclustered accesses and non-uniformaccess patterns. The validations show a high accuracy of the models. In future self-tuningdatabase systems; the importance of such models will be even higher than today; and themodels presented in this paper should be ideally suited for use in these applications.,Information Sciences,2004,*

By splitting up the development process into several refinement steps whilekeeping the application programming interface stable; the framework aims at rapidimplementation of a prototype with a well-defined interface and a subsequentimplementation of more advanced concepts like business rules in several steps. Therefinement process takes the form of incrementally adding domain-specific information to theapplication. This is achieved by transgressing from general-purpose XML tools that do notsupport the definition and enforcement of constraints to frameworks that support domain-specific models and constraints such as E/R modeling.

Low-Cost Object Declustering Strategies in Parallel Temporal Object Database Systems,Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract In a transaction-time temporal object-oriented database system (TODB); updatingan object creates a new version of the object; but the old version is still accessible. A TODBwill store large amounts of data; and to provide the necessary computing power and databandwidth; a parallel system based on a shared-nothing architecture is necessary. In orderto benefit from a parallel architecture; a suitable declustering of the objects over the nodes inthe system is important. In this report; we study three low-cost declustering algorithms: 1)declustering based on the hash value of the OID of the objects; 2) range partitioning; basedon the timestamp of the objects; and 3) a new hybrid algorithm; where current objectversions are declustered according to the hash value of the OID; and the historical versionsare range partitioned based on timestamp.

Spatial Statistics of Term Co-occurrences for Location Prediction of Tweets,Ozer Ozdikis; Heri Ramampiaro; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract. Predicting the locations of non-geotagged tweets is an active research area ingeographical information retrieval. In this work; we propose a method to detect term co-occurrences in tweets that exhibit spatial clustering or dispersion tendency with significantdeviation from the underlying single-term patterns; and use these co-occurrences to extendthe feature space in probabilistic language models. We observe that using term pairs thatspatially attract or repel each other yields significant increase in the accuracy of predictedlocations. The method we propose relies purely on statistical approaches and spatial pointpatterns without using external data sources or gazetteers. Evaluations conducted on alarge set of multilingual tweets indicate higher accuracy than the existing state-of-the-artmethods.,*,*,*

An example of such a domain is a newsarchive. One challenge from an information retrieval point of view is that a single entity canhave more than one way of referring to it. In this paper we describe how to use Wikipediacontents to automatically generate a dictionary of named entities and synonyms that are allreferring to the same entity. This dictionary can subsequently be used to improve searchquality; for example using query expansion. Through an experimental evaluation we showthat with our approach; we can find named entities and their synonyms with a high degree ofaccuracy.,*,*,*

However; the increase in disk performance is much lower than theincrease in memory and CPU performance; and we have an increasing secondary storageaccess bottleneck. Even though this is not a new situation; the advent of very large mainmemory has made new storage approaches possible. In most current database systems;data is updated in-place. To support recovery and increase performance; write-aheadlogging is used. This logging defers the in-place updates. However; sooner or later; theupdates have to be applied to the database. This often results in non-sequential writing oflots of pages; creating a write bottleneck. To avoid this; another approach is to eliminate thedatabase completely; and use a log-only approach; similar to the approach used in log …,*,*,*

An Approach to High-Performance Scalable Temporal Object Storage,Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract. In this paper; we discuss features that future database systems should support todeliver the required functionality and performance to future applications. The most importantfeatures are efficient support for: 1) large objects; 2) isochronous delivery of data; 3) querieson large data sets; 4) full text indexing; 5) multidimensional data; 6) sparse data; and 7)temporal data and versioning. To efficiently support these features in one integrated system;a new database architecture is needed. We describe an architecture suitable for thispurpose; the Vagabond Temporal Object Database system. We also describe techniques wehave developed to avoid some potential bottlenecks in a system based on this newarchitecture.,*,*,*

Many emerging applications ofdistributed database systems generate very dynamic workloads with frequent changes inaccess patterns from different sites. In those contexts; continuous refragmentation andreallocation can significantly improve performance. In this paper we present DYTAF; adecentralized approach for dynamic table fragmentation and allocation in distributeddatabase systems based on observation of the access patterns of sites to tables. Theapproach performs fragmentation and reallocation based on recent access history …,*,*,*
Technical Report IDI-TR-8/2010,Nattiya Kanhabua; Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract Recently a large number of easily accessible information resources have becomeavailable. To increase search quality; document creation time can be taken into account inorder to increase precision; and query expansion of named entities can be employed inorder to increase recall. A peculiarity of named entities compared to other vocabulary termsis that they are very dynamic in appearance; and synonym relationships between termschanges with time. In this paper; we present an approach to extract synonyms of namedentities over time from the whole history of Wikipedia. In addition; we will use their temporalpatterns as a feature in ranking and classifying them into two types; ie; time-independent ortime-dependent. Time-independent synonyms are invariant to time; while time-dependentsynonyms are relevant to a particular time period; ie; the synonym relation changes over …,*,*,*
Technical Report IDI-TR-10/2004,Kjetil Nørvåg; Albert Overskeid Nybø,Abstract The advent of large amounts of data on the web has closed the gap between thedocument storage and the database communities. In this paper; this work is continued by thedescription of the foundations for temporal document databases. We describe functionalityand operations/operators to be supported by such systems; and more specifically wedescribe the architecture for management of temporal documents used in the prototype ofthe V2 temporal document database system; which supports storage; retrieval; and queryingof temporal documents. We also give some performance results from a mini-benchmark runon the V2 prototype.,*,*,*
Reducing the Cost of Perfect Match Accesses in Object Database Systems,Kjetil Nørvåg,Abstract. In many application areas for object database systems (ODBs); the access patternis navigational; and a large fraction of the accesses are perfect match accesses/queries onone or more words in text strings in the objects. One example of such an application area isXML data stored in ODBs. In this paper; we give an overview of SigCache approach; whichcan significantly reduce the average object access cost for such queries in ODBs; with only amarginal increase in update the costs. Although the discussion in this paper is done in thecontext of ODBs; the SigCache approach can also be employed in relational and object-relational database systems experiencing a navigational access pattern.,*,*,*
