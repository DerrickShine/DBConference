Replication of micro/nano-scale features by micro injection molding with a bulk metallic glass mold insert,Nan Zhang; JS Chu; Cormac J Byrne; DJ Browne; MD Gilchrist,Abstract The development of MEMS and microsystems needs a reliable mass productionprocess to fabricate micro components with micro/nano-scale features. In our study; we usedthe micro injection molding process to replicate micro/nano-scale channels and ridges froma bulk metallic glass (BMG) cavity insert. High-density polyethylene was used as themolding material and the design of experiment approach was adopted to systematically andstatistically investigate the relationship between machine parameters; real processconditions and replication quality. The peak cavity pressure and temperature were selectedas process characteristic values to describe the real process conditions that the materialexperienced during the filling process. The experiments revealed that the replication ofridges; including feature edge; profile and filling height; was sensitive to the flow direction; …,Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering,2012,57
Towards nano-injection molding,Nan Zhang; Cormac J Byrne; David J Browne; Michael D Gilchrist,Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs); having no limiting microstructure; can be machined orthermoplastically-formed with sub-micron precision while still retaining often-desirablemetallic properties such as high compressive strength. These novel materials thus haveenormous potential for use as multi-scale tools for high-volume manufacturing of polymericMEMS and information storage devices.

Characterization of thermo-rheological behavior of polymer melts during the micro injection moulding process,Nan Zhang; MD Gilchrist,Abstract In-line process monitoring and rheological characterization can help to understandthe behaviour of polymer melt flows during manufacture and to make injection moulding ameasurable process for manufacturing high quality parts. This work developed an in-linerheology measurement system using a slit die attached to a micro injection mouldingmachine. A series of dumbbell mould inserts was used to form the slit die with thicknessranging from 600 μm to 200 μm. Two combined pressure and temperature sensors wereembedded into the slit die to measure the pressure drop. Based on the slit flow model; it wasfound that the viscosity of Pebax melts depends on the slit thickness in the actual injectionmoulding process. The competing effects of wall slip and non-isothermal conditions willdetermine the melt viscosity. The plastication induced thermo-mechanical history can also …,Polymer testing,2012,32
Flow induced crystallization of poly (ether‐block‐amide) from the microinjection molding process and its effect on mechanical properties,Nan Zhang; Seong Ying Choi; Michael D Gilchrist,Abstract Crystallization during microinjection molding is investigated relative to processconditions. Modulus and hardness of the skin layer are higher than the core layer;regardless of core structure. Young's modulus; strain at break and yield stress all increasewith an increase of skin ratio. The relationship between process; morphology andmechanical properties is studied for micro products. By using in-line process monitoring;flow induced crystallization is characterized by shear stress and apparent specific work.Shear stress is shown to be a good candidate to characterize the formation of highlyoriented structures under actual microinjection molding processes. This may provide amethod for in-line control of morphology development; and then final properties; bycontrolling the flow conditions. mame201300459-gra-0001,Macromolecular Materials and Engineering,2014,15
Manufacturing microstructured tool inserts for the production of polymeric microfluidic devices,Nan Zhang; Amit Srivastava; Brendan Kirwan; Richard Byrne; Fengzhou Fang; David J Browne; Michael D Gilchrist,Abstract Tooling is critical in defining multi-scale patterns for mass production of polymericmicrofluidic devices using the microinjection molding process. In the present work;fabrication of various microstructured tool inserts using stainless steel; nickel and bulkmetallic glasses (BMGs) is discussed based on die-sinking EDM (electrical dischargemachining); electroforming; focused ion beam milling and thermoplastic forming processes.Tool performance is evaluated in terms of surface roughness; hardness and tool life.Compared to stainless steel; nickel and BMGs are capable of integrating length scales from10 0 to 10− 8 m and are good candidates for producing polymeric microfluidics. Selection oftool materials and manufacturing technologies should consider the end-user requirementsof actual applications.,Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering,2015,11
Characterization of microinjection molding process for milligram polymer microparts,Nan Zhang; Michael D Gilchrist,Abstract Injection molding small milligram components requires precise metering and high-speed injection. Industrially; metering can be maintained either by using small injectionscrews (≤ 14 mm in diameter) or plungers as small as 3 mm diameter and/or by having verylarge sprues and runners. Although large sprues and runners increase metering volume;they hide the effect of process parameters on microcomponents. Consequently; knowledgeof conventional injection molding is not transferable to microinjection molding; makingquality control and optimization difficult. We investigated the filling and postfilling behavior of25 mm 3 microdumbbell specimens with 289 mm 3 sprue and runner by in-line processmonitoring. Design of Experiments were carried out to characterize the effects of processparameters on cavity filling and postfilling behavior.

Performance of nickel and bulk metallic glass as tool inserts for the microinjection molding of polymeric microfluidic devices,Nan Zhang; Amit P Srivastava; David J Browne; Michael D Gilchrist,Abstract Electroformed nickel and bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) can be designed toincorporate features with length scales ranging from millimeters to nanometers. This;combined with their good mechanical properties relative to other materials; makes themcompetitive candidates for manufacturing multi-scale molds to produce high volumes ofpolymeric microfluidics components and other micro/nano devices.

The method of Design ofExperiment was employed to systematically and statistically investigate the effect of machineparameters on actual cavity filling process; which was described by the defined processcharacteristic values (PCVs). The statistical analysis of the experiments indicated thatinjection speed was dominated factor affecting all PCVs in cavity filling process.

Effects of gate design and cavity thickness on filling; morphology and mechanical properties of microinjection mouldings,Nan Zhang; Quanliang Su; Seong Ying Choi; Michael D. Gilchrist,Abstract Miniaturized parts weighing up to tens of milligrams represent a large category ofmicroinjection moulded products. Both miniaturization and extreme processing undermicroinjection moulding cause material to experience high shear rates and high coolingrates; and to have different morphology and final properties from conventional injectionmoulding. It also makes mould design quite challenging. This study investigates micro gatedesign (opening and thickness) and cavity thickness (100–500 μm) on filling; morphologyand mechanical properties of Poly (ether-block-amide) miniaturized dumbbell parts. It isfound that a reduction of gate size has two conflicting effects: increased shear heatingincreases flow length; increased cooling rate reduces flow length. Filling increasessignificantly with an increase of cavity thickness. In addition; skin ratio reduces from∼ 70 …,Material and Design,2015,3

The piezoelectric tensor at the length scale of an individual fibril wasdetermined from angle-dependent in-plane and out-of-plane piezoelectric measurements.The longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient for individual fibrils at the nanoscale was found tobe roughly an order of magnitude greater than that reported for macroscopic measurementsof tendon; the low response of which stems from the presence of oppositely oriented fibrils;as confirmed here.,ACS Biomaterials Science & Engineering,2017,*
Vacuum Venting Enhances the Replication of Nano/Microfeatures in Micro-Injection Molding Process,Seong Ying Choi; Nan Zhang; JP Toner; G Dunne; Michael D Gilchrist,Vacuum venting is a method proposed to improve feature replication in microparts that arefabricated using micro-injection molding (MIM). A qualitative and quantitative study has beencarried out to investigate the effect of vacuum venting on the nano/microfeature replication inMIM. Anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) containing nanofeatures and a bulk metallic glass(BMG) tool mold containing microfeatures were used as mold inserts. The effect of vacuumpressure at constant vacuum time; and of vacuum time at constant vacuum pressure on thereplication of these features is investigated.

The effects of miniaturization and processing on microinjection moldings,Nan Zhang; Michael D. Gilchrist,Mass production of small; high-precision; high-value-added plastic parts has been made possibleby microinjection molding technology. The fabricated parts are typically micro components; weighinga few milligrams; or larger parts with micro/nanoscale surface features. These products havea characteristically high surface-to-volume ratio (103–106m-1) and a correspondingly fastercooling rate than larger components [1]. However; due to the intrinsic low thermal conductivityof polymer materials; a large thermal gradient exists through the part thickness. To fill featuresat the micro/nanoscale; high temperatures and high injection speeds are required; leading tocorrespondingly high stresses and shear rates during molding.

Microinjection Molding for Microfluidics Applications,Jing-Song Chu; Michael D Gilchrist; Nan Zhang,The use of▶ magnetic fields for Lab-on-Chip applications has become very common overthe past few years. Indeed; a great deal of research in microfluidics has been focused ondeveloping not only magnetic field-based Lab-on-Chips for biological or chemicalapplications but also microfluidic actuators. The first class of these Lab-on-Chips; as is oftenthe case in microfluidics; consisted of a direct downscaling of existing methods for biologicalor chemical sample handling through the use of▶ magnetic microbeads. More recently; theuse of magnetic fields in microfluidics has been extended to devise mixers; sorters; or on-chip detection systems. Magnets and magnetic coils can now be fabricated on themicrometer scale and be directly integrated in the chip. Therefore; this makes magnetic field-based Lab-on-Chip an exciting topic that we will review in this entry. Generalities on …,*,2015,*
