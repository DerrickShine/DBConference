Used properly; video cameras help expose wrongdoing but typically come atthe cost of privacy to those not involved in any maleficent activity. What if we could designintelligent systems that are more selective in what video they capture; and focus onanomalous events while protecting the privacy of authorized personnel?

Energy efficient data collection in distributed sensor environments,Qi Han; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Sensors are typically deployed to gather data about the physical world and its artifacts for avariety of purposes that range from environment monitoring; control; to data analysis. Sincesensors are resource constrained; often sensor data is collected into a sensor database thatresides at (more powerful) servers. A natural tradeoff exists between the sensor resources(bandwidth; energy) consumed and the quality of data collected at the server. Blindlytransmitting sensor updates at a fixed periodicity to the server results in a suboptimalsolution due to the differences in stability of sensor values and due to the varying applicationneeds that impose different quality requirements across sensors. We propose adaptive datacollection mechanisms for sensor environments that adjusts to these variations while at thesame time optimizing the energy consumption of sensors.

Multi-agent simulation of disaster response,Daniel Massaguer; Vidhya Balasubramanian; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,ABSTRACT Information Technology has the potential of improving the quality and theamount of information humans receive during emergency response. Testing this technologyin realistic and flexible environments is a non-trivial task. DrillSim is an augmented realitysimulation environment for testing IT solutions. It provides an environment where scientistsand developers can bring their IT solutions and test their effectiveness on the context ofdisaster response. The architecture of DrillSim is based on a multi-agent simulation. Thesimulation of the disaster response activity is achieved by modeling each person involved asan agent. This finer granularity provides extensibility to the system since new scenarios canbe defined by defining new agents.

Mitigating soft error failures for multimedia applications by selective data protection,Kyoungwoo Lee; Aviral Shrivastava; Ilya Issenin; Nikil Dutt; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract With advances in process technology; soft errors (SE) are becoming an increasinglycritical design concern. Due to their large area and high density; caches are worst hit by softerrors. Although Error Correction Code based mechanisms protect the data in caches; theyhave high performance and power overheads. Since multimedia applications areincreasingly being used in mission-critical embedded systems where both reliability andenergy are a major concern; there is a de? nite need to improve reliability in embeddedsystems; without too much energy overhead. We observe that while a soft error inmultimedia data may only result in a minor loss in QoS; a soft error in avariable that controlsthe execution? ow of the program may be fatal. Consequently; we propose to partition thedata space into failure critical and failure non-critical data; and provide a high-degree of …,Proceedings of the 2006 international conference on Compilers; architecture and synthesis for embedded systems,2006,70

Scalable distributed garbage collection for systems of active objects,Nalini Venkatasubramanian; Gul Agha; Carolyn Talcott,Abstract Automatic storage management is important in highly parallel programmingenvironments where large numbers of objects and processes are being constantly createdand discarded. Part of the difficulty with automatic garbage collection in systems of activeobjects; such as actors; is that an active object may not be garbage if it has references toother reachable objects; even when no other object has references to it. This is because anactor may at some point communicate its mail address to a reachable object thereby makingitself reachable. Because messages may be pending in the network; the asynchrony ofdistributed networks makes it difficult to determine the current topology. Existing garbagecollection schemes halt the computation process in order to determine if a currentlyinaccessible actor may be potentially active; thus precluding a real-time response by the …,*,1992,58

Conserving power to prolongbattery life is of primary importance for these devices. Several factors such as backlightintensity; the hard disk; the CPU; the network interface and the nature of the applicationcontribute significantly towards power consumption for a mobile device. While significantresearch effort has been made to optimize power consumption at the application; networkand processor levels; comparatively little work has been done to reduce or adapt to thepower consumed by the backlight.

However; maintaining accurate informationabout available system resources is complex and expensive; especially in mobileenvironments where system conditions are highly dynamic. Resource provisioningmechanisms for such dynamic environments must therefore be able to tolerate imprecisionin system state while ensuring adequate QoS to the end-user. In this paper; we address theinformation collection problem for QoS-based services in mobile environments. Specifically;we propose a family of information collection policies that vary in the granularity at whichsystem state information is represented and maintained. We empirically evaluate the impactof these policies on the performance of diverse resource provisioning strategies. We …,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2006,33
Energy-aware cosynthesis of real-time multimedia applications on MPSoCs using heterogeneous scheduling policies,Minyoung Kim; Sudarshan Banerjee; Nikil Dutt; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract Real-time multimedia applications are increasingly being mapped onto MPSoC(multiprocessor system-on-chip) platforms containing hardware--software IPs (intellectualproperty); along with a library of common scheduling policies such as EDF; RM.

Proximiter: Enabling mobile proximity-based content sharing on portable devices,Bo Xing; Karim Seada; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,The recent years have witnessed an explosive amount of user-generated contents; alongwith users' soaring demands on sharing these contents. An evidence of that is the blossomof hundreds of sharing sites on the web; among which the most famous are MySpace [1];Flickr [2]; YouTube [3]; Facebook [4] and LinkedIn [5]. Through these sites; users upload thecontents they generate (blogs; pictures; videos; resumes; etc.); and make them available totheir friends or the general public. A common characteristic of such Internet-based contentsharing scenarios is that all contents are hosted by third-party servers on the Internet; andsharing happens when content consumers (regardless of where they are) access thehosting web sites.,Pervasive Computing and Communications; 2009.

Flashback: A peer-to-peerweb server for flash crowds,Mayur Deshpande; Abhishek Amit; Mason Chang; Nalini Venkatasubramanian; Sharad Mehrotra,We present Flashback; a ready-to-use system for scalably handling large unexpected trafficspikes on web-sites. Unlike previous systems; our approach does not rely on anyintermediate nodes to cache content. Instead; the clients (browsers) create a dynamic; self-scaling peer-to-peer (P2P) Web-server that grows and shrinks according to the load. Thisapproach translates into a challenging problem-a P2P data exchange protocol that canoperate in churn rates where more than 90% of peers can leave the overlay in under 10seconds. This is at least an order of magnitude higher churn rate than previously addressedresearch. Additionally; our system operates under two strict constraints-users are assuredthat they upload only as much as they download and second; end-user browsing experienceis preserved; ie; low latency downloads and zero configuration or download of any …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2007.

Video dissemination over hybrid cellular and ad hoc networks,Ngoc Minh Do; Cheng-Hsin Hsu; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,We study the problem of disseminating videos to mobile users by using a hybrid cellular andad hoc network. In particular; we formulate the problem of optimally choosing the mobiledevices that will serve as gateways from the cellular to the ad hoc network; the ad hoc routesfrom the gateways to individual devices; and the layers to deliver on these ad hoc routes. Wedevelop a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP)-based algorithm; called POPT; to solve thisoptimization problem. We then develop a Linear Program (LP)-based algorithm; called MTS;for lower time complexity. While the MTS algorithm achieves close-to-optimum video qualityand is more efficient than POPT in terms of time complexity; the MTS algorithm does not runin real time for hybrid networks with large numbers of nodes.

Assessing the impact of geographically correlated failures on overlay-based data dissemination,Kyungbaek Kim; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,This paper addresses reliability of data dissemination applications when there are severedisruptions to the underlying physical infrastructure. Such massive simultaneous physicalfailures can happen during the geographical events such as natural disasters (earthquakes;floods; tornados) or sudden power outages-infrastructure failures in these cases aregeographically correlated. In particular; we focus on overlay based data disseminationmechanisms and explore their ability to tolerate such large geographically correlatedfailures. Due to the tight correlation between multiple overlay links and a single physical link;a few physical failures may affect lots of overlay links. To enable reliable disseminationunder such conditions; we propose overlay network construction methods that incorporateproximity-aware neighbor selection methods to improve the performance of the overlay …,Global Telecommunications Conference (GLOBECOM 2010); 2010 IEEE,2010,24

Middleware for pervasive spaces: Balancing privacy and utility,Daniel Massaguer; Bijit Hore; Mamadou H Diallo; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract Middleware for pervasive spaces has to meet conflicting requirements. It has to bothmaximize the utility of the information exposed and ensure that this information does notviolate users' privacy. In order to resolve these conflicts; we propose a framework groundedin utility theory where users dynamically control the level of disclosure about theirinformation. We begin by providing appropriate definitions of privacy and utility for the type ofapplications that would support collaborative work in an office environment—currentdefinitions of privacy and anonymity do not apply in this context.

A semantics-based approach for speech annotation of images,Dmitri Kalashnikov; Sharad Mehrotra; Jie Xu; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Associating textual annotations/tags with multimedia content is among the most effectiveapproaches to organize and to support search over digital images and multimediadatabases. Despite advances in multimedia analysis; effective tagging remains largely amanual process wherein users add descriptive tags by hand; usually when uploading orbrowsing the collection; much after the pictures have been taken. This approach; however; isnot convenient in all situations or for many applications; eg; when users would like to publishand share pictures with others in real time. An alternate approach is to instead utilize aspeech interface using which users may specify image tags that can be transcribed intotextual annotations by employing automated speech recognizers.

Many error-resilient video encodings allow us toexploit errors and generate a range of acceptable tradeoff spaces by controlling the amountof errors in the system. This expanded tradeoff space allows system designers tocomparatively evaluate different operating points with varying QoS and energy consumptionby aggressively exploiting error-resilience attributes; and can potentially result in significantenergy savings. Specifically; we propose an error-aware video encoding technique thatintentionally injects errors (drops frames) while ensuring QoS in accordance with error-resilience.

Partially protected caches to reduce failures due to soft errors in multimedia applications,Kyoungwoo Lee; Aviral Shrivastava; Ilya Issenin; Nikil Dutt; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,With advances in process technology; soft errors are becoming an increasingly criticaldesign concern. Owing to their large area; high density; and low operating voltages; cachesare worst hit by soft errors. Based on the observation that in multimedia applications; not alldata require the same amount of protection from soft errors; we propose a partially protectedcache (PPC) architecture; in which there are two caches; one protected and the otherunprotected at the same level of memory hierarchy. We demonstrate that as compared to theexisting unprotected cache architectures; PPC architectures can provide 47 times reductionin failure rate; at only 1% runtime and 3% power overheads. In addition; the failure ratereduction obtained by PPCs is very sensitive to the PPC cache configuration. Therefore; thisobservation provides an opportunity for further improvement of the solution by correctly …,IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems,2009,18

Directory-based composite routing and scheduling policies for dynamic multimedia environments,Zhenghua Fu; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract. In this paper we present and evaluate algorithms to address combined path andserver selection (CPSS) problems in highly dynamic multimedia environments. Our goal is toensure effective utilization of network and server resources while tolerating imprecision insystem state information. Components within the framework implement the optimizedscheduling policies as well as collect/update the network and server parameters using adirectory service. We present and analyze multiple policies to solve the CPSS problem. Inaddition; we study multiple techniques for updating the directory service with system stateinformation. We further evaluate the performance of the CPSS policies under differentupdate mechanisms and study the implications of the CPSS policies on directory servicemanagement.,Multimedia Systems,2004,18
Reflective middleware for integrating network monitoring with adaptive object messaging,Qi Han; Sebastian Gutierrez-Nolasco; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,In the future; applications will need to execute in a ubiquitous environment with varyingnetwork conditions (connectivity; bandwidth; etc.) and system constraints (eg; power andstorage). The distributed object paradigm is often used to facilitate the development of large-scale distributed applications. However; the traditional object messaging layer operates withlimited awareness of underlying system and network conditions; whereas current systemand network monitoring tools operate at the network layer with little awareness of application-level object communication requirements. This article explores the possibility; mechanismsand benefits of filling the gap between object messaging and system monitoring. Weintroduce connection abstraction as the mechanism for these two layers to communicate andexchange information.

Exploring adaptability of secure group communication using formal prototyping techniques,Sebastian Gutierrez-Nolasco; Nalini Venkatasubramanian; Mark-Oliver Stehr; Carolyn Talcott,Abstract Traditionally; adaptability in communication frameworks has been restricted topredefined choices without taking into consideration tradeoffs between them and theapplication requirements. Furthermore; different applications with an entire spectrum ofrequirements will have to adapt to these predefined choices instead of tailoring thecommunication framework to fit their needs. In this paper we extend an executablespecification of a state-of-the-art secure group communication subsystem to explore twodimensions of adaptability; namely security and synchrony. In particular; we relax thetraditional requirement of virtual synchrony (a well-known bottleneck) and propose variousgeneric optimizations; while preserving essential security guarantees.,Proceedings of the 3rd workshop on Adaptive and reflective middleware,2004,17
MIRO: An embedded distributed architecture for biologically inspired mobile robots,Alfredo Weitzenfeld; Sebastian Gutierrez-Nolasco; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract—Nature has always been a source of inspiration in the development of roboticsystems. As such; the study of animal behavior (ethology) and the study of the underlyingneural structure responsible for behavior (neuroethology) have inspired many roboticdesigns. In general; neuroethological based systems tend to be more complex thanethological ones thus being more expensive to compute; a common problem to bothsimulation and robotic experimentation. To overcome this problem; it is necessary either toincorporate very powerful hardware or; particularly in the case of mobile robots; embed therobot via wireless communication into remote distributed computational system whereexpensive computation can take place. While the first approach simplifies the overall roboticarchitecture it results in bulky and expensive robots. The second approach results in …,Proc ICAR-03; 11 th International Conference on Advanced Robotics; June,2003,17

However; most web applications require datain plaintext for implementing the various functionalities and in general; do not supportencrypted data management. Therefore; CloudProtect strives to carry out the datatransformations (encryption/decryption) in a manner that is transparent to the application; ie;preserves all functionalities of the application; including those that require data to be inplaintext.

Timeliness-accuracy balanced collection of dynamic context data,Qi Han; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,In the future; we are likely to see a tremendous need for context-aware applications whichadapt to available context information such as physical surroundings; network; or systemconditions. We aim to provide a fundamental support for these applications-a real-timecontext information collection service. This service delivers the right context information tothe right user at the right time. The complexity of providing the real-time context informationservice arises from 1) the dynamically changing status of information sources; 2) the diverseuser requirements in terms of data accuracy and service latency; and 3) constantly changingsystem conditions.

A reflective middleware framework for communication in dynamic environments,Sebastian Gutierrez-Nolasco; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract The goal of a flexible communication framework is to allow dynamic customizationof complex communication protocols without compromising the overall system performance.However; the communication protocols provided in successful middleware frameworks areusually tailored to specific and/or static requirements are not suitable for dynamicenvironments. In dynamic environments; applications must be able to customizecommunication protocols on-the-fly in order to respond to change requirements whileprotecting the system from reaching inconsistent states that can lead to deadlocks; livelocksand incorrect execution semantics. Hence; there is a need to identify interprotocol andprotocol-(middleware) service interactions in order to ensure safe flexibility of the system.The work described here proposes a reflective communication framework (RCF) capable …,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2002,15

Application-aware integration of data collection and power management in wireless sensor networks,Qi Han; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract Sensors are typically deployed to gather data about the physical world and itsartifacts for a variety of purposes that range from environment monitoring; control; to dataanalysis. Since sensors are resource constrained; often sensor data is collected into sensordatabases that reside at (more powerful) servers. A natural tradeoff exists betweenresources (bandwidth; energy) consumed and the quality of data collected at the server.Blindly transmitting sensor updates at a fixed periodicity to the server results in a suboptimalsolution due to the differences in stability of sensor values and due to the varying applicationneeds that impose different quality requirements across sensors. In order to adapt to thesevariations while at the same time optimizing the energy consumption of sensors; this paperproposes three different models and corresponding data collection protocols.

Adaptive parameter collection in dynamic distributed environments,Zhenghua Fu; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Cost-effectively collecting distributed state information is a challenging problem. There isperhaps no single perfect solution since different distributed application environments posedifferent requirements from the information collection process.

Farecast: Fast; reliable application layer multicast for flash dissemination,Kyungbaek Kim; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract To disseminate messages from a single source to a large number of targetedreceivers; a natural approach is the tree-based application layer multicast (ALM). However;in time-constrained flash dissemination scenarios; eg earthquake early warning; where timeis of the essence; the tree-based ALM has a single point of failure; its reliable extensionsusing ack-based failure recovery protocols cannot support reliable dissemination in thetimeframe needed.

The pub/sub system besides beingresponsible for matching and routing the published content; is also responsible forconverting the content into the suitable (target) format for each subscriber. Contentconversion is achieved through a set of content adaptation operators (eg; image transcoder;document translator; etc.) at different nodes in the overlay network. We study algorithms forplacement of such operators in the pub/sub broker overlay in order to minimize thecommunication and computation resource consumption.

Ccd: A distributed publish/subscribe framework for rich content formats,Hojjat Jafarpour; Bijit Hore; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,In this paper; we propose a content-based publish/subscribe (pub/sub) framework thatdelivers matching content to subscribers in their desired format. Such a framework enablesthe pub/sub system to accommodate richer content formats including multimediapublications with image and video content. In our proposed framework; users (consumers) inaddition to specifying their information needs (subscription queries); also specify their profilewhich includes the information about their receiving context which includes characteristics ofthe device used to receive the content (eg; resolution of a PDA used by a consumer). Thepub/sub system besides being responsible for matching and routing the published content;also becomes responsible for converting the content into the suitable format for each user.Content conversion is achieved through a set of content adaptation operators (eg; image …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2012,10
Dynamic load balancing for cluster-based publish/subscribe system,Hojjat Jafarpour; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,In this paper we present load balancing techniques for Cluster-based pub/sub frameworkthat include both static and dynamic load balancing. The static load balancing is donethrough a multi-cluster architecture for broker overlay network which is based onsubscription distribution knowledge in the event space. The dynamic load balancing; on theother hand; is achieved through exploiting multiple inter-cluster and intra-clusterconnections to dynamically distribute publication and subscription forwarding load amongbrokers during run time. Our experimental results show that the proposed load balancingtechniques effectively prevent overloaded brokers without having significant effect oncontent dissemination efficiency.,Applications and the Internet; 2009.

Proactive energy-aware video streaming to mobile handheld devices,Shivajit Mohapatra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract In this paper; we present a adaptive middleware solution for power-aware videostreaming to mobile handheld devices. Using knowledge of dynamic device parameters (egresidual energy); changing network noise levels and device mobility patterns; themiddleware dynamically determines video streaming properties (eg video burst sizes) tomaximize the user QoS (reduce packet loss) while optimizing power consumption of thedevice. Specifically; we propose a proactive video transcoding and streaming technique thatuses global system knowledge to effect power optimization; by transitioning the wireless NICto sleep mode. Our performance results indicate that such a proactive scheme can reducethe energy consumption of network cards by as much as 70%; even in the presence ofnetwork noise and provide graceful video adaptations for better user experience.,*,2003,10
Adaptive lookup of open WiFi using crowdsensing,Di Wu; Qiang Liu; Yong Li; Julie A McCann; Amelia C Regan; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Open WiFi access points (APs) are demonstrating that they can provide opportunistic dataservices to moving vehicles. We present CrowdWiFi; a novel system to look up roadsideWiFi APs located outdoors or inside buildings. CrowdWiFi consists of two components:online compressive sensing (CS) and offline crowdsourcing. Online CS presents an efficientframework for the coarse-grained estimation of nearby APs along the driving route; wherereceived signal strength (RSS) values are recorded at runtime; and the number and locationof the APs are recovered immediately based on limited RSS readings and adaptive CSoperations.

Optimizing offline access to social network content on mobile devices,Ngoc Do; Ye Zhao; Shu-Ting Wang; Cheng-Hsin Hsu; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,In this paper; we explore the problem of supporting efficient access to social media contentson social network sites for mobile devices without requiring mobile users to be online all thetime. We propose and implement a broker/proxy based architecture that stages data at abroker/proxy; and selectively downloads to the mobile device only those contents that havea high likelihood of being viewed. The system determines the relevance of social mediaupdates that continuously arrive (eg; Facebook friend updates) for each user.

We study optimizingthe performance of communications (specifically in terms of latency) in an instant meshnetwork by intelligently selecting the gateway.

SAT: Spatial awareness from textual input,Dmitri V Kalashnikov; Yiming Ma; Sharad Mehrotra; Ramaswamy Hariharan; Nalini Venkatasubramanian; Naveen Ashish,Abstract Recent events (WTC attacks; Southeast Asia Tsunamis; Hurricane Katrina; Londonbombings) have illustrated the need for accurate and timely situational awareness tools inemergency response. Developing effective situational awareness (SA) systems has thepotential to radically improve decision support in crises by improving the accuracy andreliability of the information available to the decision-makers. In an evolving crisis; rawsituational information comes from a variety of sources in the form of situational reports; liveradio transcripts; sensor data; video streams. Much of the data resides (or can be converted)in the form of free text; from which events of interest are extracted. Spatial or locationinformation is one of the fundamental attributes of the events; and is useful for a variety ofsituational awareness (SA) tasks.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,9
A game theoretic approach for power aware middleware,Shivajit Mohapatra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract In this paper; we propose a dynamic game theoretic approach for choosing poweroptimization strategies for various components (eg cpu; network interface etc.) of a low-power device operating in a distributed environment. Specifically; we model the energyconsumption problem as a dynamic non-cooperative game theoretic problem; where thevarious components of the device are modelled as the players in the game thatsimultaneously consume a common resource (device battery power). An analysis for theNash and social optima of the game is presented. We then introduce an adaptive distributedpower-aware middleware framework; called" Dynamo"; that incorporates the game theoreticapproach for determining optimal power optimization strategies.

Optimizing power using a reconfigurable middleware,Shivajit Mohapatra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract In distributed environments; generic middleware services (eg caching; locationmanagement etc.) are widely used to satisfy application needs in a cost-effective manner.Such middleware services consume system resources such as storage; computation andcommunication and can be sources of significant power overheads when executed on low-power devices. Our goal is to develop a distributed middleware framework that is inherentlypower-aware and reconfigures itself to adapt to diminishing power levels of low-powerdevices in distributed systems. This paper presents and evaluates a methodology foroptimizing the power consumption of low-power devices using a reflective and customizablemiddleware framework. It introduces a power-aware middleware framework (parm) andidentifies some of the intrinsic requirements for the framework to be effective. Specifically …,Tech. rep.,2003,9

ODS evolve dynamically and componentsof ODS interact with an environment that is not under their control. In particular; we wouldlike to be able to consider separately issues such as: functional behavior of a service; failuresemantics and fault tolerance protocols; and resource management issues such as memorymanagement; migration; load balancing; and scheduling. In this report we consider remotecreation; migration; and reachability snapshot services: their specification at different levelsof abstraction; and their composition.,*,2001,9
A Composable Reflective Communication Framework,Sebastian Gutierrez-Nolasco; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract A communication service is described by an abstract protocol that specifies a set ofroles to be played by participants; the requirements on role players and installationinformation. The (dynamic) installation of a protocol requires no knowledge or modificationof the component itself; it is sufficient to encapsulate each component in a layer thatimplements the role it is to play; affecting only the communication between participants of theparticular communication protocol. However; preservation of guaranteed behavior from thecommunication service may crucially depend on the composition order of the protocols andtheir possible interactions. Furthermore; Quality of Service (QoS) specifications have beenusually incorporated as part of the communication service specification; further complicatingthe validation of the composition process.

We first design a flexible and scalable representation to modelindividual geographies and their interconnections. Given such a representation; we developan algorithm that exploits precomputation and caching of geographical data for pathplanning. A utility-based approach is adopted to decide which paths to precompute andstore.

The different dimensions of dynamicity,Mayur Deshpande; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,In a peer-to-peer (P2P) network; a'fabric'of overlay links helps peers discover and use otherpeers' resources. This fabric; however; is highly dynamic and constantly changing. Whiledifferent measures of dynamicity have been implicitly and explicitly proposed; there is lack ofdeeper understanding about the various aspects of dynamicity. We systematically evaluateand quantify different dimensions of dynamicity through controlled generation of differentdynamic networks. We also introduce a new dimension of dynamicity; persistence; whichquantifies stable nodes in a network. This measure could be quite useful in the design andtesting of P2P protocols that exploit the presence of stable nodes. Also; quite coincidentally;and to our surprise; a certain type of dynamic network that we designed has node degreeproperties that resemble those observed in social networks.,Peer-to-Peer Computing; 2004.

A middleware approach to access control for mobile concurrent objects,Jehan Wickramasuriya; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract The need for addressing security concerns in mobile distributed environments iswell known. However; providing security mechanisms at the application layer is usuallyinsufficient; especially when considering distributed object-oriented (OO) systems. Thispaper presents a domain-based approach to access control in a distributed environmentwith mobile objects. The dynamic nature and semantic diversity of OO systems makes itdifficult to ensure information security and integrity via traditional access control models. Weillustrate a capability-based access control architecture for mobile concurrent objects andensure the preservation of domain based access control in the presence of mobile objects.We examine composability issues that study the effects of enforcing access control policiesin the presence of other resource management services in a distributed environment.

On optimal and fair service allocation in mobile cloud computing,M Reza Rahimi; Nalini Venkatasubramanian; Sharad Mehrotra; Athanasios V Vasilakos,This paper studies the optimal and fair service allocation for a variety of mobile applications(single or group and collaborative mobile applications) in mobile cloud computing. Weexploit the observation that using tiered clouds; ie clouds at multiple levels (local and public)can increase the performance and scalability of mobile applications. We proposed a novelframework to model mobile applications as a location-time workflows (LTW) of tasks; hereusers mobility patterns are translated to mobile service usage patterns.

Complete automation of future grid for optimal real-time distribution of renewables,Kiyoshi Nakayama; Kyle E Benson; Lubomir F Bic; Michael B Dillencourt,In this paper; we present a novel distributed control technique to distribute renewableenergy resources to consumers in a future large-scale power grid connecting real-time end-use devices to anticipate demand automatically. The proposed technique; which integratestie-set graph theory with an intelligent agent system; effectively divides the power grid into aset of loops. Autonomous agents constantly navigate the grid to dynamically synchronizestate information among tie-sets and completely automate the future power grid. The supplyand load of electric power at every instant can be balanced even if the future load isuncertain and renewable generation is highly variable and unpredictable.

While such a system has beenrecently studied; existing efforts resort to simulations when evaluating their solutions;because there is no public-domain software for setting up a complete hybrid networktestbed. In this work; we design and implement a testbed for scalable video streaming over ahybrid network. Our testbed is built on top of a Linux server and multiple Androidsmartphones. We demonstrate how to use our testbed to evaluate the scheduling algorithmsproposed in the literature. We also present a new scheduling algorithm which runs in real-time yet outperforms previous algorithms.

Fault tolerant evaluation of continuous selection queries over sensor data,Iosif Lazaridis; Qi Han; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,We consider the problem of evaluating continuous selection queries over sensor-generatedvalues in the presence of faults. Small sensors are fragile; have finite energy and memory;and communicate over a lossy medium; hence; tuples produced by them may not reach thequerying node; resulting in an incomplete and ambiguous answer; as any of the non-reporting sensors may have produced a tuple which was lost. We develop a protocol; FAultTolerant Evaluation of Continuous Selection Queries (FATE-CSQ); which guarantees a user-requested level of quality in an efficient manner. When many faults occur; this may not beachievable; in that case; we aim for the best possible answer; under the query's timeconstraints. FATE-CSQ is designed to be resilient to different kinds of failures.

Using semantics for speech annotation of images,Chaitanya Desai; Dmitri V Kalashnikov; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Digital cameras and multimedia capture devices are becoming increasingly popular to takepictures. Annotating these pictures is important to support their browsing and retrieval. Fullyautomatic image annotation techniques typically rely entirely on visual properties of theimage. The state of the art image annotation systems of this kind work well in detectinggeneric object classes: car; horse; motorcycle; airplane; etc. However; certain characteristicsof the image are hard to capture using strictly the visual properties. These include location(Paris; California; San Francisco; etc); event (birthday; wedding; graduation ceremony; etc);people (John; Jane; brother; etc) and abstract qualities referring to objects in the image(beautiful; funny; sweet; etc) among others. The more conventional method of annotationthat relies completely on human input has several limitations as well. Typing tags using …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09.

Specifically; weexploit quality-aware in-network aggregation of query information to reduce communicationcosts. Given cluster structures over sensor nodes; we develop an adaptive approximate dataprocessing protocol to aggregate data and process queries given error tolerance on userqueries. The protocol enforces group quality constraints on clusters and adjusts errorbounds to balance workload of clusters and reduce communication cost. It also tries toinitiate local communication instead of global communication in the effort of minimizingoverall communication overhead.

Partitioning techniques for partially protected caches in resource-constrained embedded systems,Kyoungwoo Lee; Aviral Shrivastava; Nikil Dutt; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract Increasing exponentially with technology scaling; the soft error rate even in earth-bound embedded systems manufactured in deep subnanometer technology is projected tobecome a serious design consideration. Partially protected cache (PPC) is a promisingmicroarchitectural feature to mitigate failures due to soft errors in power; performance; andcost sensitive embedded processors. A processor with PPC maintains two caches; oneprotected and the other unprotected; both at the same level of memory hierarchy. Theintuition behind PPCs is that not all data in the application is equally prone to soft errors. Byfinding and mapping the data that is more prone to soft errors to the protected cache; anderror-resilient data to the unprotected cache; failures induced by soft errors can besignificantly reduced at a minimal power and performance penalty. Consequently; the …,ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems (TODAES),2010,6
Practical experiences in enabling and ensuring quality sensing in emergency response applications,Chris Davison; Daniel Massaguer; Lilia Paradis; M Reza Rahimi; Bo Xing; Qi Han; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Situational awareness in emergency response is critical. Knowing the status of the hazards;the rescue workers; and the building occupants; etc.; can greatly help the incidentcommander make the right decisions in responding emergencies; and as a result; savelives. Such situational awareness can be achieved by using existing sensing andcommunication infrastructures and/or having rescue practitioners dynamically deploy theirown. Nevertheless; current sensing and communications techniques are; not fault-free. Inthis paper; we study; through both lab experiments and real emergency response drills; thenature of different wireless networks (sensor networks and Wi-Fi networks) in transmittingvarious types of data.

Towards distributed applications stability engineering,Pankaj Garg; Svend Frolund; Allan Shepherd; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract-We develop concepts of a stable distributed application and present anengineering approach for the life cycle of such applications. The definition of stability ismotivated by the need to address changes in the environment in which a distributedapplication is embedded—a network of computers; software environment; and user accesspatterns. Current approaches for distributed applications engineering do not adequatelyaddress the stability issues raised in this paper. Although there are approaches for reliability;performance engineering; and scalability; hitherto they have not been brought togetherunder a perspective such as stability engineering. We illustrate the concepts of stability andstability engineering with several example distributed applications.,Proc. 5th California Software Symp,1995,6
ReCREW: A reliable flash-dissemination system,Mayur Deshpande; Kyungbaek Kim; Bijit Hore; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,In this paper; we explore a new form of dissemination that arises in distributed; mission-critical applications called Flash Dissemination. This involves the rapid dissemination of richinformation to a large number of recipients in a very short period of time. A key characteristicof Flash Dissemination is its unpredictability (eg; natural hazards); but when invoked it mustharness all possible resources to ensure timely delivery of information. Additionally; it mustscale to a large number of recipients and perform efficiently in highly heterogeneous (data;network) and failure prone environments. We investigate a peer-based approach based onthe simple principle of transferring dissemination load to information receivers usingfoundations from broadcast networks; gossip theory; and random networks.

One of the limitations of the simulators is that they are developed by domainexperts who have an in-depth understanding of the phenomena being modeled andtypically designed to be executed and evaluated independently. Therefore; the grandchallenge is to facilitate the process of pulling all of independently created models togetherinto an interoperating multisimulation model where decision makers can explore differentalternatives and conduct low cost experiments.

Data partitioning techniques for partially protected caches to reduce soft error induced failures,Kyoungwoo Lee; Aviral Shrivastava; Nikil Dutt; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract Exponentially increasing with technology scaling; soft errors have become aserious design concern in the deep sub-micron embedded systems. Partially Pro-tectedCache (PPC) is a promising microarchitectural feature to mitigate failures due to soft errorsin embedded processors.

Towards reliable application data broadcast in wireless ad hoc networks,Bo Xing; Mayur Deshpande; Nalini Venkatasubramanian; Sharad Mehrotra; D Bren,Application data broadcast in ad hoc networks is an important primitive that has receivedlittle systematic research-the main focus of prior research being on control data broadcast. Inthis paper; we show why control data broadcast and even multicast techniques areinsufficient for reliable application data broadcast; in fact their reliability degrades sharplywith increasing application data size. We discover the root cause of this to be IP fragmentingthe application data but not providing good reliability control on the fragments. We hencepropose READ (reliable and efficient application-data dissemination); a protocol based onhigher-layer fragmentation with fragment-level reliability control.

We present a novel power management service in QoS-brokerage architecture thatrelies on multi-level middleware services to act as brokers in delivering multimedia contentin distributed real-time systems under performance and power constraints. To minimizepower consumption; the power management service provides for minimal interaction amongthe system components as well as provides dynamic control of speed scaling (such asvoltage; frequency) and component shutdown. These power control “knobs” enable theservice to match instantaneous application needs against available energy resources. Thepower management service is implemented using the Comp| OSE middleware frameworkusing a power-aware API that allows the applications programmer to ensure a continuousdialogue between the distributed embedded systems and changing application needs.

The ability to manage and share information on large-scale networkresources with a growing number of users in a secure and efficient manner is desirable.Distributed systems allow services; endsystems and protocols to dynamically attach to anddetach from the distributed environment. In turn it is desirable that these services are able tooperate in a safe; concurrent manner while possibly sharing common resources; that is tosay they are composable.

A metaobject framework for qos-based distributed resource management,Nalini Venkatasubramanian; Gul Agha; Carolyn Talcott,Abstract: Systems that provide distributed multimedia services are subject to constantevolution-customizable middleware is required to effectively manage this change. In thispaper we present a meta-architectural framework for customizable QoS-based middlewareusing Actors; a model of concurrent active objects. Middleware services for resourcemanagement execute concurrently with each other and with application activities—scheduling; protocols providing security and reliability; load balancing and streamsynchronization can therefore potentially interfere with each other. To ensure cost-effectiveQoS in distributed multimedia systems; safe composability of resource managementservices is essential. For instance; system protocols and activities must not cause arbitrarydelays in the presence of timing based QoS constraints.

Cross-layer interactions of error control schemes in mobile multimedia systems,Kyoungwoo Lee; Aviral Shrivastava; Minyoung Kim; Nikil Dutt; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract Soft errors are threatening the system reliability in mobile devices but traditionalhardware protection techniques incur significant overheads in terms of power andperformance. Thus; incorporating reliability in resource-limited mobile devices posessignificant challenges.

So we study heterogeneous specifics abouttwo different errors at two different abstraction layers; and present a cooperative cross-layerapproach to obtain low-cost reliability at the minimal degradation of QoS.

Mobile data overlay (mdo): A data placement paradigm for mobile applications,Yun Huang; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,This paper addresses the issue of proxy-based data placement for mobile applications.

Fault-Tolerant Queries over Sensor Data.,Iosif Lazaridis; Qi Han; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract We consider the problem of evaluating continuous selection queries over sensor-generated values in the presence of faults. Small sensors are fragile; have finite energy andmemory; and communicate over a lossy medium; hence; tuples produced by them may notreach the querying node; resulting in an incomplete and ambiguous answer; as any of thenon-reporting sensors may have produced a tuple which was lost. We develop a protocol;FAult Tolerant Evaluation of Continuous Selection Queries (FATE-CSQ); which guarantees auser-requested level of quality in an efficient manner. When many faults occur; this may notbe achievable; in that case; we aim for the best possible answer; under the query's timeconstraints.

Tie-set based fault tolerance for autonomous recovery of double-link failures,Kiyoshi Nakayama; Kyle E Benson; Vahe Avagyan; Michael B Dillencourt; Lubomir F Bic; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,In this paper; we propose a mechanism for coping with double-link failures in anautonomous and distributed manner. We call it Tie-set Based Fault Tolerance (TBFT)because it utilizes tie-sets; which represent a set of the edges comprising a loop within thegraph that represents the network. An autonomous distributed control method based ondividing a network into a set of tie-sets; whose union covers every edge in the network; hasbeen verified to be more effective than traditional tree-based restoration techniques in caseof single link failure. The proposed method efficiently and gracefully handle double-linkfailures and also decrease the communication overhead incurred during networkconfiguration. We demonstrate these results by simulating and comparing TBFT with thetraditional approach of using Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP).,Computers and Communications (ISCC); 2013 IEEE Symposium on,2013,3

Heuristics for flash-dissemination in heterogenous networks,Mayur Deshpande; Nalini Venkatasubramanian; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract Flash Dissemination is a particularly useful form of data broadcast that arises inmany mission-critical applications. The goal is rapid distribution of medium amounts of datain as short a time period as possible. While optimal algorithms are available for a highlyconstrained case (all nodes having the same bandwidth and latency); there is relatively littlework in the context of heterogenous networks. Most systems and protocols today either usetrees or randomized mesh-based techniques to deal with heterogeneity and work with localknowledge. We argue that a protocol with global knowledge can perform much better. In thispaper; we propose two centralized heuristics–DIM-Rank and DIM-Time that use globalknowledge to schedule data transfer between nodes.

Supporting internet-of-things analytics in a fog computing platform,Hua-Jun Hong; Pei-Hsuan Tsai; An-Chieh Cheng; Md Yusuf Sarwar Uddin; Nalini Venkatasubramanian; Cheng-Hsin Hsu,Modern IoT analytics are computational and data intensive. Existing analytics are mostlyhosted in cloud data centers; and may suffer from high latency; network congestion; andprivacy issues. In this paper; we design; implement; and evaluate a fog computing platformthat runs analytics in a distributed way on multiple devices; including IoT devices; edgeservers; and data-center servers. We focus on the core optimization problem: makingdeployment decisions to maximize the number of satisfied IoT analytics. We carefullyformulate the deployment problem and design an efficient algorithm; named SSE; to solve it.Moreover; we conduct a detailed measurement study to derive system models of the IoTanalytics based on diverse QoS levels and heterogeneous devices to facilitate the optimaldeployment decisions.

RichNote: Adaptive selection and delivery of rich media notifications to mobile users,Md Yusuf Sarwar Uddin; Vinay Setty; Ye Zhao; Roman Vitenberg; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,In recent years; notification services for social networks; mobile apps; messaging systemsand other electronic services have become truly ubiquitous. When a new content becomesavailable; the service sends an instant notification to the user. When the content is producedin massive quantities; and it includes both large-size media and a lot of meta-information; itgives rise to a major challenge of selecting content to notify about and information to includein such notifications. We tackle three important challenges in realizing rich notificationdelivery:(1) content and presentation utility modeling;(2) notification selection and (3)scheduling of delivery. We consider a number of progressive presentation levels for thecontent. Since utility is subjective and hard to model; we rely on real data and user surveys.We model the content utility by learning from large-scale real world data collected from …,Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS); 2016 IEEE 36th International Conference on,2016,2

On optimizing MMVEs in network-aware clouds,Yu-Siang Huang; Cheng-Hsin Hsu; Magda El Zarki; Aiman Erbad; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract Network operators will soon cooperate with traditional cloud providers to offernetwork-virtualization-based converged cloud services; which are referred to as network-aware clouds. Network-aware clouds allow network operators to share income with Over-The-Top (OTT) providers by providing them with end-to-end network QoS guarantees. ForMMVE providers; leveraging the computation; storage; and communication resourcesoffered by network-aware clouds for the best MMVE QoE levels is crucial to their success. Inthis paper; we point out a main research challenge: optimally placing various fine-grainedMMVE tasks across heterogeneous clouds; which provide diverse computation and storageQoS guarantees (in data centers) and communication QoS guarantees (end-to-end).

Achieving resilience of heterogeneous networks through predictive; formal analysis,Zhijing Qin; Grit Denker; Carolyn Talcott; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract Rapid development and wide deployment of wireless technologies in recent yearshave brought an increasing number and variety of services that are accessible directly frommobile terminals via multiple network access technologies (eg; Ethernet; WiFi; Bluetooth;LTE; etc). A particular traffic flow may go through different kinds of networks; which greatlyincreases the end-to-end connectivity opportunities. However; the disadvantage ofmultinetworks is that a failure or change in one network type may affect many traffic flows.Thus; the various networks in a multinetwork cannot be managed in isolation. Rather weneed methodologies that analyze the effects of changes in these dynamic andheterogeneous network environments in unison.

QuARES: A quality-aware renewable energy-driven sensing framework,Nga Dang; Elaheh Bozorgzadeh; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract Renewable energy technologies have become a promising solution to reduceenergy concerns that arise due to limited battery in wireless sensor networks. While thisenables us to prolong the lifetime of a sensor network (perpetually); the realization ofsustainable sensor platforms is challenging due to the unstable nature of environmentalenergy sources. In this paper; we propose an adaptive energy harvesting managementframework; QuARES; which exploits an application's tolerance to quality degradation toadjust data collection quality based on energy harvesting conditions. The proposedframework consists of two phases: an offline phase which uses prediction of harvestedenergy to allocate energy budget for time slots; and an online phase to tackle fluctuations inthe time-varying energy harvesting profile. We formulate the energy budget allocation …,Sustainable Computing: Informatics and Systems,2012,2
Interoperability of Multiple Autonomous Simulators in Integrated Simulation Environments,Leila Jalali; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,ABSTRACT: In this paper; we propose a methodology for integrating multiple autonomouspre-existing simulation models into an integrated simulation environment. One of the limitationsof the simulators is that they are developed by domain experts who have an in-depth understandingof the phenomena being modelled and typically designed to be executed and evaluatedindependently. Therefore the grand challenge is to facilitate the process of pulling all of independentlycreated models together into an interoperating simulation model where decision makers canexplore different alternatives and conduct low cost experiments. We aim to build such integratedsimulation environments by creating a loosely coupled federation of pre-existing simulators.Unlike the significant code rewrite required in the HLA case; our framework permits individualsimulators to maintain their autonomy (ie retain their internal representations of time/state …,Spring SIW,2011,2
Disruption-tolerant spatial dissemination,Bo Xing; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Spatial dissemination is a specific form of information dissemination that enables mobileusers to send information to other mobile users who are or will appear at a specific location(a user-defined region).

A semantic approach for building pervasive spaces,Daniel Massaguer; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract Large and pervasive sensing; communications; and computing infrastructures areenabling the realization of pervasive spaces. Enabling such spaces; however; encompassesa set of challenges. First; programming each application such that it connects to each sensorand it interprets the data being sensed requires a concentration of expertise that is rarelyavailable. Second; achieving a wise and fair usage of the infrastructures is impossible withcurrent approaches due to their lack of awareness of domain and application semantics.This paper summarizes a PhD dissertation that focuses on designing and implementing amiddleware that addresses these challenges and overcomes the limitations of previousapproaches by featuring a distributed streaming architecture and by being aware of thesemantics of the space and applications.

SURCH: distributed aggregation over wireless sensor networks,Xingbo Yu; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,In this paper; we present SURCH; a novel decentralized algorithm for efficient processing ofqueries generated in sensor networks. Unlike existing techniques; SURCH is fullydistributed and does not require the existence or construction of a communicationinfrastructure. It exploits the broadcast nature of wireless communication to optimize querypropagation and evaluation. In SURCH; partial results are aggregated en route while thequery spreads through the network. The key features of SURCH include its ability to avoidunnecessary communication; balanced node workload; and resilience to node failures.Performance results illustrate that SURCH outperforms alternative techniques for a variety ofaggregation and selection queries,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2006.

Overload-driven mobility-aware cache management in wireless environments,Humeyra Topcu-Altintas; Yun Huang; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,In this paper; we propose a novel cache management strategy that uses the notion of"overload" where overload is defined as a situation when there is insufficient proxy cache fora new incoming user in a mobile region. In an overloaded situation; there will be increasednetwork traffic (since the original server will need to be contacted) and increased servicedelays for mobile hosts (due to cache misses). The proposed techniques attempt todecrease the penalty of overloaded traffic and to reduce the number of remote accesses byincreasing cache hit ratio. Our cache replacement algorithm is holistic in that it considers (i)mobility of the clients;(ii) predicted overloads;(iii) sizes of cached objects and (iv) theiraccess frequencies in determining which object's cache (how much cache space) to bereplaced; and when to replace. Performance results show that our overload-driven cache …,Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Networking & Services; 2006 Third Annual International Conference on,2006,2
QoS-Aware Resource Discovery in Mobile Environments.,Yun Huang; Shivajit Mohapatra; Qi Han; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract In this chapter; we will address the problem of resource discovery that ensuressustained QoS (Quality of Service) for mobile applications. We present two aspects of theresource discovery problem:(i) static resource discovery that determines the best resourcesto service a request when it is initiated;(ii) dynamic resource reprovisioning that continues tofind nearby resources as a mobile client moves arbitrarily. We explain the role of contextinformation in effective resource discovery and discuss what constitutes relevant contextinformation for mobile applications. By introducing a generalized mediation-basedarchitecture; we show how context information is collected and applied to support static anddynamic resource discovery. We illustrate potential solutions to these issues through a casestudy that uses nearby grid resources to support mobile services.,*,2006,2

Dynamic access control for ubiquitous environments,Jehan Wickramasuriya; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract Current ubiquitous computing environments provide many kinds of information. Thisinformation may be accessed by different users under varying conditions depending onvarious contexts (eg location). These ubiquitous computing environments also impose newrequirements on security. The ability for users to access their information in a secure andtransparent manner; while adapting to changing contexts of the spaces they operate in ishighly desirable in these environments. This paper presents a domain-based approach toaccess control in distributed environments with mobile; distributed objects and nodes. Weutilize a slightly different notion of an object's “view”; by linking its context to the stateinformation available to it for access control purposes.

Time-sensitive computation of aggregate functions over distributed imprecise data,Qi Han; M Ba Nguyen; Sandy Irani; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Summary form only given. Many distributed applications in the real world now require realtime services in which aggregate queries need to be computed over a set of values. Theseapplications can often tolerate varying degrees of inaccuracy in the results. Systemdesigners; on the other hand; would like to provide services with low inaccuracy andminimal management overhead. We focus on addressing the tradeoffs between timeliness;accuracy and cost for data aggregation in distributed environments. Specifically; we addressthe problem of time-sensitive computation of aggregate queries (count; sum and min) over aset of values represented by intervals with lower and upper bounds. These intervals areapproximations based on most recent values about distributed sources.

Server Transcoding of Multimedia Data for Cross-Disability Access,Vidhya Balasubramanian; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Multimedia transmission over wide-area networks currently only considers the server andnetwork resource constraints and client device capabilities. It is also essential that theaccessibility of the multimedia content for different users with diverse capabilities anddisabilities be considered. In this paper we develop a transcoding technique to present themultimedia content to suit diverse disabled user groups by using an ability basedclassification approach. Using ability-based prioritization; the appropriate alternatemodalities and quality levels are chosen to replace the inaccessible modalities. Thetranscoding process allows for refinements to cater to specific types and degrees ofimpairments.

Controlling Mobile Robots with Distributed Neuro-Biological Systems,Alfredo Weitzenfeld; Sebastian Gutierrez-Nolasco; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract—Nature has always been a source of inspiration in the development ofautonomous robotic systems. As such; the study of animal behavior (ethology) and the studyof the underlying neural structure responsible for behavior (neuroethology) have inspiredmany robotic designs. In general; the complexity of these behaviors has a direct impact onrobot efficiency. For example; behaviors involving neural network based adaptation andlearning can become very inefficient under real-time processing constraints. To overcomethese constraints; autonomous mobile robots need either powerful hardware; oralternatively; have to be linked to distributed grid-like computer networks using wirelesscommunication. While the first approach simplifies the overall robotic architecture; it resultsin larger and more expensive robots. On the other hand; the second approach results in …,Proc. AINS,2003,2

Such” convergecast” communication is becoming increasingly relevant insensor monitoring and pervasive sensing applications. An important aspect of enablingaccurate collection is to ensure small delays in the collection process.

First we select the most utility-awareencoding and decoding parameters for videos of different motion levels through extensiveoffline profiling and analysis. Then we design a feedback algorithm to adaptively applydifferent coding parameters while monitoring the system performance online during a videocall. To minimize energy consumption; we utilize Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling(DVFS) for the CPU and buffered transmissions for the network. Our experimental resultsshow an effective saving on energy consumption; with on average 52% savings on the CPUand 30% on the wireless network; while still maintaining high quality service.,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Multimedia,2011,1
Protecting personal data from untrusted web-based data services,Ravi Chandra Jammalamadaka; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Our society places a heavy emphasis on security and the privacy of personal data. Personaldata at the hands of a malicious entity could spell disastrous consequences for the data'sowner. There is a whole slew of attacks on the Internet aimed at procuring and misusingpersonal information for profit. 1; 2 And so; recently; there has been a huge thrust towardsdeveloping technologies that protect personal data from being misused. 3; 4 Governmentsacross the world are passing laws to protect personal information. 5 Outsourcing personalinformation to web-based data services (WDS) is a common recent trend. These serviceshave become very popular; but they require us to trust the service provider and may bevulnerable to both outsider and insider attacks.

Partially Protected Caches to Reduce Failures due to Soft Errors in Mission-Critical Multimedia Systems,Kyoungwoo Lee; Aviral Shrivastava; Ilya Issenin; Nikil Dutt; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract With advances in process technology; soft errors are becoming an increasinglycritical design concern. Soft errors are manifested as a toggle in Boolean logic; which mayresult in failure of the system functionality. Owing to their large area; high density; and lowoperating voltages; caches are worst hit by soft errors. Although Error Correction Code(ECC) based mechanisms have been suggested to protect the data in caches; they havehigh performance and power overheads. We observe that in multimedia applications; not alldata require the same amount of protection from soft errors. In fact; an error in the multimediadata itself does not result in a failure; but often just results in a slight loss of quality of service.Thus; it is possible to trade-off the power and performance overheads of soft error protectionwith quality of service. To this end; we propose a Partially Protected Cache (PPC) …,Center for Embedded Computer Systems,2008,1

In this system; accesscontrol policies specify the access rights of individuals to different regions of the monitoredspace. Policy violations (detected via use of localization sensors such as RFID tags; motiondetection; etc.) are used to trigger the video surveillance subsystem. Video manipulationtechniques such as masking are used to preserve the privacy of authorized subjects whenthe surveillance system is turned on. The novel facet of this system is the integration ofsensor technology (namely RFID) with a video surveillance subsystem.,*,2008,1
A semantic model for safe protocol interaction,Sebastian Gutierrez-Nolasco; Nalini Venkatasubramanian; Carolyn Talcott,Abstract Most communication subsystems support modular and reconfigurablecommunication protocols based on the Lego block model. In this model; complex protocolsare built as collections of simpler protocols. However; protocol behavior is often expressedvia informal descriptions and few work has been done to develop the underlying semanticsthat enables us to model and reason about protocol interactions. Without it; it is very difficultto identify critical properties that must be met for correct operation. In this paper we present acommunication framework based on a semantic model of distributed object reflection andwe illustrate how this model can be used to formalize and reason about interactionsbetween communication protocols. We evaluate the overhead and feasibility of ourapproach by developing an abstract executable specification of the communication …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2006,1

In this paper; we propose a new power-aware error resilient coding scheme based on network error probability and userexpectation in video communication using mobile handheld devices. By considering bothimage content and network conditions; we can achieve a fast recoverable and energy-efficient error resilient coding scheme.

Introduction to the 3rd Workshop on Adaptive and Reflective Middleware (RM2004),Nanbor Wang; Fabio M Costa; Angelo Corsaro; Geoffrey Coulson; Nalini Venkatasubramanian; Renato Cerqueira; Richard Staehli,Most of the middleware used and developed today is characterised by its inﬂexibility inadapting to different target environments and application areas. This lack of adaptabilityusually comes from the fact that middleware is traditionally built as a single monolithic entity.This inﬂexibility usually can be characterised by either the inability to adapt the behaviour ofthe platform; the inability to adapt its structure; or even both. In application domains such asmobile computing; distributed multimedia; and distributed real-time and embedded (DRE)systems; where resources are both constrained and variable in time; having the ability toreconﬁgure the middleware in order to optimise the resource usage and/or provide thedesired quality of service (QoS) becomes a key feature.

Controlling Mobile Robots with Distributed Neuro-Biological Systems,Sebastian Gutierrez-Nolasco; Nalini Venkatasubramanian; Alfredo Weitzenfeld,Abstract—Nature has always been a source of inspiration in the development ofautonomous robotic systems. As such; the study of animal behavior (ethology) and the studyof the underlying neural structure responsible for behavior (neuroethology) have inspiredmany robotic designs. In general; the complexity of these behaviors has a direct impact onrobot efficiency. For example; behaviors involving neural network based adaptation andlearning can become very inefficient under real-time processing constraints. To overcomethese constraints; autonomous mobile robots need either powerful hardware; oralternatively; have to be linked to distributed grid-like computer networks using wirelesscommunication. While the first approach simplifies the overall robotic architecture; it resultsin larger and more expensive robots. On the other hand; the second approach results in …,Proceedings of the 2 nd Annual Symposium on Autonomous Intelligent Networks and Systems,2003,1
Programming Ubiquitous and Mobile Computing Applications with the TOTA Middleware,Marco Mamei; Franco Zambonelli; Letizia Leonardi,Such a scenario introduces peculiar and challenging requirements in the development ofdistributed software systems. Because new agents (we use this term generically to indicate adistributed application's active components) can depart out of and arrive into the network atany time and roam across different environments; applications must be able to deal withsuch activity adaptively and independently. In addition; the activities of software systems areoften contextual-that is; closely connected to the setting (for example; location; time; orenvironment) in which the systems execute. Setting/contextual characteristics are typically apriori unknown and thus require dynamic enforcement of context awareness.,Middleware Conference,2003,1
Distributed Multimedia Streaming in a Heterogeneous Environment,Radu Cornea; Shivajit Mohapatra; Nikil Dutt; Alex Nicolau; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract Streaming multimedia content to heterogeneous handheld devices is a significantresearch challenge; due to the diverse computation capabilities and battery lifetimes ofthese devices. A unified framework that integrates low level architectural optimizations(CPU; memory); OS power-saving mechanisms (Dynamic Voltage Scaling) and adaptivemiddleware techniques (admission control; transcoding; network traffic regulation) canprovide significant improvements in both the system performance and user experience. Inthis paper; we present such an integrated framework and investigate the trade-offs involvedin serving distributed clients simultaneously; while maintaining acceptable QoS levels foreach client. We show that the power savings attained at both CPU/memory and networklevels can be aggregated for increased overall performance. Based on this; we …,*,2003,1

Adaptation of Multimedia Data for Cross-Disability Access,Vidhya Balasubramanian; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,ABSTRACT Multimedia transmission over wide-area networks currently only considers theserver and network resource constraints and client device capabilities. It is also essentialthat the accessibility of the multimedia content for different users with diverse capabilitiesand disabilities be considered. As a first step in building an adaptation framework we needto automatically predict the accessibility requirements of a user; given the abilities the userpossesses to access the multimedia information. In this paper we develop an adaptationtechnique to present the multimedia content to suit diverse disabled user groups by using anability based classification approach. Using ability-based prioritization; appropriate alternatemodalities and quality levels are chosen; to replace the inaccessible modalities.

Semi-continuous transmission for cluster-based video servers,Sandy Irani; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract With advances in storage technology; the ability to provide client end storage forcontinuous media applications has become a possibility. Transmission of data in clusterbased multimedia environments can be semi-continuous in conjunction with client sidebuffering and staging. Experiments indicate that a client buffer size (staging degree) of 20percent (of object size) is near optimal for most objects. The work presented in this paperalso addresses the implications of semi-continuous transmission to placement andadmission control mechanisms in a cluster-based multimedia server. We improve admissioncontrol by introducing a technique called dynamic request migration in clusterbasedmultimedia servers that is enabled by client staging. Simulation studies demonstrate thatclose to maximum utilization can be achieved even if at most one migration within the …,Cluster Computing; 2001.

A Reflective Framework for Providing Safe QoS-enabled Customizable Middleware,Nalini Venkatasubramanian; Carolyn Talcott,Open Distributed Systems (ODS) evolve dynamically and components of ODS interact withan environment that is not under their control. Managing change efficiently is critical to theeffective deployment of applications executing in such environments; reflection helps dealwith the need for flexibility. A wide range of protocols and activities must executeconcurrently and non-disruptively; and must share resources. In order to avoid resourceconflicts; deadlocks; inconsistencies and incorrect execution semantics; the underlyingresource management system must ensure that the concurrent system activities compose ina correct manner.

Multimedia fog computing: minions in the cloud and crowd,Cheng-Hsin Hsu; Hua-Jun Hong; Tarek Elgamal; Klara Nahrstedt; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract In cloud computing; minions refer to virtual or physical machines that carry out theactual workload. Minions in the cloud hide in faraway data centers and thus cloud computingis less friendly to multimedia applications. The fog computing paradigm pushes minionstoward edge networks. We adopt a generalized definition; where minions get into enddevices owned by the crowd. The serious uncertainty; such as dynamic network conditions;limited battery levels; and unpredictable minion availability in multimedia fog platformsmakes them harder to be managed than cloud platforms. In this chapter; we share ourexperience on utilizing resources from the crowd to optimize multimedia applications. Thelearned lessons shed some light on the optimal design of a unified multimedia fog platformfor distributed multimedia applications.,Frontiers of Multimedia Research,2017,*

Ubiquitous and free WiFiaccess is unavailable in most developing cities; IoT deployments must leverage 3G cellularconnections that are expensive and metered. In order to best utilize the limited 3G data plan;we envision two adaptation strategies to drive sensing and sensemaking. The first techniqueis an infrastructure-level adaptation approach where we adjust sensing intervals of periodicsensors so that the data volume remains bounded within the plan. The second approach isat the information-level where application-specific analytics are deployed on board devices(or the edge) through container technologies (Docker and Kubernetes); the use case …,Proceedings of the 16th Workshop on Adaptive and Reflective Middleware,2017,*

Toenable trade-off analysis across multiple layers of abstraction and predict the possibleproperty violations as the system evolves dynamically over time; an executable formalspecification is developed for each layer of the system under consideration. The formalspecification is then analyzed using statistical analysis; to determine the impact of variouspolicies for achieving a variety of end-to-end properties in a quantifiable manner. Theintegration of formal analysis with dynamic behavior from system execution results in afeedback loop that enables model refinement and further optimization of policies andparameters.

Distributed Multimedia Streaming in a Heterogeneous Environment,Radu Cornea Shivajit; Radu Cornea; Shivajit Mohapatra; Nikil Dutt; Alex Nicolau; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract Streaming multimedia content to heterogeneous handheld devices is a significantresearch challenge; due to the diverse computation capabilities and battery lifetimes ofthese devices. A unified framework that integrates low level architectural optimizations(CPU; memory); OS power-saving mechanisms (Dynamic Voltage Scaling) and adaptivemiddleware techniques (admission control; transcoding; network tra# c regulation) canprovide significant improvements in both the system performance and user experience. Inthis paper; we present such an integrated framework and investigate the trade-o# s involvedin serving distributed clients simultaneously; while maintaining acceptable QoS levels foreach client. We show that the power savings attained at both CPU/memory and networklevels can be aggregated for increased overall performance. Based on this; we …,*,2007,*

Compiler-Assisted Partially Protected Caches against Soft-Error Failures for Multimedia Applications,Kyoungwoo Lee; Aviral Shrivastava; Ilya Issenin; Nikil Dutt; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract With advances in process technology; soft errors (SE) are becoming an increasinglycritical design concern. Soft errors are manifested as a toggle in Boolean logic; which mayresult in failure of the system functionality. Owing to their large area and high density; cachesare worst hit by soft errors. Although Error Correction Code based mechanisms have beensuggested to protect the data in caches; they have high performance and power overheads.Multimedia applications are becoming popular in embedded systems with help oftechnology advances; and are being used for critical missions where reliability and energyare important. Our observations that 1) the seriousness of consequences of soft errors inapplication data may differ significantly; and 2) soft errors in multimedia data typically do notcause serious faults and cause only degradation of QoS; motivates us to propose a …,*,2006,*

Device Independent Remote Adaptations for Power Optimization using Distributed Middleware,Shivajit Mohapatra; Christopher Bell; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract Providing quality of service (QoS) guarantees for power vs. performance tradeoffs indistributed middleware frameworks is a crucial research challenge. Future middlewareframeworks need to address the issue of providing acceptable performance guarantees inthe presence of low-power mobile devices. Most current energy optimization schemes (egDVS) target individual processing elements (nodes) and lack a global view of the distributedsystem; therefore the inherent advantages of distribution remains unharnessed. In this work;we introduce a middleware based distributed dynamic voltage scaling scheme (R-DVS) forvoltage setting in distributed nodes remotely; while exploiting the knowledge of the globalsystem state. To further optimize the power gains at the devices; an optimal task partitioningand offloading scheme is integrated with R-DVS.

Co-optimization of Streaming Multimedia QOS and Backlight Power Consumption for Mobile Handheld Devices,Sudeep Pasricha; Shivajit Mohapatra; Manev Luthra; Nikil Dutt; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract Mobile handheld devices have stringent constraints on power consumptionbecause they run on batteries that have a limited lifetime. Conserving power to prolongbattery life is of primary importance for these devices. Several factors such as backlightintensity; the hard disk; the CPU; the network interface and the nature of the applicationcontribute significantly towards power consumption for a mobile device. While significantresearch effort has been made to optimize power consumption at the application; networkand processor levels; comparatively little work has been done to reduce or adapt to thepower consumed by the backlight. We propose an adaptive middleware based approach tooptimize backlight power consumption for mobile handheld devices when playing streamingMPEG-1 video; without significantly compromising on video quality.

Event Based Approach to Situational Representation,Dmitri V Kalashnikov Dawit Seid Yiming; Ma Naveen Ashish Sharad Mehrotra Nalini; Venkatasubramanian Cal,ABSTRACT Many application domains require representing interrelated real-world activitiesand/or evolving physical phenomena. In the crisis response domain; for instance; one maybe interested in representing the state of the unfolding crisis (eg; forest fire); the progress ofthe response activities such as evacuation and traffic control; and the state of the crisis site(s). Such a situation representation can then be used to support multitude of applicationsincluding situation monitoring; analysis; and planning. In this paper; we make a case for anevent based representation of situations where events are defined to be domain-specificsignificant occurrences in space and time. We argue that events offer a unifying andpowerful abstraction to building situational awareness applications.

Placement Strategies of Intermittently Available Environments,Yun Huang; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract In this paper; we address the problem of data placement in a grid based multimediaenvironment; where the resource providers; ie servers; are intermittently available. The goalis to optimize the system performance by admitting maximum number of users into thesystem while ensuring user Quality of Service (QoS). Effective utilization of storageresources is key for providing continuous availability of data to end-users despite serverdowntimes. We define and formulate various placement strategies that determine the degreeof replication necessary for video objects by using a cost-based optimization procedurebased on a priori predictions of expected subscriber requests under various time-mapscenarios and QoS demands. We also devise methods for dereplication of videos based onchanges in popularity and server usage patterns. Our performance results indicate the …,*,*,*
Adaptive EE-PBPAIR: A Novel Error-Exploiting Video Encoder Incorporating End-to-End QoS Feedback,Kyoungwoo Lee Minyoung Kim Nikil Dutt; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract Energy/QoS provisioning is challenging for video applications over the lossywireless network with power-constrained mobile handheld devices. In this context; we payattention to the inherent error-tolerance of video data that can provide opportunities togenerate a range of acceptable operating points by controlling the amount of errors in thesystem. This expanded tradeoff space allows systems to comparatively evaluate differentoperating points with varying QoS and energy consumption by aggressively exploiting error-resilience attributes; and can potentially result in significant energy savings. Specifically; wepropose an error-aware video encoding technique–EE-PBPAIR–that purposely injectserrors while ensuring QoS in accordance with error-resilient feature. The novelty of ourapproach resides in active exploitation of errors to vary the operating conditions for further …,*,*,*

A Distributed Reconfigurable Middleware Framework for Energy Optimization in Low Power Mobile Devices,Shivajit Mohapatra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract In distributed environments; generic middleware services (eg caching; locationmanagement etc.) are widely used to satisfy application needs in a cost-effective manner.Such middleware services consume system resources such as storage; computation andcommunication and can be sources of significant power overheads when executed on low-power devices. In this paper; we present and evaluate a methodology for optimizing thepower consumption of low-power portable devices using a reflective and customizablemiddleware framework. Specifically; we determine when middleware components can bedynamically migrated away from a low-power device while preserving their semantics; inorder to maximize the remaining service time for the device. We design and evaluate agraph theoretic approach for dynamically determining middleware component …,*,*,*
Adaptive Protocol Management in Resource Constrained Devices,Mark Panahi; Sebastian Gutierrez-Nolasco; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract—This paper focuses on techniques to achieve dy-namic adaptation in the presenceof device resource constraints. Specifically; we focus on achieving adaptive communicationusing dynamically constructed protocol stacks that allow applications to adapt toenvironmental and device changes with minimal resources. In the presence of resourceconstraints; we achieve this adaptation by dynamic switching of communication protocols tomost effectively manage the limited device resources. Specifically; we propose 2 techniques;a simple demand-based strategy and a more sophisticated frontier based approach todetermine which protocols to install/uninstall and when to trigger replacement. Intelligentprotocol switching policies must also take into account protocol dependencies; we illustratehow this can be integrated efficiently into our algorithms. Our performance studies …,*,*,*
Towards Energy Efficiency and Reliability on Mobile Systems,Kyoungwoo Lee; Nikil Dutt; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract Power management is truely inevitable on mobile computers due to limited battery.On the other hand; reliability is critical in mobile applications since mobile computers arefailure-prone mainly because of resource constraint and lossy network. However; to the bestof our knowledge; the relationship between energy limitation and fault tolerance has beenneither widely recognized nor adequately addressed in many of prior works. Further power-aware approaches and reliability techniques usually are accomplished at each layer notacross layers from hardware to application. In this paper; we explore from generalized fault-tolerance techniques to efforts to increase reliability at each layer; review from basic powermanagement approaches to cooperated power-efficient schemes across systems; andinvestigate how to reconsider and coordinate two issues; reliability and power; to make a …,*,*,*
Reliable Dissemination of Mission-Critical Content over Heterogeneous Wireless Networks,Bo Xing; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,In recent years; situational awareness in emergency response and military domains haveattracted unprecedented attention. One important operation for realizing such situationalawareness is content dissemination; ie; the distribution of situation-related information tosome or all participants (an example scenario is illustrated in Fig. 1). Its key characteristicsare the following–(i) participants scattered around the mission site may have limitedinfrastructure access and the connectivity between one another might be intermittent;(ii) anyparticipant carrying a mobile device can be a producer of information and start adissemination;(iii) the information can be rich in content (eg; in the form of images; voice;video; etc.) and have strong temporal and/or spatial relevance (ie; may be of no use outsidea certain geographical region and/or after a specific time point).(iv) Reliability and …,*,*,*

A Semantic Framework for Modeling and Reasoning about Reflective Middleware: The Logger Example,Nalini Venkatasubramanian; Carolyn L Talcott,Abstract In a distributed reflective framework; issues of correctness and composition can bequite subtle and complex. Interactions within and across reflective levels must beconsidered; the semantics of shared; distributed resources must be clearly spelled out; andnew notions of correctness of the overall system need to be developed that account for thedynamic; distributed; and reflective setting. TLAM is a two-level model of distributedcomputation based on the actor model of objectbased distributed computation that supportsdynamic customizability and separation of concerns in designing and reasoning aboutcomponents of Open Distributed Systems. The TLAM uses reification (base object state asdata at the meta object level) and reflection (modification of base object state by metaobjects) with support for implicit invocation of meta objects in response to changes of …,*,*,*

Multilevel Access Control for Environments with Object & Node Mobility,Jehan Wickramasuriya; Nalini Venkatasubramanian; Carolyn L Talcott,Abstract The need for addressing security concerns in mobile; distributed environments iswell known. However; providing security mechanisms at the application layer is usuallyinsufficient; especially when considering object-oriented (OO) systems. This paper presentsa domain-based approach to access control in a distributed environment with mobile objectsand nodes. The dynamic nature and semantic diversity of OO systems make it difficult toensure information security and integrity via traditional access control methods. One of thechallenges we tackle in this work is that of hiding sensitive information in insecureenvironments; by providing objects in the system a'view'of their state information; andsubsequently managing this view. We present a middleware-based architecture forproviding access control in such an environment and view-sensitive mechanisms for …,*,*,*
A Reflective Architecture for Cellular Networks,Xingbo Yu; Iosif Lazaridis; Jinsu Wang; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian; Babak Jafarian,ABSTRACT The rapid growth of cellular telephony; the portability of cell phone devices; andthe imminent realization of cell phone localization technologies represent a greatopportunity for crisis management applications. Inasmuch as connectivity is maintainedduring the crisis; cell phone users may receive real-time spatially-relevant instructions fromauthorities; helping them survive and function within the crisis region. Cellular infrastructurealso enables collecting relevant on-site crisis related information from human informants.While the implications are enormous; cellular infrastructures as they exist today; do notprovide a reliable and scalable platform to realizing the potential. It is well documented inthe literature that the cellular services are amongst the first to fail both due to the collapse ofinfrastructure or the paucity of resources needed to meet surge in demands.

Mitigating the Impact of Hardware Failures on Multimedia Applications–A Cross-Layer Approach,Kyoungwoo Lee; Aviral Shrivastava; Minyoung Kim; Nikil Dutt; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,ABSTRACT Increasing exponentially with each technology generation; hardwareinducedsoft errors pose a significant threat for the reliability of mobile multimedia devices. Sincetraditional hardware error protection techniques incur significant power and performanceoverheads; this paper proposes a cross-layer cooperative approach that exploits existingerror control schemes at the application layer to mitigate the impact of hardware defects.Specifically; we propose Error Detection Codes in hardware; Drop and Forward Recovery inmiddleware; and error-resilient video encoding at the application level to effectively andefficiently combat soft errors with minimal overheads. Experimental evaluation on standardtest video streams demonstrates that our cooperative erroraware method for video encodingimproves performance by 60% and energy consumption by 58% with even better …,*,*,*
Exploiting Quality/Performance Tradeoffs in Sensor Network Applications,Xingbo Yu; Koushik Niyogi; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract Recent advances in processor; memory and radio technology have enabled cheapnodes capable of sensing; communicating and processing. Networks of distributedmicrosensors are rapidly emerging as a feasible solution to a wide range of data gatheringapplications. However; the key impediments to successful deployment of microsensor nodesare their energy and longevity constraints. We propose a middleware framework for energyaware information collection in sensor networks with a focus on tracking applications. Theproposed framework explores the trade-off between energy and application quality tosignificantly reduce energy consumption in the sensor network thereby enhancing thelifetime of a sensor node. We also show that using prediction models in our architectureprovides further gains in energy conservation and reduction in transmission costs over …,*,*,*

Towards Soft Errors,Kyoungwoo Lee; Nikil Dutt; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract This document deals with the causes and effects of single energetic particle onadvanced microelectronics called SEE (Single-Event Effects). SEE can be classified intohard errors such as SEL (Singl-Event Latchup) and SEB (Single-Event Burnout); and softerrors like SEU (Single-Event Upset) and SET (Single-Event Transient). Hard errors arepermanent; ie; they remains active permanently; so hardware redundancy such as TripleModular Redundancy can recover them usually. On the other hand; soft errors can betolerated by most redundancy techniques like temporal redundancy; data redundancy andsoftware as well as hardware redundancy since resetting or rewriting the devices restoresnormal behavior thereafter. Transient faults (soft errors) are our main interests so thisdocument focuses on the sources; mechanisms and trends with an advance of …,*,*,*

Exploiting Semantics for Sensor Re-Calibration in Event Detection Systems [long],Ronen Vaisenberg; Shengyue Ji; Bijit Hore; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,ABSTRACT Event detection from a video stream is becoming an important and challengingtask in surveillance and sentient systems. While computer vision has been extensivelystudied to solve different kinds of detection problems over time; it is still a hard problem andeven in a controlled environment only simple events can be detected with a high degree ofaccuracy. Instead of struggling to improve event detection using image processing only; webring in semantics to direct traditional image processing. Semantics are the underlying factsthat hide beneath video frames; which can not be “seen” directly by image processing. In thiswork we demonstrate that time sequence semantics can be exploited to guide unsupervisedre-calibration of the event detection system. We present an instantiation of our ideas byusing an appliance as an example-Coffee Pot level detection based on video datato …,*,*,*

A MetaArchitecture for QoS-Based Distributed Resource Management,Nalini Venkatasubramanian; Gul Agha; Carolyn Talcott,Abstract Systems that provide distributed multimedia services are subject to constantevolution-customizable middleware is required to effectively manage this change. In thispaper we develop a meta-architectural framework for customizable QoS-based middlewareusing Actors; a model of concurrent active objects. Middleware services for resourcemanagement execute concurrently with each other and with application activities—scheduling; protocols providing security and reliability; load balancing and streamsynchronization can therefore potentially interfere with each other. To ensure cost-effectiveQoS in distributed multimedia systems; safe composability of resource managementservices is essential. For instance; system protocols and activities must not cause arbitrarydelays in the presence of timing based QoS constraints. Using TLAM; a semantic model …,*,*,*
Multilevel Access Control for Ubiquitous Environments,Jehan Wickramasuriya; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract—This paper presents a domain-based approach to access control in distributedenvironments with mobile objects and nodes.

In this work; we tackle the problem of hiding sensitive information in insecureenvironments by providing objects in the system a view of their state information; andsubsequently managing this view. Combining access control requirements and multilevelsecurity with mobile and contextual requirements of active objects allow us to re-evaluatesecurity considerations for mobile objects.

A Formal Methods Approach to Adaptive Secure Group Communication,Sebastian Gutierrez-Nolasco; Nalini Venkatasubramanian; Mark-Oliver Stehr; Carolyn Talcott,Abstract—Traditionally; adaptability in communication frame-works has been restricted topredefined choices without taking into consideration tradeoffs between them and theapplication requirements. Furthermore; different applications with an entire spectrum ofrequirements will have to adapt to these predefined choices instead of tailoring thecommunication framework to fit their needs. In this paper we extend an executablespecification of a state-of-the-art secure group communication subsystem to explore twodimensions of adaptability; namely security and synchrony. In particular; we relax thetraditional requirement of virtual synchrony (a well-known bottleneck) and propose variousgeneric optimizations; while preserving essential security guarantees.,*,*,*

Privacy-Preserving Triggers for Pervasive Spaces,Jehan Wickramasuriya; Mahesh Datt; Bijit Hore; Stanislaw Jarecki; Sharad Mehrotra; Nalini Venkatasubramanian,Abstract. Providing pervasive services often necessitates gathering information aboutindividuals that may be considered sensitive. Often; one is forced to make a difficult choice:either to risk loss of privacy or to let go of the benefits pervasive technology offers. Ourconjecture is that such a choice is not always necessary. It is possible to design datacollection strategies in such a way that services offered by pervasive environments do notcome at the expense of individuals' privacy. Specifically; we consider a trigger-basedpervasive environment in which end-user services are built using triggers over eventsdetected through sensors. Privacy concerns in such a pervasive space are analogous todisclosure and misuse of event logs. We use cryptographic techniques to prevent loss ofprivacy; but that raises a fundamental challenge of evaluating triggers over the encrypted …,*,*,*
