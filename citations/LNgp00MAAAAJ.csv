Cell surface Trk receptors mediate NGF-induced survival while internalized receptors regulate NGF-induced differentiation,Yan-zhen Zhang; Daniel B Moheban; Bevil R Conway; Anita Bhattacharyya; Rosalind A Segal,Internalization and transport of a ligand-receptor complex are required to initiate cell bodyresponses to target-derived neurotrophin. However; it is not known whether internalizedreceptors and cell surface receptors initiate the same signaling pathways and biologicalresponses. Here we use a temperature-sensitive mutant of dynamin (G273D) to control thesubcellular localization of activated NGF receptors (Trks). We show that dynamin function isrequired for ligand-dependent endocytosis of Trk receptors. In PC12 cells; nerve growthfactor (NGF) stimulation promotes both survival and neuronal differentiation. These distinctbiological responses to NGF are controlled by receptors signaling from different locationswithin the cell. Neuronal differentiation is promoted by catalytically active Trks withinendosomes in the cell interior. In contrast; survival responses are initiated by activated …,Journal of Neuroscience,2000,331
Spatial structure of cone inputs to color cells in alert macaque primary visual cortex (V-1),Bevil R Conway,The spatial structure of color cell receptive fields is controversial. Here; spots of light thatselectively modulate one class of cones (L; M; or S; or loosely red; green; or blue) wereflashed in and around the receptive fields of V-1 color cells to map the spatial structure of thecone inputs. The maps generated using these cone-isolating stimuli and an eye-position-corrected reverse correlation technique produced four findings. First; the receptive fieldswere Double-Opponent; an organization of spatial and chromatic opponency critical for colorconstancy and color contrast. Optimally stimulating both center and surround subregionswith adjacent red and green spots excited the cells more than stimulating a singlesubregion. Second; red–green cells responded in a luminance-invariant way. For example;red-on-center cells were excited equally by a stimulus that increased L-cone activity …,Journal of Neuroscience,2001,241
Specialized color modules in macaque extrastriate cortex,Bevil R Conway; Sebastian Moeller; Doris Y Tsao,Summary Imaging studies are consistent with the existence of brain regions specialized forcolor; but electrophysiological studies have produced conflicting results. Here we addressthe neural basis for color; using targeted single-unit recording in alert macaque monkeys;guided by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the same subjects. Distributedwithin posterior inferior temporal cortex; a large region encompassing V4; PITd; andposterior TEO that some have proposed functions as a single visual complex; we found color-biased fMRI hotspots that we call “globs;” each several millimeters wide. Almost all cellslocated in globs showed strong luminance-invariant color tuning and some shape selectivity.Cells in different globs represented distinct visual field locations; consistent with the coarseretinotopy of this brain region. Cells in “interglob” regions were not color tuned; but were …,Neuron,2007,167
Toward a unified theory of visual area V4,Anna W Roe; Leonardo Chelazzi; Charles E Connor; Bevil R Conway; Ichiro Fujita; Jack L Gallant; Haidong Lu; Wim Vanduffel,Visual area V4 is a midtier cortical area in the ventral visual pathway. It is crucial for visualobject recognition and has been a focus of many studies on visual attention. However; thereis no unifying view of V4's role in visual processing. Neither is there an understanding ofhow its role in feature processing interfaces with its role in visual attention. This reviewcaptures our current knowledge of V4; largely derived from electrophysiological and imagingstudies in the macaque monkey. Based on recent discovery of functionally specific domainsin V4; we propose that the unifying function of V4 circuitry is to enable selective extraction ofspecific functional domain-based networks; whether it be by bottom-up specification ofobject features or by top-down attentionally driven selection.,*,2012,140
Color vision; cones; and color-coding in the cortex,Bevil R Conway,Color processing begins with the absorption of light by cone photoreceptors; and progressesthrough a series of hierarchical stages: Retinal signals carrying color information aretransmitted through the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (LGN) up to the primaryvisual cortex (V1). From V1; the signals are processed by the second visual area (V2); thenby cells located in subcompartments (“globs”) within the posterior inferior temporal (PIT)cortex; a brain region that encompasses area V4 and brain regions immediately anterior toV4. Color signals are then processed by regions deep within the inferior temporal (IT) cortexincluding area TE. As a heuristic; one can consider each of these stages to be involved inconstructing a distinct aspect of the color percept. The three cone types are the basis fortrichromacy; retinal ganglion cells that respond in an opponent fashion to activation of …,*,2009,121
Spatial and temporal properties of cone signals in alert macaque primary visual cortex,Bevil R Conway; Margaret S Livingstone,Neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus cannot perform the spatial color calculationsnecessary for color contrast and color constancy. Under neutral-adapting conditions; wemapped the cone inputs (L; M; and S) to 83 cone-opponent cells representing the centralvisual field of the next stage of visual processing; primary visual cortex (V1); to determinehow the color signals are spatially transformed. Cone-opponent cells; constituting∼ 10% ofV1 cells; formed two populations; red–green (L vs M; 66 of 83) and blue–yellow (S vs L+ M;17 of 83). Many cone-opponent cells (48 of 83) were double-opponent; with circularreceptive-field centers and crescent-shaped surrounds (0.63° offset) that had oppositechromatic tuning to the centers and a time-to-peak 11 ms later than the centers. Theremaining cone-opponent cells were either spatially opponent in only one cone system …,Journal of Neuroscience,2006,118
Advances in color science: from retina to behavior,Bevil R Conway; Soumya Chatterjee; Greg D Field; Gregory D Horwitz; Elizabeth N Johnson; Kowa Koida; Katherine Mancuso,Color has become a premier model system for understanding how information is processedby neural circuits; and for investigating the relationships among genes; neural circuits; andperception. Both the physical stimulus for color and the perceptual output experienced ascolor are quite well characterized; but the neural mechanisms that underlie thetransformation from stimulus to perception are incompletely understood. The past severalyears have seen important scientific and technical advances that are changing ourunderstanding of these mechanisms. Here; and in the accompanying minisymposium; wereview the latest findings and hypotheses regarding color computations in the retina; primaryvisual cortex; and higher-order visual areas; focusing on non-human primates; a model ofhuman color vision.,Journal of Neuroscience,2010,100
Neural basis for unique hues,Cleo M Stoughton; Bevil R Conway,Summary All colors can be described in terms of four non-reducible 'unique'hues: red;green; yellow; and blue [1]. These four hues are also the most common 'focal'colors—thebest examples of color terms in language [2]. The significance of the unique hues has beenrecognized since at least the 14 th century [3] and is universal [4; 5]; although there is someindividual variation [6; 7]. Psychophysical linking hypotheses predict an explicit neuralrepresentation of unique hues at some stage of the visual system; but no suchrepresentation has been described [8]. The special status of the unique hues “remains oneof the central mysteries of color science”[9]. Here we report that a population of recentlyidentified cells in posterior inferior temporal cortex of macaque monkey contains an explicitrepresentation of unique hues.,Current Biology,2008,86
Color architecture in alert macaque cortex revealed by FMRI,Bevil R Conway; Doris Y Tsao,Abstract The contribution that different brain areas make to primate color vision; especially inthe macaque; is debated. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging in the alertmacaque; giving a whole brain perspective of color processing in the healthy brain. Weidentified color-biased and luminance-biased activity and color-afterimage activity. Color-biased activity was found in V1; V2; and parts of V4 and not in V3a; MT; or other dorsalstream areas; in which a luminance bias predominated. Color-biased activity and color-afterimage activity were also found in a region on the posterior bank of the superior temporalsulcus. We review anatomical and physiological studies that describe this region; PITd; andpostulate that it is distinct from areas V4 and TEO. When taken together with single-unitstudies and lesion studies; our results suggest that color depends on a connected ventral …,Cerebral Cortex,2005,85
Neural basis for a powerful static motion illusion,Bevil R Conway; Akiyoshi Kitaoka; Arash Yazdanbakhsh; Christopher C Pack; Margaret S Livingstone,Most people see movement in Figure 1; although the image is static. Motion is seen fromblack→ blue→ white→ yellow→ black. Many hypotheses for the illusory motion have beenproposed; although none have been tested physiologically. We found that the illusion workswell even if it is achromatic: yellow is replaced with light gray; and blue is replaced with darkgray. We show that the critical feature for inducing illusory motion is the luminancerelationship of the static elements. Illusory motion is seen from black→ dark gray→ white→light gray→ black. In psychophysical experiments; we found that all four pairs of adjacentelements when presented alone each produced illusory motion consistent with the originalillusion; a result not expected from any current models. We also show that direction-selectiveneurons in macaque visual cortex gave directional responses to the same static element …,Journal of Neuroscience,2005,82
Color contrast in macaque V1,Bevil R Conway; David H Hubel; Margaret S Livingstone,Abstract We explored the neural basis for spatial color contrast (red looks redder surroundedby green) and temporal color contrast (red looks redder if preceded by green) in primaryvisual cortex (V1) of the alert macaque. Using pairs of stimuli; we found a subset of neuronsthat gave stronger responses to sequences of red and green spots and stronger responsesto adjacent red and green spots. These cells combined their cone inputs linearly: for a red-ON-center cell; the sum of the OFF response to green and the ON response to red predictedthe peak response to red preceded by green. These 'color'cells; which could underlie huediscrimination because they show cone opponency; could mediate spatial and temporalcolor contrast. In contrast; the majority of cortical cells; which do not show overt coneopponency but which are often orientation tuned and/or direction selective; are by …,Cerebral cortex,2002,82
Spatiotemporal structure of nonlinear subunits in macaque visual cortex,Christopher C Pack; Bevil R Conway; Richard T Born; Margaret S Livingstone,The primate visual system is arranged hierarchically; starting from the retina and continuingthrough a series of extrastriate visual areas. Selectivity for motion is first found in individualneurons in the primate visual cortex (V1); in which many simple cells respond selectively tothe direction and speed of moving stimuli. Beyond simple cells; most studies of directionselectivity have focused on either V1 complex cells or neurons in the middle temporal area(MT/V5). To understand how visual information is transferred along this pathway; we havestudied all three types of neurons; using a reverse correlation procedure to obtain highspatial and temporal resolution maps of activity for different motion stimuli. Most complexand MT cells showed strong second-order interactions; indicating that they were tuned forparticular displacements of an apparent motion stimulus.

Parallel; multi-stage processing of colors; faces and shapes in macaque inferior temporal cortex,Rosa Lafer-Sousa; Bevil R Conway,Abstract Visual-object processing culminates in inferior temporal cortex (IT). To assess theorganization of IT; we measured functional magnetic resonance imaging responses in alertmonkeys to achromatic images (faces; fruit; bodies and places) and colored gratings. ITcontained multiple color-biased regions; which were typically ventral to face patches andyoked to them; spaced regularly at four locations predicted by known anatomy. Color andface selectivity increased for more anterior regions; indicative of a broad hierarchicalarrangement. Responses to non-face shapes were found across IT; but were strongeroutside color-biased regions and face patches; consistent with multiple parallel streams. ITalso contained multiple coarse eccentricity maps: face patches overlapped centralrepresentations; color-biased regions spanned mid-peripheral representations and place …,Nature neuroscience,2013,72
Substructure of direction-selective receptive fields in macaque V1,Margaret S Livingstone; Bevil R Conway,We used two-dimensional (2-D) sparse noise to map simultaneous and sequential two-spotinteractions in simple and complex direction-selective cells in macaque V1. Sequential-interaction maps for both simple and complex cells showed preferred-direction facilitationand null-direction suppression for same-contrast stimulus sequences and the reverse forinverting-contrast sequences; although the magnitudes of the interactions were weaker forthe simple cells. Contrast-sign selectivity in complex cells indicates that direction-selectiveinteractions in these cells must occur in antecedent simple cells or in simple-cell-likedendritic compartments. Our maps suggest that direction selectivity; and on andoffsegregation perpendicular to the orientation axis; can occur prior to receptive-fieldelongation along the orientation axis. 2-D interaction maps for some complex cells …,Journal of Neurophysiology,2003,62
Color-tuned neurons are spatially clustered according to color preference within alert macaque posterior inferior temporal cortex,Bevil R Conway; Doris Y Tsao,Abstract Large islands of extrastriate cortex that are enriched for color-tuned neurons haverecently been described in alert macaque using a combination of functional magneticresonance imaging (fMRI) and single-unit recording. These millimeter-sized islands; dubbed“globs;” are scattered throughout the posterior inferior temporal cortex (PIT); a swath of brainanterior to area V3; including areas V4; PITd; and posterior TEO. We investigated the micro-organization of neurons within the globs. We used fMRI to identify the globs and then usedMRI-guided microelectrodes to test the color properties of single glob cells. We used colorstimuli that sample the CIELUV perceptual color space at regular intervals to test the colortuning of single units; and make two observations. First; color-tuned neurons of various colorpreferences were found within single globs. Second; adjacent glob cells tended to have …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2009,58
Space-time maps and two-bar interactions of different classes of direction-selective cells in macaque V-1,Bevil R Conway; Margaret S Livingstone,We used one-dimensional sparse noise stimuli to generate first-order spatiotemporal mapsand second-order two-bar interaction maps for 65 simple and 124 complex direction-selective cells in alert macaque V1. Spatial and temporal phase differences between lightand dark space-time maps clearly distinguished simple and complex cell populations.Complex cells usually showed similar direction preferences to light and dark bars; but manyof the directional simple cells were much more direction selective to one sign of contrastthan the reverse. We show that this is predicted by a simple energy model. Some of thedirection-selective simple cells showed multiple space-time-slanted subregions; but others(previously described as S1 cells) had space-time maps that looked like just one subregionof an ordinary simple cell. Both simple and complex cells showed directional interactions …,Journal of Neurophysiology,2003,58
Striking individual differences in color perception uncovered by ‘the dress’ photograph,Rosa Lafer-Sousa; Katherine L Hermann; Bevil R Conway,Summary 'The dress' is a peculiar photograph: by themselves the dress' pixels are brownand blue; colors associated with natural illuminants [1]; but popular accounts (# TheDress)suggest the dress appears either white/gold or blue/black [2]. Could the purportedcategorical perception arise because the original social-media question was an alternative-forced-choice? In a free-response survey (N= 1401); we found that most people; includingthose naïve to the image; reported white/gold or blue/black; but some said blue/brown.Reports of white/gold over blue/black were higher among older people and women. On re-test; some subjects reported a switch in perception; showing the image can be multistable. Ina language-independent measure of perception; we asked subjects to identify the dress'colors from a complete color gamut. The results showed three peaks corresponding to the …,Current Biology,2015,51
Receptive fields of disparity-tuned simple cells in macaque V1,Doris Y Tsao; Bevil R Conway; Margaret S Livingstone,Abstract Binocular simple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) are the first cells along themammalian visual pathway to receive input from both eyes. Two models of how binocularsimple cells could extract disparity information have been put forward. The phase-shiftmodel proposes that the receptive fields in the two eyes have different subunit organizations;while the position-shift model proposes that they have different overall locations. In fivefixating macaque monkeys; we recorded from 30 disparity-tuned simple cells that showedselectivity to the disparity in a random dot stereogram. High-resolution maps of the left andright eye receptive fields indicated that both phase and position shifts were common. Singlecells usually showed a combination of the two; and the optimum disparity was bestcorrelated with the sum of receptive field phase and position shift.,Neuron,2003,46
Was Rembrandt stereoblind?,Margaret S Livingstone; Bevil R Conway,To the Editor: Stereopsis is an important cue for depth perception; yet it can be a hindranceto an artist trying to depict a three-dimensional scene on a flat surface. Art teachers ofteninstruct students to close one eye in order to flatten what they see. Therefore;stereoblindness might not be a handicap—and might even be an asset—for some artists.Stereopsis requires precise alignment of the two eyes.

Contrast affects speed tuning; space-time slant; and receptive-field organization of simple cells in macaque V1,Margaret S Livingstone; Bevil R Conway,We measured speed tuning of V1 cells in alert macaques to high-and low-contrast stimuli.Most V1 cells tested; both simple and complex and directional as well as nondirectional;shifted their speed tuning to slower speeds for lower contrast stimuli. We found that thespace-time slant of the receptive field of directional simple cells differed for high-and low-contrast stimuli; with the space-time slant predicting higher optimum speeds for the higher-contrast stimuli; ie; there was a larger spatial shift of the receptive-field organization per unittime. Not only did the space-time maps of directional simple cells show different slantsbetween high-and low-contrast stimuli; but they also showed a different organization;because for high-contrast stimuli; the maps tended to show a complete inversion of thereceptive-field spatial organization at long delays after stimulus onset; with initial …,Journal of neurophysiology,2007,29
Neural mechanisms of color vision: Double-opponent cells in the visual cortex,Bevil R Conway,From the Foreword by Nobel Laureate David Hubel:" We now have the first cleardemonstration of double opponent cells in the primate visual system. Given thetemperament of those who work in the field of color vision there seems little doubt thatheated debates will continue; but for the present at least; the subject seems to be as close tosettled as such things can be in science." How the brain represents color remains one of themost controversial topics in neurophysiology. We know that color is represented through anopponent mechanism; demonstrated by the fact that some colors are exclusive of others. Yethow these antagonistic chromatic axes are represented in the cortex has been a mystery.

Color signals through dorsal and ventral visual pathways,Bevil R Conway,Abstract Explanations for color phenomena are often sought in the retina; lateral geniculatenucleus; and V1; yet it is becoming increasingly clear that a complete account will take usfurther along the visual-processing pathway. Working out which areas are involved is nottrivial. Responses to S-cone activation are often assumed to indicate that an area or neuronis involved in color perception. However; work tracing S-cone signals into extrastriate cortexhas challenged this assumption: S-cone responses have been found in brain regions; suchas the middle temporal (MT) motion area; not thought to play a major role in colorperception. Here; we review the processing of S-cone signals across cortex and presentoriginal data on S-cone responses measured with fMRI in alert macaque; focusing on onearea in which S-cone signals seem likely to contribute to color (V4/posterior inferior …,Visual neuroscience,2014,26
Color-biased regions of the ventral visual pathway lie between face-and place-selective regions in humans; as in macaques,Rosa Lafer-Sousa; Bevil R Conway; Nancy G Kanwisher,The existence of color-processing regions in the human ventral visual pathway (VVP) haslong been known from patient and imaging studies; but their location in the cortex relative toother regions; their selectivity for color compared with other properties (shape and objectcategory); and their relationship to color-processing regions found in nonhuman primatesremain unclear. We addressed these questions by scanning 13 subjects with fMRI whilethey viewed two versions of movie clips (colored; achromatic) of five different object classes(faces; scenes; bodies; objects; scrambled objects). We identified regions in each subjectthat were selective for color; faces; places; and object shape; and measured responseswithin these regions to the 10 conditions in independently acquired data. We report two keyfindings. First; the three previously reported color-biased regions (located within a band …,Journal of Neuroscience,2016,19
Functional architecture for disparity in macaque inferior temporal cortex and its relationship to the architecture for faces; color; scenes; and visual field,Bram-Ernst Verhoef; Kaitlin S Bohon; Bevil R Conway,Binocular disparity is a powerful depth cue for object perception. The computations for objectvision culminate in inferior temporal cortex (IT); but the functional organization for disparity inIT is unknown. Here we addressed this question by measuring fMRI responses in alertmonkeys to stimuli that appeared in front of (near); behind (far); or at the fixation plane. Wediscovered three regions that showed preferential responses for near and far stimuli; relativeto zero-disparity stimuli at the fixation plane. These “near/far” disparity-biased regions werelocated within dorsal IT; as predicted by microelectrode studies; and on the posteriorinferotemporal gyrus. In a second analysis; we instead compared responses to near stimuliwith responses to far stimuli and discovered a separate network of “near” disparity-biasedregions that extended along the crest of the superior temporal sulcus.

Colour vision: a clue to hue in V2,Bevil R Conway,Almost everybody knows that colour perception begins with the three cone types – L; M andS; or loosely; red; green and blue (Figure 1A;B) – but what most people do not know is that eachcone type does not represent a single colour. If cones did; then we would be able to see a continuousmixture of impossible colours; such as reddish-greens and bluish-yellows. How cone responsesare translated into our perception of hue has been a difficult nut to crack; but a recent study[1] suggests it happens in V2; the second cortical visual area … Figure 1.

The projection from V1 to extrastriate area 21a: a second patchy efferent pathway that colocalizes with the CO blob columns in cat visual cortex,Bevil Conway; Jamie D Boyd; Tara H Stewart; Joanne A Matsubara,Abstract The different patchy organizations of neurons projecting from primary visual cortex(area 17) to the various extrastriate areas may contribute to functional differences in theoutput to each of these areas. The pattern of neurons projecting to extrastriate area 21a wasexamined using large injections of retrograde tracers and compared to the pattern shown byneurons projecting to the lateral suprasylvian area (LS). Patches of neurons projecting to21a showed a bimodal laminar distribution; with numerous labeled cells in the upper andlower third of layer 3 bracketing a sparsely labeled central third; LS-projecting neurons wereconfined to the lower and middle thirds of layer 3. The 21a projecting cells were relativelytighter in their clustering pattern than the LS projecting cells; ie the difference in labelingdensity between patch and interpatch zones was greater for 21a-projecting cells than for …,Cerebral Cortex,2000,17
Psychophysical chromatic mechanisms in macaque monkey,Cleo M Stoughton; Rosa Lafer-Sousa; Galina Gagin; Bevil R Conway,Chromatic mechanisms have been studied extensively with psychophysical techniques inhumans; but the number and nature of the mechanisms are still controversial. Appeals tomonkey neurophysiology are often used to sort out the competing claims and to testhypotheses arising from the experiments in humans; but psychophysical chromaticmechanisms have never been assessed in monkeys. Here we address this issue bymeasuring color-detection thresholds in monkeys before and after chromatic adaptation;employing a standard approach used to determine chromatic mechanisms in humans. Weconducted separate experiments using adaptation configured as either flickering full-fieldcolors or heterochromatic gratings. Full-field colors would favor activity within the visualsystem at or before the arrival of retinal signals to V1; before the spatial transformation of …,Journal of Neuroscience,2012,16
Color consilience: color through the lens of art practice; history; philosophy; and neuroscience,Bevil R Conway,Abstract Paintings can be interpreted as the product of the complex neural machinery thattranslates physical light signals into behavior; experience; and emotion. The brainmechanisms responsible for vision and perception have been sculpted during evolution andfurther modified by cultural exposure and development. By closely examining artists'paintings and practices; we can discover hints to how the brain works; and achieve insightinto the discoveries and inventions of artists and their impact on culture. Here; I focus on anintegral aspect of color; color contrast; which poses a challenge for artists: a mark situatedon an otherwise blank canvas will appear a different color in the context of the finishedpainting.

Color tuning in alert macaque V1 assessed with fMRI and single-unit recording shows a bias toward daylight colors,Rosa Lafer-Sousa; Yang O Liu; Luis Lafer-Sousa; Michael C Wiest; Bevil R Conway,Colors defined by the two intermediate directions in color space;“orange–cyan” and “lime–magenta;” elicit the same spatiotemporal average response from the two cardinal chromaticchannels in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). While we found LGN functional magneticresonance imaging (fMRI) responses to these pairs of colors were statisticallyindistinguishable; primary visual cortex (V1) fMRI responses were stronger to orange–cyan.Moreover; linear combinations of single-cell responses to cone-isolating stimuli of V1 cone-opponent cells also yielded stronger predicted responses to orange–cyan over lime–magenta; suggesting these neurons underlie the fMRI result. These observations areconsistent with the hypothesis that V1 recombines LGN signals into “higher-order”mechanisms tuned to noncardinal color directions.

A different point of hue,Bevil R Conway; Margaret S Livingstone,Understanding color is not easy. Newton made some headway; but his demonstration ofcolor's physical basis provided only limited insight because; as Young (2) pointed out; theresimply is not enough space for a receptor for each of the seven million or so perceivablecolors at each retinal location. Young argued for a triplet color code; and we now know thatsuch a code exists in the form of the three cone types (Fig. 1). Young's idea made color aconstruction of the brain; not a physical attribute; and paved the way for opponent colortheory (3) in which color is determined not by trichromacy but by three opponent processes:red-green; blueyellow; and black-white. This theory gained ground because it accounted forthe fact that we are unable to see a continuous mixture of ''reddish-greens''and ''bluish-yellows;''which should be perceivable if color were simply trichromatic.

Evolution of neural computations: Mantis shrimp and human color decoding,Qasim Zaidi; Justin Marshall; Hanne Thoen; Bevil R Conway,Mantis shrimp and primates both possess good color vision; but the neural implementationin the two species is very different; a reflection of the largely unrelated evolutionary lineagesof these creatures. Mantis shrimp have scanning compound eyes with 12 classes ofphotoreceptors; and have evolved a system to decode color information at the front-end ofthe sensory stream. Primates have image-focusing eyes with three classes of cones; anddecode color further along the visual-processing hierarchy. Despite these differences; wereport a fascinating parallel between the computational strategies at the color-decodingstage in the brains of stomatopods and primates. Both species appear to use narrowly tunedcells that support interval decoding color identification.,i-Perception,2014,12
Color-detection thresholds in rhesus macaque monkeys and humans,Galina Gagin; Kaitlin S Bohon; Adam Butensky; Monica A Gates; Jiun-Yiing Hu; Rosa Lafer-Sousa; Reitumetse L Pulumo; Jane Qu; Cleo M Stoughton; Sonja N Swanbeck; Bevil R Conway,Abstract Macaque monkeys are a model of human color vision. To facilitate linkingphysiology in monkeys with psychophysics in humans; we directly compared color-detectionthresholds in humans and rhesus monkeys. Colors were defined by an equiluminant planeof cone-opponent color space. All subjects were tested on an identical apparatus with a four-alternative forced-choice task. Targets were 2 square; centered 2 from fixation; embedded inluminance noise. Across all subjects; the change in detection thresholds from initial testingto plateau performance (“learning”) was similar for+ L− M (red) colors and+ M− L (bluish-green) colors. But the extent of learning was higher for+ S (lavender) than for− S (yellow-lime); moreover; at plateau performance; the cone contrast at the detection threshold washigher for+ S than for− S.

Response: Towards a neural representation for unique hues,Bevil R Conway; Cleo M Stoughton,Summary We recently reported that a population of color-tuned neurons in posterior inferiortemporal cortex of macaque monkey represents all colors and that this population shows abias towards certain colors: we found that many cells were tuned to red; followed by peaks togreen; blue; and an indistinct peak corresponding to yellow [1]. This appears to be theclosest explicit neural representation of unique hues found in the primate. John Mollonsuggests that the distribution is what one would expect of neurons found earlier in the visualpathway; in lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN); if tested with the colors we used to measuretuning. Previous work has shown that LGN cells respond linearly to changes in conecontrast and do not represent unique hues. While we acknowledge that our stimuli wouldconstrain the population's color-tuning distribution if the neurons were linear; the …,Current Biology,2009,12

Subjectsviewed computer-generated; dynamic; 100× 100 random-dot stereograms presented at adistance of 57 cm and spanning 11. Subjects were first shown a zero-disparity stereogramfor 2 s; then a central 4.5 square region of the stereogram was shifted to a nonzero disparityfor 2 s and then returned to zero disparity for 2 s. Ten nonzero disparities were shown; eachdisparity was presented twice for each subject; in random sequence.

Color vision: mice see hue too,Bevil R Conway,Normal mice have just two cone pigments; unlike humans who usually have three. Our extracone colors the world in a way that mice can only dream of… until now [1]. A few years ago; twogroups [2;3] independently generated a transgenic mouse that expresses the human red retinalpigment; in addition to the native mouse green and blue pigments; giving the mouse a trichromaticretina. The burning question has been whether these mice use the extra pigment to measuredifferences in spectral distribution — do they see in red-green color? Many scientists; includingme; would probably have guessed not; because color vision involves all sorts of specializedneural circuits; both in the retina and in the cortex [4;5]; that would seem to require more thana single genetic switch to invent. But Jacobs et al.[1] have now shown with careful psychophysicalexperiments that a fraction of these transgenic mice are indeed trichromatic.,Current biology,2007,9
Binocular stereoscopy in visual areas V-2; V-3; and V-3A of the macaque monkey,David H Hubel; Torsten N Wiesel; Erin M Yeagle; Rosa Lafer-Sousa; Bevil R Conway,Abstract Over 40 years ago; Hubel and Wiesel gave a preliminary report of the first accountof cells in monkey cerebral cortex selective for binocular disparity. The cells were locatedoutside of V-1 within a region referred to then as “area 18.” A full-length manuscript neverfollowed; because the demarcation of the visual areas within this region had not been fullyworked out. Here; we provide a full description of the physiological experiments and identifythe locations of the recorded neurons using a contemporary atlas generated by functionalmagnetic resonance imaging; we also perform an independent analysis of the location of theneurons relative to an anatomical landmark (the base of the lunate sulcus) that is oftencoincident with the border between V-2 and V-3. Disparity-tuned cells resided not only in V-2; the area now synonymous with area 18; but also in V-3 and probably within V-3A. The …,Cerebral Cortex,2013,7

Representation of perceptual color space in macaque posterior inferior temporal cortex (the V4 Complex),Kaitlin S Bohon; Katherine L Hermann; Thorsten Hansen; Bevil R Conway,Abstract The lateral geniculate nucleus is thought to represent color using two populations ofcone-opponent neurons [L vs M; S vs (L+ M)]; which establish the cardinal directions in colorspace (reddish vs cyan; lavender vs lime). How is this representation transformed to bringabout color perception? Prior work implicates populations of glob cells in posterior inferiortemporal cortex (PIT; the V4 complex); but the correspondence between the neuralrepresentation of color in PIT/V4 complex and the organization of perceptual color space isunclear. We compared color-tuning data for populations of glob cells and interglob cells topredictions obtained using models that varied in the color-tuning narrowness of the cells;and the color preference distribution across the populations. Glob cells were best accountedfor by simulated neurons that have nonlinear (narrow) tuning and; as a population …,Eneuro,2016,6
Vision and art: an interdisciplinary approach to neuroscience education,Rosa Lafer-Sousa; Bevil R Conway,Abstract Undergraduate institutions are increasingly adopting neuroscience within theircurricula; although it is unclear how best to implement this material given theinterdisciplinary nature of the field; which requires knowledge of basic physics; chemistry;biology and psychology. This difficulty is compounded by declines over recent decades inthe amount of physics education that students receive in high school; which hindersstudents' ability to grasp basic principles of neuroscience. Here we discuss our experiencesas teacher (BRC) and student (RLS) with an undergraduate course in Vision and Art. Thecourse capitalizes on students' prior interest in visual art to motivate an understanding of thephysiological and computational neural processes that underlie vision; our aim is that thelearning strategies that students acquire as a result of the format and interdisciplinary …,Journal of Undergraduate Neuroscience Education,2009,6
Color naming across languages reflects color use,Edward Gibson; Richard Futrell; Julian Jara-Ettinger; Kyle Mahowald; Leon Bergen; Sivalogeswaran Ratnasingam; Mitchell Gibson; Steven T Piantadosi; Bevil R Conway,Abstract What determines how languages categorize colors? We analyzed results of theWorld Color Survey (WCS) of 110 languages to show that despite gross differences acrosslanguages; communication of chromatic chips is always better for warm colors (yellows/reds)than cool colors (blues/greens). We present an analysis of color statistics in a largedatabank of natural images curated by human observers for salient objects and show thatobjects tend to have warm rather than cool colors. These results suggest that the cross-linguistic similarity in color-naming efficiency reflects colors of universal usefulness andprovide an account of a principle (color use) that governs how color categories come about.We show that potential methodological issues with the WCS do not corrupt information-theoretic analyses; by collecting original data using two extreme versions of the color …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2017,5

Responses of V1 neurons to reverse phi stimuli,Margaret Livingstone; Bevil Conway,Abstract Anstis (1970) showed that 2-stimulus apparent motion appears to go in the reversedirection if the two stimuli are of opposite contrast. He termed this reverse phi. Neuralcorrelates of reverse phi have been reported in cat V1 (Emerson et al.; 1987); primate MT(Livingstone et al.; 2001); and wallaby pretectum (Ibbotson & Clifford; 2001). Here wepresent a quantitative evaluation of responses to phi and reverse phi apparent motionstimuli in alert macaque V1. Of a population of 118 V1 cells (60 complex; 38 simple; 20 S1)ALL showed direction-selective responses to 2-bar apparent-motion stimuli; and All of themshowed reversed direction preference when the two bars were of opposite contrast. Thereversal was not complete: the slope of the same-contrast direction index vs the inverting-contrast direction index was−. 76;−. 72 and−. 67 for the 3 cell types; respectively; and the …,Journal of Vision,2002,2
# TheDress: Categorical perception of an ambiguous color image,Rosa Lafer-Sousa; Bevil R Conway,Abstract We present a full analysis of data from our preliminary report (Lafer-Sousa;Hermann; & Conway; 2015) and test whether# TheDress image is multistable. A multistableimage must give rise to more than one mutually exclusive percept; typically within singleindividuals. Clustering algorithms of color-matching data showed that the dress was seencategorically; as white/gold (W/G) or blue/black (B/K); with a blue/brown transition state.Multinomial regression predicted categorical labels. Consistent with our prior hypothesis;W/G observers inferred a cool illuminant; whereas B/K observers inferred a warm illuminant;moreover; subjects could use skin color alone to infer the illuminant. The data provide some;albeit weak; support for our hypothesis that day larks see the dress as W/G and night owlssee it as B/K.

Stable receptive field structure of color neurons in primary visual cortex under adapting and non-adapting conditions,Bevil R Conway,The way in which color signals from the three cone classes (L; M; S) are handled by the restof the visual system to bring about color perception is incompletely known. In particular; theneural mechanism underlying two fundamental features of color vision; color contrast andcolor constancy; are unclear. Modeling efforts have shown that these features could beaccounted for by neurons capable of making chromatic comparisons across visual space.The existence of such neurons in the primate is contested. I revisited the issue; recording theactivity of single neurons in primary visual cortex of alert macaques trained to fixate a dot ona computer monitor; on which I flashed small spots of light that modulated a single coneclass at a time. Cone-isolating stimuli can either increase or decrease one of the three conetypes; thus there are a total of 6 stimuli; the stimuli were presented on a neutral gray …,Conference on Colour in Graphics; Imaging; and Vision,2006,1

DEPTH PERCEPTION,MS Livingstone; R Lafer-Sousa; BR Conway,Pictorial depictions of three-dimensional scenes have been of interest to vision scientistsbecause they provide a compelling example of how the perception of depth can arise solelyfrom two-dimensional surfaces. The perception of depth in such pictures is conveyed by avariety of monocular depth cues including linear perspective; occlusion; and shading. Bydefinition monocular depth cues require the use of only a single eye; and the perception ofdepth in pictures may in fact be enhanced when only a single eye is opened. Recently;Livingstone; Lafer-Sousa; and Conway turned this issue on its head by investigatingwhether expert artists—ie; individuals who have extensive training using monocular depthcues—may have difficulty utilizing binocular depth cues such as stereopsis; which involvesfusing the disparity that arises from the two eyes' separate views of the world.

Color Constancy of V1 Double Opponent Cells to Natural Images,Dimitri Fisher; Bevil Conway; Mark Goldman,The human visual system perceives colors of objects as largely independent of the lightingconditions even though the spectral composition of the incident light; and thus of the lightreflected off objects and reaching the eye; can be very different under different types oflighting (such as midday sun; sunset; fluorescent or incandescent light). The ability tomaintain constant perception of object color is called color constancy; and its neural basisremains unknown. Neurons in the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) do not showresponse properties consistent with color constancy; indicating that this computation isperformed at a subsequent stage of neural processing. The critical computation underlyingcolor constancy is a comparison of the relative cone activations across visual space. Recentstudies have confirmed the existence of double-opponent cells in V1 that; in principle …,Front. Syst. Neurosci. Conference Abstract: Computational and systems neuroscience 2009,2009,*
Modeling the transformation from LGN to V1 color-opponent receptive fields,Sarah M Maynard; Bevil R Conway; Mark S Goldman,Color arises from a network that begins with the cones and progresses through stages ofprocessing involving cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN); primary visual cortex (V1);and prestriate areas. Color is a threedimensional percept defined by an achromaticluminance axis along with two chromatic axes; red vs. green and blue vs. yellow.Representation of color along the red-green axis is derived from an opponent processwhereby responses from medium-wavelength-selective (M) cones are subtracted from thoseof long-wavelength-selective (L) cones [1]; leading to Type IL/M cells in the LGN [2]: L-ONcells are excited by L-cone activity in the receptive field center and suppressed by M-coneactivity in the surround. Type I neurons are by themselves incapable of encoding spatialcolor contrast; a hallmark of color vision. Color contrast is instead thought to arise through …,BMC Neuroscience,2008,*
Specialized color cells in V1 and beyond,Bevil Conway,Abstract Single-unit recording and cone-isolating stimuli were used to show that primaryvisual cortex (V1) contains specialized cone-opponent cells; many of them double-opponent. Cone-opponent cells in V1 are distinguished from complex-equiluminance cells;a more numerous population of neurons that are responsive to equiluminant colorboundaries irrespective of the configuration of the hues forming the boundary. Cone-opponent cells and not complex-equiluminance cells; could contribute to hue perception byencoding local color contrast and contributing to color constancy; complex equiluminancecells; on the other hand; likely assist in defeating camouflage. Testing neural responses atequiluminance has been a popular assay of the color properties of neurons; but theseresults show that while spatial frequency tuning to equiluminant stimuli may be necessary …,Journal of Vision,2007,*

Spatial structure of cone inputs to cortical color cells,Bevil R Conway,Summary and Conclusions The spatial structure of primate cortical color-cell receptive fieldsis controversial. In this study; spots of light that selectively modulate one class of cones (L; Mor S; or loosely red; green or blue) were flashed in and around the receptive fields of V-1color cells to map the spatial structure of the cone inputs. The maps generated using thesecone-isolating stimuli; together with an eye-position corrected reverse correlation technique;produced four findings. First; the receptive fields were Double-Opponent; an organization ofspatial and chromatic opponency that; when complemented by other cues in the naturalworld (eg spectral highlights and 3-D shape; Kraft and Brainard; 1999); likely contributes tocolor constancy and color contrast.

The ratio of L and M cone input intored-green cells was roughly the same for all cells; suggesting that this population representsa single chromatic axis. Red-green cells responded to stimuli of all orientations; were notdirection-selective and had circularly symmetric receptive fields; moreover; they often respondedto S-cone stimuli in such a way that they might be best described as red-cyan. Almost all colorcells gave a bigger response to a color if it was preceded by an opposite color; suggesting thatthese cells also encode temporal color contrast … Summary of the motion experiments …,*,2002,*
A history of color research,Bevil R Conway,Abstract A world devoid of color is a gray and bleak one. Despite this; the specific benefits ofcolor vision are difficult to quantify. Picasso said flippantly “when I run out of blue I use red”by which he meant that it is the brightness (or value) of a pigment and not its color thatdescribes the 3-dimensional shape of objects. Matisse demonstrated this point beautifully inhis painting La Femme au Chapeau (The Woman in the Hat; Paris; 1905; San FranciscoMuseum of Modern Art). A grayscale version shows that the values of the pigments preservethe shape of the woman's face quite well: the color transitions do not interfere with anaccurate representation of the play of light across her face (Livingstone; 2002). That thepainting reads well as a face despite the radical color transitions shows that color is not animportant cue to shape. Indeed; object shapes are easily recognizable even in dim light …,*,2002,*
Temporal structure of cone inputs to cortical color cells,Bevil R Conway,Abstract The color of a stimulus can be made more salient if it is immediately preceded by astimulus of opposite color; a phenomenon known as successive or temporal color contrast(Helmholtz; 1909; pg. 243; Figure 3.1). Here I tested whether color cells in monkey V-1 couldmediate this temporal chromatic contrast. I did this using sequential colored stimuli(consisting of small patches of cone isolating light) presented to the centers of V-1 cellreceptive fields. All colored stimuli were brighter than the constant adapting background onwhich they were presented. For almost all color cells (33/35); the response to a stimulus wasreduced if the stimulus was immediately preceded by a similarly colored stimulus. But theresponse was increased if the stimulus was preceded by an oppositely colored stimulus. Itested 12 non-color cells in a similar way; for all of these cells; I found that a previous …,*,2002,*
