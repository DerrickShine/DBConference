Medians and beyond: new aggregation techniques for sensor networks,Nisheeth Shrivastava; Chiranjeeb Buragohain; Divyakant Agrawal; Subhash Suri,Abstract Wireless sensor networks offer the potential to span and monitor large geographicalareas inexpensively. Sensors; however; have significant power constraint (battery life);making communication very expensive. Another important issue in the context of sensor-based information systems is that individual sensor readings are inherently unreliable. Inorder to address these two aspects; sensor database systems like TinyDB and Cougarenable in-network data aggregation to reduce the communication cost and improvereliability. The existing data aggregation techniques; however; are limited to relatively simpletypes of queries such as SUM; COUNT; AVG; and MIN/MAX. In this paper we propose a dataaggregation scheme that significantly extends the class of queries that can be answeredusing sensor networks. These queries include (approximate) quantiles; such as the …,Proceedings of the 2nd international conference on Embedded networked sensor systems,2004,564
Big data and cloud computing: current state and future opportunities,Divyakant Agrawal; Sudipto Das; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Scalable database management systems (DBMS)---both for update intensiveapplication workloads as well as decision support systems for descriptive and deepanalytics---are a critical part of the cloud infrastructure and play an important role in ensuringthe smooth transition of applications from the traditional enterprise infrastructures to nextgeneration cloud infrastructures. Though scalable data management has been a vision formore than three decades and much research has focussed on large scale datamanagement in traditional enterprise setting; cloud computing brings its own set of novelchallenges that must be addressed to ensure the success of data management solutions inthe cloud environment.

Advanced transaction models in workflow contexts,Gustavo Alonso; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Mohan Kamath; Roger Gunthor; Chandrasekaran Mohan,In recent years; numerous transaction models have been proposed to address the problemsposed by advanced database applications; but only a few of these models are being used incommercial products. In this paper; we make the case that such models may be too centeredaround databases to be useful in real environments. Advanced applications raise a varietyof issues that are not addressed at all by transaction models. These same issues; however;are the basis for existing workflow systems; which are having considerable success ascommercial products in spite of not having a solid theoretical foundation. We explore someof these issues and show that; in many aspects; workflow models are a superset oftransaction models and have the added advantage of incorporating a variety of ideas thathave so far remained outside the scope of traditional transaction processing.,Data Engineering; 1996.

A game theoretic framework for incentives in P2P systems,Chiranjeeb Buragohain; Divyakant Agrawal; Subhash Suri,Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks are self-organizing; distributed systems; with no centralizedauthority or infrastructure. Because of the voluntary participation; the availability of resourcesin a P2P system can be highly variable and unpredictable. We use ideas from game theoryto study the interaction of strategic and rational peers; and propose a differential service-based incentive scheme to improve the system's performance.,Peer-to-Peer Computing; 2003.(P2P 2003).

Efficient computation of frequent and top-k elements in data streams,Ahmed Metwally; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract We propose an integrated approach for solving both problems of finding the mostpopular k elements; and finding frequent elements in a data stream. Our technique isefficient and exact if the alphabet under consideration is small. In the more practical largealphabet case; our solution is space efficient and reports both top-k and frequent elementswith tight guarantees on errors. For general data distributions; our top-k algorithm can returna set of k′ elements; where k′≈ k; which are guaranteed to be the top-k'elements; and weuse minimal space for calculating frequent elements. For realistic Zipfian data; our spacerequirement for the frequent elements problem decreases dramatically with the parameter ofthe distribution; and for top-k queries; we ensure that only the top-k elements; in the correctorder; are reported. Our experiments show significant space reductions with no loss in …,International Conference on Database Theory,2005,420
Meghdoot: content-based publish/subscribe over P2P networks,Abhishek Gupta; Ozgur D Sahin; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Publish/Subscribe systems have become a prevalent model for delivering data fromproducers (publishers) to consumers (subscribers) distributed across wide-area networkswhile decoupling the publishers and the subscribers from each other. In this paper wepresent Meghdoot; which adapts content-based publish/subscribe systems to DistributedHash Table based P2P networks in order to provide scalable content delivery mechanismswhile maintaining the decoupling between the publishers and the subscribers. Meghdoot isdesigned to adapt to highly skewed data sets; which is typical of real applications. Theexperimental results demonstrate that Meghdoot balances the load among the peers andthe design scales well with increasing number of peers; subscriptions and events.,ACM/IFIP/USENIX International Conference on Distributed Systems Platforms and Open Distributed Processing,2004,408
An efficient and fault-tolerant solution for distributed mutual exclusion,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract In this paper; we present an efficient and fault-tolerant algorithm for generatingquorums to solve the distributed mutual exclusion problem. The algorithm uses a logical treeorganization of the network to generate tree quorums; which are logarithmic in the size of thenetwork in the best case. Our approach is resilient to both site and communication failures;even when such failures lead to network partitioning. Furthermore; the algorithm exhibits aproperty of graceful degradation; ie; it requires more messages only as the number offailures increase in the network. We describe how tree quorums can be used for variousdistributed applications for providing mutually exclusive access to a distributed resource;managing replicated objects; and atomically commiting a distributed transaction.,ACM Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS),1991,401
Dimensionality reduction for similarity searching in dynamic databases,KV Ravi Kanth; Divyakant Agrawal; Ambuj Singh,Abstract Databases are increasingly being used to store multi-media objects such as maps;images; audio and video. Storage and retrieval of these objects is accomplished using multi-dimensional index structures such as R*-trees and SS-trees. As dimensionality increases;query performance in these index structures degrades. This phenomenon; generallyreferred to as the dimensionality curse; can be circumvented by reducing the dimensionalityof the data. Such a reduction is however accompanied by a loss of precision of query results.Current techniques such as QBIC use SVD transform-based dimensionality reduction toensure high query precision. The drawback of this approach is that SVD is expensive tocompute; and therefore not readily applicable to dynamic databases. In this paper; wepropose novel techniques for performing SVD-based dimensionality reduction in dynamic …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1998,391
Limiting the spread of misinformation in social networks,Ceren Budak; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract In this work; we study the notion of competing campaigns in a social network andaddress the problem of influence limitation where a" bad" campaign starts propagating froma certain node in the network and use the notion of limiting campaigns to counteract theeffect of misinformation. The problem can be summarized as identifying a subset ofindividuals that need to be convinced to adopt the competing (or" good") campaign so as tominimize the number of people that adopt the" bad" campaign at the end of both propagationprocesses. We show that this optimization problem is NP-hard and provide approximationguarantees for a greedy solution for various definitions of this problem by proving that theyare submodular. We experimentally compare the performance of the greedy method tovarious heuristics. The experiments reveal that in most cases inexpensive heuristics such …,Proceedings of the 20th international conference on World wide web,2011,384
Functionality and limitations of current workflow management systems,Gustavo Alonso; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Carl Mohan,Abstract Work ow systems hold the promise of facilitating the everyday operation of manyenterprises and work environments. As a result; many commercial work ow managementsystems have been developed. These systems; although useful; do not scale well; havelimited fault-tolerance; and are in exible in terms of interoperating with other work owsystems. In this paper; we discuss the limitations of contemporary work ow managementsystems; and then elaborate on various directions for research and potential futureextensions to the design and modeling of work ow management systems.,IEEE expert,1997,378
Efficient view maintenance at data warehouses,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Ambuj Singh; Tolga Yurek,Abstract We present incremental view maintenance algorithms for a data warehouse derivedfrom multiple distributed autonomous data sources. We begin with a detailed framework foranalyzing view maintenance algorithms for multiple data sources with concurrent updates.Earlier approaches for view maintenance in the presence of concurrent updates typicallyrequire two types of messages: one to compute the view change due to the initial updateand the other to compensate the view change due to interfering concurrent updates. Thealgorithms developed in this paper instead perform the compensation locally by using theinformation that is already available at the data warehouse. The first algorithm; termedSWEEP; ensures complete consistency of the view at the data warehouse in the presence ofconcurrent updates. Previous algorithms for incremental view maintenance either …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1997,374
ElasTraS: An elastic; scalable; and self-managing transactional database for the cloud,Sudipto Das; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract A database management system (DBMS) serving a cloud platform must handlelarge numbers of application databases (or tenants) that are characterized by diverseschemas; varying footprints; and unpredictable load patterns. Scaling out using clusters ofcommodity servers and sharing resources among tenants (ie; multitenancy) are importantfeatures of such systems. Moreover; when deployed on a pay-per-use infrastructure;minimizing the system's operating cost while ensuring good performance is also animportant goal. Traditional DBMSs were not designed for such scenarios and hence do notpossess the mentioned features critical for DBMSs in the cloud. We present ElasTraS; whichcombines three design principles to build an elastically-scalable multitenant DBMS fortransaction processing workloads. These design principles are gleaned from a careful …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2013,311
Reverse nearest neighbor queries for dynamic databases.,Ioana Stanoi; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract In this paper we propose an algorithm for answering reverse nearest neighbor(RNN) queries; a problem formulated only recently. This class of queries is strongly relatedto that of nearest neighbor (NN) queries; although the two are not necessarilycomplementary. Unlike nearest neighbor queries; RNN queries find the set of databasepoints that have the query point as the nearest neighbor. There is no other proposal we areaware of; that provides an algorithmic approach to answer RNN queries. The earlierapproach for RNN queries (KM99]) is based on the pre-computation of neighborhoodinformation that is organized in terms of auxiliary data structures. It can be argued that theprecomputation of the RNN information for all points in the database can be too restrictive. Inthe case of dynamic databases; insert and update operations are expensive and can lead …,ACM SIGMOD workshop on research issues in data mining and knowledge discovery,2000,282
Exotica/FMQM: A persistent message-based architecture for distributed workflow management,Gustavo Alonso; C Mohan; Roger Günthör; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Mohan Kamath,Abstract In the past few years there has been an increasing interest in workflow applicationsas a way of supporting complex business processes in modern corporations. Given thenature of the environment and the technology involved; workflow applications are inherentlydistributed and pose many interesting challenges to the system designer. In most cases; aclient/server architecture is used in which knowledge about the processes being executed iscentralized in one node to facilitate monitoring; auditing; and to simplify synchronization. Inthis paper; we explore a novel distributed architecture; Exotica/FMQM; for workflow systemsin which the need for such a centralized database is eliminated. Instead; we use persistentmessages as the means to store the information relevant to the execution of a businessprocess. Our approach is to completely distribute the execution of a process so individual …,*,1995,281
A comparison of DFT and DWT based similarity search in time-series databases,Yi-Leh Wu; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,ABSTRACT Similarity search in time-series databases has received significant attentionlately. P opular tec hniques for efficient retrieval of time sequences in time-series databaseshas been to use Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). Recently; the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) has gained popular interest in database domain and several proposalshave been made to replace DFT by DWT for similarity search over time-series databases. Inthis paper; we explore the feasibility of replacing DFT by DWT with a comprehensiveanalysis of the DFT and DWT as matching functions in time-series databases. Our resultsshow that although the DWT based technique has several adv antages; eg; the D WThascomplexity of O (N) whereas DFT is O (N log N); D WT does not reduce relativ e matchingerror and does not increase query precision in similarity search as suggested by previous …,Proceedings of the ninth international conference on Information and knowledge management,2000,274
G-store: a scalable data store for transactional multi key access in the cloud,Sudipto Das; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Cloud computing has emerged as a preferred platform for deploying scalable web-applications. With the growing scale of these applications and the data associated withthem; scalable data management systems form a crucial part of the cloud infrastructure. Key-Value stores--such as Bigtable; PNUTS; Dynamo; and their open source analogues--havebeen the preferred data stores for applications in the cloud. In these systems; data isrepresented as Key-Value pairs; and atomic access is provided only at the granularity ofsingle keys. While these properties work well for current applications; they are insufficient forthe next generation web applications--such as online gaming; social networks; collaborativeediting; and many more--which emphasize collaboration. Since collaboration by definitionrequires consistent access to groups of keys; scalable and consistent multi key access is …,Proceedings of the 1st ACM symposium on Cloud computing,2010,263
System and method for intelligent caching and refresh of dynamically generated and static web content,*,A system for updating Web pages stored in cache based on modifications to data stored in adatabase is disclosed. The system for updating stored Web pages may be part of a largersystem having a database management system for storing data used to generate Webpages. The database management system is capable of identifying modified data stored inthe database. The system for updating stored Web pages is comprised of one or moreservers programmed for maintaining associations between the stored Web pages and thestored data; and receiving the identity of modified data from the memory managementsystem.

Twig 2 Stack: bottom-up processing of generalized-tree-pattern queries over XML documents,Songting Chen; Hua-Gang Li; Junichi Tatemura; Wang-Pin Hsiung; Divyakant Agrawal; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract Tree pattern matching is one of the most fundamental tasks for XML queryprocessing. Holistic twig query processing techniques [4; 16] have been developed tominimize the intermediate results; namely; those root-to-leaf path matches that are not in thefinal twig results. However; useless path matches cannot be completely avoided; especiallywhen there is a parent-child relationship in the twig query. Furthermore; existing approachesdo not consider the fact that in practice; in order to process XPath or XQuery statements; amore powerful form of twig queries; namely; Generalized-Tree-Pattern (GTP)[8] queries; isrequired. Most existing works on processing GTP queries generally calls for costly post-processing for eliminating redundant data and/or grouping of the matching results.

Approximate Range Selection Queries in Peer-to-Peer systems.,Abhishek Gupta; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract We present an architecture for a data sharing peer-to-peer system where the data isshared in the form of database relations. In general; peer-to-peer systems try to locateexactmatch data objects to simple user queries. Since peer-to-peer users generally tend tosubmit broad queries in order to find data of their interest; we develop a P2P data sharingarchitecture for computing approximate answers for the complex queries by finding dataranges that are similar to the user query. Thus this paper represents the first step towardssolving the general range lookup problem over P2P systems instead of exact lookupoperations.,CIDR,2003,251
Zephyr: live migration in shared nothing databases for elastic cloud platforms,Aaron J Elmore; Sudipto Das; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Multitenant data infrastructures for large cloud platforms hosting hundreds ofthousands of applications face the challenge of serving applications characterized by smalldata footprint and unpredictable load patterns. When such a platform is built on an elasticpay-per-use infrastructure; an added challenge is to minimize the system's operating costwhile guaranteeing the tenants' service level agreements (SLA). Elastic load balancing istherefore an important feature to enable scale-up during high load while scaling down whenthe load is low. Live migration; a technique to migrate tenants with minimal serviceinterruption and no downtime; is critical to allow lightweight elastic scaling. We focus on theproblem of live migration in the database layer. We propose Zephyr; a technique toefficiently migrate a live database in a shared nothing transactional database architecture …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,222
Enabling dynamic content caching for database-driven web sites,K Selçuk Candan; Wen-Syan Li; Qiong Luo; Wang-Pin Hsiung; Divyakant Agrawal,Abstract Web performance is a key differentiation among content providers. Snafus andslowdowns at major web sites demonstrate the difficulty that companies face trying to scaleto a large amount of web traffic. One solution to this problem is to store web content at server-side and edge-caches for fast delivery to the end users. However; for many e-commercesites; web pages are created dynamically based on the current state of business processes;represented in application servers and databases. Since application servers; databases;web servers; and caches are independent components; there is no efficient mechanism tomake changes in the database content reflected to the cached web pages. As a result; mostapplication servers have to mark dynamically generated web pages as non-cacheable. Inthis paper; we describe the architectural framework of the CachePortal system for …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2001,222
Database management as a service: Challenges and opportunities,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Fatih Emekci; Ahmed Metwally,Data outsourcing or database as a service is a new paradigm for data management in whicha third party service provider hosts a database as a service. The service provides datamanagement for its customers and thus obviates the need for the service user to purchaseexpensive hardware and software; deal with software upgrades and hire professionals foradministrative and maintenance tasks. Since using an external database service promisesreliable data storage at a low cost it is very attractive for companies. Such a service wouldalso provide universal access; through the Internet to private data storedat reliable andsecure sites. A client would store their data; and not need to carry their data with them asthey travel. They would also not need to log remotely to their home machines; which maysuffer from crashes and be unavailable. However; recent governmental legislations …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09.

Epidemic algorithms in replicated databases,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Robert C Steinke,We present a family of epidemic algorithms for maintaining replicated data in a transactionalframework. The algorithms are based on the causal delivery of log records where eachrecord corresponds to one transaction instead of one operation. The fist algorithm in thisfamily is a pessimistic protocol that ensures serializability and guarantees strict executions.Since we expect the epidemic algorithms to be used in environments with low probability ofconflicts among transactions; we develop a variant of the pessimistic algorithm in whichlocks are released as soon as transactions finish their execution locally. However; thisoptimistic releasing of locks introduces the possibility of cascading aborts while ensuringserializable executions. The last member of thii family of epidemic algorithms is motivatedfrom the need for asynchronous replication solutions that are being increasingly used in …,Proceedings of the sixteenth ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1997,209
Parallelizing skyline queries for scalable distribution,Ping Wu; Caijie Zhang; Ying Feng; Ben Y Zhao; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Skyline queries help users make intelligent decisions over complex data; wheredifferent and often conflicting criteria are considered. Current skyline computation methodsare restricted to centralized query processors; limiting scalability and imposing a single pointof failure. In this paper; we address the problem of parallelizing skyline query execution overa large number of machines by leveraging content-based data partitioning. We present anovel distributed skyline query processing algorithm (DSL) that discovers skyline pointsprogressively. We propose two mechanisms; recursive region partitioning and dynamicregion encoding; to enforce a partial order on query propagation in order to pipeline queryexecution. Our analysis shows that DSL is optimal in terms of the total number of local queryinvocations across all machines. In addition; simulations and measurements of a …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,203
MD-HBase: A scalable multi-dimensional data infrastructure for location aware services,Shoji Nishimura; Sudipto Das; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,The ubiquity of location enabled devices has resulted in a wide proliferation of locationbased applications and services. To handle the growing scale; database managementsystems driving such location based services (LBS) must cope with high insert rates forlocation updates of millions of devices; while supporting efficient real-time analysis on latestlocation. Traditional DBMSs; equipped with multi-dimensional index structures; canefficiently handle spatio-temporal data. However; popular open source relational databasesystems are overwhelmed by the high insertion rates; real-time querying requirements; andterabytes of data that these systems must handle. On the other hand; Key-value stores caneffectively support large scale operation; but do not natively support multi-attribute accessesneeded to support the rich querying functionality essential for the LBSs.

The Tree Quorum Protocol: An Efficient Approach for Managing Replicated Data.,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract In this paper; we present an efficient algorithm for managing replicated data. Weimpose a logical tree structure on the set of copies of an object. In a failurefree environmentthe protocol executes read operations by reading one copy of an object while guaranteeingfault-tolerance of write operations. It also exhibits the property of graceful degradation; ie;communication costs are minimal in a failure-free environment but may increase as failuresoccur. This approach in designing distributed systems is desirable since it providesfaulttolerance without imposing unnecessary costs on the failure-free mode of operations.,VLDB,1990,199

PowerBookmarks is a Web information organization; sharing; andmanagement tool; which parses metadata from bookmarked URLs and uses it to index andclassify the URLs. PowerBookmarks supports advanced query; classification; and navigationfunctionalities on collections of bookmarks. PowerBookmarks monitors and utilizes users'access patterns to provide many useful personalized services; such as automated URLbookmarking; document refreshing; and bookmark expiration. It also allows users to specifytheir preference in bookmark management; such as ranking schemes and classification treestructures.

Exploiting atomic broadcast in replicated databases,Divyakant Agrawal; Gustavo Alonso; Amr El Abbadi; Ioana Stanoi,In spite of the fact that many applications require replicated databases either forperformance or fault-tolerance; replication has remained a research issue until recently.Today; the demand for practical replication schemes has greatly increased and some simpleprotocols are being implemented in databases (Oracle and Sybase; for instance) or inapplication development tools (Lotus Notes). These; however; are ad hoc implementationsand the issue of replicated data management is still a source of controversy amongdatabase practitioners and researchers. On one hand; traditional synchronous protocols aretoo expensive in terms of message cost and communication latency; and they aresusceptible to deadlocks when compared to non-replicated databases.

An integrated efficient solution for computing frequent and top-k elements in data streams,Ahmed Metwally; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract We propose an approximate integrated approach for solving both problems offinding the most popular k elements; and finding frequent elements in a data stream comingfrom a large domain. Our solution is space efficient and reports both frequent and top-kelements with tight guarantees on errors. For general data distributions; our top-k algorithmreturns k elements that have roughly the highest frequencies; and it uses limited space forcalculating frequent elements. For realistic Zipfian data; the space requirement of theproposed algorithm for solving the exact frequent elements problem decreases dramaticallywith the parameter of the distribution; and for top-k queries; the analysis ensures that onlythe top-k elements; in the correct order; are reported. The experiments; using real andsynthetic data sets; show space reductions with hardly any loss in accuracy. Having …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2006,157
Discovery of influence sets in frequently updated databases,Ioana Stanoi; Mirek Riedewald; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract An increasing number of organizations are currently working on ways to expressand provide location infor-mation to services and applications. A location aware systemknows the position of each component; and it is able to track devices through changes dueto movement. In this context; data management issues such as efficient storage and retrievalof data through frequent updates pose new challenges. While we believe that spatialqueries in general are going to gain in importance due to the emerging type of applications;we are particularly interested in the discovery of influence regions and influence sets arounda query point. An influence set is formed by all points that have q as their nearest neighbor;and are located within the boundaries of an influence region. In this paper we pro-pose forthe first time a technique that reduces such a query to the more familiar nearest neighbor …,VLDB,2001,156
Albatross: lightweight elasticity in shared storage databases for the cloud using live data migration,Sudipto Das; Shoji Nishimura; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Database systems serving cloud platforms must serve large numbers ofapplications (or tenants).

Retrieving and organizing web pages by “information unit”,Wen-Syan Li; K Selçuk Candan; Quoc Vu; Divyakant Agrawal,ABSTRACT Since WWW encourages hypertext and hypermedia document authoring (eg;HTML or XML); Web authors tend to create documents that are composed of multiple pagesconnected with hyperlinks or frames. A Web document may be authored in multiple ways;such as (1) all information in one physical page; or (2) a main page and the relatedinformation in separate linked pages. Existing Web search engines; however; return onlyphysical pages. In this paper; we introduce and describe the use of the concept ofinformation unit; which can be viewed as a logical Web document consisting of multiplephysical pages as one atomic retrieval unit. We present an algorithm to efficiently retrieveinformation units. Our algorithm can perform progressive query processing over a Web indexby considering both document semantic similarity and link structures.

Vector approximation based indexing for non-uniform high dimensional data sets,Hakan Ferhatosmanoglu; Ertem Tuncel; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract With the proliferation of multimedia data; there is increasing need to support theindexing and searching of high dimensional data. Recently; a vector appro ximationbasedtechnique called VA-file has been proposed for indexing high dimensional data. It has beenshown that the VA-file is an effective technique compared to the current approaches basedon space and data partitioning. The VA-file gives good performance especially when thedata set is uniformly distributed. Real data sets are not uniformly distributed; are oftenclustered; and the dimensions of the feature vectors in real data sets are usually correlated.More careful analysis for nonuniform or correlated data is needed for effectively indexinghigh dimensional data. We propose a solution to these problems and propose the VA+-file; anew technique for indexing high dimensional data sets based on vector approximations …,Proceedings of the ninth international conference on Information and knowledge management,2000,150

Constrained nearest neighbor queries,Hakan Ferhatosmanoglu; Ioanna Stanoi; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract In this paper we introduce the notion of constrained nearest neighbor queries(CNN) and propose a series of methods to answer them. This class of queries can bethought of as nearest neighbor queries with range constraints. Although both nearestneighbor and range queries have been analyzed extensively in previous literature; theimplications of constrained nearest neighbor queries have not been discussed. Due to theirversatility; CNN queries are suitable to a wide range of applications from GIS systems toreverse nearest neighbor queries and multimedia applications. We develop methods foranswering CNN queries with different properties and advantages. We prove the optimality(with respect to I/O cost) of one of the techniques proposed in this paper. The superiority ofthe proposed technique is shown by a performance analysis.,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2001,140

Asorganizations adopt work ow technology; they become increasingly dependent on thesystem to carry on their daily business activities.

Since higher level Web services areincreasingly composed in terms of lower level Web services; it is important that servicediscovery not only be based on service functionality but also be based on process behavior;ie; how a service functionality is served. Furthermore; centralized approaches to servicediscovery suffer from problems such as high operational and maintenance cost; single pointof failure; and scalability. Another issue that has not been considered in current Web servicediscovery paradigms is the issue of trust and quality of service of the service provider. We;therefore; propose a structured peer-to-peer framework for Web service discovery in …,Web Services; 2004. Proceedings. IEEE International Conference on,2004,130
Approximate nearest neighbor searching in multimedia databases,Hakan Ferhatosmanoglu; Ertem Tuncel; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Develops a general framework for approximate nearest-neighbor queries. We categorize thecurrent approaches for nearest-neighbor query processing based on either their ability toreduce the data set that needs to be examined; or their ability to reduce the representationsize of each data object. We first propose modifications to well-known techniques to supportthe progressive processing of approximate nearest-neighbor queries. A user may thereforestop the retrieval process once enough information has been returned. We then develop anew technique based on clustering that merges the benefits of the two general classes ofapproaches. Our cluster-based approach allows a user to progressively explore theapproximate results with increasing accuracy. We propose a new metric for evaluation ofapproximate nearest-neighbor searching techniques. Using both the proposed and the …,Data Engineering; 2001.

Epidemic algorithms for replicated databases,JoAnne Holliday; Robert Steinke; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,We present a family of epidemic algorithms for maintaining replicated database systems.The algorithms are based on the causal delivery of log records where each recordcorresponds to one transaction instead of one operation. The first algorithm in this family is apessimistic protocol that ensures serializability and guarantees strict executions. Since weexpect the epidemic algorithms to be used in environments with low probability of conflictsamong transactions; we develop a variant of the pessimistic algorithm which is optimistic inthat transactions commit as soon as they terminate locally and inconsistencies are detectedasynchronously as the effects of committed transactions propagate through the system. Thelast member of the family of epidemic algorithms is pessimistic and uses voting withquorums to resolve conflicts and improve transaction response time.

The dynamic data cube,Steven Geffner; Divakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Range sum queries on data cubes are a powerful tool for analysis. A range sumquery applies an aggregation operation (eg; SUM; AVERAGE) over all selected cells in adata cube; where the selection is specified by providing ranges of values for numericdimensions. We present the Dynamic Data Cube; a new approach to range sum querieswhich provides efficient performance for both queries and updates; which handles clusteredand sparse data gracefully; and which allows for the dynamic expansion of the data cube inany direction.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2000,126
Detectives: detecting coalition hit inflation attacks in advertising networks streams,Ahmed Metwally; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Click fraud is jeopardizing the industry of Internet advertising. Internet advertising iscrucial for the thriving of the entire Internet; since it allows producers to advertise theirproducts; and hence contributes to the well being of e-commerce. Moreover; advertisingsupports the intellectual value of the Internet by covering the running expenses of publishingcontent. Some content publishers are dishonest; and use automation to generate traffic todefraud the advertisers. Similarly; some advertisers automate clicks on the advertisements oftheir competitors to deplete their competitors' advertising budgets. This paper describes theadvertising network model; and focuses on the most sophisticated type of fraud; whichinvolves coalitions among fraudsters. We build on several published theoretical results todevise the Similarity-Seeker algorithm that discovers coalitions made by pairs of …,Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web,2007,123
Relative prefix sums: An efficient approach for querying dynamic OLAP data cubes,Steven Geffner; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Terry Smith,Range sum queries on data cubes are a powerful tool for analysis. A range sum queryapplies an aggregation operation (eg; SUM) over all selected cells in a data cube; where theselection is specified by providing ranges of values for numeric dimensions. Manyapplication domains require that information provided by analysis tools be current or" near-current." Existing techniques for range sum queries on data cubes; however; can incurupdate costs on the order of the size of the data cube. Since the size of a data cube isexponential in the number of its dimensions; rebuilding the entire data cube can be verycostly. We present an approach that achieves constant time range sum queries whileconstraining update costs. Our method reduces the overall complexity of the range sumproblem.,Data Engineering; 1999.

The generalized tree quorum protocol: an efficient approach for managing replicated data,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract In this paper; we present a low-cost fault-tolerant protocol for managing replicateddata. We impose a logical tree structure on the set of copies of an object and develop aprotocol that uses the information available in the logical structure to reduce thecommunication requirements for read and write operations. The tree quorum protocol is ageneralization of the static voting protocol with two degrees of freedom for choosingquorums. In general; this results in significantly lower communication costs for comparabledata availability. The protocol exhibits the property of graceful degradation; ie;communication costs for executing operations are minimal in a failure-free environment butmay increase as failures occur. This approach in designing distributed systems is desirablesince it provides fault-tolerance without imposing unnecessary costs on the failure-free …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1992,120

Data management challenges in cloud computing infrastructures,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Shyam Antony; Sudipto Das,Abstract The challenge of building consistent; available; and scalable data managementsystems capable of serving petabytes of data for millions of users has confronted the datamanagement research community as well as large internet enterprises. Current proposedsolutions to scalable data management; driven primarily by prevalent applicationrequirements; limit consistent access to only the granularity of single objects; rows; or keys;thereby trading off consistency for high scalability and availability. But the growing popularityof “cloud computing”; the resulting shift of a large number of internet applications to thecloud; and the quest towards providing data management services in the cloud; has openedup the challenge for designing data management systems that provide consistencyguarantees at a granularity larger than single rows and keys.

Power aware routing for sensor databases,Chiranjeeb Buragohain; Divyakant Agrawal; Subhash Suri,Wireless sensor networks offer the potential to span and monitor large geographical areasinexpensively. Sensor network databases like TinyDB [S. Madden et al.; 2002] are thedominant architectures to extract and manage data in such networks. Since sensors havesignificant power constraints (battery life); and high communication costs; design of energyefficient communication algorithms is of great importance. The data flow in a sensordatabase is very different from data flow in an ordinary network and poses novel challengesin designing efficient routing algorithms. In this work we explore the problem of energyefficient routing for various different types of database queries and show that in general; thisproblem is NP-complete. We give a constant factor approximation algorithm for one class ofquery; and for other queries give heuristic algorithms.

AFilter: adaptable XML filtering with prefix-caching suffix-clustering,K Selçuk Candan; Wang-Pin Hsiung; Songting Chen; Junichi Tatemura; Divyakant Agrawal,Abstract XML message filtering problem involves searching for instances of a given;potentially large; set of patterns in a continuous stream of XML messages. Since themessages arrive continuously; it is essential that the filtering rate matches the data arrivalrate. Therefore; the given set of filter patterns needs to be indexed appropriately to enablereal-time processing of the streaming XML data. In this paper; we propose AFilter; anadaptable; and thus scalable; path expression filtering approach. AFilter has a base memoryrequirement linear in filter expression and data size. Furthermore; when additional memoryis available; AFilter can exploit prefix commonalities in the set of filter expressions using aloosely-coupled prefix caching mechanism as opposed to tightly-coupled active staterepresentation of alternative approaches. Unlike existing systems; AFilter can also exploit …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,107
Hardware acceleration in commercial databases: A case study of spatial operations,Nagender Bandi; Chengyu Sun; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Traditional databases have focused on the issue of reducing I/O cost as it is thebottleneck in many operations. As databases become increasingly accepted in areas suchas Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Bioinformatics; commercial DBMS need tosupport data types for complex data such as spatial geometries and protein structures.These non-conventional data types and their associated operations present newchallenges. In particular; the computational cost of some spatial operations can be orders ofmagnitude higher than the I/O cost. In order to improve the performance of spatial queryprocessing; innovative solutions for reducing this computational cost are beginning toemerge. Recently; it has been proposed that hard-ware acceleration of an off-the-shelfgraphics card can be used to reduce the computational cost of spatial operations …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,105
Exotica/FMDC: Handling disconnected clients in a workflow management system,Gustavo Alonso; G Alonso; Roger Gunthor; Divy Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Mohan Kamath; D Agrawal; A El Abbadi; C Mohan,Abstract Workflow Management Systems (WFMS) are a first generation of products thatattempt to manage the execution of business processes by large numbers of usersdistributed over a wide area and using heterogeneous resources. They are a very promisingvenue for collaborative systems but; in most cases; the autonomy of the users is greatlyrestricted due to architectural and design considerations. This is a severe restriction;especially when considering the emergence of mobile computing; and the increase in use oflaptops and small computers which are connected to a network only occasionally. In thispaper; we discuss how disconnected workflow clients can be supported while preserving thecorrectness of the overall execution and allowing coordinated interactions between thedifferent users.

Privacy preserving decision tree learning over multiple parties,Fatih Emekçi; Ozgur D Sahin; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Data mining over multiple data sources has emerged as an important practicalproblem with applications in different areas such as data streams; data-warehouses; andbioinformatics. Although the data sources are willing to run data mining algorithms in thesecases; they do not want to reveal any extra information about their data to other sources dueto legal or competition concerns. One possible solution to this problem is to usecryptographic methods. However; the computation and communication complexity of suchsolutions render them impractical when a large number of data sources are involved. In thispaper; we consider a scenario where multiple data sources are willing to run data miningalgorithms over the union of their data as long as each data source is guaranteed that itsinformation that does not pertain to another data source will not be revealed.

Big data and cloud computing: new wine or just new bottles?,Divyakant Agrawal; Sudipto Das; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Cloud computing is an extremely successful paradigm of service orientedcomputing and has revolutionized the way computing infrastructure is abstracted and used.Three most popular cloud paradigms include: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS); Platform asa Service (PaaS); and Software as a Service (SaaS). The concept however can also beextended to Database as a Service and many more.

Privacy preserving query processing using third parties,Fatih Emekci; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Aziz Gulbeden,Data integration from multiple autonomous data sources has emerged as an importantpractical problem. The key requirement for such data integration is that owners of such dataneed to cooperate in a competitive landscape in most of the cases. The research challengein developing a query processing solution is that the answers to the queries need to beprovided while preserving the privacy of the data sources. In general; allowing unrestrictedread access to the whole data may give rise to potential vulnerabilities as well as may havelegal implications. Therefore; there is a need for privacy preserving database operations forquerying data residing at different parties.

Consistency and orderability: Semantics-based correctness criteria for databases,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Ambuj K Singh,Abstract The semantics of objects and transactions in database systems are investigated.User-defined predicates called consistency assertions are used to specify user programs.Three new correctness criteria are proposed. The first correctness criterion consistency isbased solely on the users' specifications and admit nonserializable executions that areacceptable to the users. Integrity constraints of the database are maintained throughconsistency assertions. The second correctness criterion orderability is a generalization ofview serializability and represents a weak notion of equivalence to a serial schedule. Finally;the third correctness criterion strong order-ability is introduced as a generalization of conflictserializability. Unlike consistency; the notions of orderability allow users to operate anisolation as maintenance of the integrity constrainst now becomes the responsibility of the …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1993,96
Cyclic allocation of two-dimensional data,Sunil Prabhakar; Khaled Abdel-Ghaffar; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Various proposals have been made for declustering 2D tiled data on multiple I/O devices.Strictly optimal solutions only exist under very restrictive conditions on the tiling of the 2Dspace or for very few I/O devices. In this paper; we explore allocation methods where nostrictly optimal solution exists. We propose a general class of allocation methods; referred toas cyclic allocation methods; and show that many existing methods are instances of thisclass. As a result; various seemingly ad hoc and unrelated methods are presented in asingle framework. Furthermore; the framework is used to develop new allocation methodsthat give better performance than any previous method and that approach the best feasibleperformance.,Data Engineering; 1998.

Hardware acceleration for spatial selections and joins,Chengyu Sun; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Spatial database operations are typically performed in two steps. In the filteringstep; indexes and the minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) of the objects are used toquickly determine a set of candidate objects; and in the refinement step; the actualgeometries of the objects are retrieved and compared to the query geometry or each other.Because of the complexity of the computational geometry algorithms involved; the CPU costof the refinement step is usually the dominant cost of the operation for complex geometriessuch as polygons. In this paper; we propose a novel approach to address this problem usingefficient rendering and searching capabilities of modern graphics hardware. This approachdoes not require expensive pre-processing of the data or changes to existing storage andindex structures; and it applies to both intersection and distance predicates.

Distributed navigation algorithms for sensor networks,Chiranjeeb Buragohain; Divyakant Agrawal; Subhash Suri,Abstract: We propose efficient distributed algorithms to aid navigation of a user through ageographic area covered by sensors. The sensors sense the level of danger at theirlocations and we use this information to find a safe path for the user through the sensor field.Traditional distributed navigation algorithms rely upon flooding the whole network withpackets to find an optimal safe path. To reduce the communication expense; we introducethe concept of a skeleton graph which is a sparse subset of the true sensor networkcommunication graph. Using skeleton graphs we show that it is possible to find approximatesafe paths with much lower communication cost. We give tight theoretical guarantees on thequality of our approximation and by simulation; show the effectiveness of our algorithms inrealistic sensor network situations.,arXiv preprint cs/0512060,2005,90

The performance of database replication with group multicast,JoAnne Holliday; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Replication with update-anywhere capability while maintaining global synchronization andisolation has long been thought impractical. Protocols have been proposed for distributedreplicated databases that take advantage of atomic broadcast systems to simplify messagepassing and conflict resolution in hopes of making replication efficient. This paper presentsperformance measurements on a simulation of a replicated database using those protocols.The results show that with the proper group broadcast mechanism; replication with update-anywhere capability is indeed practical.,Fault-Tolerant Computing; 1999.

Modular synchronization in multiversion databases: Version control and concurrency control,Divyakant Agrawal; Soumitra Sengupta,Abstract In this paper we propose a version control mechanism that enhances the modularityand extensibility of multiversion concurrency control algorithms. We decouple themultiversion algorithms into two components: version control and concurrency control. Thispermits modular development of multiversion protocols; and simplifies the task of proving thecorrectness of these protocols. An interesting feature of our framework is that the executionof read-only transactions becomes completely independent of the underlying concurrencycontrol implementation. Also; algorithms with the version control mechanism have severaladvantages over most other multiversion algorithms.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1989,85
Storage and retrieval of moving objects,Hae Don Chon; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract We investigate the problem and provide a data model storing; indexing; andretrieving future locations of moving objects in an efficient manner. Each moving object hasfour independent variables which allow us to predict its future location: a starting location; adestination; a starting time; and an initial velocity. To understand the underlying complexityof the problem; we investigate and categorize the configurations where two variables canvary. Based on that understanding; we choose a configuration which is to some extentrestrictive; but still can be used in a wide variety of realistic settings. A performance studyshows that our model has much less overhead in processing range queries compared toother proposed approaches.,International Conference on Mobile Data Management,2001,84
Using broadcast primitives in replicated databases,Ioana Stanoi; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,We explore the use of different variants of broadcast protocols for managing replicateddatabases. Starting with the simplest broadcast primitive; the reliable broadcast protocol; weshow how it can be used to ensure correct transaction execution. The protocol is simple; andhas several advantages; including prevention of deadlocks. However; it requires a two-phase commitment protocol for ensuring correctness. We then develop a second protocolthat uses causal broadcast and avoids the overhead of two-phase commit by exploiting thecausal delivery properties of the broadcast primitives to implicitly collect the relevantinformation used in two-phase commit. Finally; we present a protocol that employs atomicbroadcast and completely eliminates the need for acknowledgements during transactioncommitment.,Distributed Computing Systems; 1998.

From static distributed systems to dynamic systems,Achour Mostefaoui; Michel Raynal; Corentin Travers; Stacy Patterson; Divyakant Agrawal; AE Abbadi,A noteworthy advance in distributed computing is due to the recent development of peer-to-peer systems. These systems are essentially dynamic in the sense that no process can get aglobal knowledge on the system structure. They mainly allow processes to look up for datathat can be dynamically added/suppressed in a permanently evolving set of nodes. Althoughprotocols have been developed for such dynamic systems; to our knowledge; up to date nocomputation model for dynamic systems has been proposed. Nevertheless; there is a strongdemand for the definition of such models as soon as one wants to develop provably correctprotocols suited to dynamic systems. This paper proposes a model for (a class of) dynamicsystems.

These applicationsrequire a new model of association between pairs of elements in streams. We develop analgorithm; Streaming-Rules; to report association rules with tight guarantees on errors; usinglimited processing per element; and minimal space. The modular design of Streaming-Rulesallows for integration with current stream management systems; since it employs existingtechniques for finding frequent elements.

In this paper; we introduce LocX; a novel alternative thatprovides significantly improved location privacy without adding uncertainty into query resultsor relying on strong assumptions about server security. Our key insight is to apply secureuser-specific; distance-preserving coordinate transformations to all location data shared withthe server.

Structural trend analysis for online social networks,Ceren Budak; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract The identification of popular and important topics discussed in social networks iscrucial for a better understanding of societal concerns. It is also useful for users to stay ontop of trends without having to sift through vast amounts of shared information. Trenddetection methods introduced so far have not used the network topology and has thus notbeen able to distinguish viral topics from topics that are diffused mostly through the newsmedia. To address this gap; we propose two novel structural trend definitions we callcoordinated and uncoordinated trends that use friendship information to identify topics thatare discussed among clustered and distributed users respectively.

Constrained shared locks for increasing concurrency in databases,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr Elabbadi,Abstract In this paper; we extend the traditional relationships between locks; ie; shared andnon-shared; to permit sharing in a constrained manner. The new relationship between locksenables us to develop a family of locking protocols; the least permissive of which is twophase locking while the most permissive accepts all order-preserving conflict serializablehistories. The latter protocol also accepts all conflict serializable histories without reorderingread and write operations. Instances of the family of protocols can cope with a variety ofdatabase recovery problems.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,1995,80
Distributed optimistic concurrency control with reduced rollback,Divyakant Agrawal; Arthur J Bernstein; Pankaj Gupta; Soumitra Sengupta,Abstract Concurrency control algorithms have traditionally been based on locking andtimestamp ordering mechanisms. Recently optimistic schemes have been proposed. In thispaper a distributed; multi-version; optimistic concurrency control scheme is described whichis particularly advantageous in a query-dominant environment. The drawbacks of theoriginal optimistic concurrency control scheme; namely that inconsistent views may be seenby transactions (potentially causing unpredictable behavior) and that read-only transactionsmust be validated and may be rolled back; have been eliminated in the proposed algorithm.Read-only transactions execute in a completely asynchronous fashion and are thereforeprocessed with very little overhead. Furthermore; the probability that read-write transactionsare rolled back has been reduced by generalizing the validation algorithm. The effects of …,Distributed Computing,1987,79

One of the most important advantages of replication isthat it masks and tolerates failures in the network gracefully. In particular; the system remainsoperational and available to the users despite failures. However; complex and expensivesynchronization protocols are needed to maintain the replicas. In this paper; we proposedreplica control protocols where the synchronization cost is reduced by exploiting thestructural information of the underlying system. We first show that distributed mutualexclusion can be achieved efficiently if a logical structure is imposed of the underlying net--work system. Several such protocols hav: appeared in the literature [9; 1&l]. We then arguethat solutions to the problem of mutual exclusion can be extended to solve the problem ofreplica GGliirol in a distributed database.

Write-ahead-logging is a common approach for providingrecovery capability while improving performance in most storage systems. However; theseparation of log and application data incurs write overheads observed in write-heavyenvironments and hence adversely affects the write throughput and recovery time in thesystem.

Consequently; the correctness criteria derived for theseproblems are incomparable. Recently a unified theory of concurrency control and recoveryhas been introduced that is based on commutativity and performs transaction recovery bysubmitting inverse operations for operations of aborted transactions. In this paper weprovide a constructive correctness criterion that leads to the design of unified protocols thatguarantee atomicity and serializability.,Information Systems,1994,71

Efficient retrieval for browsing large image databases,Daniel Wu; Ambuj Singh; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Terence R Smith,Abstract The Alexandria project has been initiated to build a digital library for map andsatellite images. Designed for content-based retrieval; the relevant information in eachimage is encoded in the form of a multi-dimensional feature vector. Though representingimages by feature vectors~ eatly facilitates user queries; indexing these vectors degradesperformance when the number of dimensions is large.

Efficient processing of distributed top-k queries,Hailing Yu; Hua-Gang Li; Ping Wu; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Ranking-aware queries; or top-k queries; have received much attention recently invarious contexts such as web; multimedia retrieval; relational databases; and distributedsystems. Top-k queries play a critical role in many decision-making related activities suchas; identifying interesting objects; network monitoring; load balancing; etc. In this paper; westudy the ranking aggregation problem in distributed systems. Prior research addressing thisproblem did not take data distributions into account; simply assuming the uniform datadistribution among nodes; which is not realistic for real data sets and is; in general;inefficient. In this paper; we propose three efficient algorithms that consider data distributionsin different ways. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our approachesin terms of bandwidth consumption.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2005,69
Using message semantics to reduce rollback in optimistic message logging recovery schemes,Hong Va Leong; Divyakant Agrawal,Recovery from failures can be achieved through asynchronous checkpointing and optimisticmessage logging. These schemes have low overheads during failure-free operations.Central to these protocols is the determination of a maximal consistent global state; which isrecoverable. Message semantics is not exploited in most existing recovery protocols todetermine the recoverable state. We propose to identify messages that are not influential ina computation through message semantics. These messages can be logically removed fromthe computation without changing its meaning or result. We show that considering thesemessages in the recoverable state computation gives rise to recoverable states thatdominate the recoverable state defined under conventional model. We then develop analgorithm for identifying these messages. This technique can also be applied to ensure a …,Distributed Computing Systems; 1994.; Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on,1994,66
Safety guarantee of continuous join queries over punctuated data streams,*,Systems and methods are disclosed to guarantee the safety of a continuous join query(CJQ) over one or more punctuated data streams by constructing a punctuation graph;checking whether the punctuation graph is strongly connected and if so; indicating that theCJQ is safe to execute. The system uses a generalized punctuation graph and itstransformation to support arbitrary punctuation schemes. The system also provides anefficient shared purge algorithm for multi-way join operator.,*,2007,61
Flexible data cubes for online aggregation,Mirek Riedewald; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Applications like Online Analytical Processing depend heavily on the ability toquickly summarize large amounts of information. Techniques were proposed recently thatspeed up aggregate range queries on MOLAP data cubes by storing pre-computedaggregates. These approaches try to handle data cubes of any dimensionality by dealingwith all dimensions at the same time and treat the different dimensions uniformly. Thealgorithms are typically complex; and it is difficult to prove their correctness and to analyzetheir performance. We present a new technique to generate Iterative Data Cubes (IDC) thataddresses these problems. The proposed approach provides a modular framework forcombining one-dimensional aggregation techniques to create space-optimal high-dimensional data cubes. A large variety of cost tradeoffs for high-dimensional IDC can be …,International Conference on Database Theory,2001,61
View invalidation for dynamic content caching in multitiered architectures,K Selçuk Candan; Divyakant Agrawal; Wen-Syan Li; Oliver Po; Wang-Pin Hsiung,Abstract In today's multitiered application architectures; clients do not access data stored inthe databases directly. Instead; they use applications which in turn invoke the DBMS togenerate the relevant content. Since executing application programs may require significanttime and other resources; it is more advantageous to cache application results in a resultcache. Various view materialization and update management techniques have beenproposed to deal with updates to the underlying data. These techniques guarantee that thecached results are always consistent with the underlying data. Several applications;including e-commerce sites; on the other hand; do not require the caches be consistent allthe time. Instead; they require that all outdated pages in the caches are invalidated in atimely fashion. In this paper; we show that invalidation is inherently different from view …,Proceedings of the 28th international conference on Very Large Data Bases,2002,59
Exotica: a project on advanced transaction management and workflow systems,C Mohan; Divyakant Agrawal; Gustavo Alonso; Amr El Abbadi; Roger Guenthoer; M Kamath,Abstract This paper is an overview of the Exotica project; currently in progress at the IBMAlmaden Research Center. The project aims at exploring several research areas fromadvanced transaction management concepts to client/server architectures and mobilecomputing within the context of business processes and workflow management. Theultimate goal is to incorporate these ideas into IBM's products and prototypes. The projectinvolves IBM groups in Almaden (USA); Hursley (UK); Boeblingen (Germany); and Vienna(Austria).

Deltasky: Optimal maintenance of skyline deletions without exclusive dominance region generation,Ping Wu; Divyakant Agrawal; Omer Egecioglu; Amr El Abbadi,This paper addresses the problem of efficient maintenance of a materialized skyline view inresponse to skyline removals. While there has been significant progress on skyline querycomputation; an equally important but largely unanswered issue is on the incrementalmaintenance for skyline deletions. Previous work suggested the use of the so calledexclusive dominance region (EDR) to achieve optimal I/O performance for deletionmaintenance. However; the shape of an EDR becomes extremely complex in higherdimensions; and algorithms for its computation have not been developed. We derive asystematic way to decompose a d-dimensional EDR into a collection of hyper-rectangles.We show that the number of such hyper-rectangles is O (md); where m is the current skylineresult size. We then propose a novel algorithm DeltaSky which determines whether an …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007. IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,57
Partial database replication using epidemic communication,JoAnne Holliday; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Data replication in distributed databases has been investigated extensively with the hopethat it will improve performance; reliability; and availability.

Using delayed commitment in locking protocols for real-time databases,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Richard Jeffers,Abstract In this paper; we propose locking protocols that are useful for real-time databases.Our approach is motivated from two main observations. First; locking protocols are widelyaccepted and used in most database systems. Second; in real-time databases it has beenshown that the blocking behavior of transactions in locking protocols results in performancedegradation. We use a new relationship between locks called ordered sharing to eliminateblocking that arises in the traditional locking protocols. Ordered sharing eliminates blockingof read and write operations but may result in delayed commitment. Since in real-timedatabases; timeliness and not response time is the crucial factor; or protocols exploit thisdelay to allow transactions to execute within the slacks of delayed transactions. We comparethe performance of the proposed protocols with the two phase locking protocol for real …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1992,57
A comprehensive framework for secure query processing on relational data in the cloud,Shiyuan Wang; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Data security in the cloud is a big concern that blocks the widespread use of thecloud for relational data management. First; to ensure data security; data confidentialityneeds to be provided when data resides in storage as well as when data is dynamicallyaccessed by queries. Prior works on query processing on encrypted data did not providedata confidentiality guarantees in both aspects. Tradeoff between secrecy and efficiencyneeds to be made when satisfying both aspects of data confidentiality while being suitablefor practical use. Second; to support common relational data management functions; varioustypes of queries such as exact queries; range queries; data updates; insertion and deletionshould be supported. To address these issues; this paper proposes a comprehensiveframework for secure and efficient query processing of relational data in the cloud. Our …,Workshop on Secure Data Management,2011,56
Applying the golden rule of sampling for query estimation,Yi-Leh Wu; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Query size estimation is crucial for many database system components. Inparticular; query optimizers need efficient and accurate query size estimation when decidingamong alternative query plans. In this paper we propose a novel sampling technique basedon the golden rule of sampling; introduced by von Neumann in 1947; for estimating rangequeries. The proposed technique randomly samples the frequency domain using thecumulative frequency distribution and yields good estimates without any a priori knowledgeof the actual underlying distribution of spatial objects. We show experimentally that theproposed sampling technique gives smaller approximation error than the Min-Skewhistogram based and wavelet based approaches for both synthetic and real datasets.Moreover; the proposed technique can be easily extended for higher dimensional …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2001,56
Scalable collection summarization and selection,Ron Dolin; Divyakant Agrawal; E El Abbadi,Abstract Information retrieval over the Internet increasingly requires the filtering of thousandsof information sources. As the number and variety of sources increases; new ways ofautomatically summarizing; discovering; and selecting sources relevant to a user's query areneeded. Pharos is a highly scalable distributed architecture for locating heterogeneousinformation sources. Its design is hierarchical; thus allowing it to scale well as the number ofinformation sources increases. We demonstrate the feasibility of the Pharos architectureusing 2500 Usenet newsgroups as separate collections. Each newsgroup is summarized viaautomated Library of Congress classification. We show that using Pharos as an intermediateretrieval mechanism provides acceptable accuracy of source selection compared toselecting sources using complete classification information; while maintaining good …,Proceedings of the fourth ACM conference on Digital libraries,1999,56

Incremental maintenance of path-expression views,Arsany Sawires; Junichi Tatemura; Oliver Po; Divyakant Agrawal; K SelÇuk Candan,Abstract Caching data by maintaining materialized views typically requires updating thecache appropriately to reflect dynamic source updates. Extensive research has addressedthe problem of incremental view maintenance for relational data but only few works haveaddressed it for semi-structured data. In this paper we address the problem of incrementalmaintenance of views defined over XML documents using path-expressions. The approachdescribed in this paper has the following main features that distinguish it from the previousworks:(1) The view specification language is powerful and standardized enough to be usedin realistic applications.(2) The size of the auxiliary data maintained with the views dependson the expression size and the answer size regardless of the source data size.(3) No sourceschema is assumed to exist; the source data can be any general well-formed XML …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,55
Fates: Finding a time dependent shortest path,Hae Don Chon; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract We model a moving object as a sizable physical entity equipped with GPS; wirelesscommunication capability; and a computer. Based on a grid model; we develop a distributedsystem; FATES; to manage data for moving objects in a two-dimensional space. The systemis used to provide time-dependent shortest paths for moving objects. The performance studyshows that FATES yields shorter average trip time when there is a more congested routethan any other routes in the domain space.,International Conference on Mobile Data Management,2003,55
Relative serializability: An approach for relaxing the atomicity of transactions,Vashudha Krishnaswamy; Divyakant Agrawal; John L.  Bruno; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Serializability is too strong a correctness criterion and unnecessarily restrictsconcurrency. We use the semantic information of a transaction to provide different atomicityviews of the transaction to other transactions. The proposed approach improves concurrencyand allows interleavings among transactions which are nonserializable; but whichnonetheless preserve the consistency of the database and are acceptable to the users. Wedevelop a graph-based tool whose acyclicity is both a necessary and sufficient condition forthe correctness of an execution. Our theory encompasses earlier proposals that incorporatesemantic information of transactions. Furthermore; it is the first approach that provides anefficient graph-based tool for recognizing correct schedules without imposing anyrestrictions on the application domain. Our approach is widely applicable to many …,journal of computer and system sciences,1997,55
Serializability; not serial: Concurrency control and availability in multi-datacenter datastores,Stacy Patterson; Aaron J Elmore; Faisal Nawab; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract We present a framework for concurrency control and availability in multi-datacenterdatastores. While we consider Google's Megastore as our motivating example; we definegeneral abstractions for key components; making our solution extensible to any system thatsatisfies the abstraction properties. We first develop and analyze a transaction managementand replication protocol based on a straightforward implementation of the Paxos algorithm.Our investigation reveals that this protocol acts as a concurrency prevention mechanismrather than a concurrency control mechanism. We then propose an enhanced protocolcalled Paxos with Combination and Promotion (Paxos-CP) that provides true transactionconcurrency while requiring the same per instance message complexity as the basic Paxosprotocol. Finally; we compare the performance of Paxos and Paxos-CP in a multi …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,54
Selectivity estimation for spatial joins with geometric selections,Chengyu Sun; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Spatial join is an expensive operation that is commonly used in spatial databasesystems. In order to generate efficient query plans for the queries involving spatial joinoperations; it is crucial to obtain accurate selectivity estimates for these operations. In thispaper we introduce a framework for estimating the selectivity of spatial joins constrained bygeometric selections. The center piece of the framework is Euler Histogram; whichdecomposes the estimation process into estimations on vertices; edges and faces. Based onthe characteristics of different datasets; different probabilistic models can be plugged into theframework to provide better estimation results. To demonstrate the effectiveness of thisframework; we implement it by incorporating two existing probabilistic models; and comparethe performance with the Geometric Histogram [1] and the algorithm recently proposed by …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2002,54
Query processing for moving objects with space-time grid storage model,Hae Don Chon; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,With the growing popularity of mobile computing devices and wireless communications;managing dynamically changing information about moving objects is becoming feasible. Inthis paper we implement a system that manages such information and propose an efficientrange query algorithm with a filtering step which efficiently determines if a polylinecorresponding to the trajectory of a moving object intersects with a given range. We studythe performance of the system; which shows that despite the filtering step; for moderatelylarge ranges; the range query algorithm we propose outperforms the algorithm withoutfiltering.,Mobile Data Management; 2002.

Low-latency multi-datacenter databases using replicated commit,Hatem Mahmoud; Faisal Nawab; Alexander Pucher; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Web service providers have been using NoSQL datastores to provide scalabilityand availability for globally distributed data at the cost of sacrificing transactionalguarantees. Recently; major web service providers like Google have moved towardsbuilding storage systems that provide ACID transactional guarantees for globally distributeddata. For example; the newly published system; Spanner; uses Two-Phase Commit and Two-Phase Locking to provide atomicity and isolation for globally distributed data; running on topof Paxos to provide fault-tolerant log replication. We show in this paper that it is possible toprovide the same ACID transactional guarantees for multi-datacenter databases with fewercross-datacenter communication trips; compared to replicated logging. Instead of replicatingthe transactional log; we replicate the commit operation itself; by running Two-Phase …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,52
Why go logarithmic if we can go linear?: Towards effective distinct counting of search traffic,Ahmed Metwally; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Estimating the number of distinct elements in a large multiset has severalapplications; and hence has attracted active research in the past two decades. Severalsampling and sketching algorithms have been proposed to accurately solve this problem.The goal of the literature has always been to estimate the number of distinct elements whileusing minimal resources. However; in some modern applications; the accuracy of theestimate is of primal importance; and businesses are willing to trade more resources forbetter accuracy. Throughout our experience with building a distinct count system at a majorsearch engine; Ask. com; we reviewed the literature of approximating distinct counts; andcompared most algorithms in the literature. We deduced that Linear Counting; one of theleast used algorithms; has unique and impressive advantages when the accuracy of the …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,52

SPiDeR organizes the serviceproviders into a structured P2P overlay and allows them to advertise and lookup services ina completely decentralized and dynamic manner. It supports three different kinds of searchoperations: For advertising and locating services; service providers can use keywordsextracted from service descriptions (keyword-based search); categories from a globalontology (ontology-based search); and/or paths from the service automaton (behavior-basedsearch). The users can also rate the quality of the services they use. The ratings areaccumulated within the system so that users can query for the quality ratings of thediscovered services. Finally; we present the performance of SPiDeR in terms of routing …,International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing,2005,52
Geoscope: Online detection of geo-correlated information trends in social networks,Ceren Budak; Theodore Georgiou; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract The First Law of Geography states" Everything is related to everything else; but nearthings are more related than distant things". This spatial significance has implications invarious applications; trend detection being one of them. In this paper we propose a newalgorithmic tool; GeoScope; to detect geo-trends. GeoScope is a data streams solution thatdetects correlations between topics and locations in a sliding window; in addition toanalyzing topics and locations independently. GeoScope offers theoretical guarantees fordetecting all trending correlated pairs while requiring only sub-linear space and runningtime.

Bounded inconsistency for type-specific concurrency control,Man Hon Wong; Divyakant Agrawal; Hang Kwong Mak,Abstract The traditional correctness criterion of serializability indatabases is considered toorestrictive especially whendatabases are used to model advanced applications. In general;two approaches are adopted to address this problem. The firstapproach considers placingmore structure on data objects toexploit type specific properties while keepingserializabilityas the correctness criterion. The other approach uses explicitsemantics oftransactions and databases to permit interleavedexecutions of transactions that are non-serializable. In thispaper; we attempt to bridge the gap between the two approachesby usingthe notion of serializability with boundedinconsistency. Users are free to specify themaximum level ofinconsistency that can be allowed in the executions ofoperationsdynamically. In particular; if no inconsistency isallowed in the execution of any operation …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,1997,49

Process synchronization in workflow management systems,Gustavo Alonso; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Workflow management systems automate the execution of business processes allowing theconcurrent execution of multiple process instances. Existing systems do not provide amechanism to guarantee correct concurrent execution and; as a result; it is not possible tocoordinate and synchronize different process instances. Part of the problem is thatconventional techniques are not entirely suitable for workflow environments. In databases;locks are the basic mechanism. In operating systems; this is achieved using semaphores ormonitors. Neither of these approaches is appropriate for workflow applications. A method isproposed to enforce correct interleavings and guarantee mutual exclusion; as defined by theuser; between concurrent workflow processes.

PRISM: indexing multi-dimensional data in P2P networks using reference vectors,Ozgur D Sahin; Aziz Gulbeden; Fatih Emekçi; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems research has gained considerable attention recentlywith the increasing popularity of file sharing applications. Since these applications are usedfor sharing huge amounts of data; it is very important to efficiently locate the data of interestin such systems. However; these systems usually do not provide efficient search techniques.Existing systems offer only keyword search functionality through a centralized index or byquery flooding. In this paper; we propose a scheme based on reference vectors for sharingmulti-dimensional data in P2P systems. This scheme effectively supports a larger set ofquery operations (such as k-NN queries and content-based similarity search) than currentsystems; which generally support only exact key lookups and keyword searches.

Query relaxation by structure and semantics for retrieval of logical web documents,Wen-Syan Li; K. Selcuk  Candan; Quoc Vu; Divyakant Agrawal,Since the Web encourages hypertext and hypermedia document authoring (eg; HTML orXML); Web authors tend to create documents that are composed of multiple pagesconnected with hyperlinks. A Web document may be authored in multiple ways; such as:(1)all information in one physical page; or (2) a main page and the related information inseparate linked pages. Existing Web search engines; however; return only physical pagescontaining keywords.

Concentric hyperspaces and disk allocation for fast parallel range searching,Hakan Ferhatosmanoglu; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Data partitioning and declustering have been extensively used in the past to parallelize I/Ofor range queries. Numerous declustering and disk allocation techniques have beenproposed in the literature. However most of these techniques were primarily designed fortwo-dimensional data and for balanced partitioning of the data space. As databasesincreasingly integrate multimedia information in the form of image; video; and audio data; itis necessary to extend the declustering techniques for multidimensional data. We firstestablish that traditional declustering techniques do not scale for high-dimensional data. Wethen propose several new partitioning schemes based on concentric hyperspaces. We thendevelop disk allocation methods for each of the proposed schemes. We conclude with anevaluation of range queries based on these schemes and show that partitioning based on …,Data Engineering; 1999. Proceedings.; 15th International Conference on,1999,46

Research efforts over thelast decade have resulted in a number of efficient algorithms with varying degrees of spaceand time complexities. While these techniques are developed in a standard CPU setting;many of their applications such as click-fraud detection and network-traffic summarizationtypically execute on special networking architectures called Network Processing Units(NPUs). These NPUs interface with special associative memories known as Ternary ContentAddressable Memories (TCAMs) to provide gigabit rate forwarding at network routers.

The development shows that in terms of I/Outilization; the flexible retrieval model (FRM) is very beneficial and results in significantperformance improvements when compared to existing placement techniques for relationaldata. It is also cache-friendly by retrieving only the relevant values required for evaluating aquery; in this way; it further pushes some of the ideas earlier developed in Partition AttributesAcross (PAX) by not only avoiding cache pollution; but also memory pollution.

Limitations of generating a secret key using wireless fading under active adversary,Murtaza Zafer; Dakshi Agrawal; Mudhakar Srivatsa,Abstract Recently; many research studies have explored the use of wireless fading togenerate an information-theoretic shared secret key over an open wireless channel. Whilethis line of research is now mature enough to be built into demonstrative working systems forscenarios involving a (limited) passive/eavesdropping adversary model; the case of anactive (jamming) adversary has not been sufficiently studied.

Range Cube: Efficient cube computation by exploiting data correlation,Ying Feng; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Ahmed Metwally,Data cube computation and representation are prohibitively expensive in terms of time andspace. Prior work has focused on either reducing the computation time or condensing therepresentation of a data cube. We introduce range cubing as an efficient way to computeand compress the data cube without any loss of precision. A new data structure; range trie; isused to compress and identify correlation in attribute values; and compress the input datasetto effectively reduce the computational cost. The range cubing algorithm generates acompressed cube; called range cube; which partitions all cells into disjoint ranges. Eachrange represents a subset of cells with the same aggregation value; as a tuple which has thesame number of dimensions as the input data tuples. The range cube preserves the roll-up/drill-down semantics of a data cube. Compared to H-cubing; experiments on real …,Data Engineering; 2004. Proceedings. 20th International Conference on,2004,43
Using space-time grid for efficient management of moving objects,Hae Don Chon; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Efficient storage and retrieval of moving objects in DBMS have received significantinterest recently. There are applications that would benefit from the management ofdynamically changing information about moving objects. In this paper; we develop a systemthat manages such information interacting with moving objects. We model the space-timedomain space as a grid (Space-Time Grid) and model the trajectory of a moving object as apolyline in the Space-Time Grid. The polyline is the result of the interactions among othermoving objects. In this paper; the insertion algorithm and several other query processingalgorithms are presented.,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM international workshop on Data engineering for wireless and mobile access,2001,43
Issues and evaluations of caching solutions for web application acceleration,Wen-Syan Li; Wang-Pin Hsiung; Dmitri V Kalashnikov; Radu Sion; Oliver Po; Divyakant Agrawal; K Selçuk Candan,Response time and reliability are two key points of differentiation among e-commerce Websites. In business terms; the brand name of an e-commerce site is correlated to the type ofexperience users receive. The need to account for users' quality perception in designingWeb servers for e-commerce systems has been highlighted in this chapter. Snafus and slow-downs at major Web sites during special events or peak times demonstrate the difficulty ofscaling up e-commerce sites. Slow response times and down times can be devastating for e-commerce sites. In technical terms; ensuring the timely delivery of fresh dynamic content toend-users and engineering highly scalable e-commerce Web sites for special peak accesstimes put heavy demand on IT staff. This is compounded by the ever-changing complexity ofe-commerce applications. For many e-commerce applications; Web pages are created …,*,2002,42
Content-based similarity search over peer-to-peer systems,Ozgur D Sahin; Fatih Emekci; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Peer-to-peer applications are used to share large volumes of data. An importantrequirement of these systems is efficient methods for locating the data of interest in a largecollection of data. Unfortunately current peer-to-peer systems either offer exact keywordmatch functionality or provide inefficient text search methods through centralized indexing orflooding. In this paper we propose a method based on popular Information Retrievaltechniques to facilitate content-based searches in peer-to-peer systems. A simulation of theproposed design was implemented and its performance was evaluated using somecommonly used test collections; including Ohsumed which was used for the TREC-9Filtering Track. The experiments demonstrate that our approach is scalable as it achieveshigh recall by visiting only a small subset of the peers.,International Workshop on Databases; Information Systems; and Peer-to-Peer Computing,2004,41

Supporting sliding window queries for continuous data streams,Lin Qiao; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Although traditional databases and data warehouses have been exploited widely to managepersistent data; a large number of applications from sensor network need functionalsupports for transient data in the continuous data stream. One of the crucial functions is tosummarize the data items within a sliding window. A sliding window contains a fixed widthspan of data elements. The data items are implicitly deleted from the sliding window; when itmoves out of the window scope. Several one-dimensional histograms have been proposedto store the succinct time information in a sliding window. Such histograms; however; onlyhandle the data items with attribute values in unary domains. In this paper; we explore theproblem of extending the value to a multi-valued domain.

The available evidence implicating the involvement of oxidative stress in thecaries process suggests that local antioxidant status may be of importance in determiningthe susceptibility to the caries process. Aim. The aim of this study was to estimate the totalantioxidant capacity (TAC) in unstimulated saliva of healthy children with and without severeearly childhood caries (S-ECC) and to correlate the individual TAC level with dmft (d=decayed; m= missing; f= filled; t= teeth) score and age.

Space-efficient data cubes for dynamic environments,Mirek Riedewald; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Renato Pajarola,Abstract Data cubes provide aggregate information to support the analysis of the contents ofdata warehouses and databases. An important tool to analyze data in data cubes is therange query. For range queries that summarize large regions of massive data cubes;computing the query result on-the-fly can result in non-interactive response times. To speedup range queries; values that summarize regions of the data cube are precomputed andstored. This faster response time results in more expensive updates and/or space overhead.While the emphasis is typically on low query and update costs; growing data collectionsincrease the demand for space-efficient approaches. In this paper two techniques arepresented that have the same update and query costs as earlier approaches; withoutintroducing any space overhead.,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2000,39
Mixed consistency: a model for parallel programming,Divyakant Agrawal; Manhoi Choy; Hong Va Leong; Ambuj K Singh,A general purpose parallel programming model called mixed consistency is developed fordistributed shared memory systems. This model combines two kinds of weak memoryconsistency conditions: causal memory and pipelined random access memory; and providesfour kinds of explicit synchronization operations: read locks; write locks; barriers; and awaitoperations. The resulting suite of memory and synchronization operations can be tailored tosolve most programming problems in an efficient manner. Conditions are also developedunder which the net effect of programming in this model is the same as programming withsequentially consistent memory. Several examples are included to illustrate the model andthe correctness conditions.,Proceedings of the thirteenth annual ACM symposium on Principles of distributed computing,1994,39
Live database migration for elasticity in a multitenant database for cloud platforms,Sudipto Das; Shoji Nishimura; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,ABSTRACT The growing popularity of cloud computing as a platform for deploying internetscale applications has seen a large number of web applications being deployed in thecloud. These applications (or tenants) are typically characterized by small data footprints;different schemas; and variable load patterns. Scalable multitenant database managementsystems (DBMS) running on a cluster of commodity servers are thus critical for a cloudservice provider to support a large number of small applications. Multitenant DBMSs oftencollocate multiple tenants' databases on a single server for effective resource sharing. Dueto the variability in load; elastic load balancing of tenants' data is critical for performance andcost minimization. On demand migration of tenants' databases to distribute load on anelastic cluster of machines is a critical technology for elastic load balancing. Therefore …,CS; UCSB; Santa Barbara; CA; USA; Tech.

pCube: Update-efficient online aggregation with progressive feedback and error bounds,Mirek Riedewald; Divyakant Agrawal,Multidimensional data cubes are used in large data warehouses as a tool for onlineaggregation of information. As the number of dimensions increases; supporting efficientqueries as well as updates to the data cube becomes difficult. Another problem that ariseswith increased dimensionality is the sparseness of the data space. In this paper we developa new data structure referred to as the pCube (data cube for progressive querying); tosupport efficient querying and updating of multidimensional data cubes in large datawarehouses. While the pCube concept is very general and can be applied to any type ofquery; we mainly focus on range queries that summarize the contents of regions of the datacube. pCube provides intermediate results with absolute error bounds (to allow tradingaccuracy for fast response time); efficient updates; scalability with increasing …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2000.

Efficient disk allocation for fast similarity searching,Sunil Prabhakar; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract As databases increasingly integrate non-textual information it is becomingnecessary to support efficient similarity searching in addition to range searching. Recently;declustering techniques have been proposed for improving the performance of similaritysearches through parallel I/O. In this paper; we propose a new scheme which provides gooddeclustering for similarity searching. In particular; it does global declustering as opposed tolocal declustering; exploits the availability of extra disks and does not limit the partitioning ofthe data space. Our technique is based upon the Cyclic declustering schemes which weredeveloped for range and partial match queries. We establish; in general; that Cyclicdeclustering techniques outperform previously proposed techniques.,Proceedings of the tenth annual ACM symposium on Parallel algorithms and architectures,1998,38
Characterizing tenant behavior for placement and crisis mitigation in multitenant DBMSs,Aaron J Elmore; Sudipto Das; Alexander Pucher; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Xifeng Yan,Abstract A multitenant database management system (DBMS) in the cloud mustcontinuously monitor the trade-off between efficient resource sharing among multipleapplication databases (tenants) and their performance. Considering the scale of\attn{hundreds to} thousands of tenants in such multitenant DBMSs; manual approaches forcontinuous monitoring are not tenable. A self-managing controller of a multitenant DBMSfaces several challenges. For instance; how to characterize a tenant given its variety ofworkloads; how to reduce the impact of tenant colocation; and how to detect and mitigate aperformance crisis where one or more tenants' desired service level objective (SLO) is notachieved.

Thread cooperation in multicore architectures for frequency counting over multiple data streams,Sudipto Das; Shyam Antony; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Many real-world data stream analysis applications such as network monitoring;click stream analysis; and others require combining multiple streams of data arriving frommultiple sources. This is referred to as multi-stream analysis. To deal with high stream arrivalrates; it is desirable that such systems be capable of supporting very high processingthroughput. The advent of multicore processors and powerful servers driven by theseprocessors calls for efficient parallel designs that can effectively utilize the parallelism of themulticores; since performance improvement is possible only through effective parallelism. Inthis paper; we address the problem of parallelizing multi-stream analysis in the context ofmulticore processors.

High dimensional nearest neighbor searching,Hakan Ferhatosmanoglu; Ertem Tuncel; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract As databases increasingly integrate different types of information such as time-series; multimedia and scientific data; it becomes necessary to support efficient retrieval ofmulti-dimensional data. Both the dimensionality and the amount of data that needs to beprocessed are increasing rapidly. As a result of the scale and high dimensional nature; thetraditional techniques have proven inadequate. In this paper; we propose search techniquesthat are effective especially for large high dimensional data sets. We first propose VA+-filetechnique which is based on scalar quantization of the data. VA+-file is especially useful forsearching exact nearest neighbors (NN) in non-uniform high dimensional data sets.

Furthermore; since the entire data is not available at all times themaintenance task must be done incrementally. We show that R (elaxed) Hist (ogram) is anappropriate summarization under data stream scenario. In order to reduce query estimationerrors; we propose adaptive approaches which not only capture the data distribution; butalso integrate independent query patterns. We introduce a workload decay model toefficiently capture global workload information and ensure that the query patterns from therecent past are weighted more than queries that are further in the past. We verifyexperimentally that our approach successfully adapts to continuously changing workload …,Proceedings of the eleventh international conference on Information and knowledge management,2002,37
Using automated classification for summarizing and selecting heterogeneous information sources,Ron Dolin; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Justin Pearlman,Information retrieval over the Internet increasingly requires the filtering of thousands ofheterogeneous information sources. Important sources of information include not onlytraditional databases with structured data and queries; but also increasing numbers of non-traditional; semi-or unstructured collections such as Web sites; FTP archives; etc. As thenumber and variability of sources increases; new ways of automatically summarizing;discovering; and selecting collections relevant to a user's query are needed. One suchmethod involves the use of classification schemes; such as the Library of CongressClassification (LCC)[10]; within which a collection may be represented based on its content;irrespective of the structure of the actual data or documents. For such a system to be usefulin a large-scale distributed environment; it must be easy to use for both collection …,D-Lib Magazine,1998,37
Efficient execution of read-only transactions in replicated multiversion databases,OT Satyanarayanan; Divyakant Agrawal,Multiple versions of data are used in database systems to increase concurrency. The higherconcurrency results since read-only transactions can be executed without any concurrencycontrol overhead and; therefore; read-only transactions do not interfere with the execution ofupdate transactions. Availability of data in a distributed environment is improved by datareplication. We propose a protocol for managing data in a replicated multiversionenvironment; where execution of read-only transactions or queries becomes completelyindependent of the underlying concurrency control and replica control mechanisms; and thedata availability for read-only transactions increases significantly since they can be executedas long as any one copy of the object is available in the system.

Efficient dissemination of information in computer networks,Divyakant Agrawal; A Malpani,Abstract Many distributed applications require that information be propagated in the systemefficiently. Propagation of information; as soon as it becomes known; via direct messages; isprohibitively expensive even in relatively small networks. Fortunately; in many applications;one can use lazy propagation of information; where each site eventually obtains all theinformation in the network. A common method for spreading information is by exchanginginformation logs amongst sites in the network. Several mechanisms for log propagation havealready been proposed. All these mechanisms require that information log must beaccompanied with temporal information; which is the state of the site sending the message;when the message is sent. In this paper; we eliminate the need for sending the log andtemporal components together. We demonstrate that the separation of these two …,The Computer Journal,1991,37

Efficient retrieval of multidimensional datasets through parallel I/O,Sunil Prabhakar; Khaled Abdel-Ghaffar; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Many scientific and engineering applications process large multidimensional datasets. Animportant access pattern for these applications is the retrieval of data corresponding toranges of values in multiple dimensions. Performance is limited by disk largely due to highdisk latencies. Tiling and distributing the data across multiple disks is an effective techniquefor improving performance through parallel I/O. The distribution of tiles across the disks is animportant factor in achieving gains. Several schemes for declustering multidimensional datato improve the performance of range queries have been proposed in the literature. Weextend the class of cyclic schemes which have been developed earlier for two-dimensionaldata to multiple dimensions.

Generalizing PIR for practical private retrieval of public data,Shiyuan Wang; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Private retrieval of public data is useful when a client wants to query a public dataservice without revealing the query to the server. Computational Private InformationRetrieval (c PIR) achieves complete privacy for clients; but is deemed impractical since itinvolves expensive computation on all the data on the server. Besides; it is inflexible if theserver wants to charge the client based on the service data that is exposed. k-Anonymity; onthe other hand; is flexible and cheap for anonymizing the querying process; but is vulnerableto privacy and security threats. We propose a practical and flexible approach for the privateretrieval of public data called Bounding-Box PIR (bb PIR). Using bb PIR; a client specifiesboth privacy requirements and a service charge budget. The server satisfies the client'srequirements; and achieves overall good performance in computation and …,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2010,34

The performance of protocols based on locks with ordered sharing,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; AE Lang,There is growing evidence that for a wide variety of database workloads and systemconfigurations; locking-based concurrency control outperforms other types of concurrencycontrol strategies. However; in the presence of increased data contention; locking protocolssuch as two-phase locking perform poorly. In this paper; we analyze a family of locking-based protocols that employ a new relationship between locks called ordered sharing.Using a centralized database simulation model; we demonstrate that these protocols exhibitcomparable performance to that of traditional locking-based protocols when data contentionis low; and they exhibit superior performance when data contention is high. Furthermore; weshow that the performance of these protocols improves as resources become more plentiful.This is particularly significant because the performance of two-phase locking degrades as …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1994,33
Using multiversion data for non-interfering execution of write-only transactions,Divyakant Agrawal; Vasudha Krishnaswamy,Abstract A modular version control mechanism is developed for executing write-onlytransactions with minimal interference to read-write transactions using multiversion data.The execution of write-only transactions is completely independent of the underlyingconcurrency control protocol. The version control mechanism provides the versatility of usingany conflict-baaed concurrency control protocol for read-write transaction synchronization.An integrated version control mechanism is presented in which both read-only and write-only transactions are handled symmetrically; and are independent of the concurrencycontrol mechanism. In addition; there is negligible version control related overhead forexecuting read-only and write-only transactions.

Using reconfiguration for efficient management of replicated data,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Replicated data management protocols have been proposed that exploit a logicallystructured set of copies. These protocols have the advantage that they provide limited fault-tolerance at low communication cost. The proposed protocols can be viewed as analoguesof the read-one write-all protocol in the context of logical structures. In this paper; we start bygeneralizing these protocols in two ways for logical structures. First; the quorum-basedapproach is applied to develop protocols that use structured read and write quorums; thusattaining a high degree of data availability for both read and write operations. Next; thereconfiguration or views approach is developed for these structures; resulting in protocolsthat attain high degrees of availability at significantly low communication cost for readoperations. In this sense; the proposed protocols have the advantages of the read-one …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1996,32
A non-restrictive concurrency control for object oriented databases,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract We propose an algorithm for executing transactions in object oriented databases.The object oriented database model generalizes the classical model of databaseconcurrency control by permitting accesses to class and instance objects; by permittingarbitrary operations on objects as opposed to traditional read and write operations; and byallowing for the nested execution of transactions on objects. In this paper; we first develop auniform methodology for treating both classes and instances. We then develop a two phaselocking protocol with a new relationship between locks called ordered sharing for an objectoriented database. Ordered sharing does not restrict the execution of conflicting operations.Finally; we extend the protocol to allow for nesting. The resulting protocol permits moreconcurrency that other known locking-based protocols.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,1992,32

Scalable filtering of multiple generalized-tree-pattern queries over XML streams,Songting Chen; Hua-Gang Li; Jun'ichi Tatemura; Wang-Pin Hsiung; Divyakant Agrawal; K Selçuk Candan,An XML publish/subscribe system needs to filter a large number of queries over XMLstreams. Most existing systems only consider filtering the simple XPath statements. In thispaper; we focus on filtering of the more complex generalized-tree-pattern (GTP) queries. Ourfiltering mechanism is based on a novel Tree-of-Path (TOP) encoding scheme; whichcompactly represents the path matches for the entire document. First; we show that the TOPencodings can be efficiently produced via a shared bottom-up path matching. Second; withthe aid of this TOP encoding; we can (1) achieve polynomial time and space complexity forpost processing;(2) avoid redundant predicate evaluations;(3) allow an efficient duplicate-free and merge join-based algorithm for merging multiple encoded path matches and (4)simplify the processing of GTP queries.

Sleuth: Single-publisher attack detection using correlation hunting,Ahmed Metwally; Fatih Emekçi; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Several data management challenges arise in the context of Internet advertisingnetworks; where Internet advertisers pay Internet publishers to display advertisements ontheir Web sites and drive traffic to the advertisers from surfers' clicks. Although advertiserscan target appropriate market segments; the model allows dishonest publishers to defraudthe advertisers by simulating fake traffic to their own sites to claim more revenue. This paperaddresses the case of publishers launching fraud attacks from numerous machines; which isthe most widespread scenario. The difficulty of uncovering these attacks is proportional tothe number of machines and resources exploited by the fraudsters. In general; detecting thisclass of fraud entails solving a new data mining problem; which is finding correlations inmultidimensional data. Since the dimensions have large cardinalities; the search space is …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,30
Engineering and hosting adaptive freshness-sensitive web applications on data centers,Wen-Syan Li; Oliver Po; Wang-Pin Hsiung; K Selçuk Candan; Divyakant Agrawal,Abstract Wide-area database replication technologies and the availability of content deliverynetworks allow Web applications to be hosted and served from powerful data centers. Thisform of application support requires a complete Web application suite to be distributed alongwith the database replicas. A major advantage of this approach is that dynamic content isserved from locations closer to users; leading into reduced network latency and fastresponse times. However; this is achieved at the expense of overheads due to (a)invalidation of cached dynamic content in the edge caches and (b) synchronization ofdatabase replicas in the data center. These have adverse effects on the freshness ofdelivered content. In this paper; we propose a freshness-driven adaptive dynamic contentcaching; which monitors the system status and adjusts caching policies to provide content …,Proceedings of the 12th international conference on World Wide Web,2003,30

Billiard quorums on the grid,Divyakant Agrawal; Ömer Eğecioğlu; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Maekawa considered a simple but suboptimal grid based quorum generationscheme in which N sites in a network are logically organized in the form of a√ N×√ N grid;and the quorum sets are row-column pairs. Even though the quorum size 2√ N of the gridscheme is twice as large as finite projective plane based optimal size quorums; it has theadvantage of being simple and geometrically evident. In this paper we construct grid basedquorums which use a modified grid; and paths that resemble billiard ball paths instead ofhorizontal and vertical line segments of rows and columns in the grid scheme. The size ofthese quorums is√ 2√ N. The construction and its properties are geometrically evident asin the case of Maekawa's grid; and the quorum sets can be generated efficiently.,Information Processing Letters,1997,30
Algorithms for the structural diagnosis and decomposition of sparse; underconstrained design systems,Natarajan Sridhar; Rajiv Agrawal; Gary L Kinzel,Abstract Most design systems and variational geometry scenarios are represented by a setof sparse constraints. Typically; such a system is underconstrained and is solved in aninteractive framework by the specification of additional constraints (inputs) by the designer.At the onset of the design solution process; and also after every input operation; it must bedetermined if the complete set of design constraints (both initial and input) has anyredundancies. This defines the structural diagnosis problem. The set of variables andconstraints that can then be solved (solution set) has to be identified; along with the mostefficient order of solving them. This is the structural decomposition problem. It has beendemonstrated in literature that occurrence matrices can be used to represent the structure ofdesign systems. In this context; the diagnosis of the design system can be accomplished …,Computer-Aided Design,1996,30
An energy-based model to predict wear in nanocrystalline diamond atomic force microscopy tips,R Agrawal; N Moldovan; HD Espinosa,Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is one of the most powerful techniques to probe surfaces andmaterial properties at the nanoscale; and pattern organic and inorganic molecules. In allcases; knowledge of the tip geometry and its evolution with continued use is essential. In thiswork; a broadly applicable energy model for the evolution of scanning probe tip radii duringuse is presented based on quantitative wear experiments. Experiments were conductedusing AFM probes made of both undoped and nitrogen-doped diamond. Undoped diamondprobes were found to be nearly ten times more wear resistant than commercially availablesilicon nitride probes. For a constant applied force; a linear relationship between wearvolume and total dissipation energy is identified. The change in tip radius was also found tobe proportional to the square root of scan distance; x 0.5.,Journal of Applied Physics,2009,29
Resilient logical structures for efficient management of replicated data,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Replicated data management protocols have been pro posed that exploit a logicallystructured set of copies. These protocols have the advantage that they provide limited fault-tolerance at low communication cost. The propceed protocols can be viewed as analoguesof the read-one write-all protocol in the context of logical structures. In this paper; theseprotocols are generalized in two ways for a grid and a tree structure. First; the quorum basedapproach is applied to develop protocols that use structured read and write quorums; thusattaining a high degree of data availability for both read and write operations. Next; thereconfiguration or views approach is developed for both grid and tree structures resulting inprotocols that attain high degrees of availability at significantly low communication cost forread operations. In this sense; the proposed protocols have the advantages of the …,VLDB,1992,29
Squall: Fine-grained live reconfiguration for partitioned main memory databases,Aaron J Elmore; Vaibhav Arora; Rebecca Taft; Andrew Pavlo; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract For data-intensive applications with many concurrent users; modern distributedmain memory database management systems (DBMS) provide the necessary scale-outsupport beyond what is possible with single-node systems. These DBMSs are optimized forthe short-lived transactions that are common in on-line transaction processing (OLTP)workloads. One way that they achieve this is to partition the database into disjoint subsetsand use a single-threaded transaction manager per partition that executes transactions one-at-a-time in serial order. This minimizes the overhead of concurrency control mechanisms;but requires careful partitioning to limit distributed transactions that span multiple partitions.Previous methods used off-line analysis to determine how to partition data; but the dynamicnature of these applications means that they are prone to hotspots. In these situations; the …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,28
eCEO: an efficient Cloud Epistasis cOmputing model in genome-wide association study,Zhengkui Wang; Yue Wang; Kian-Lee Tan; Limsoon Wong; Divyakant Agrawal,Abstract Motivation: Recent studies suggested that a combination of multiple singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) could have more significant associations with a specificphenotype. However; to discover epistasis; the epistatic interactions of SNPs; in a largenumber of SNPs; is a computationally challenging task. We are; therefore; motivated todevelop efficient and effective solutions for identifying epistatic interactions of SNPs. Results:In this article; we propose an efficient Cloud-based Epistasis cOmputing (eCEO) model forlarge-scale epistatic interaction in genome-wide association study (GWAS). Given a largenumber of combinations of SNPs; our eCEO model is able to distribute them to balance theload across the processing nodes. Moreover; our eCEO model can efficiently process eachcombination of SNPs to determine the significance of its association with the phenotype …,Bioinformatics,2011,28
The reality of real-time business intelligence,Divyakant Agrawal,Abstract Real-time Business Intelligence has emerged as a new technology solution toprovide timely data-driven analysis of enterprise wide data and information. Such type ofdata analysis is needed for both tactical as well as strategic decision making tasks within anenterprise. Unfortunately; there is no clarity about the critical technology components thatdistinguish a real-time business intelligence system from traditional data warehousing andbusiness intelligence solutions. In this paper; we take an evolutionary approach to obtain abetter understanding of the role of real-time business intelligence in the context of enterprise-wide information infrastructures. We then propose a reference architecture for building a real-time business intelligence system. By using this reference architecture we identify the keyresearch and development challenges in the areas of data-stream analysis; complex …,International Workshop on Business Intelligence for the Real-Time Enterprise,2008,28
Scalable xml filtering with bottom up path matching and encoded path joins,*,Systems and methods to provide two bottom up path matching solutions and one postprocessing solution for evaluating value predicates and tree pattern queries. The first pathmatching method triggers the matching whenever a leaf query step is seen and stores theprefix sub-matches in a cache for reuse. The second path matching method is an NFA (non-deterministic finite state automata) based solution through a post-order traversal of the XMLdocument tree. The post processing method relies on a compact encoding the path results;which avoids redundant value predicate; join evaluations and any duplicate elimination; sortand grouping operations.,*,2008,28
Cure of antimony-unresponsive Indian post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis with oral miltefosine,Shyam Sundar; Kailash Kumar; Jaya Chakravarty; Dipti Agrawal; Shrinkhla Agrawal; Amit Chhabra; Vikram Singh,Summary We report the case of a patient with Indian post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis(PKDL) who failed to show any response to 2 months' treatment with sodium stibogluconate.Six months later he was treated with oral miltefosine on a compassionate basis as an off-label indication. Miltefosine was given 100 mg daily in divided doses for an initial 8 weeks.Due to insufficient response; the treatment was extended up to a total of 12 weeks. Thepatient showed an excellent response to treatment; and after 12 months of follow-up therewas complete healing of all cutaneous lesions. Oral miltefosine appears to be an importantalternative for the treatment of PKDL in India and confirmatory studies in controlled clinicaltrials are needed.,Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,2006,28
Range addressable network: A p2p cache architecture for data ranges,Anshul Kothari; Divyakant Agrawal; Abhishek Gupta; Subhash Suri,Peer-to-peer computing paradigm is emerging as a scalable and robust model for sharingmedia objects. We propose an architecture and describe the associated algorithms and datastructures to support the execution of range selection queries over data scattered across aP2P network especially for resource discovery in grid environments. We develop adistributed data structure referred to as a range addressable network that provides thefollowing two quality-of-service guarantees:(i) the located peer is one with the smallestsuperset of the query range (important from the application perspective); and (ii) in a P2Pnetwork of n peers; a query is routed through O (log n) peers before the intended peer isfound (important from the system perspective).

Query estimation by adaptive sampling,Yi-Leh Wu; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,The ability to provide accurate and efficient result estimations of user queries is veryimportant for the query optimizer in database systems. In this paper; we show that thetraditional estimation techniques with data reduction points of view do not producesatisfiable estimation results if the query patterns are dynamically changing. We further showthat to reduce query estimation error; instead of accurately capturing the data distribution; itis more effective to capture the user query patterns. In this paper; we propose queryestimation techniques that can adapt to user query patterns for more accurate estimates ofthe size of selection or range queries over databases.,Data Engineering; 2002.

Integrating security with fault-tolerant distributed databases,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Replication reduces the security of data in a distributed environment. In this paper;we address the issue of maintaining security in a fault-tolerant replicated database. Wepresent a protocol that combines both security and reliability aspects in a database system.Although this protocol provides the desired level of security; it does so at the expense ofavailability. By integrating a propagation mechanism with our protocol; we are able toachieve a high level of security and availability.,The Computer Journal,1990,28
Checking and repairing a network configuration,*,Disclosed is a technique for correcting a configuration problem. The configuration problem isdetected.

Method and apparatus for distributed indexing,*,Disclosed is a method and apparatus for providing range based queries over distributednetwork nodes. Each of a plurality of distributed network nodes stores at least a portion of alogical index tree. The nodes of the logical index tree are mapped to the network nodesbased on a hash function. Load balancing is addressed by replicating the logical index treenodes in the distributed physical nodes in the network. In one embodiment the logical indextree comprises a plurality of logical nodes for indexing available resources in a gridcomputing system. The distributed network nodes are broker nodes for assigning gridcomputing resources to requesting users. Each of the distributed broker nodes stores atleast a portion of the logical index tree.,*,2007,27
Safety guarantee of continuous join queries over punctuated data streams,Hua-Gang Li; Songting Chen; Junichi Tatemura; Divyakant Agrawal; K Selçuk Candan; Wang-Pin Hsiung,Abstract Continuous join queries (CJQ) are needed for correlating data from multiplestreams. One fundamental problem for processing such queries is that since the datastreams are infinite; this would require the join operator to store infinite states and eventuallyrun out of space. Punctuation semantics has been proposed to specifically address thisproblem. In particular; punctuations explicitly mark the end of a subset of data and; hence;enable purging of the stored data which will not contribute to any new query results. Given aset of available punctuation schemes; if one can identify that a CJQ still requires unboundedstorage; then this query can be flagged as unsafe and can be prevented from running.Unfortunately; while punctuation semantics is clearly useful; the mechanisms to identify ifand how a particular CJQ could benefit from a given set of punctuation schemes are not …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,27
Redesigning an active queue management system,Deepak Agrawal; Fabrizio Granelli,A robust proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is proposed for active queuemanagement (AQM). A linear quadratic regulator (LQR) method is used to design thecontroller; named LQR-PID. LQR is a robust design technique as compared to classical gain-and-phase margin and dominant pole placement methods. The LQR-PID controller marksthe packets according to queue length with a probability and notifies congestion to sources;in turn; sources adjust their send rate; thus maintaining queue length at the desired level inbottleneck routers. By maintaining queue length at the desired level; delay can be predictedand quality of service can be provided. Simulation results demonstrate the robustness andsuperiority of LQR-PID AQM as compared with other AQM schemes in the literature.,Global Telecommunications Conference; 2004. GLOBECOM'04. IEEE,2004,27
The performance of two phase commit protocols in the presence of site failures,Mei-Ling Liu; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract The two phase commit is an important protocol in distributed database systems.Much of the existing literature on the protocol is restricted to discussing and analyzing theprotocol (and its variants) in the absence of failures. Very little; especially in quantitativeterms; has been written about its performance in the presence of site failures. In this study;we use a simulation testbed of a distributed database system to quantify the differences inthe performances of four widely known variants of the 2PC protocols (the generic 2PC;presumed commit; presumed abort; and early prepare). Our study covers both the no-failurecase and the case of site failures. We present a number of interesting results based on ourexperiments. One is that the performance of these protocols is highly dependent on themessage-processing latency at the transaction coordinator site. Another is that the …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,1998,27
Modular synchronization in distributed; multiversion databases: Version control and concurrency control,Divyakant Agrawal; Soumitra Sengupta,A version control mechanism is proposed that enhances the modularity and extensibility ofmultiversion concurrency control algorithms. The multiversion algorithms are decoupled intotwo components: version control and concurrency control. This permits modulardevelopment of multiversion protocols and simplifies the task of proving the correctness ofthese protocols. A set of procedures for version control is described that defines the interfacewith the version control component. It is shown that the same interface can be used by thedatabase actions of both two-phase locking and time-stamp concurrency control protocols toaccess multiversion data. An interesting feature of the framework is that the execution ofread-only transactions becomes completely independent of the underlying concurrencycontrol implementation. Unlike other multiversion algorithms; read-only transactions in …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1993,27
A nonblocking quorum consensus protocol for replicated data,Divyakant Agrawal; Arthur J.  Bernstein,A nonblocking quorum protocol for replica control which guarantees one-copy serializabilityis developed. The effects of a nonblocking protocol are analyzed; and it is shown that thegains can be substantial under certain conditions. It is demonstrated that in order for theprotocol to be useful; it must be integrated with a propagation mechanism. It is also shownthat the access latency can be reduced significantly in a replicated environment. Aninteresting aspect of the quorum protocol is that it essentially uses a read quorom/write-quorom approach for concurrency control but uses a read-one/write-all approach for replicacontrol. It is shown that the nonblocking quorom protocol provides the same level ofavailability and fault tolerance as the quorum protocol proposed by DK Gifford (1979).,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,1991,27
Browsing large digital library collections using classification hierarchies,Steven Geffner; Divyakant Agrawal; A El Abbadi; T Smith,Abstract Summarization of intermediary query result sets plays an important role when usersbrowse through digital library collections. Summarization enables users to quickly digest theresults of their queries; and provides users with important information they can use to narrowtheir search interactively.

Engineering constraint management based on an occurrence matrix approach,R Agrawal; GL Kinzel; R Srinivasan; K Ishii,Abstract In many mechanical systems; the mathematical model can be characterized by mnonlinear equations in n unknowns. The m equations could be either equality constraints oractive inequality constraints in a constrained optimization framework. In either case; themathematical model consists of (nm) degrees of freedom; and (nm) unknowns must bespecified before the system can be analyzed. In the past; designers have often fixed the setof (nm) specification variables and computed the remaining n variables using the nequations. This paper presents constraint management algorithms that give the designercomplete freedom in the choice of design specifications. An occurrence matrix is used tostore relationships among design parameters and constraints; to identify dependenciesamong the variables; and to help prevent redundant specification.

Diffusion of information in social networks: Is it all local?,Ceren Budak; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Recent studies on the diffusion of information in social networks have largely focused onmodels based on the influence of local friends. In this paper; we challenge thegeneralizability of this approach and revive theories introduced by social scientists in thecontext of diffusion of innovations to model user behavior. To this end; we study variousdiffusion models in two different online social networks; Digg and Twitter. We first evaluatethe applicability of two representative local influence models and show that the behavior ofmost social networks users are not captured by these local models.

Supporting web query expansion efficiently using multi-granularity indexing and query processing,Wen-Syan Li; Divyakant Agrawal,Abstract The problem of word mismatch in information retrieval (IR) occurs because usersoften use different words to describe concepts in their queries than authors use to describethe same concepts in their documents. Query expansion is used to deal with the mismatchbetween author and user vocabularies. To support query expansion; indices on wordsrelated by lexical semantics and syntactical co-occurrence need to be maintained. Twoissues become paramount in supporting query expansion: the size of index tables and thequery processing overhead. In this paper; we propose to use the notion of multi-granularityfor more efficient indexing and query processing while the same degrees of precision andrecall are maintained. We also describes extensions of this technique to handle:(1) queryrelaxation to handle words with multiple senses and with other semantic relationships;(2) …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2000,24
Data warehousing alternatives for mobile environments,Ioana Stanoi; Divyakant Agrawal; A El Abbadi; Shirish Hemant Phatak; BR Badrinath,With rapid advancement in technology; mobile devices are increasingly becomino the norm.These devices are char- P acterized by their need to operate even when they are dis- connectedfrom the fixed non-mobile world.

Maintaining XPath views in loosely coupled systems,Arsany Sawires; Junichi Tatemura; Oliver Po; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract We address the problem of maintaining materialized XPath views in environmentswhere the view maintenance system and the base data system are loosely-coupled. Weshow that the recently proposed XPath view maintenance techniques require tight coupling;and thus are not practical for loosely-coupled systems. Our solution adapts to loose-couplingby using information that is fully available through standard XPath interfaces. Thisinformation consists of the view definition; the update statement; and the current materializedview result. Under this model; incremental maintenance is not always possible; thus;maintaining the consistency of the views requires frequent view recomputations. Our goal isto reduce the frequency of view recomputation by detecting cases where a base update isirrelevant to a view; and cases where a view is self maintainable given a base update.

For multiple drives; the problem is shown to be NPcomplete. Efficient and effective heuristics are presented for the multiple drives case. Thescheduling policies developed achieve significant performance gains over more naive firstcome first served policies.

Performance characteristics of protocols with ordered shared locks,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; AE Lang,A family of locking-based protocols is analyzed that use a novel mode of locks calledordered sharing. Using a centralized database simulation model; it is demonstrated thatthese protocols exhibit comparable performance to that of traditional locking-basedprotocols when data contention is low and exhibit superior performance when datacontention is high. It is shown that the performance of these protocols improves as physicalresources become more plentiful. This is particularly significant since two-phase lockingdegrades due to data and not resource contention. Thus; introducing additional resourcesimproves the performance of the proposed protocols while it does not benefit two-phaselocking significantly.,Data Engineering; 1991. Proceedings.

Progressive ranking of range aggregates,Hua-Gang Li; Hailing Yu; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Ranking-aware queries have been gaining much attention recently in manyapplications such as multimedia databases; search engines and data streams. They are;however; not only restricted to such applications but are also very useful in On-LineAnalytical Processing (OLAP) applications. In this paper; we introduce aggregation rankingqueries in OLAP data cubes motivated by an online advertisement tracking data warehouseapplication. These queries aggregate information over a specified range and then return theranked order of the aggregated values. For instance; an advertiser might be interested in thetop-k publishers over the last three months in terms of sales obtained through the onlineadvertisements placed on the publishers.

Techniques for efficient routing and load balancing in content-addressable networks,Ozgur D Sahin; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,As a distributed hash table (DHT); a content addressable network (CAN) provides efficientrouting and object location in a decentralized manner while offering fault tolerance anddynamic peer operations. However; as opposed to other DHTs that use a flat ID space; CANuses a multi-dimensional logical space. DHTs usually require O (logN) routing informationper peer and provide routing in O (logN) hops; where N is the number of peers in the system.In CAN; on the other hand; each peer keeps only constant amount of routing information andthe routing takes O (dN/sup 1/d/) hops; where d is the dimensionality of the logical space.Hence the routing performance of CAN is worse than other DHTs especially when d is small.In this paper; we describe and evaluate several schemes for efficient routing in CAN bykeeping additional routing information at the peers.

To this end; we show how for a particular method of consistent probing itis possible to have the power of SQL view queries with multiset semantics; and at the sametime have available a spectrum of concurrency from none at all as in previously proposedsolutions to the maximum concurrency obtained by issuing all probes in parallel. We thenshow how optimization of the probing process can be used to select various degrees ofconcurrency for the desired tradeoffs of concurrency against processing cost and messagesize.,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,1999,22
Hashfile: An efficient index structure for multimedia data,Dongxiang Zhang; Divyakant Agrawal; Gang Chen; Anthony KH Tung,Nearest neighbor (NN) search in high dimensional space is an essential query in manymultimedia retrieval applications. Due to the curse of dimensionality; existing indexstructures might perform even worse than a simple sequential scan of data when answeringexact NN query. To improve the efficiency of NN search; locality sensitive hashing (LSH) andits variants have been proposed to find approximate NN. They adopt hash functions that canpreserve the Euclidean distance so that similar objects have a high probability of colliding inthe same bucket. Given a query object; candidate for the query result is obtained byaccessing the points that are located in the same bucket. To improve the precision; eachhash table is associated with m hash functions to recursively hash the data points intosmaller buckets and remove the false positives. On the other hand; multiple hash tables …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,21

Secure data management service on cloud computing infrastructures,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Fatih Emekci; Ahmed Metwally; Shiyuan Wang,Abstract Data outsourcing or database as a service is a new paradigm for data managementin which a third party service provider hosts a database as a service. The service providesdata management for its customers and thus obviates the need for the service user topurchase expensive hardware and software; deal with software upgrades and hireprofessionals for administrative and maintenance tasks. Since using an external databaseservice promises reliable data storage at a low cost it is very attractive for companies. Such aservice would also provide universal access; through the Internet to private data stored atreliable and secure sites in cloud computing infrastructures. However; recent governmentallegislations; competition among companies; and data thefts mandate companies to usesecure and privacy preserving data management techniques. The data provider …,*,2011,21
Efficient integration and aggregation of historical information,Mirek Riedewald; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Data warehouses support the analysis of historical data. This often involvesaggregation over a period of time. Furthermore; data is typically incorporated in thewarehouse in the increasing order of a time attribute; eg; date of sale or time of atemperature measurement. In this paper we propose a framework to take advantage of thisappend only nature of updates due to a time attribute. The framework allows us to integratelarge amounts of new data into the warehouse and generate historical summaries efficiently.Query and update costs are virtually independent from the extent of the data set in the timedimension; making our framework an attractive aggregation approach for append-only datastreams. A specific instantiation of the general approach is developed for MOLAP datacubes; involving a new data structure for append-only arrays with pre-aggregated values …,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2002,21
Abundance of ruminal bacteria; epithelial gene expression; and systemic biomarkers of metabolism and inflammation are altered during the peripartal period in dairy...,Andrea Minuti; A Palladino; MJ Khan; S Alqarni; A Agrawal; F Piccioli-Capelli; F Hidalgo; FC Cardoso; ERMINIO Trevisi; JJ Loor,Abstract Seven multiparous Holstein cows with a ruminal fistula were used to investigate thechanges in rumen microbiota; gene expression of the ruminal epithelium; and bloodbiomarkers of metabolism and inflammation during the transition period.

Minimizing commit latency of transactions in geo-replicated data stores,Faisal Nawab; Vaibhav Arora; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Cross datacenter replication is increasingly being deployed to bring data closer tothe user and to overcome datacenter outages. The extent of the influence of wide-areacommunication on serializable transactions is not yet clear. In this work; we derive a lower-bound on commit latency. The sum of the commit latency of any two datacenters is at leastthe Round-Trip Time (RTT) between them. We use the insights and lessons learned whilederiving the lower-bound to develop a commit protocol; called Helios; that achieves lowcommit latencies. Helios actively exchanges transaction logs (history) between datacenters.The received logs are used to decide whether a transaction can commit or not. The earliestpoint in the received logs that is needed to commit a transaction is decided by Helios toensure a low commit latency. As we show in the paper; Helios is theoretically able to …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,20

An autonomic and scalable multitenant database management system(DBMS) is therefore an important component of the software stack for platforms supportingthese applications. Elastic load balancing is a key requirement for effective resourceutilization and operational cost minimization. Efficient techniques for database migration arethus essential for elasticity in a multitenant DBMS. Our vision is a DBMS where multitenancyis viewed as virtualization in the database layer; and migration is a first class notion with thesame stature as scalability; availability etc. This paper serves as the first step in thisdirection.

UQBE: uncertain query by example for web service mashup,Junichi Tatemura; Songting Chen; Fenglin Liao; Oliver Po; K Selcuk Candan; Divyakant Agrawal,Abstract The UQBE is a mashup tool for non-programmers that supports query-by-example(QBE) over a schema made up by the user without knowing the schema of the originalsources. Based on automated schema matching with uncertainty; the UQBE system returnsthe best confident results. The system lets the user refine them interactively. A tuple in thequery result is associated with lineage that is a boolean formula over schema matchingdecisions representing underlying conditions on which the corresponding tuple is includedin the result. Given binary feedbacks on tuples by the user; which are possibly imprecise; thesystem solves it as an optimization problem to refine confidence values of matchingdecisions. The demo features graphical user interaction on the UQBE system; includingquerying and refinement.,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,20
Probe: Multi-dimensional range queries in p2p networks,Ozgur D Sahin; Shyam Antony; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Structured P2P systems are effective for exact key searches in a distributedenvironment as they offer scalability; self-organization; and dynamicity. These valuableproperties also make them a candidate for more complex queries; such as range queries. Inthis paper; we describe PRoBe; a system that supports range queries over multiple attributesin P2P networks. PRoBe uses a multi-dimensional logical space for this purpose and mapsdata items onto this space based on their attribute values. The logical space is divided intohyper-rectangles; each maintained by a peer in the system. The range queries correspondto hyper-rectangles which are answered by forwarding the query to the peers responsible foroverlapping regions of the logical space. We also propose load balancing techniques andshow how cached query answers can be utilized for the efficient evaluation of similar …,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2005,20

Using wavelet decomposition to support progressive and approximate range-sum queries over data cubes,Yi-Leh Wu; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,ABSTRACT Data cubes are designed to pro vide aggregateinformation that can be used toanalyze the contents of databases and data warehouses. A range query applies anaggregation operation (eg; SUM; AVERAGE) over all selected cells in a data cube; wherethe selection is specified by providing ranges of values on different dimensions. Previousapproaches to process the range sum query on data cubes (eg; prefix sum) have low querycosts but have high update costs. We use the discrete wavelet transformation to decomposea data cube into w avelet coefficients of different resolutions. The resulting decomposed datacube can be used for progressiv eand appro ximatequery processing. This new approachcan handle clustered and sparse data gracefully and can provide efficient performance forboth queries and updates; which makes the wavelet decomposition technique suitable for …,Proceedings of the ninth international conference on Information and knowledge management,2000,20
Analysis of quorum-based protocols for distributed (k+ 1)-exclusion,Divyakant Agrawal; Ömer Egecioglu; A Abbadi,A generalization of the majority quorum for the solution of the distributed (k+ 1)-exclusionproblem is proposed. This scheme produces a family of quorums of varying sizes andavailabilities indexed by integral divisors r of k. The cases r= 1 and r= k correspond to knownmajority based quorum generation algorithms MAJ and DIV; whereas intermediate values ofr interpolate between these two extremes. A cost and availability analysis of the proposedmethods is also presented. An interesting implication of this analysis is that in a reasonablyreliable environment with a large number of sites; even protocols with low communicationcosts attain high availability.,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,1997,20

This question has been puzzling many social scientists;economists; politicians and educators for a long time. Knowing the answer to this questioncan help deliberately start such successful cascades. Many theories have been introducedin this topic by economists and social scientists and these theories have been backed bysmall numbers of case studies. In this paper; we will focus on the popular theoriesintroduced in" The Tipping Point" by Malcolm Gladwell. The basic idea is the crucial effect ofthree types of" fascinating" people that the author calls mavens; connectors and salesmenon the effectiveness of a cascade. Those people are claimed to" play a critical role in theword-of-mouth epidemics that dictate our tastes; trends and fashions".

Freshness-driven adaptive caching for dynamic content Web sites,Wen-Syan Li; Oliver Po; Wang-Pin Hsiung; K Selçuk Candan; Divyakant Agrawal,Abstract Both response time and content freshness are essential to e-commerceapplications on the Web. One option to achieve good response time is to build a highperformance Web site by deploying the state of art IT infrastructures with large network andserver capacities. With such a system architecture; freshness of the content delivered islimited by the network latency since when users receive the contents; the contents may havechanged at the server. With the wide availability of content delivery networks; many e-commerce Web applications utilize edge cache servers to cache and deliver dynamiccontents at locations much closer to users; avoiding network latency. By caching a largenumber of dynamic content pages in the edge cache servers; response time can bereduced; benefiting from higher cache hit rates. However; this is achieved at the expense …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2003,19
Active occurrence-matrix-based approach to design decomposition,Natarajan Sridhar; Rajiv Agrawal; Gary L Kinzel,Abstract An efficient algorithm is presented for decomposing constraint equations definingan engineering design. It is assumed that the design problem is modelled mathematically bym independent; nonconflicting algebraic equations (constraints) in n design variables. Thedesign procedure is initiated by specifying (or inputting)(n− m) variables; one by one. Thealgorithm uses an active occurrence-matrix approach to determine which variables can becomputed; and the most efficient sequence for computing these variables. The procedure isindependent of the order in which the input variable (s) are specified.,Computer-Aided Design,1993,19
Reducing Storage for Quorum Consensus Algorithms.,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract In this paper; we first develop a fragmentation method that reduces the storageoverhead of replicated objects. We then present a data management protocol for thesefragmented objects; and show that this protocol is a generalisation of quorum consensusalgorithms for replicated data in which objects are not fragmented. Although this protocolreduces storage requirements; it does not achieve the same level of resiliency for both readand write operations. By integrating a log-based propagation mechanism with our protocol;we are able to achieve the same level of resiliency for both read and write operations asother quorum consensus protocols; while reducing the storage cost.,VLDB,1988,19
Adaptive logging: Optimizing logging and recovery costs in distributed in-memory databases,Chang Yao; Divyakant Agrawal; Gang Chen; Beng Chin Ooi; Sai Wu,Abstract By maintaining the data in main memory; in-memory databases dramatically reducethe I/O cost of transaction processing. However; for recovery purposes; in-memory systemsstill need to flush the log to disk; which incurs a substantial number of I/Os. Recently;command logging has been proposed to replace the traditional data log (eg; ARIES logging)in in-memory databases. Instead of recording how the tuples are updated; command loggingonly tracks the transactions that are being executed; thereby effectively reducing the size ofthe log and improving the performance. However; when a failure occurs; all the transactionsin the log after the last checkpoint must be redone sequentially and this significantlyincreases the cost of recovery. In this paper; we first extend the command logging techniqueto a distributed system; where all the nodes can perform their recovery in parallel.

Is homomorphic encryption the holy grail for database queries on encrypted data?,Shiyuan Wang; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract. Homomorphic encryption has been used for supporting simple aggregations;numeric calculations on encrypted data as well as for private information retrieval. Recently;theoretical breakthroughs on homomorphic encryption resulted in fully homomorphicencryption; which is able to compute arbitrary functions on encrypted data. As a result;homomorphic encryption is generally believed to be the holy grail for solving databasequeries on encrypted data. However; there has not been a systematic study that analyzesthe use of fully homomorphic encryption for solving database queries beyond simpleaggregations and numeric calculations; such as selection; range and join queries. Ourpaper fills this gap by identifying what fully homomorphic encryption can do and what itcannot do well for supporting general database queries at a conceptual level.

Fast algorithms for heavy distinct hitters using associative memories,Nagender Bandi; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Real-time detection of worm attacks; port scans and distributed denial of service (DDoS)attacks; as network packets belonging to these security attacks flow through a networkrouter; is of paramount importance. In a typical worm attack; a worm infected host tries tospread the worm by scanning a number of other hosts thus resulting in significant number ofnetwork connections at an intermediate router. Detecting such attacks amounts to finding allhosts that are associated with unusually high number of other hosts; which is equivalent tosolving the classic heavy distinct hitter problem over data streams. While several heavydistinct hitter solutions have been proposed and evaluated in a standard CPU setting; mostof the above applications typically execute on special networking architectures callednetwork processing units (NPUs).

Cache Portal: Technology for Accelerating Database-driven e-commerce Web Sites.,Wen-Syan Li; K Selçuk Candan; Wang-Pin Hsiung; Oliver Po; Divyakant Agrawal; Qiong Luo; Wei-Kuang Waine Huang; Yusuf Akca; Cemal Yilmaz,Response time is one key point of differentiation among electronic commerce (e-commerce)Web sites. Snafu and slow-downs at major Web sites during special events or peak timesdemonstrate the difficulty of scaling up ecommerce sites. Such slow response times anddown times can be devastating for e-commerce sites as indicated in a recent study by ZonaResearch [1] on the relationship between Web page download time and user abandonmentrate. The study shows that only 2% of users will leave a Web site (ie abandonment rate) ifthe download time is less than 7 seconds. However; The abandonment rate goes up to 70%when the download time is around 12 seconds.

On the implementation of the quorum concensus protocol,ML Liu; D Agrawal; A El Abbadi,Abstract Although replica control has been the subject of intensive research; it has yet tofulfill its promise in practical applications. A major reason for this lack of acceptance is thecomplexity of the implementation of these protocols. This paper describes a simple andefficient implementational approach for one such protocols; the quorum consensus protocol.1 Introduction Replicated data is employed in distributed databases to enhance dataavailability: multiple copies of a critical data item are maintained on different sites; so that thedata item can be retrieved even if some copies of the data item cannot be accessed due tosystem failures. However; this benefit of data availability is only realized at the cost ofelaborate algorithms that hide the underlying complexity of maintaining multiple copies of asingle data item.

CloudOptimizer: Multi-tenancy for I/O-bound OLAP workloads,Hatem A Mahmoud; Hyun Jin Moon; Yun Chi; Hakan Hacıgümüş; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El-Abbadi,Abstract Consolidation of multiple databases on the same server allows service providers tosave significant resources because many production database servers are often under-utilized. Recent research investigates the problem of minimizing the number of serversrequired to host a set of tenants when the working sets of tenants are kept in main memory(eg; in-memory OLAP workloads; or OLTP workloads); thus the memory assigned to eachtenant; as well as the I/O bandwidth and CPU time; are all dictated by the working set size ofthe tenant. Other research investigates the reverse problem when the number of servers isfixed; but the amount of resources allocated to different tenants on the same server needs tobe configured to optimize a cost function. In this paper we investigate the problem whenneither the number of servers nor the amount of resources allocated to each tenant are …,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2013,17
Analysis of bursty packet loss characteristics on underutilized links using SNMP,Seung-Hwa Chung; Deepali Agrawal; Myung-Sup Kim; James W Hong; Kihong Park,Abstract–ISPs typically provide sufficient bandwidth according to increasing trafficrequirements. However; in the case of QoS-sensitive applications such as VoIP; servicequality may not be up to expectations even in underutilized links because of sporadic butnonnegligible losses due to traffic bursts. This study aims to detect and analyze packet losscharacteristics on underutilized links in an enterprise IP intranet environment. We collectedpacket loss data from various routers and switches deployed on POSTECH's campusnetwork. To obtain the packet loss information; we fetched data from private and standardSNMP MIB variables of the monitored routers and switches. We analyzed the data andidentified parts that are representative of packet loss across three time scales: 5min; 5secand 1sec.

Binocular: a system monitoring framework,Fatih Emekci; Sezai E Tuna; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Recent advances in hardware technology facilitate applications requiring a largenumber of sensor devices; where each sensor device has computational; storage; andcommunication capabilities. However these sensors are subject to certain constraints suchas limited power; high communication cost; low computation capability; presence of noise inreadings and low bandwidth. Since sensor devices are powered by ordinary batteries;power is a limiting resource in sensor networks and power consumption is dominated bycommunication. In order to reduce power consumption; we propose to use a linear model oftemporal; spatial and spatio-temporal correlations among sensor readings. With this model;readings of all sensors can be estimated using the readings of a few sensors by using linearobservers and multiple queries can be answered more efficiently.

The performance of two-phase commit protocols in the presence of site failures,ML Liu; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Much of the existing literature on the two phase commit protocol is restricted to discussingand analyzing the protocol (and its variants) in the absence of failure. Very little; especially inquantitative terms; has been written about its performance in the presence of site failures.We use a simulation test bed of a distributed database system to quantify the differences inthe performances of four 2PC protocols (the generic 2PC; presumed commit; presumedabort; and early prepare). Our study covers both the no-failure case and the case of sitefailures. We present a number of interesting experimental results. One is that theperformance of these protocols is highly dependent on the message-processing latency atthe transaction coordinator site. Another is that the presumed abort protocol does notnecessarily yield better performance in the presence of site failures.,Fault-Tolerant Computing; 1994. FTCS-24.

Replicated objects in time warp simulations,Divyakant Agrawal; Jonathan R Agre,ABSTRACT The simulation objects in a Time Warp distributed; discrete event simulationsystem can be replicated in order to gain improvements in both performance and faulttolerance. Performance can be increased by having copies of frequently used objects atmultiple sites; reducing the message traffic and delays. This represents a tradeoff since thereis overhead involved in maintaining the consistency of the various copies. In general; thereare advantages if the ratio of state modifying operations versus state observing operations issmall. However; the replicated object can also be used aa the basis of a new technique forincreasing performance of fault tolerant systems called Optimistic Fault Tolerance(OFT).

Dividing secrets to secure data outsourcing,Fatih Emekci; Ahmed Methwally; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Data outsourcing or database as a service is a new paradigm for datamanagement. The third party service provider hosts databases as a service. These partiesprovide efficient and cheap data management by obviating the need to purchase expensivehardware and software; deal with software upgrades and hire professionals foradministrative and maintenance tasks. However; due to recent governmental legislations;competition among companies and database thefts; companies cannot use databaseservice providers directly. They need secure and privacy preserving data managementtechniques to be able to use them in practice.

In our recent experimental work we demonstrated how this can beachieved with an ultra-scalable switching architecture reaching multi-terabits per second (10-100 Tb/s) in a single chassis. The implemented testbed uses only off-the-shelf optical andelectronic components. The scalability of this architecture is the direct outcome of how globaltime (ie; UTC-coordinated universal time) and pipeline forwarding are utilized. The paperpresents the design of a prototype switch and experimental activity with it.,Communications; 2007. ICC'07. IEEE International Conference on,2007,16
Modeling and maintaining multi-view data warehouses,Ioana Stanoi; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Data warehouses are designed mostly as centralized systems; and the majority ofupdate maintenance algorithms are tailored for this specific model. Maintenance methodshave been proposed either under the assumption of a single view data warehouse; a multi-view centralized model; or a multi-view distributed system with strict synchronizationrestrictions. We argue that extending this model to a multi-view distributed one; is a practicalgeneralization of the data warehouse system; andt he basis for a growing number ofapplications basedon the idea of cooperative views. In this paper we develop a generalframework for modeling the maintenance of multi-views in a distributed; decentralized datawarehouse; together with an efficient incremental algorithm for view maintenance.

Additivity rule for the softness parameter in alkali halides,Jai Shanker; DP Agrawal; Ram Pal Singh,Abstract In the present communication we report an additivity rule for the repulsive potentialsoftness parameter in alkali halides derived from the values of overlap integrals. This ruleprovides a new interpretation for the repulsive interactions between different ion pairs andreduces the number of parameters. The use of additivity rule eliminates the assumption thatthe anion-anion; anion-cation and cation-cation softness parameters are equal. Using thenew model for repulsive interactions we have calculated the cohesive energy andcompressibility of sixteen alkali halides with NaCl structure. The results obtained in thepresent study are in better agreement with experiment than those obtained earlier with thehelp of a traditional approach based on the Born model.,Solid State Communications,1979,16
Scalable data cube analysis over big data,Zhengkui Wang; Yan Chu; Kian-Lee Tan; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr EI Abbadi; Xiaolong Xu,Abstract: Data cubes are widely used as a powerful tool to provide multidimensional views indata warehousing and On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP). However; with increasingdata sizes; it is becoming computationally expensive to perform data cube analysis. Theproblem is exacerbated by the demand of supporting more complicated aggregate functions(eg CORRELATION; Statistical Analysis) as well as supporting frequent view updates in datacubes. This calls for new scalable and efficient data cube analysis systems. In this paper; weintroduce HaCube; an extension of MapReduce; designed for efficient parallel data cubeanalysis on large-scale data by taking advantages from both MapReduce (in terms ofscalability) and parallel DBMS (in terms of efficiency). We also provide a general data cubematerialization algorithm which is able to facilitate the features in MapReduce-like …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1311.5663,2013,15

Browsing and placement of multi-resolution images on parallel disks,Sunil Prabhakar; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Ambuj Singh; Terence Smith,Abstract. With rapid advances in computer and communication technologies; there is anincreasing demand to build and maintain large image repositories. To reduce the demandson I/O and network resources; multi-resolution representations are being proposed for thestorage organization of images. Image decomposition techniques such as wavelets can beused to provide these multi-resolution images. The original image is represented by severalcoefficients; one of them with visual similarity to the original image; but at a lower resolution.These visually similar coefficients can be thought of as thumbnails or icons of the originalimage. This paper addresses the problem of storing these multi-resolution coefficients ondisks so that thumbnail browsing as well as image reconstruction can be performedefficiently. Several strategies are evaluated to store the image coefficients on parallel …,Multimedia systems,2003,15
Evaluations of architectural designs and implementation for database-driven web sites,Wen-Syan Li; Wang-Pin Hsiung; Oliver Po; K Selçuk Candan; Divyakant Agrawal,Abstract Response time is a key differentiation point among electronic commerce (e-commerce) applications. For many e-commerce applications; Web pages are createddynamically based on the current business state; stored in database systems. Thearchitecture of database-driven e-commerce Web sites are more complex than that of typicalWeb sites. It requires integration of Web servers; application servers; and back-enddatabase systems as well as synchronization of multiple databases if caches are used foracceleration of content delivery. In this paper; we analyze the factors that impact theperformance and scalability of a database-driven Web site. We experimentally test (1) theperformance metrics of database update; query; and synchronization;(2) trigger overhead;and (3) application server (AS) and database connection overhead and constraints.

Database replication: If you must be lazy; be consistent,JoAnne Holliday; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Due to the severe performance penalties associated with isochronous replication; there issignificant interest in asynchronous replica management protocols. Lazy protocols currentlyin use either do not guarantee consistency and serializability; as needed by transactionalsemantics; or they impose restrictions on the placement of data and on which data objectscan be updated. In this paper; we consider an alternative update protocol; based onepidemic communication; that guarantees consistency and serializability in spite of a write-anywhere capability.,Reliable Distributed Systems; 1999.

We beginwith a comprehensive discussion of magnetic tape and optical storage technologies. This isfollowed by a classification of commercial products based on their performancecharacteristics. Our analysis of product data indicates that in contrast to disk technology;tertiary storage products have significant variablility in terms of data transfer rates as well asother performance figures. We then summarize efforts in the areas of operating systems;databases and advanced applications to integrate tertiary storage. We point out that differentassumptions about the underlying technology result in entirely different algorithms andsystem design.

Analysis of the repulsive softness parameter in alkali halides,Jai Shanker; DP Agrawal,Abstract An analysis of the repulsive softness parameter for alkali halides has beenpresented on the basis of the additivity rule. The softness parameters for individual ionshave been obtained using data from three different sources viz. overlap data; molecular dataand crystal data. The softness parameters so derived are used to evaluate the bulk modulusand its pressure dependence for 20 alkali halides with NaCl and CsCl structures adoptingSmith's distortion model for repulsive interactions.

Abacus: A distributed middleware for privacy preserving data sharing across private data warehouses,Fatih Emekci; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Recent trends in the global economy force competitive enterprises to collaboratewith each other to analyze markets in a better way and make decisions based on that.Therefore; they might want to share their data with each other to run data mining algorithmsover the union of their data to get more accurate and representative results. During thisprocess they do not want to reveal their data to each other due to the legal issues andcompetition. However; current systems do not consider privacy preservation in data sharingacross private data sources. To satisfy this requirement; we propose a distributedmiddleware; ABACUS; to perform intersection; join; and aggregation queries over multipleprivate data warehouses in a privacy preserving manner. Our analytical evaluations showthat ABACUS is efficient and scalable.,ACM/IFIP/USENIX International Conference on Distributed Systems Platforms and Open Distributed Processing,2005,14
Data management for moving objects,Hae Don  Chon; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El  Abbadi,Abstract We model a moving object as a sizable physical entity equipped with GPS; wirelesscommunication capability; and a computer such as a PDA. Furthermore; we have observedthat a real trajectory of a moving object is the result of interactions among moving objects inthe system yielding a polyline instead of a line segment. In this paper; we first choose apartitioning approach to efficiently manage such trajectory information and develop a systemcalled RouteManager based on a space-time grid that manages moving objects in a one-dimensional space. We then extend this to two-dimensional space. The time-dependentshortest path problem is an interesting application where such a system can be used.,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2002,14
A token-based fault-tolerant distributed mutual exclusion algorithm,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr Elabbadi,Abstract In this paper; we propose a token-based distributed mutual exclusion algorithm thatis resilient to site and communication failures. The protocol uses the notion of logical time todetect the loss of the token and to recover the state of the lost token. Unlike otherapproaches; this results in the integration of token recovery due to failures with the protocolitself. Thus; we eliminate the need for expensive election protocols that are generally used intoken-based algorithms to regenerate lost tokens. We also introduce the notion of weaklyconsistent replicated queues that are used to ensure freedom from starvation.,Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing,1995,14
Reducing recovery constraints on locking based protocols,Gustavo Alonso; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Serializability is the standard correctness criterion for concurrency control. Toensure correctness in the presence of failures; recoverability is also imposed. Pragmaticconsiderations result in further constraints; for instance; the existing log-based recoveryimplementations that use before-images warrant that transaction executions be strict. Strictexecutions are restrictive; thus sacrificing concurrency and throughput. In this paper weidentify the relation between the recovery mechanism and the restrictions imposed byconcurrency control protocols. In particular; we propose a new inverse operation that can beintegrated with the underlying recovery mechanism. In order to establish the viability of ourapproach; we demonstrate the new implementation by making minor modifications to theconventional recovery architecture. This inverse operation is also designed to avoid the …,Proceedings of the thirteenth ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1994,14
An approach to eliminate transaction blocking in locking protocols,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Richard Jeffers,Locking based protocols are widely used for transaction management and concurrencycontrol in database systems. Much of the recent wo~ k on database concurrency control hasconcentrated on evaluating the performance of the two phase locking protocol[16] either bysimulation studies [13; 33; 7; 5] or by analytical modeling[32; 17; 27; 29; 34]. The simulationstudies have generally established the superiority of two phase locking over other types ofconcurrency control protocols such as timest amp ordering['28; 10] and optimisticconcurrency control [22]. More recently several researchers have become interested indeveloping techniques to stabilize the behavior of two phase loc! iiug at very highmultiprogramming levels (in particular beyond its thrash point). Tay; Suri; and Goodman[32]observed that if half the transactions ate blocked; the system is already thrashing.

Crystal‐Independent Repulsive Hardness Parameters for Alkali Halides,J Shanker; DP Agrawal,Abstract In the present paper an analysis is performed of interionic forces in alkali halides byadopting Smith's distortion model for repulsive interactions. This model represents therepulsive potential in terms of parameters which depend only on the ions. By treating therepulsive hardness parameters ϱ to be crystal independent the cohesive energies; bulkmodulus and its pressure dependence are calculated for 16 alkali halides with NaClstructure. A distinguished feature of treating the parameters as ion dependent and crystalindependent is that the values of ϱ do not remain the same for cation–cation; cation–anion;and anion–anion interactions. This is a modification over the traditional Born model where acommon value of ϱ is taken for all the ion pairs. To make a simultaneous fit of the cohesiveenergy; bulk modulus; and its pressure dependence; it is essential to consider the van der …,physica status solidi (b),1980,14

Multiple query optimization in middleware using query teamwork,Kevin O'Gorman; Amr El Abbadi; Divyakant Agrawal,Abstract Multiple concurrent queries occur in many database settings. This paper describesthe use of middleware as an optimization tool for such queries. Since commonsubexpressions derive from common data and the data is usually greatest at the source; themiddleware exploits the presence of sharable access patterns to underlying data; especiallyscans of large portions of tables or indexes; in environments where query queuing orbatching is an acceptable approach. The results show that simultaneous queries with suchsharable accesses have a tendency to form synchronous groups (teams) which benefit eachother through the operation of the disk cache; in effect using it as an implicit pipeline. Themiddleware exploits this tendency by queuing and scheduling the queries to promote thisinteraction; using an algorithm designed to promote such teamwork.

The lord of the rings: Efficient maintenance of views at data warehouses,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Achour Mostéfaoui; Michel Raynal; Matthieu Roy,Abstract Data warehouses have become extremely important to support online analyticalprocessing (OLAP) queries in databases. Since the data view that is obtained at a datawarehouse is derived from multiple data sources that are continuously updated; keeping adata warehouse up-to-date becomes a crucial problem. An approach referred to as theincremental view maintenance is widely used. Unfortunately; a precise and formal definitionof view maintenance (which can actually be seen as a distributed computation problem)does not exist. This paper develops a formal model for maintaining views at datawarehouses in a distributed asynchronous system. We start by formulating the viewmaintenance problem in terms of abstract update and data integration operations and statethe notions of correctness associated with data warehouse views.

Using broadcast primitives in replicated databases,Ioana Stanoi; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract In this paper; we explore the use of the simple variants of broadcast protocols formanaging replicated databases. In particular; we start with the simplest broadcast primitive;the reliable broadcast protocol; and show how it can be used to ensure correct transactionexecution. The protocol is simple; and has several advantages; including prevention ofdeadlocks. However; it requires a two-phase commitment protocol for ensuring correctness.We then develop a second protocol that uses causal broadcast and avoids the overhead oftwo-phase commit by exploiting the causal delivery properties of the broadcast primitives toimplicitly collect the relevant information used in two-phase commit. Finally; we present aprotocol that employs atomic broadcast and completely eliminates the need foracknowledgements during transaction commitment.,PODC,1997,13
Indexing non-uniform spatial data,Kothuri Venkata Ravi Kanth; Divyakant Agrawal; Ambuj K Singh; Amr El Abbadi,Non-uniformity in data extents is a general characteristic of spatial data. Indexing such non-uniform data using conventional spatial index structures such as R/sup*/-trees is inefficientfor two reasons:(1) the non-uniformity increases the likelihood of overlapping index entries;and (2) clustering of non-uniform data is likely to index more dead space than clustering ofuniform data. To reduce the impact of these anomalies; we propose a new scheme thatpromotes data objects to higher levels in tree-based index structures. We examine twocriteria for promotion of data objects and evaluate their relative merits using an R*-tree. Inexperiments on cartographic data; we observe that our promotion criteria yield up to 45%improvement in query performance for an R*-tree.,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 1997.

In this paper; we first develop auniform methodology for treating both classes and instances. We then develop a two-phaselocking protocol with a new relationship between locks called ordered sharing for an object-oriented database. Ordered sharing does not restrict the execution of conflicting operations.Finally; we extend the protocol to handle objects that execute methods on other objects thusresulting in the nested execution of transactions.

P2p systems with transactional semantics,Shyam Antony; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Structured P2P systems have been developed for constructing applications atinternet scale in cooperative environments and exhibit a number of desirable features suchas scalability and self-maintenance. We argue that such systems when augmented with welldefined consistency semantics provide an attractive building block for many large scale dataprocessing applications in cluster environments. Towards this end; we study the problem ofproviding transactional semantics to P-Ring a P2P system which supports efficient rangequeries. We first extend a commonly used replication protocol in P2P systems to providewell defined guarantees in the presence of concurrent updates and under well definedfailure assumptions.

Exploring spatial datasets with histograms,Chengyu Sun; Nagender Bandi; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract As online spatial datasets grow both in number and sophistication; it becomesincreasingly difficult for users to decide whether a dataset is suitable for their tasks;especially when they do not have prior knowledge of the dataset. In this paper; we proposebrowsing as an effective and efficient way to explore the content of a spatial dataset.Browsing allows users to view the size of a result set before evaluating the query at thedatabase; thereby avoiding zero-hit/mega-hit queries and saving time and resources.Although the underlying technique supporting browsing is similar to range queryaggregation and selectivity estimation; spatial dataset browsing poses some uniquechallenges. In this paper; we identify a set of spatial relations that need to be supported inbrowsing applications; namely; the contains; contained and the overlap relations.

Wrex: A scalable middleware architecture to enable xml caching for web-services,Junichi Tatemura; Oliver Po; Arsany Sawires; Divyakant Agrawal; K Selçuk Candan,Abstract Web service caching; ie; caching the responses of XML web service requests; isneeded for designing scalable web service architectures. Such caching of dynamic contentrequires maintaining the caches appropriately to reflect dynamic updates to the back-enddata source. In the database; especially relational; context; extensive research hasaddressed the problem of incremental view maintenance. However; only a few attemptshave been made to address the cache maintenance problem for XML web servicemessages. We propose a middleware solution that bridges the gap between the cachedweb service responses and the backend dynamic data source. We assume; for generality;that the back-end source has a general XML logical data model.

The additivity rule provides a direct method of determining the repulsive hardnessparameters for individual ions and thereby reduces the number of parameters considerably.Using the repulsive hardness parameters for individual ions derived from the overlapintegrals an investigation is made on the crystal binding of LiH; NaH; KH; RbH; CsH; AgCl;AgBr; CaF 2; SrF 2; and BaF 2.

Managing geo-replicated data in multi-datacenters,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Hatem A Mahmoud; Faisal Nawab; Kenneth Salem,Abstract Over the past few years; cloud computing and the growth of global large scalecomputing systems have led to applications which require data management across multipledatacenters. Initially the models provided single row level transactions with eventualconsistency. Although protocols based on these models provide high availability; they arenot ideal for applications needing a consistent view of the data. There has been now agradual shift to provide transactions with strong consistency with Google's Megastore andSpanner. We propose protocols for providing full transactional support while replicating datain multi-datacenter environments. First; an extension of Megastore is presented; which usesoptimistic concurrency control. Second; a contrasting method is put forward; which usesgossip-based protocol for providing distributed transactions across datacenters.

Information diffusion in social networks: observing and affecting what society cares about,Divyakant Agrawal; Ceren Budak; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Information diffusion in social networks provide great opportunities for political andsocial change as well as societal education. Therefore understanding information diffusionin social networks is a critical research goal. This greater understanding can be achievedthrough data analysis; development of reliable models that can predict outcomes of socialprocesses; and ultimately the creation of applications that can shape the outcome of theseprocesses. In this tutorial; we aim to provide an overview of such recent research based on awide variety of techniques such as optimization algorithms; data mining; data streamscovering a large number of problems such as influence spread maximization; misinformationlimitation and study of trends in online social networks.,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,11
CEO a cloud epistasis computing model in GWAS.,Zhengkui Wang; Yue Wang; Kian-Lee Tan; Limsoon Wong; Divyakant Agrawal,Abstract—The 1000 Genome project has made available a large number of singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However;the large number of SNPs has also rendered the discovery of epistatic interactions of SNPscomputationally expensive. Parallelizing the computation offers a promising solution. In thispaper; we propose a cloud-based epistasis computing (CEO) model that examines all k-locus SNPs combinations to find statistically significant epistatic interactions efficiently. OurCEO model uses the MapReduce framework which can be executed both on user's ownclusters or on a cloud environment. Our cloud-based solution offers elastic computingresources to users; and more importantly; makes our approach affordable and available toall end-users. We evaluate our CEO model on a cluster of more than 40 nodes. Our …,BIBM,2010,11
Efficient techniques for replicated data management,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Data replication in distributed systems is considered. Two approaches are developed topartially mitigate the costs associated with replicated data management. The first approach;termed the views protocol; is developed to address the concern of practitioners who rejectthe quorum protocol since it requires that a read operation be executed on more that onecopy. The second approach organizes the copies of data into a logical structure such as atree; a grid; etc. By using the additional information of the logical structure it is possible torelax the quorum intersection requirements. The two approaches are briefly described; andthe possibility of combining them to manage replicated data more efficiently is considered.,Management of Replicated Data; 1990.

Risk based access control with uncertain and time-dependent sensitivity,John A Clark; Juan E Tapiador; John McDermid; Pau-Chen Cheng; Dakshi Agrawal; Natalie Ivanic; Dave Slogget,In traditional multi-level security (MLS) models; object labels are fixed assessments ofsensitivity. In practice there will inevitably be some uncertainty about the damage that mightbe caused if a document falls into the wrong hands. Furthermore; unless specificmanagement action is taken to regrade the label on an object; it does not change. This doesnot reflect the operational reality of many modern systems where there is clearly a temporalelement to the actual sensitivity of information. Tactical information may be highly sensitiveright now but comparatively irrelevant tomorrow whilst strategic secrets may need to bemaintained for many years; decades; or even longer. In this paper we propose to model bothsecurity labels and clearances as probability distributions.

CoTS: A scalable framework for parallelizing frequency counting over data streams,Sudipto Das; Shyam Antony; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Frequency counting; frequent elements and top-k queries form a class of operators that areused for a wide range of stream analysis applications. In spite of the abundance of thesealgorithms; all known techniques for answering data stream queries are sequential innature. The imminent ubiquity of Chip Multi-Processor (CMP) architectures requiresalgorithms that can exploit the parallelism of such architectures. In this paper; we firstevaluate different naive techniques for intra-operator parallelism; and summarize theinsights obtained from the naive techniques. Our experimental analysis of the naive designsshows that intra-operator parallelism is not straightforward and requires a complete redesignof the system.

Moolap: Towards multi-objective olap,Shyam Antony; Ping Wu; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Aggregation is among the core functionalities of OLAP systems. Frequently; such queriesare issued in decision support systems to identify interesting groups of data. When morethan one aggregation function is involved and the notion of interest is not clearly defined;skyline queries provide a robust mechanism to capture the potentially interesting pointswhere (i) users do not need to specify a ranking function and (ii) the result is independent ofthe dimension scales. To provide better exploration functionalities in OLAP systems; wepropose to use skyline queries over aggregated data to identify the most interesting groups.Since aggregation functions have to be ad-hoc to cover a wide variety of user interests; theskyline over the aggregates has to be computed on the fly. Hence any algorithm to computesuch a skyline must be fast and be able to progressively produce the result set with …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,10

Optimal scheduling algorithms for tertiary storage,Sunil Prabhakar; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract The ever growing needs of large multimedia systems cannot be met by magneticdisks due to their high cost and low storage density. Consequently; cheaper and densertertiary storage systems are being integrated into the storage hierarchies of theseapplications. Although tertiary storage is cheaper; the access latency is very high due to theneed to load and unload media on the drives. This high latency and the bursty nature of I/Otraffic result in the accumulation of I/O requests for tertiary storage. We study the problem ofscheduling these requests to improve performance. In particular we address the issues ofscheduling across multiple tapes or disks as opposed to most other studies which consideronly one or two media. We focus on algorithms that minimize the number of switches andshow through simulation that these result in near-optimal schedules. For single drive …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2003,10
Energy-conscious data aggregation over large-scale sensor networks,Fatih Emekci; Hailing Yu; Divyakant Agrawal; AE Abbadi,Abstract Recent advances in hardware technology facilitate applications requiring largenumbers of sensor devices; where each sensor device has computational; storage; andcommunication capabilities. Since sensor devices are powered by ordinary batteries; poweris a limiting resource in sensor networks. Power usage can be reduced by pushing part ofthe computation into the network to reduce communication cost; which is the main energyconsumer in sensor networks. In order to further reduce power usage; we propose power-aware query processing techniques for aggregation queries. Instead of requiring exactanswers to queries; we introduce precision into queries to give users full control of thetradeoffs between precision and energy usage.

Efficient I/O scheduling in tertiary libraries,Sunil Prabhakar; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Ambuj Singh,Abstract With the recent improvements in network and processor speeds; several dataintensive applications have become much more feasible than ever before. The only practicalsolution for storing such enormous amounts of data is tertiarystorage. Automated access totertiary storage is made possible through robotic libraries for tapes and optical disks. Due tothe slow speeds of operation of the drives and library robotics; access times for suchlibrariesare high resulting in the accumulation of I/O requests. In this paper we study theproblem of scheduling these requests for efficient performance. We focus on schedulingpolicies that process all requests on a loaded medium before unloading it. For single drivesettings an efficient algorithm that produces optimal schedules is developed. For multipledrives the problem is shown to be NP-Complete.

Semantics-based time warp protocols,Hong Va Leong; Divyakant Agrawal,Abstract The time warp mechanism is one of the useful paradigms to carry out a distributeddiscrete event simulation; where the synchronization of events can be determined a prioriwhen the program is being executed. The forward computation performed optimistically hasto be rolled back when an out-of-order synchronization message is received. This excessiveamount of rollback seriously jeopardizes the performance of a time warp mechanism.Semantics of the synchronization messages being sent in a time warp execution can beexploited to reduce the amount of rollback. In particular; the commutativity and dependencyproperties of messages can be used to avoid certain types of rollback. For example; twocommutative messages can be processed in any order and the resultant computationremains valid. In this paper; the semantics on the messages are de ned and the protocols …,*,1993,10

Declustering two-dimensional datasets over MEMS-based storage,Hailing Yu; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Due to the large difference between seek time and transfer time in current disktechnology; it is advantageous to perform large I/O using a single sequential access ratherthan multiple small random I/O accesses. However; prior optimal cost and data placementapproaches for processing range queries over two-dimensional datasets do not considerthis property. In particular; these techniques do not consider the issue of sequential dataplacement when multiple I/O blocks need to be retrieved from a single device. In this paper;we reevaluate the optimal cost of range queries by declustering two-dimensional datasetsover multiple devices; and prove that; in general; it is impossible to achieve the new optimalcost. This is because disks cannot facilitate two-dimensional sequential access which isrequired by the new optimal cost.

Exploiting single-threaded model in multi-core in-memory systems,Chang Yao; Divyakant Agrawal; Gang Chen; Qian Lin; Beng Chin Ooi; Weng-Fai Wong; Meihui Zhang,The widely adopted single-threaded OLTP model assigns a single thread to each staticpartition of the database for processing transactions in a partition. This simplifiesconcurrency control while retaining parallelism. However; it suffers performance loss arisingfrom skewed workloads as well as transactions that span multiple partitions. In this paper;we present a dynamic single-threaded in-memory OLTP system; called LADS; that extendsthe simplicity of the single-threaded model. The key innovation in LADS is the separation ofdependency resolution and execution into two non-overlapping phases for batches oftransactions. After the first phase of dependency resolution; the record actions of thetransactions are partitioned and ordered. Each independent partition is then executedsequentially by a single thread; avoiding the need for locking. By careful mapping of the …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,8

However; processing this big data isvery challenging since both space and computational requirements are hard to satisfy. Onesolution for dealing with such requirements is to take advantage of parallel frameworks; suchas MapReduce or Spark; that allow to make powerful computing and storage units on top ofordinary machines. Although these key-based frameworks have been praised for their highscalability and fault tolerance; they show poor performance in the case of data skew. Thereare important cases where a high percentage of processing in the reduce side ends upbeing done by only one node.

As the home of high-value; data-driven applications for overfour decades; a natural question for database researchers to ask is: what role should thedatabase community play in these new data-driven machine-learning-based applications?,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,7
Reconciling network management data,*,Network management data is managed by determining that a first version and a secondversion of a set of network management data have been created. The set of networkmanagement data is associated with a plurality of managed entities in a network. First andsecond network graphs are created based on the first version and second version of the setof network management data; respectively. The first and second network graphs include afirst and second set of entities in the plurality of managed entities; respectively. A similaritymetric is assigned between at least one or more entities in the first and second set of entities.At least a first entity in the first set of entities and at least a second entity in the second set ofentities are determined to be identical entities based on the similarity metric being one ofequal to and above a first given threshold.,*,2014,7
Towards practical private processing of database queries over public data,Shiyuan Wang; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Privacy is a major concern when users query public online data services. Theprivacy of millions of people has been jeopardized in numerous user data leakage incidentsin many popular online applications. To address the critical problem of personal dataleakage through queries; we enable private querying on public data services so that thecontents of user queries and any user data are hidden and therefore not revealed to theonline service providers. We propose two protocols for private processing of databasequeries; namely BHE and HHE. The two protocols provide strong query privacy by usingPaillier's homomorphic encryption; and support common database queries such as rangeand join queries by relying on the bucketization of public data. In contrast to traditionalPrivate Information Retrieval proposals; BHE and HHE only incur one round of client …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2014,7
Secret-key exchange for wireless and sensor networks,*,A mechanism is provided for establishing a shared secret-key for secure communicationbetween nodes in a wireless network. A first node in the wireless network provides aspreading code to a second node of the wireless network. The second node provides a firstinput for the key establishment to the first node using communication encoded with thespreading code. Responsive to obtaining the first input from the second node; the first nodeprovides a second input for the key establishment to the second node using communicationencoded with the spreading code. Then; the first node and the second node establish theshared secret-key using the first input and the second input.,*,2013,7

HengHa: data harvesting detection on hidden databases,Shiyuan Wang; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract The back-end databases of web-based applications are a major data securityconcern to enterprises. The problem becomes more critical with the proliferation ofenterprise hosted web applications in the cloud. While prior work has concentrated onmalicious attacks that try to break into the database using vulnerabilities of web applications;little work has focused on the threat of data harvesting through web form interfaces; in whichlarge collections of the underlying data can be harvested and sensitive information can belearnt by iteratively submitting legitimate queries and analyzing the returned results fordesigning new queries. To defend against data harvesting without compromising usability;we consider a detection approach. We summarize the characteristics of data harvesting; andpropose the notions of query correlation and result coverage for data harvesting detection …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM workshop on Cloud computing security workshop,2010,7

Freshness-driven adaptive caching for dynamic content,Wen-Syan Li; Oliver Po; Wang-Pin Hsiung; K Selçuk Candan; Divyakant Agrawal,With the wide availability of content delivery networks; many e-commerce Web applicationsutilize edge cache servers to cache and deliver dynamic contents at locations much closer tousers; avoiding network latency. By caching a large number of dynamic content pages in theedge cache servers; response time can be reduced; benefiting from higher cache hit rates.However this is achieved at the expense of higher invalidation cost. On the other hand; ahigher invalidation cost leads to a longer invalidation cycle (time to perform the invalidationcheck on the pages in caches) at the expense of freshness of cached dynamic content. Inthis paper we propose a freshness-driven adaptive dynamic content caching technique;which monitors response time and invalidation cycle length and dynamically adjusts cachingpolicies.

Data declustering for efficient range and similarity searching,Sunil Prabhakar; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Advances in processor and network technologies have catalyzed the growth of dataintensive applications such as image repositories and digital libraries. The lack ofcommensurate improvements in storage systems have resulted in I/O becoming a majorbottleneck in modern systems. The use of parallel I/O from multiple devices is a well knowntechnique for improving I/O performance. A key factor in exploiting parallel I/O is knowledgeof the access pattern--the sets of data items that are likely to be accessed concurrentlyshould be declustered across the disks. Range and nearest-neighbor (similarity) queries arethe most important class of queries for multimedia databases. Declustering schemes tailoredfor improving the performance of range only or similarity only queries have been proposedin the literature.

A java-based framework for processing distributed objects,Daniel Wu; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Ambuj Singh,Abstract The Alexandria Digital Library Project at UC Santa Barbara has been building aninformation retrieval system for geographically referenced information and datasets. To meetthese requirements; we have designed a distributed Data Store to store its holdings. Thelibrary's map; image and geographical data are viewed as a collection of objects withevolving roles. Developed in the Java programming language and the HORB distributedobject system; the Data Store manages these objects for flexible and scalable processing.To implement the Data Store we provide a messaging layer that allows applications todistribute processing between the Data Store and the local host. We define a data model forData Store repositories that provide Client access to Data Store objects. We finally providesupport for specialized views of these Data Store items.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,1997,7
Browsing and placement of multiresolution images on secondary storage,Sunil Prabhakar; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Ambuj Singh; Terence R Smith,Image decomposition techniques such as wavelets are used to provide multiresolutionrepresentations of images. The original image is represented by several coefficients; one ofthem with visual similarity to the original image; but at a lower resolution. Several strategiesare evaluated to store the image coefficients on parallel disks so that thumbnail browsing aswell as image reconstruction can be performed efficiently. Disk simulation and experimentswith real disks are used to evaluate the performance of these strategies. The results indicatethat significant performance improvements can be achieved with as few as four disks byplacing image coefficients based upon browsing access patterns.,Multimedia Computing and Systems' 97.

Parallelizing multidimensional index structures,Kothuri Venkata Ravi Kanth; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Ambuj Singh; Terence R Smith,Indexing multidimensional data is inherently complex leading to slow query processing. Thisbehavior becomes more pronounced with the increase in database size and/or number ofdimensions. In this paper we address this issue by processing an index structure in parallel.First; we study different ways of partitioning an index structure. We then propose efficientalgorithms for processing each query in parallel on the index structure.

Quorum consensus algorithms for secure and reliable data,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,The authors address the issue of maintaining security in a fault-tolerant replicated database.They present a data-management protocol that integrates the information-dispersalalgorithm (for security) and the quorum-consensus algorithm (for reliability). Although thisprotocol provides the desired level of security; it does not achieve the same level ofavailability for both read and write operations as the quorum-consensus algorithm. Byintegrating a log-based propagation mechanism with their protocol; the authors are able toachieve the same level of availability for both read and write operations as other quorum-consensus protocols; while maintaining the desired level of security.,Reliable Distributed Systems; 1988.

Dgcc: A new dependency graph based concurrency control protocol for multicore database systems,Chang Yao; Divyakant Agrawal; Pengfei Chang; Gang Chen; Beng Chin Ooi; Weng-Fai Wong; Meihui Zhang,Abstract: Multicore CPUs and large memories are increasingly becoming the norm inmodern computer systems. However; current database management systems (DBMSs) aregenerally ineffective in exploiting the parallelism of such systems. In particular; contentioncan lead to a dramatic fall in performance. In this paper; we propose a new concurrencycontrol protocol called DGCC (Dependency Graph based Concurrency Control) thatseparates concurrency control from execution. DGCC builds dependency graphs forbatched transactions before executing them. Using these graphs; contentions within thesame batch of transactions are resolved before execution. As a result; the execution of thetransactions does not need to deal with contention while maintaining full equivalence to thatof serialized execution. This better exploits multicore hardware and achieves higher level …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1503.03642,2015,6

Automated storage management with qos guarantees,Lin Qiao; Balakrishna R Iyer; Divyakant Agrawal; AE Abbadi,Automated storage management is critical for most dataintensive applications running onDBMSs. In large-scale storage subsystems; the workload is expected to vary with time. Inorder to ensure both QoS and efficient usage of storage resources; variation in the actualphysical disks is allowed to support a single virtual disk. Such data migration generatesextra IOs and consumes storage resources. Not only does data migration need to bescheduled ahead but it must also be scheduled in such a way that QoS violations do notoccur because of the extra migration IOs.

Progressive ranking of range aggregates,Hua-Gang Li; Hailing Yu; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Ranking-aware queries have been gaining much attention recently in manyapplications such as search engines and data streams. They are; however; not onlyrestricted to such applications but are also very useful in OLAP applications. In this paper;we introduce aggregation ranking queries in OLAP data cubes motivated by an onlineadvertisement tracking data warehouse application. These queries aggregate informationover a specified range and then return the ranked order of the aggregated values. Theydiffer from range aggregate queries in that range aggregate queries are mainly concernedwith an aggregate operator such as SUM and MIN/MAX over the selected ranges of alldimensions in the data cubes. Existing techniques for range aggregate queries are not ableto process aggregation ranking queries efficiently.

Weak Consistency in Distributed Data Warehouses.,Ioana Stanoi; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract We propose and analyze a novel multiple-view model of a distributed datawarehouse. Views are represented in a hierarchical fashion; incorporating data from basesources as well as possibly other views. Current approaches to maintain consistency in sucha model require that data stored in a view derived from base data via di erent paths be fromthe same state of the base relation. This type of consistency criterion is too restrictive forsome applications. Hence; we propose relaxing the synchronization constraints at the viewlevel and develop a model that allows views to set their own constraints by enforcingindividual conditions for all pairs of paths. We de ne a correctness criteria for updates in thisparticular model; and analyze the new requirements necessary for maintaining theconsistency of data. Finally; we propose an algorithm to ensure that views are updated …,FODO,1998,6
Impact of Media Exchanges in Robotic Libraries,Sunil Prabhakar; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract The large storage requirements of many commerical and scientific applicationscannot be met by magnetic disks due to their high cost and low storage density.Consequently; cheaper and more dense tertiary storage systems are being intergrated intothe storage hierarchies of these applications. Although tertiary storage can accomodatelarge amounts of data; the access latency is very high due to the need to load and unloadmedia from the read/write drives. These media exchanges are very slow with typical times inthe order of tens of seconds. In order to reduce this high latency research efforts havefocussed on minimizing media exchanges under the assumption that it is always beneficialto eliminate exchanges. We analyze the validity of this assumption. It is shown that there areinstances when the assumption does not hold. It is further shown that various factors …,*,1997,6
A brief survey of tertiary storage systems and research,Sunil Prabhakar; Divyakant Agrawal; A El Abbadi; A Singh,With the recent improvements in network and processor speeds; several data intensive applicationshave become much more feasible than ever before. These applications are characterized byvery large computational and stor- age requirements. In the present commercial setting and mostlikely in the near future; the only practical solution for storing such enormous amounts of datais tertiary storage. Although tertiary storage; in particu- lar magnetic tapes; has been used solelyfor archiving or backup purposes; the exploding storage requirements and the high cost of secondarystorage are forcing com- puter architects and designers to re-evaluate the role of tertiarystorage.

Context-specific synchronization for atomic data types in object-based databases,Man Hon Wong; Divyakant Agrawal,Abstract Highly concurrent and reliable atomic data types are crucial for object-baseddatabases. Deferred update (DU) and update-in-place (UIP) are two common recoverystrategies for implementing atomic data types. These two strategies place incomparableconstraints on the conflict relations between concurrent operations resulting in incomparablesynchronization protocols. Also; the conflict relations used are usually static in the sense thatthey depend only on the operation types; and the algorithms do not use the context-specificinformation that may be available in the system. In this paper; a new synchronizationmechanism that employs a hybrid scheme by using both DU and UIP is proposed.Furthermore; the protocol is dynamic in the sense that context-specific information is alsoused to determine conflict relations among concurrent operations.

Using data migration for heterogeneous databases,D Agrawal; EA Abbadi,The authors propose an approach to execute transactions in heterogeneous distributeddatabases. Instead of using the traditional approach of executing global transaction byremotely accessing distributed data; they propose that transactions be executed locally; anddata is dynamically migrated to the appropriate sites. Thus; they eliminate the need forglobal transactions. Since there are no global transactions; the problem of distributedcommitment does not arise. This is an important issue related to database recovery that isoften ignored by protocols for transaction processing in heterogeneous databases. A specialprotocol is executed for migrating data objects. They present a protocol for localizing theaccess of a data object.,Interoperability in Multidatabase Systems; 1991. IMS'91.

Analysis of the Relative Stability of the NaCl; CsCl; and Cubic ZnS Structures in Alkali Halide Crystals,J Shanker; DP Agrawal; AK Rajauria,In a recent paper/1/we have developed an interionic force model by treating the repulsiveinteractions within the framework of Smith's distortion model/2/. It was found that theinclusion of van der Waals potentials and Lundqvist's three-body potential along with theCoulomb and repulsive interactions is essential in order to explain the cohesive energy; bulkmodulus and its pressure derivative in alkali halide crystals. In the present note we supportthis finding by studying the relative stability of alkali halides in NaC1; CsC1; and cubic ZnSstructure. The stability of alkali halide crystals has been a long-standing problem in thetheory of ionic solids/3/.

Adaptive logging for distributed in-memory databases,Chang Yao; Divyakant Agrawal; Gang Chen; Beng Chin Ooi; Sai Wu,Abstract: A new type of logs; the command log; is being employed to replace the traditionaldata log (eg; ARIES log) in the in-memory databases. Instead of recording how the tuplesare updated; a command log only tracks the transactions being executed; thereby effectivelyreducing the size of the log and improving the performance. Command logging on the otherhand increases the cost of recovery; because all the transactions in the log after the lastcheckpoint must be completely redone in case of a failure. In this paper; we first extend thecommand logging technique to a distributed environment; where all the nodes can performrecovery in parallel. We then propose an adaptive logging approach by combining datalogging and command logging. The percentage of data logging versus command loggingbecomes an optimization between the performance of transaction processing and …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1503.03653,2015,5
COSAC: A framework for combinatorial statistical analysis on cloud,Zhengkui Wang; Divyakant Agrawal; Kian-Lee Tan,In many scientific applications; it is critical to determine if there is a relationship between acombination of objects. The strength of such an association is typically computed usingsome statistical measures. In order not to miss any important associations; it is notuncommon to exhaustively enumerate all possible combinations of a certain size. However;discovering significant associations among hundreds of thousands or even millions ofobjects is a computationally intensive job that typically takes days; if not weeks; to complete.We are; therefore; motivated to provide efficient and practical techniques to speed up theprocessing exploiting parallelism. In this paper; we propose a framework; COSAC; for suchcombinatorial statistical analysis for large-scale data sets over a MapReduce-based cloudcomputing platform.

Towards practical private processing of database queries over public data with homomorphic encryption,Shiyuan Wang; Divyakant Agrawal; AE Abbadi,Abstract—Data privacy is a major concern when users query public online data services.The privacy of millions of people has been jeopardized in numerous user data leakageincidents in many popular online applications. To address the critical problem of personaldata leakage through queries; we enable private querying on public data services so thatthe contents of user queries and any user data are hidden and therefore not revealed to theonline service provider. We propose two protocols for processing private database queries;namely BHE and HHE. BHE provides complete query privacy by using Paillier'shomomorphic encryption along with the bucketization of public data. In contrast to traditionalPrivate Information Retrieval (PIR) proposals; BHE only incurs one round of client serverinteraction for processing one query. Built upon BHE; HHE is a hybrid protocol that …,University of California. Department of Computer Science. Technical Report,2011,5

Fast computation of spatial selections and joins using graphics hardware,Nagender Bandi; Chengyu Sun; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Spatial database operations are typically performed in two steps. In the filteringstep; indexes and the minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) of the objects are used toquickly determine a set of candidate objects. In the refinement step; the actual geometries ofthe objects are retrieved and compared to the query geometry or each other. Because of thecomplexity of the computational geometry algorithms involved; the CPU cost of therefinement step is usually the dominant cost of the operation for complex geometries such aspolygons. Although many run-time and pre-processing-based heuristics have beenproposed to alleviate this problem; the CPU cost still remains the bottleneck. In this paper;we propose a novel approach to address this problem using the efficient rendering andsearching capabilities of modern graphics hardware.

Towards scalable architectures for clickstream data warehousing,Peter Alvaro; Dmitriy V Ryaboy; Divyakant Agrawal,Abstract Click-stream data warehousing has emerged as a monumental informationmanagement and processing challenge for commercial enterprises. Traditional solutionsbased on commercial DBMS technology often suffer from poor scalability and largeprocessing latencies. One of the main problems is that click-stream data is inherentlycollected in a distributed manner; but in general these distributed click-stream logs arecollated and pushed upstream in a centralized database storage repository; creating storagebottlenecks. In this paper; we propose a design of an ad-hoc retrieval system suitable forclick-stream data warehouses; in which the data remains distributed and database queriesare rewritten to be executed against the distributed data. The query rewrite does not involveany centralized control and is therefore highly scalable.

We present the basic model of a smart index; as well as variations of smart indexesthat are suitable when the size of summaries is large. An algorithm for generatingsummaries of the results of arbitrary queries is given; and algorithms for updating varioussummaries are discussed. Experimental results show that smart indexes generatesummaries much more efficiently than traditional trees for all query areas greater than 1%-2% of the data space; with a relatively small additional storage overhead.

Using message semantics to reduce rollback in the time warp mechanism,Hong Va Leong; Divyakant Agrawal; Jonathan R Agre,Abstract The time warp mechanism is one of the most favorite paradigm to carry out adistributed discrete event simulation; where the synchronization of events can bedetermined a priori when the program is being executed. The forward computationperformed optimistically has to be rolled back when an out-of-order synchronizationmessage is received. This excessive amount of rollback often haunts the performance of atime warp mechanism. We propose in this paper that the semantics of the synchronizationmessages being sent in a time warp execution can be exploited to reduce the amount ofrollback. In particular; we illustrate with some examples how the commutativity anddependency properties of messages can be used to avoid certain types of rollback. Forexample; two commutative messages can be processed in any order and the resultant …,International Workshop on Distributed Algorithms,1993,5

We focus on database method schemas (dms);a model capturing the data manipulation capabilities of a large class of deterministicmethods in object-oriented databases. The results clarify the impact of various languageconstructs on object creation. Several new constructs based on expanded notions of deepequality are introduced. In particular; we provide a tractable construct which yields alanguage complete with respect to object creation. The new construct is also relevant toquery complexity.

A unified implementation of concurrency control and recovery,Gustavo Alonso; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract this paper; we discuss the characteristics of such a scheduler and develop efficientschedulers based on a new class of locks. We start by proposing an equivalent definition forPRED. The original definition of PRED was stated in a recursive manner; which hinders itsuse for the development of dynamic schedulers. Our definition is procedural; and providesus with an easy; graph testing protocol for recognizing all PRED executions. However;serialization graph testing is known to be inefficient; and since locking is widely used forconcurrency control; we propose a locking based protocol to recognize a subclass of PRED.The unified theory relied on a specific implementation of the recovery mechanism; viz.; logsand before images. We develop an alternative recovery mechanism; which also uses logsand before images; but allows more concurrency among transactions. This recovery …,*,1993,5

Db-risk: The game of global database placement,Victor Zakhary; Faisal Nawab; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Geo-replication is the process of maintaining copies of data at geographicallydispersed datacenters for better availability and fault-tolerance. The distinguishingcharacteristic of geo-replication is the large wide-area latency between datacenters thatvaries widely depending on the location of the datacenters. Thus; choosing whichdatacenters to deploy a cloud application has a direct impact on the observable responsetime. We propose an optimization framework that automatically derives a geo-replicationplacement plan with the objective of minimizing latency. By running the optimizationframework on real placement scenarios; we learn a set of placement optimizations for geo-replication. Some of these optimizations are surprising while others are in retrospect straight-forward. In this demonstration; we highlight the geo-replication placement optimizations …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,4

In one aspect; a method for processing information streamsproduced by end-computing devices that are transmitted over a wireless network having atleast one network element is provided. The method includes the following steps. Datapackets which originate from the end-computing devices and are received by the networkelement are inspected for spatiotemporal metadata. Spatiotemporal metadata is insertedinto the data packets and the data packets are transmitted if the step of inspecting the datapackets reveals that the data packets are missing spatiotemporal metadata. Otherwise thedata packets are transmitted if the step of inspecting the data packets reveals thatspatiotemporal metadata is already present in the data packets.,*,2014,4
Data partitioning for minimizing transferred data in mapreduce,Miguel Liroz-Gistau; Reza Akbarinia; Divyakant Agrawal; Esther Pacitti; Patrick Valduriez,Abstract Reducing data transfer in MapReduce's shuffle phase is very important because itincreases data locality of reduce tasks; and thus decreases the overhead of job executions.In the literature; several optimizations have been proposed to reduce data transfer betweenmappers and reducers. Nevertheless; all these approaches are limited by how intermediatekey-value pairs are distributed over map outputs. In this paper; we address the problem ofhigh data transfers in MapReduce; and propose a technique that repartitions tuples of theinput datasets; and thereby optimizes the distribution of key-values over mappers; andincreases the data locality in reduce tasks. Our approach captures the relationships betweeninput tuples and intermediate keys by monitoring the execution of a set of MapReduce jobswhich are representative of the workload.

Given that the data are unified from various sourcesand accessed by numerous users; providing users with a unified mediated schema as dataintegration is insufficient. On one hand; a deterministic mediated schema restricts users'freedom to express queries in their preferred vocabulary; on the other hand; it is not realisticfor users to remember the numerous attribute names that arise from integrating various datasources. As such; a user-oriented data management and query interface is required. In thispaper; we propose an out-of-the-box approach that separates users' actions from databaseoperations.

Physical-layer-enhanced wireless secret key exchange,Cagatay Capar; Murtaza Zafer; Dennis Goeckel; Don Towsley; Dakshi Agrawal,ABSTRACT We address the problem of efficiently establishing a shared secret key over anopen wireless channel in the presence of an active (jamming) adversary. A commonlyemployed technique in practice for key sharing is the cryptographic ellipticcurve Diffie-Hellman (DH) protocol; however; its communication cost in a jammed environment is veryhigh. Hence; we employ novel physical-layer techniques to enhance the performance of theDH protocol in a wireless setting. Specifically; we propose a protocol that exploits therandomness inherent to the wireless environment by testing rapidly for time-frequencybands where success can be obtained; essentially probing for those bands that arefavorable to the communicating parties and unfavorable to the adversary. The proposedprotocol is significantly more energy and time efficient than the standard DH approach …,Univ. Massachusetts Amherst; Amherst; MA; Tech. Rep. UM-CS-2010-032,2010,4
Efficient skyline computation over ad-hoc aggregations,Shyam Antony; Ping Wu; Divyakant Agrawal; AE Abbadi,Abstract Aggregation is among the core functionalities of OLAP systems. Frequently; suchqueries are issued in decision support systems to identify interesting groups of data. Whenmore than one aggregation function is involved and the notion of interest is not clearlydefined; skyline queries provide a robust mechanism to capture the potentially interestingpoints where (i) users do not need to specify a ranking function and (ii) the result isindependent of the dimension scales. For providing better exploration functionalities in theOLAP system; in this paper; we propose to use skyline queries over aggregated data toidentify the most interesting groups. Since the aggregation function has to be ad-hoc tocover a wide variety of user interests; the skyline over the aggregates has to be computed onthe fly. Hence any algorithm to compute such a skyline must be fast and be able to …,IEEE ICDE,2008,4

Exploiting temporal correlation in temporal data warehouses,Ying Feng; Hua-Gang Li; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Data is typically incorporated in a data warehouse in increasing order of time.Furthermore; the MOLAP data cube tends to be sparse because of the large cardinality ofthe time dimension. We propose an approach to improve the efficiency of range aggregatequeries on MOLAP data cubes in a temporal data warehouse by factoring out the time-related dimensions. These time-related dimensions are handled separately to takeadvantage of the monotonic trend over time. The proposed technique captures local datatrends with respect to time by partitioning data points into blocks; and then uses a perfectbinary block tree as an index structure to achieve logarithmic time complexity for bothincremental updates and data retrievals. Experimental results establish the scalability andefficiency of the proposed approach on various datasets.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2005,4

The reasonis that the storage maintenance cost manifests one of the biggest factors in the overalloperational cost. At the same time; due to the interactive nature of most applications; userstypically pose the QoS constraints on IO access performance. Hence it is crucial to ensurethat the applications are not underprovisioned (giving rise to the risk of QoS violation) orover-provisioned (resulting in high operational costs). Such issue gets further complicatedwhen the application workload keeps changing.

The Performance of Replicated Databases Using Atomic Broadcast Group Communication,JoAnne Holliday; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Database replication with update-anywhere capability while maintaining globalsynchronization and isolation has long been thought impractical. Protocols have beenproposed for distributed replicated databases that take advantage of atomic broadcastsystems to simplify message passing and conflict resolution in hopes of making replicationefficient. This paper presents performance measurements on a simulation of a distributedreplicated database using those protocols. The results show that with the proper groupbroadcast mechanism; replication with update-anywhere capability is indeed practical.,*,1999,4

Ordered sharing: A new lock primitive for database systems,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract We propose a new lock primitive called ordered sharing that allows increasedconcurrency in database systems. A generalized two phase locking protocol is developedthat may employ locks with the standard shared and non-shared relationships as well as theproposed ordered shared relationships between locks. The paper then addresses thereliability and performance issues of the proposed protocol. We show that ordered sharingresults in a set of protocols that are optimal in both their reliability and concurrency aspects.A simulation study demonstrates that ordered sharing results in improved performance indatabase systems. The general applicability of the new primitive is further demonstrated byusing it in several representative database environments.,*,1995,4
Context-specific synchronization for atomic data types,Man Hon Wong; Divyakant Agrawal,Abstract Highly concurrent and reliable atomic data types are crucial for the design ofdistributed systems. Deferred update (DU) and update-in-place (UIP) are two commonrecovery strategies for implementing atomic data types. These two strategies placeincomparable constraints on the conflict relations between concurrent operations resulting inincomparable synchronization protocols. Also; the conflict relations used are usually static inthe sense that the algorithms do not use the context-specific information that may beavailable in the system. In this paper; a new synchronization mechanism that employs ahybrid recovery scheme by using both DU and UIP is proposed. Furthermore; the protocol isdynamic in the sense that the context-specific information is also used to determine conflictrelations among concurrent operations on the atomic data types. Another extension is the …,International Conference on Database Theory,1992,4
Localized-access protocols for replicated databases,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract In this paper; we present two protocols for efficient execution of transactions inreplicated databases. Transactions are executed at a single site thus avoidingcommunication overhead and distributed commitment; which are required by most otherreplica control protocols. In the first protocol; data accessibility at a site can be dynamicallyreconfigured using special transactions; which are executed on demand. In the secondprotocol; data accessibility is reconfigured by migrating ownership of individual objects inthe database. The two protocols present trade-offs with respect to atomicity; resiliency; anddata availability. The approach of local execution of user transactions improves responsetime; eliminates the need for distributed commit protocols; and accommodates databaseheterogeneity.,International Workshop on Distributed Algorithms,1990,4
Recovering from process failures in the time warp mechanism,Jonathan R Agre; Divyakant Agrawal,A recovery procedure for distributed systems using the time warp control mechanism isdescribed. Time warp is an optimistic execution technique in which synchronization isachieved using rollback. The recovery procedure is a protocol that exploits the redundancyalready available to implement process rollback in the time warp mechanism. Thus; therecovery protocol has little additional bookkeeping overhead; unlike many other recoveryprocedures. An informal proof of the correctness of the recovery procedure for a singleprocess failure is presented. The protocol is extended so that it becomes resilient to multipleprocess failures.,Reliable Distributed Systems; 1989.; Proceedings of the Eighth Symposium on,1989,4

This leads to a significant performancebottleneck for Relational Database Management Systems. Recent advances innanotechnology have led to the invention of MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS)based storage technology to replace disks. In this paper; we exploit the physicalcharacteristics of MEMS-based storage devices to develop a placement scheme forrelational data that enables retrieval in both row-wise and column-wise manner. We developalgorithms for different relational operations based on this data layout. Our experimentalresults and analysis demonstrate that this data layout not only improves I/O utilization; butresults in better cache performance for a variety of different relational operations.,The VLDB journal,2007,3
Search-quality tradeoffs for routing in non-ideal wireless networks,Chiranjeeb Buragohain; Divyakant Agrawal; Subhash Suri,Typical wireless routing protocols like AODV/DSR are not scalable to very large networksbecause they employ flooding for route discovery. Geographic routing protocols like GPSRare highly scalable because they require minimum control overhead; but depend onidealized link quality models (such as the unit disk model) which are not always applicable.We explore the routing spectrum between these two extremes under a realistic random linkquality model. It is common wisdom that by adding limited flooding to a protocol likegeographic routing improves quality. In this paper; we provide a formal and quantitativeformulation of this trade-off; and show both analytically and experimentally that a significantimprovement in path quality is possible by searching a narrow region around the geographicstraight-line path between the source and destination.

Using Linear Models to Monitor the Physical World with Sensors.,Fatih Emekçi; Sezai Emre Tuna; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Recent advances in hardware technology facilitate applications requiring a largenumber of sensor devices; where each sensor device has computational; storage; andcommunication capabilities. However these sensors are subject to certain constraints suchas limited power; high communication cost; low computation capability; presence of noise inreadings and low bandwidth. Since sensor devices are powered by ordinary batteries;power is a limiting resource in sensor networks and power consumption is dominated bycommunication. In order to reduce power consumption; we propose to use a linear model oftemporal; spatial and spatio-temporal correlations among sensor readings. With this model;readings of all sensors can be estimated using the readings of a few sensors by using linearobservers. Since a small set of sensors are accessed for query processing …,SSDBM,2005,3

Exploiting the multi-append-only-trend property of historical data in data warehouses,Hua-Gang Li; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Mirek Riedewald,Abstract Data warehouses maintain historical information to enable the discovery of trendsand developments over time. Hence data items usually contain time-related attributes likethe time of a sales transaction or the order and shipping date of a product. Furthermore thevalues of these time-related attributes have a tendency to increase over time. We refer to thisas the Multi-Append-Only-Trend (MAOT) property. In this paper we formalize the notion ofMAOT and show how taking advantage of this property can improve query performanceconsiderably. We focus on range aggregate queries which are essential for summarizinglarge data sets.

One of the crucial functions is tosummarize the data items within a sliding window. A sliding window contains a fixed widthspan of data elements. The data items are implicitly deleted from the sliding window; when itmoves out of the window scope. Several one-dimensional histograms have been proposedto store the succinct time information in a sliding window.

Magnetic recording system design to reduce medium noise through signal precompensation,Joseph A O'Sullivan; Dakshi Agrawal; Donald G Porter; Ronald S Indeck; Marcel W Muller,Abstract Much of the noise in magnetic recording systems is due to intrinsic properties of themagnetic medium itself. Much of this noise is repeatable in that identical waveformsrecorded in the same place on the medium (with an erasure in between) have highlycorrelated noise. This effect is exploited in the present paper through the design of systemsto estimate and subsequently correct the distortion of the recorded waveform due to mediumnoise. The approach may be applicable to other storage channels whose noise is mediumdependent such as magneto-optic media. A method for optimally reducing repeatableadditive medium noise is proposed. Simulations of this system have been run and theresults are promising.,Proc. 28th CISS,*,3

Ideally; a user will specifyan ML task in a high-level and easy-to-use language and the framework will invoke theappropriate algorithms and system configurations to execute it. An important observationtowards designing such a framework is that many ML tasks can be expressed asmathematical optimization problems; which take a specific form. Furthermore; theseoptimization problems can be efficiently solved using variations of the gradient descent (GD)algorithm. Thus; to decouple a user specification of an ML task from its execution; a keycomponent is a GD optimizer. We propose a cost-based GD optimizer that selects the bestGD plan for a given ML task.

Automated Disassembly Sequence Planning and Optimization,Deepak Agrawal; Phani T Nallamothu; Supreet R Mandala; Soundar Kumara; Daniel A Finke,Abstract Disassembly is an important activity which directly governs the cost of products.Literature reveals that much of the research has been focused on assembly sequenceplanning. The disassembly planning problem; however; needs a separate consideration onaccount of the need for partial disassembly and other constraints. This paper reports theseamless design and implementation of a software system which automatically determineshow to disassemble a product completely; given only a geometric description of theassembly. The system is conceptually divided into two stages. The first stage takes the CADmodel of the product assembly as input; which generates interference matrices for principaldirections (±x;±y;±z). A precedence relationship is determined from these interferencematrices to aid in the generation of disassembly sequences. In the second stage a user …,IIE Annual Conference. Proceedings,2013,2
Towards the End-to-End Design for Big Data Management in the Cloud: Why; How; and When?,Divy Agrawal,Abstract With the wide-scale adoption of cloud computing and with the explosion in thenumber of distributed applications and end-user devices; we are witnessing insatiabledesire to build bigger-and-bigger systems that can serve hundreds of millions of end-users;are highly automated; and can collect enormous amounts of data in short periods of time.Often newer systems are implemented by integrating existing sub-systems that are alreadyin use. A consequence of such a massive-scale integration is that it is very difficult to have acomplete understanding of the overall system design. In fact; recent examples indicate thatthe only way to debug and test newer modules is to put them in live deployments thatsometimes can lead to disastrous outcomes. In this talk; I will use some of the recent eventsin the context of Big Data and Cloud Computing as a motivation to argue that we need …,BTW,2013,2
InfoPuzzle: exploring group decision making in mobile peer-to-peer databases,Aaron J Elmore; Sudipto Das; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract As Internet-based services and mobile computing devices; such as smartphonesand tablets; become ubiquitous; society's reliance on them to accomplish critical and time-sensitive tasks; such as information dissemination and collaborative decision making; alsoincreases. Dependence on these media magnifies the damage caused by their disruption;whether malicious or natural. For instance; a natural disaster disrupting cellular and Internetinfrastructures impedes information spread; which in turn leads to chaos; both among thevictims as well as the aid providers. Decentralized and ad-hoc mechanisms for informationdissemination and decision making are paramount to help restore order.

From a virtualized computing nucleus to a cloud computing universe: a case for dynamic clouds,Divyakant Agrawal; Sudipto Das; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract The current model of the cloud consists of a static set of data centers (or cloudcores) which drive the computation and storage needs of large numbers of applications. Weenvision a new paradigm where the cloud will be comprised of a large dynamic collection ofcloud cores along with a static set of cores; the nucleus; to create a cloud computinguniverse with a capacity much larger than the nucleus and a cost much smaller than owningthe entire infrastructure. This model is rooted by the observation that a tremendous amountof computation exists outside the core that can potentially augment the nucleus' capacity. Anexample of this surplus capacity are enterprizes with diurnal trends in usage behavior thatjoin the cloud during predicted periods of usage troughs. We propose to leverage this elasticand dynamic infrastructure to create a unified cloud service. A number of challenges; at …,*,2011,2

Improving user response times in application delivery networks through reduction of network and server latencies,K SELÇUK CANDAN; Wen-Syan Li; Divyakant Agrawal,An application delivery network (ADN) consists of a set of servers distributed over a largewide area network. In general; ADNs employ two approaches to improve performance interms of response time:(1) use topological proximity on the network to redirect clients to aclosest server; and (2) balance the load of the servers in the original source or the contentdelivery network using a load balancing algorithm. These two approaches aim to minimizethe two major parameters; network latency and server latency; respectively. To acceleratedelivery of static content; network latency is the major parameter to minimize. However; toaccelerate delivery of dynamically generated content; both parameters are important and asolution requires to achieve a balance between these two approaches.

Cross layer performance evaluation of a software defined radio UWB receiver using turbo decoding,Chittabrata Ghosh; Dharma P Agrawal,The design of a Software Deflned Radio (SDR) receiver is a persisting research challenge.Our research work makes an attempt to utilize wideband transmission techniques like Ultra-Wideband (UWB) for the detailed cross-layer design of a SDR receiver. But UWB signals areprone to severe multipath fading. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) isintroduced in our SDR receiver since it is robust to multipath fading. The addition of iterativeTurbo decoding further improves the performance of the SDR receiver in such scenario.Additionally; rake filtering is included for optimal coherence of multipath components. Theperformance of the receiver has been evaluated in terms of bit error rate (BER) analysis insevere multipath faded channels with exponential power delay profile.

Attribute-based access to distributed data over P2P networks,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Subhash Suri,Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks are distributed data sharing systems with no dedicated andcentralised infrastructure. While P2P systems have been used so far mainly for file sharing;their true potential lies as a vast; loosely connected worldwide infrastructure for sharingresources; data and information. This paper addresses a natural step in the evolution ofP2P: data and information sharing where data is accessed based on its attributes orproperties. We have identified diverse applications that can benefit directly from attribute-based access to distributed data over P2P systems. Based on the application requirements;we propose three new models for both data distribution and data accesses.,International Journal of Computational Science and Engineering,2007,2

Automated Storage Management with QoS Guarantee in Large-scale Virtualized Storage Systems.,Lin Qiao; Balakrishna R Iyer; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Storage virtualization in modern storage systems allows variability in the number of“physical” disks supporting a single “virtual” disk. In practice; IO workloads vary with time.Presuming the evolution of reasonable predictive models with the power of accuratelypredicting IO workload; it may be argued that it is straightforward to compute the number ofdisks needed at any time to satisfy QoS constraints. However; because disks contain data;the data also needs to be reallocated amongst disks. Not only does data migration need tobe scheduled ahead but it must also be scheduled in such a way that QoS violations do notoccur because of the extra migration IOs. In this paper; we present a novel analyticframework; PULSTORE; for autonomically managing the storage to balance both cost andperformance.

MARS: A Matching and Ranking System for XML Content and Structure Retrieval,S Alireza Aghili; Hua-Gang Li; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Structural queries specify complex predicates on the content and the structure of theelements of tree-structured XML documents. Recent works have typically applied top-downdecomposition of the twig patterns into (i) parent-child or ancestordescendant relationships;or (ii) path expression queries; and then followed by a join operation to reconstruct matchedtwig patterns. This demonstration system is the implementation prototype of an efficientheuristic-based bottom-up approach named MARS (Matching And Ranking System for xmlstructure queries); for matching and ranking of structural query patterns for XML queryprocessing. An efficient nearest common ancestor labeling scheme is applied to utilize fastbottomup construction of the subtree matches from the potential keywords.

Due to the curse of dimensionality; it is hard toimprove the query cost of similarity search in a high dimensional space. The problem isgetting even worse when objects are represented using sets of local feature vectors; sincethe distance measurement among vector sets is the minimum matching distance. In theminimum matching distance; the vectors from two sets are paired to minimize the sum of thedistance of all pairs while the distance measurements over single feature vectors do notneed the process of pairing. In this paper; we extend the minimum matching distance to theEuclidean minimum matching distance and the Manhattan minimum matching distancesince Euclidean and Manhattan distances are commonly used in similarity search over …,Department of Computer Science; University of California; Santa Barbara; Tech.

Disk allocation for fast range and nearest-neighbor queries,Sunil Prabhakar; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract As databases increasingly integrate non-textual multimedia information it isbecoming necessary to support efficient similarity searching in addition to range searching.Range and nearest-neighbor (similarity) queries are the most important class of queries formultimedia and multi-dimensional databases. Due to the large sizes of the datasetsinvolved; I/O is a critical factor limiting performance. The use of parallel I/O throughdeclustering of the data is a promising approach to improve performance. Consequentlyseveral research efforts have addressed the problem of declustering multidimensional datafor optimizing range and partial match queries. Very limited work has been done forsimilarity queries; and the problem of declustering for combined range and similarity querieshas not been addressed in the literature.

Towards a formal model for view maintenance in data warehouses,Achour Mostefaoui; Michel Raynal; Matthieu Roy; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,As the capability for storing data increases; there is a greater need for developing analysistools that provide aggregation and summarization capabilities. In the context of databases; anew class of query processing referred to as OLAP (OnLine Analytical Processing) hasemerged for aggregating and summarizing vast amount of data. A typical example of anOLAP query is to identify total sales for a product type in a geographic region over a specificperiod of time. As this example illustrates; since OLAP queries need to scan the data foraggregation; executing them on traditional DBMSs will adversely impact the OLTP (OnLineTransaction Processing) workload; which typically consists of short update transactions.Furthermore; enterprise wide data is typically stored on multiple database repositories. Suchgeographical distribution leads to expensive distributed processing for OLAP queries …,Proceedings of the twenty-first annual symposium on Principles of distributed computing,2002,2
Dynamic multidimensional data cubes,Mirek Riedewald; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,ABSTRACT Data cubes are ubiquitous tools in data warehousing; online analyticalprocessing; and decision support applications. Based on a selection of precomputed andmaterialized aggregate values; they can dramatically speed up aggregation andsummarization over large data collections. Traditionally; the emphasis has been on loweringquery costs with little regard to maintenance; ie; update cost issues. We argue that currenttrends require data cubes to be not only query-efficient; but also dynamic at the same time;and we also show how this can be achieved. Several array-based techniques with differenttradeoffs between query and update cost are discussed in detail. We also survey selectedapproaches for sparse data and the popular data cube operator; CUBE. Moreover; this workincludes an overview of future trends and their impact on data cubes.,Multidimensional Databases: Problems and Solutions: Problems and Solutions,2002,2

Optimal partitioning for spatial data,Hakan Ferhatosmanoglu; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract It is desirable to design partitioning techniques that minimize the I/O time incurredduring query execution in spatial databases. In this paper; we explore optimal partitioningtechniques for spatial data for di erent types of queries. In particular; we show thathexagonal partitioning has optimal I/O cost for circular queries compared to all possible non-overlapping partitioning techniques that use convex regions. For rectangular queries; weshow that although for the special case when queries are rectilinear; rectangular gridpartitioning gives superior performance; hexagonal partitioning has overall better I/O cost fora general class of range queries. We also discuss storage and retrieval techniques forhexagonal partitioning using current techniques for rectangular grid partitioning. i,Technical Report; Comp. Sci. Dept.,2000,2

Abbadi. Using broadcast primitives in replicated databases,I Stanoi; D Agrawal; A El Abbadi,Abstract We explore the use of di erent variants of broadcast protocols for managingreplicated databases. Starting with the simplest broadcast primitive; the reliable broadcastprotocol; we show how it can be used to ensure correct transaction execution. The protocolis simple; and has several advantages; including prevention of deadlocks. However; itrequires a twophase commitment protocol for ensuring correctness. We then develop asecond protocol that uses causal broadcast and avoids the overhead of two-phase commitby exploiting the causal delivery properties of the broadcast primitives to implicitly collect therelevant information used in two-phase commit. Finally; we present a protocol that employsatomic broadcast and completely eliminates the need for acknowledgements duringtransaction commitment. 1,*,1998,2

The OLTP model is extremely rigid in the way in which itprovides access to the information for its users. There are at least two important changeswhich require a complete overhaul of the traditional OLTP model. The first is the increasingreliance on re-engineered business processes and worktlow automation for transactionprocessing. The second is extending the enterprise database connectivity to the employeesin the field.

The performance of replica control protocols in the presence of site failures,ML Liu; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Replicated data were employed in distributed databases to enhance dataavailability. However; this benefit of data availability is only realized at the cost of elaboratealgorithms that hide the underlying complexity of maintaining multiple copies of a single dataitem. The difficulty lies in keeping the copies consistent in the face of system failures while atthe same time maximizing data availability. The algorithms which address these problemsare called replica control algorithms. Although replica control has been the subject ofextensive research for quite some time now; it has yet to fulfil its promise in practicalapplications. A major reason for this lack of acceptance is that the performance impact ofthese protocols cannot be easily quantified; as very few existing performance figures ofcommercial database systems which support copies are available.

An efficient implementation of the quorum consensus protocol,ML Liu; D Agrawal; AE Abbadi,Abstract The Quorum Consensus (QC) algorithm; a replication control algorithm whichprovides serializability even in the presence of network partitioning; has been studiedextensively but is not widely implemented in practice. One of the reasons for its lack ofacceptance is that the gathering of a quorum for each operation in a transaction is non-trivialto implement. The typical approach is either (i) to send each operation to all replica sites andwait for a quorum of sites to respond; or (ii) to send each operation to a random quorum set;then retry if not all responses are received after a timeout. Both alternatives are difficult toimplement. This paper proposes a simple implementation approach which makes use of anestimated uplist at the site of a transaction coordinator. Such a list provides a hint on whichreplica sites are currently communicable. We argue that such a list is typically maintained …,*,1994,2

Dynamic logical structures: A position statement for managing replicated data,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,The authors discuss extensions to the grid protocol to improve the fault-tolerance of writeoperations by using the notions of structured read and write grid quorums. As is the case inthe standard quorum protocols; the increased fault-tolerance for write operations is at theincreased cost of executing read operations. In order to let users continue using theanalogues of the read-one-write-all protocol in the context of a logical structure; theydevelop reconfiguration protocols for dynamically adapting to failures and recovery. Thisresults in the following dichotomy. Users accesses are through the simple analogues of theread-one-write-all protocol with respect to a logical structure and therefore have lowcommunication cost for read operations. On the other hand; the reconfiguration protocoluses the notion of quorums in the context of a logical structure to ensure high data …,Management of Replicated Data; 1992.; Second Workshop on the,1992,2

Power-aware Query processing over Sensor Networks,Fatih Emekci; Hailing Yu; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract. Recent advances in hardware technology make applications requiring largenumbers of sensor devices possible; where each sensor device has computation; memory;and communication capabilities. Since sensor devices are powered by ordinary batteries;power is a limiting resource in sensor networks. Some work has been proposed to reducethe power usage by pushing part of the computation into the network to reducecommunication cost; which is an expensive operation in sensor networks. In order to furtherreduce power usage based on the inherent property of sensor networks; we propose power-aware query processing techniques for aggregation queries. Instead of giving exact answersto users' queries; we introduce precision into queries to give users full control of the tradeoffbetween precision and energy usage.

Caching at the web scale,Victor Zakhary; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Today's web applications and social networks are serving billions of users aroundthe globe. These users generate billions of key lookups and millions of data object updatesper second. A single user's social network page load requires hundreds of key lookups. Thisscale creates many design challenges for the underlying storage systems. First; thesesystems have to serve user requests with low latency. Any increase in the request latencyleads to a decrease in user interest. Second; storage systems have to be highly available.Failures should be handled seamlessly without affecting user requests. Third; usersconsume an order of magnitude more data than they produce. Therefore; storage systemshave to be optimized for read-intensive workloads. To address these challenges; distributedin-memory caching services have been widely deployed on top of persistent storage. In …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,1

APCAPT: Asymmetric power control against packet tracer attacks for base station location anonymity,Vaibhav Pandit; Hailong Li; Venkata PV Gottumukkala; Dharma P Agrawal,Base Station location anonymity is a critical aspect while securing a Wireless SensorNetwork (WSN) against local adversarial attacks. WSNs have a wide range of applicationswhere security is a primary concern. Among different security issues; the area of base station(BS) location privacy has been relatively less explored. In this paper; we propose a noveltechnique to protect the location privacy of the BS against external packet tracer attacks byemploying asymmetric power control for the transmissions along the multi hop path betweenthe source and the sink. The transmission range at each sensor node is varied with theobjective of minimizing the amount of distance the packet tracer can travel towards the sink;thereby preventing the attacker from tracing packets directly to the BS. We formulate this asan optimization problem and derive the optimal transmission levels for the routing paths …,Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems (MASS); 2012 IEEE 9th International Conference on,2012,1

Towards Multitenancy for IO-bound OLAP Workloads,Hatem A Mahmoud; Hyun Jin Moon; Yun Chi; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El-Abbadi,ABSTRACT Consolidation of multiple databases on the same server allows serviceproviders to save significant resources because many production database servers are oftenunder-utilized. We consider the problem of minimizing the number of servers needed to hosta set of tenants; while satisfying the service level agreement (SLA) on the throughput of eachtenant. Recent research investigates this problem under the assumption that the workingsets of tenants are kept in main memory (eg; OLTP workloads; or in-memory OLAPworkloads); thus the buffer size of each tenant is dictated by the working set size of thattenant. In this paper we instead investigate the problem when the throughput SLAs oftenants are low enough for queries to be answered from disk. We study the trade-offbetween buffer size and query execution time for IO-bound workloads and propose an …,Bericht; University of California; Santa Barbara,2012,1

Knuckles: bringing the database to the data,Peter Alvaro; Dmitriy V Ryaboy; Divyakant Agrawal,Click-stream data warehousing has emerged as a monumental information managementand processing challenge for commercial enterprises. Traditional solutions based oncommercial DBMS technology often suffer from poor scalability and large processinglatencies. Although click-stream data tends to be collected in a distributed manner to supportscaling the servers that host the websites; in general these partitioned click-stream logs arecollated and pushed upstream to a centralised database storage repository; creating storagebottlenecks. In this paper; we propose a design of an ad-hoc retrieval system suitable forclick-stream data warehouses; in which the data remains distributed and database queriesare rewritten to be executed against the distributed data.

Selectively retrofitting monitoring in distributed systems,Animashree Anandkumar; Chatschik Bisdikian; Ting He; Dakshi Agrawal,Abstract Current distributed systems carry legacy subsystems lacking sufficientinstrumentation for monitoring the end-to-end business transactions supported by thesesystems. In the absence of instrumentation; only probabilistic monitoring is possible by usingtime-stamped log-records. Retro fitting these systems with expensive monitoringinstrumentation provides high-granularity; precise tracking of transactions. Given a limitedbudget; local instrumentation strategies which maximize the effectiveness of monitoringtransactions throughout the system are proposed. The operation of the end-to-end system ismodeled by a queuing network; each queue represents a subsystem which produces time-stamped log-records as transactions pass through it. Two simple heuristics forinstrumentation are proposed which become optimal under certain conditions. One …,ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review,2009,1

As the number of participants grows; collusion poses a serious threatto auction performance. Small groups of colluding bidders can make use of the interferenceconstraints to manipulate auction outcomes; leading to unfair spectrum distribution andsignificant loss in auction revenue. Prior designs; however; are either forced to give upspatial reuse for collusion-resistance; become computationally prohibitive; or can onlyaddress very limited types of collusion. In this paper; we present DC2; a systematic auctiondesign that can effectively discourage collusion and achieve spatial reuse; even whenmultiple collusion groups are present. DC2 achieves this using a novel 3-stage “Divide;Conquer; and Combine” procedure that integrates an efficient spectrum allocation …,*,2009,1
Verification of string manipulating programs using multi-track automata,Fang Yu; Tevfik Bultan; Oscar H Ibarra,Abstract Verification of string manipulation operations is a crucial problem in computersecurity. We present a new symbolic string verification technique that can be used to provethat vulnerabilities that result from improper string manipulation do not exist in a givenprogram. We formally characterize the string verification problem as the reachability analysisof string systems; programs that contain only string variables and allow a limited set ofoperations on them. We show that string analysis problem is undecidable with even threevariables if branch conditions that compare different variables are allowed. We develop asound symbolic analysis technique for string verification that over-approximates thereachable states of the string system. We represent the set of string values that stringvariables can take using multi-track deterministic finite automata and implement a forward …,*,2008,1

Guaranteeing correctness of lock-free range queries over P2P data,Stacy Patterson; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract As P2P systems evolve into a platform for full-fledged distributed databasemanagement systems; the need arises for sophisticated query support and guarantees onquery correctness. While there has been recent work addressing range queries in P2Psystems; the work on query correctness is just beginning. Linga et al.[1] provided the firstformal definition of correctness for range queries in P2P systems and described a lock-based range query technique that is provably correct. A natural question that arises iswhether it is possible to develop a lock-free protocol that can meet the same guarantee ofcorrectness. In this paper; we demonstrate the feasibility of lock-free correct protocols by firstdeveloping a simple; proof-of-concept query protocol and verifying that this protocol meetsthe correctness conditions.

Exploiting sequential access when declustering data over disks and MEMS-based storage,Hailing Yu; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Due to the large difference between seek time and transfer time in current disktechnology; it is advantageous to perform large I/O using a single sequential access ratherthan multiple small random I/O accesses. However; prior optimal cost and data placementapproaches for processing range queries over two-dimensional datasets do not considerthis property. In particular; these techniques do not consider the issue of sequential dataplacement when multiple I/O blocks need to be retrieved from a single device. In this paper;we reevaluate the optimal cost of range queries by declustering two-dimensional datasetsover multiple devices; and prove that; in general; it is impossible to achieve the new optimalcost. This is because disks cannot facilitate two-dimensional sequential access which isrequired by the new optimal cost. Then we revisit the existing data allocation schemes …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2006,1

Consequently; manydatabase-driven Web applications rely on data centers that host applications and databasecontents. Such IT infrastructure enables generation of requested pages at locations muchcloser to the end-users; thus reducing network latency. However; it incurs additionalcomplexity associated with database/data center synchronization and data freshness.

At thesame time the bene t of taking full advantage of the hard disk geometry is often overlooked.This paper presents the Multiresolution File Scan (MFS) approach which is based on aselection of at les which are accessed with fast sequential I/O operations. Its simple structureand low storage overhead allow MFS to scale to high dimensionality while making the bestuse of the increasing transfer speed of modern hard disks.

Based upon recent experimental results; themultiplicative model should be the more realistic of the two models; and hence is discussedin more detail. The anticipated increase in performance is quantified in terms of the signalswritten on the medium and the noise power.,Coding and Signal Processing for Information Storage,1995,1

On the power of reconfiguration in fault-tolerant distributed databases,El Abbadi,Dynamic reconfiguration is used to significantly increase fault-tolerance in replicateddatabases. This is illustrated for both unstructured and logically structured replicateddatabases. Previous work on reconfiguration was mainly concerned with changes within aparticular replica management protocol. The authors extend this approach to applyreconfiguration from one protocol to another. A generalized reconfiguration mechanism isproposed for designing large and scalable distributed databases. Reconfiguration not onlyensures a high degree of fault-tolerance but also provides high performance. Finally; thegeneralized reconfiguration mechanism can be used by the database designers todynamically adapt database performance and availability to changing application needsand underlying network conditions.,System Sciences; 1994.

Semantics-based failure recovery in distributed systems with optimistic message logging,Hong Va Leongy; Divyakant Agrawaly,Abstract Recovery from failures is important in distributed computing. A common techniqueto support recovery is asynchronous checkpointing; coupled with optimistic messagelogging. These schemes have low overheads during failure-free operations and can providean acceptable degree of fault-tolerance. Central to these protocols is the determination of amaximal consistent global state; which is recoverable. Message semantics is not exploited inmost existing recovery protocols to determine the recoverable state. We propose to identifymessages that are not in uential in the computation through message semantics. Thesemessages can be logically removed from the computation without changing its meaning orresult. In this paper; we illustrate with examples how the removal of these messagesimproves the theoretical maximal consistent global state. Taking semantics into account …,*,1994,1

Modular Synchronization in Multiversion Databases: Version Control and Concurrency Control,Soumitra Senguptat,Abstract In this paper we propose a version control mechanism that enhances the modularityand extensibility of multiversion concurrency control algorithms. We decouple themultiversion algorithms into two components: version control and concurrency control. Thispermits modular development of multiversion protocols; and simplifies the task of proving thecorrectness of these protocols. An interesting feature of our framework is that the executionof read-only transactions becomes completely independent of the underlying concurrencycontrol implementation. Also; algorithms with the version control mechanism have severaladvantages over most other multiversion algorithms.,Proc. ACM SIGMOD,1989,1
Optimistic concurrency control algorithms for distributed database systems,Divyakant Agrawal,Abstract We present optimistic concurrency control algorithms for non-replicated andreplicated database systems in this thesis. The optimistic concurrency control algorithm asproposed by Kung and Robinson is criticized for its problem of excessive transactionrollback. We have generalized the validation conditions of the original algorithm whichresults in reducing the amount of rollback in the system by allowing additional interleavingsof transactions. We also show that the generalized algorithm permits more concurrency thanthe optimistic concurrency control algorithm. Another problem of the optimistic concurrencycontrol algorithm is that the transactions may see inconsistent views of the database. Thisproblem can be eliminated by using a multiversion implementation of the database. Wehave combined the generalized validation condition with a multiversion database to yield …,*,1987,1

Prior works have typicallyapplied top-down decomposition of the twig patterns into (i) binary (parent-child or ancestor-descendant) relationships; or (ii) path expression queries; followed by a join operation toreconstruct matched twig patterns. However; most of these methods (i) rely on the user'sknowledge of the underlying database to pose well-formed queries; and (ii) suffer frominspecting too many irrelevant results. In this paper; we propose a novel heuristic formatching of XML twig query patterns; named TWIX; which imposed minimal restrictions onthe user and causes substantial reduction of the search space through a distributed …,University of California; Santa Barbara,*,1
FUCA: Fuzzy‐based unequal clustering algorithm to prolong the lifetime of wireless sensor networks,Deepika Agrawal; Sudhakar Pandey,Summary Wireless sensor network comprises billions of nodes that work collaboratively;gather data; and transmit to the sink.“Energy hole” or “hotspot” problem is a phenomenon inwhich nodes near to the sink die prematurely; which causes the network partition. This isbecause of the imbalance of the consumption of energy by the nodes in wireless sensornetworks. This decreases the network's lifetime. Unequal clustering is a technique to copeup with this issue. In this paper; an algorithm;“fuzzy-based unequal clustering algorithm;” isproposed to prolong the lifetime of the network. This protocol forms unequal clusters. This isto balance the energy consumption. Cluster head selection is done through fuzzy logicapproach. Input variables are the distance to base station; residual energy; and density.Competition radius and rank are the two output fuzzy variables.

Janus: A Hybrid Scalable Multi-Representation Cloud Datastore,Vaibhav Arora; Faisal Nawab; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Cloud-based data-intensive applications have to process high volumes of transactional andanalytical requests on large-scale data. Businesses base their decisions on the results ofanalytical requests; creating a need for real-time analytical processing. We propose Janus; ahybrid scalable cloud datastore; which enables the efficient execution of diverse workloadsby storing data in different representations. Janus manages big datasets in the context ofdatacenters; thus supporting scaling out by partitioning the data across multiple servers. Thisrequires Janus to efficiently support distributed transactions. In order to support the differentdatacenter requirements; Janus also allows diverse partitioning strategies for the differentrepresentations. Janus proposes a novel data movement pipeline to continuously ensure upto date data between the different representations.

FLIHSBC: Fuzzy Logic and Improved Harmony Search Based Clustering Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks to Prolong the Network Lifetime,Deepika Agrawal; Sudhakar Pandey,Abstract Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a rapidly growing technology. WSNscomprises of sensor nodes having limited energy as battery powers them. These batteriescannot be changed or recharged as they are operated in a harsh environment. Energyconservation mechanism should be developed. Through study; it is found that clustering isan approach for achieving energy efficiency. In this type of protocols; cluster heads (CH) arechosen among the sensor nodes and then clusters are formed by assigning non-clusterhead to the nearest cluster head. Load balancing and the distribution of the cluster headsare the major drawbacks. To deal with the mentioned difficulties; a double optimizationbased on fuzzy logic approach and harmony search algorithm is proposed in this paperknown as fuzzy logic and improved harmony search based clustering (FLIHSBC) …,International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing and Ambient Intelligence,2017,*
Leader or Majority: Why have one when you can have both? Improving Read Scalability in Raft-like consensus protocols,Vaibhav Arora; Tanuj Mittal; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi; Xun Xue; Zhiyanan Zhiyanan; Zhujianfeng Zhujianfeng,Abstract: Consensus protocols are used to provide consistency guarantees over replicateddata in a distributed system; and allow a set of replicas to work together as a coherent group.Raft is a consensus protocol that is designed to be easy to understand and implement. It isequivalent to Multi-Paxos in fault-tolerance and performance. It uses a leader basedapproach for coordinating replication to a majority. The leader regularly informs the followersof its existence using heartbeats. All reads and writes go through the leader to ensure strongconsistency. However; read-heavy workloads increase load on the leader since thefollowers in Raft are maintained as cold standbys. Since the algorithm itself guaranteesreplication to at least a majority; why not exploit this fact to serve strongly consistent readswithout a leader? We propose mechanisms to use quorum reads in Raft to offload the …,Proceedings of the 9th USENIX Conference on Hot Topics in Cloud Computing,2017,*
Typhon: Consistency Semantics for Multi-Representation Data Processing,Vaibhav Arora; Faisal Nawab; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Variety of data has led to the fall of the" One size fits all" paradigm in databases. Applicationsnow store data in multiple data representations; rather than just storing the data in a singlerelational database. However; applications only provide consistency semantics at theboundaries of a single datastore; corresponding to specific representation. This can lead tosemantically inconsistent executions; which can have undesirable consequences for theapplication users. We propose; Typhon; a multi-representation data processing framework;which defines consistency semantics across multiple representations. Typhon introduces thenotion of entities; which link the data present in diverse representations; and defines implicitcausal guarantees; which capture the logical order intended by the application user.

An energy efficient approach to extend network life time of wireless sensor networks,Veena Anand; Deepika Agrawal; Preety Tirkey; Sudhakar Pandey,Abstract The energy consumption in wireless sensor networks is a significant matter andthere are many ways to conserve energy. The use of mobile sensors is of great relevance tominimize the total energy dissipation in communication and overhead control packets. In aWSN; sensor nodes deliver sensed data back to the sink via multi hopping. The sensornodes near the sink will usually consume more battery power than others; consequently;these nodes will quickly drain out their battery energy and decrease in the network lifetime ofthe WSN. The presence of mobile sinks causes increased energy reduction in theirproximity; due to more relay load under multi hop communication. Moreover; nodedeployment technique can also be used to improve the life time of the network.

A Shared Log Storage for Applications Running on the Cloud,Faisal Nawab; Vaibhav Arora; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract—Web applications are facing unprecedented demand with users issuing millions ofrequests per second. The developer needs to scale the application to this demand whileproviding fault-tolerance and availability. This process is error-prone and need expertise thatis not necessarily part of the arsenal of a web developer. The cloud platform attracted manydevelopers for its scalability and availability guarantees. Here; we propose a distributed logstore (FLStore) that bridges the gap between the developer and the cloud. This is done byexposing a simple interface (ie; the log) that is scalable; available; and faulttolerant. Thedeveloper uses a specific API to issue read and append operations which allows buildingcomplex applications without worrying about answering the question of scalability. FLStoreis designed to be fully distributed to allow the maximum possible scalability.,GSWC 2014,2014,*

Microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP-2) in the diagnosis of hirschsprung disease–a rewarding ancillary technique,Rajesh Kumar Agrawal; Nandita Kakkar; GPS Garcha; Pankaj Kaul; Ram Samujh; KLN Rao; Rakesh Kumar Vasishita,Introduction Hirschsprung disease (HD) also known as congenital aganglionosis; ischaracterized by the absence of myenteric and submucosal ganglion cells (GC) in the distalgastrointestinal tract. Diagnosis of HD is a negative diagnosis; made on the absence of GCand missing out on even a single ganglion cell can totally change the diagnosis. Microtubuleassociated protein 2 (MAP2) immunohistochemistry is very helpful in catching the elusiveganglion cells in the small; improperly oriented rectal biopsies. Material and methods Toassess this; 72 samples from 42 suspected cases of HD were subjected to routinehaematoxylin and eosin stain and MAP 2 immunohistochemistry. Results On paraffin sectionanalysis the number of samples considered positive for HD were 24 which were broughtdown to 19 after MAP-2 analysis.

Is colorectal biopsy necessary in irritable bowel syndrome?,Kaushal Kishor Prasad; Saroj Kant Sinha; Arbab Sikander; Satya Vati Rana; Uma Debi,Background: Clinical symptom based criteria for IBS is not sufficient enough to rule outmicroscopic colitis (MC). We sought to study whether biopsy is necessary in IBS. Methods:This prospective study included colonic mucosa of 197 patients with IBS (129 IBS-D; 50 IBS-C and 18 IBS-M) to rule out MC. Results:: Overall prevalence of MC in patients with IBS was23.4%(46/197). The prevalence of MC in patients with IBS-D was 28.7%(37/129); higherthan in patients with IBS-C 12%(6/50) and IBS-M 16.7%(3/18). Conclusions:: Microscopiccolitis is present in a relevant proportion of symptomatic patients meeting diagnostic criteriafor IBS. Despite the fact that IBS is a functional disorder; in many patients morphologicalchanges occur in colon mucosa. The diagnostic criteria of IBS are not specific enough toexclude the presence of MC. Therefore; in patients of IBS; it may be reasonable to …,Pathology,2014,*
Automated Assembly Sequence Planning and Subassembly Detection,Deepak Agrawal; Soundar Kumara; Daniel Finke,Abstract Assembly planning is an important activity which directly governs more than 50% ofthe cost of products. Literature reveals that considerable theoretical work has been focusedon assembly sequence planning but very little work addresses practical implementation. Theassembly planning problem needs a special consideration on account of the need for partialconstraints such as subassembly detection. This paper reports the design andimplementation of a software system which automatically determines a product assemblysequence; and subassemblies; which can be assembled in parallel; given only thegeometric description of the assembly. The system is conceptually divided into two stages.The first stage takes CAD model of the product assembly as input; which generates a contactrelationship and precedence relationship to aid in the generation of assembly sequences …,IIE Annual Conference.

Exotica/FMQM: A Persistent,D Agrawal; A El Abbadi,Abstract In the past few years there has been an increasing interest in workflow applicationsas a way of supporting complex business processes in modern corporations. Given thenature of the environment and the technology involved; workflow applications are inherentlydistributed and pose many interesting challenges to the system designer. In most cases; aclient/server architecture is used in which knowledge about the processes being executed iscentralized in one node to facilitate monitoring; auditing; and to simplify synchronization. Inthis paper; we explore a novel distributed architecture; Exotica/FMQM; for workflow systemsin which the need for such a centralized database is eliminated. Instead; we use persistentmessages as the means to store the information relevant to the execution of a businessprocess. Our approach is to completely distribute the execution of a process so individual …,Information Systems Development for Decentralized Organizations: Proceedings of the IFIP working conference on information systems development for decentralized organizations; 1995,2013,*

T-Hex: true hexagonal regular topology formation in large scale wireless sensor networks,Sanshit Sharma; Vaibhav Pandit; Dharma P Agrawal,Wireless Sensor Network (WSNs) have seen a steady rise in their popularity and havebecome an integral part of a large spectrum of applications. Many of these applicationsadvocate the use of large scale WSNs with dense deployments to provide comprehensivesensing coverage. The formation of clusters or overlay networks has been observed toimprove the performance of such large scale networks. Furthermore; regular topologies offermany advantages when dealing with networks of this size. Current schemes focus oncreating logical or semi-logical regular overlay networks only.

Tracheal Diverticulum: A Rare Cause Of Dysphagia,P Kaul; R Agrawal,Tracheal diverticulum is a paratracheal air cyst lined by ciliated columnar epithelium that hasa communication with the trachea. It is usually an incidental radiographic finding with afrequency of about 1% on autopsy. They are predominantly right-sided possibly due to thesupportive effect of the esophagus on the left. Tracheal diverticuli can be divided intocongenital and acquired forms. The congenital diverticula are rare and thought to be due tomalformed supernumerary branches of trachea. The acquired form are thought to beproduced by bulging of a weak part in the tracheal wall secondary to increased intraluminalpressure. They have been associated with COPD and can be a sign of COPD.

Failure mechanisms and electromechanical coupling in semiconducting nanowires,HD Espinosa; R Agrawal; B Peng; RA Bernal,Abstract One dimensional nanostructures; like nanowires and nanotubes; are increasinglybeing researched for the development of next generation devices like logic gates;transistors; and solar cells. In particular; semiconducting nanowires with a nonsymmetricwurtzitic crystal structure; such as zinc oxide (ZnO) and gallium nitride (GaN); have drawnimmense research interests due to their electromechanical coupling. The designing of thefuture nanowire-based devices requires component-level characterization of individualnanowires. In this paper; we present a unique experimental set-up to characterize themechanical and electromechanical behaviour of individual nanowires. Using this set-up andcomplementary atomistic simulations; mechanical properties of ZnO nanowires andelectromechanical properties of GaN nanowires were investigated.

Lately there have beenvarious optimization algorithms and models of communication introduced to tackle thatproblem. However; the scalability issues; the validity of these models and their robustness tosmall errors in the parameters of the models are unanswered problems that warrant theneed to identify simpler methods to serve the same purpose. In a recent work; Gladwellidentifies three types of important people that he claims make an idea tip and uses a smallnumber of success cases such as the sudden popularity of the Hush Puppies to support hisideas.

Hierarchical result views for keyword queries over relational databases,Shiyuan Wang; Junichi Tatemura; Arsany Sawires; Oliver Po; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Enabling keyword queries over relational databases (KQDB) benefits a largepopulation of users who have difficulty in understanding the database schema or usingSQLs. However; since there are different interpretations for a query; the results of KQDB thatmix different possible answers still make it hard for users to consume and extract theinformation that is interesting to them. To help users with different preferences understandthe query results and quickly locate the desired information; this paper proposes generatingeasy-to-navigate hierarchical result views for each interpretation to the query on the fly. Wedefine the structures for organizing these hierarchical views; provide metrics for evaluatingthem in terms of user navigation efforts; and develop an efficient algorithm for generating theview structures.

Towards Robust Firewalls Using Approximate Packet Classification,Qunfeng Dong; Dheeraj Agrawal; Zihui Ge; Jia Wang; Jianming Wu; Suman Banerjee,ABSTRACT During the past decade or two; the Internet has witnessed an ever escalatingdemand for protection against unwanted traffic; including those carrying out maliciousattacks. Packet filtering has been universally deployed in firewalls to serve as the firstdefense frontier against such unwanted traffic. Thus far in practice; packet filtering infirewalls has followed the conventional paradigm of exact packet classification; in whichevery packet has to be classified exactly conforming to the complete set of defined rules.However; under heavy traffic load due to unusually large traffic bursts or malicious attacks;performing exact packet classification sometimes incurs load that far exceeds the firewall'scapacity. It is not rare for firewalls to crash under such circumstances; causing considerableloss of important data and extended periods of service disruption. In this paper; we …,*,2007,*

The main challenge today is to extract usefulinformation from an overwhelmingly large amount of raw data. To support complex analysisqueries; data warehouses were introduced. They manage data; which is extracted from thedifferent operational databases and from external data sources; and they are optimized forfast query processing. For modern data warehouses; it is common to manage Terabytes ofdata. According to a recent survey by the Winter Corporation (2003); for instance; thedecision support database of SBC reached a size of almost 25 Terabytes; up from 10.5Terabytes in 2001 (Winter Corporation; 2001).,*,2005,*
New Hardware Support for Database Operations.,Nagender Bandi; Chengyu Sun; Hailing Yu; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Query processing cost in database applications can be divided into two parts: theI/O cost and the computational cost. Traditionally DBMS researchers have focused on theissue of reducing the I/O cost as it is the primary source of bottleneck in most of the databaseoperations. As the computer systems which run the DBMSs evolved; this problem worsenedbecause the speeds of secondary storage devices increased at a much slower pacecompared to the memory access and processing speeds.

Modeling and Maintaining Multi-View Data,I Stanoi; D Agrawal; A El Abbadi,Abstract. Data warehouses are designed mostly as centralized systems; and the majority ofupdate maintenance algorithms are tailored for this specific model. Maintenance methodshave been proposed either under the assumption of a single view data warehouse; a multi-view centralized model; or a multi-view distributed system with strict synchronizationrestrictions. We argue that extending this model to a multi-view distributed one; is a practicalgeneralization of the data warehouse system; and the basis for a growing number ofapplications based on the idea of cooperative views. In this paper we develop a generalframework for modeling the maintenance of multi-views in a distributed; decentralized datawarehouse; together with an efficient incremental algorithm for view maintenance.

We describe the tuning of a gigabyte-scale TPC-D database for investigation ofincremental maintenance of a materialized view. We find that incremental maintenance isfeasible over a wide range of update sizes (granularities); that intuitive SQL formulationsperform poorly; but that there are better alternatives. We show that these results can bemeaningfully evaluated and presented only in the context of reasonable instance tuning.,Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery: Second International Conference; DaWaK 2000 London; UK; September 4-6; 2000 Proceedings,2003,*

Managing and analyzing massive data sets with data cubes,Mirek Riedewald; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Data cubes combine an easy-to-understand conceptual model with animplementation that enables the fast summarization of large data sets. This makes them apowerful tool for supporting the interactive analysis of massive data collections like datawarehouses and digital libraries. This article surveys some of the recent developments indata cube research. We mainly focus on techniques for fast aggregation in datawarehousing environments. This includes work on group-by and range queries;approximate query responses; and compression. Since sparse high-dimensional data cubesare of increasing interest; issues related to them are explicitly discussed.,*,2002,*

The Iterative Data Cube,Mirek Riedewald; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract. Data cubes provide aggregate information to support the analysis of the contents ofdata warehouses and databases. An important tool to analyze data in data cubes is therange query. For range queries that summarize large regions of massive data cubes;computing the query result on-the-y can result in non-interactive response times (eg in theorder of minutes). To speed up range queries; values that summarize regions of the datacube are pre-computed and stored. This faster response time results in more expensiveupdates and/or space overhead. In this paper a technique is presented that generates a newclass of schemes that support range queries on data cubes {Iterative Data Cubes. The mainidea is that techniques that provide a certain tradeo of query and update costs for a one-dimensional data cube are applied iteratively along the dimensions of data cubes of …,University of California; Santa Barbara; Computer Science Technical Report,2000,*

Technical Report TRCS99-32 Epidemic Quorums for Managing Replicated Data,JoAnne Holliday; Robert Steinke; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract In the epidemic model an update is initiated on a single site; and is propagated toother sites in a lazy manner. When combined with version vectors and event logs; thispropagation mechanism delivers updates in causal order despite communication failures.We integrate quorums into the epidemic model to processes transactions on replicated data.Causal order helps establish the global serialization order on transactions. Our approachenforces serializability by aborting transactions that may cause inconsistency. In theabsence of con ict a transaction can commit as soon as it is known to a quorum of sites. Inthe presence of con ict; sites vote and a transaction can commit as soon as a quorum of sitesvote for it. We present a detailed simulation study of a distributed replicated database anddemonstrate the performance improvements.,*,1999,*
View Derivation Graph with Edge Fitting for Data Warehousing in Disconnected Environments,I Stanoi; D Agrawal; AE Abbadi,Abstract Data warehouse views cache summarized information from queries over one ormultiple distributed base sources. In this paper; we address the problem of data warehousemaintenance in an environment where base source data can be stored on mobile devices.The requirements of a partially disconnected world lead to significant tradeoffs between theview update cost on one hand; and the level of freshness of the view on the other hand.Current decentralized maintenance methods that can be applied to a disconnectedenvironment involve either replicating of source data at the view; or computing view updatesthrough queries to all base sources. Replication may involve excessive storage overhead;while view update may be blocked due to the disconnection of any of the base sources.

Concentric Hyperspaces and Disk Allocation for Fast Parallel Searching,Hakan Ferhatosmanoglu; Divyakanth Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Data partitioning and declustering have been extensively used in the past toparallelize I/O for range queries. Numerous declustering and disk allocation techniqueshave been proposed in the literature. However; most of these techniques were primarilydesigned for two-dimensional data and for balanced partitioning of the data space. Asdatabases increasingly integrate multimedia information in the form of image; video; andaudio data; it is necessary to extend the declustering techniques for multidimensional data.In this paper; we first establish that traditional declustering techniques do not scale for high-dimensional data. We then propose several new partitioning schemes based on concentrichyperspaces. We then develop disk allocation methods for each of the proposed schemes.We conclude with an evaluation of range queries based on these schemes and show that …,*,1999,*
Letter from the Special Issue Editor,Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El  Abbadi,Data replication is one of the oldest and most persistent topics of research in distributeddatabases. It holds the promise of solving both problems of fault-tolerance and performance.By replicating the data on remote sites; failures may occur and users may still be able toaccess data; alternatively; if a data item is replicated on a local or nearby site; accesses tothat copy are efficient and may involve very low overhead. To obtain these benefits;however; complex and expensive synchronization mechanisms are often needed tomaintain the consistency and integrity of data. In fact it has often been argued that due to thesynchronization overheads and the increased possibility of deadlock; replication isimpractical. Nevertheless; the appeal of replication persists and sometimes even migrates tocommercial industrial products. In this special issue various researchers and practitioners …,IEEE Data Eng.

Context-specific synchronization for atomic data types in object-based databases,Hon Wong Man; Divyakant Agrawal,АННОТАЦИЯ: Highly concurrent and reliable atomic data types are crucial for object-baseddatabases. Deferred update (DU) and update-in-place (UIP) are two common recoverystrategies for implementing atomic data types. These two strategies place incomparableconstraints on the conflict relations between concurrent operations resulting in incomparablesynchronization protocols. Also; the conflict relations used are usually static in the sense thatthey depend only on the operation types; and the algorithms do not use the context-specificinformation that may be available in the system. In this paper; a new synchronizationmechanism that employs a hybrid scheme by using both DU and UIP is proposed.Furthermore; the protocol is dynamic in the sense that context-specific information is alsoused to determine conflict relations among concurrent operations. Another extension is …,Theoretical Computer Science,1995,*
Exclusion Algorithm,D AGRAWAL; AHI ABBADI,In this paper; we propose a token-based distributed mutual exclusion algorithm that isresilient to site and conmunication failures. The protocol uses the notion of logical time todetect the loss of the token and to recover the state of the lost token. Unlike otherapproaches; this results in the integration of token recovery due to failures with the protocolitself. Thus; we eliminate the need for expensive election protocols that are generally used intoken-based algorithms to regenerate lost tokens. We also introduce the notion of weaklyconsistent replicated queues that are used to ensure freedom from starvation. c. 199sAcademie Press; Ine.,*,1995,*

Efficient information dissemination in computer networks,A Malpani; Divyakant Agrawal,A common method for spreading information is by exchanging information logs amongstsites in the network. Several mechanisms for log propagation have already been proposed.All these mechanisms require that log information must be accompanied with temporalinformation; ie the state of the site sending the message when the message is sent. Theauthors eliminate the need for sending the log and temporal components together. Theydemonstrate that the separation of these two components leads to a more efficient andflexible solution of the log propagation problem. Also; the solution is more scalable; whichmakes it more suitable for large and geographically dispersed networks.,Local Computer Networks; 1989.; Proceedings 14th Conference on,1989,*

This hasled to the emergence of globalscale data management and event processing. However; theWide-Area Network (WAN) latency separating datacenters is orders of magnitude largerthan typical network latencies; and this requires a reevaluation of many of the traditionaldesign trade-offs of data management systems. Therefore; data management problems mustbe revisited to account for the new design space. In this paper; we revisit the problem ofsupporting strongly-consistent transaction processing for GSDM. This includes providing anunderstanding of the limits imposed by the WAN latency on transaction latency in addition toa design of a system framework that aims to reduce response time and increase …,*,*,*

Massive Data Processing in Map Reduce Surroundings,Manoj Dwivedi; Deepak Agrawal,Abstract—Big data is a term that refers to data sets or combinations of data sets whose size(volume); complexity (variability); and rate of growth (velocity) make them difficult to becaptured; managed; processed or analyzed by conventional technologies and tools; such asrelational databases and desktop statistics or visualization packages; within the timenecessary to make them useful. While the size used to determine whether a particular dataset is considered big data is not firmly defined and continues to change over time; mostanalysts and practitioners currently refer to data sets from 30-50 terabytes (10 12 or 1000gigabytes per terabyte) to multiple petabytes (1015 or 1000 terabytes per petabyte) as bigdata. To address the above mentioned issues; the Hadoop framework is designed to providea reliable; shared storage and analysis infrastructure to the user community. The storage …,*,*,*

Behaviour of Routing Protocols of Mobile Adhoc Netwok with Increasing Number of Groups using Group Mobility Model,Deepak Agrawal; Brajesh Patel,Abstract—A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a collection of wireless mobile nodesforming a dynamic network Topology without the aid of any existing network infrastructure orcentralized administration. Each node participating in the network acts as a host and as arouter; means they have to forward packets and identify route as well. Random waypoint isthe most common mobility model in most of the simulation based studies of various MANETrouting protocols. The Group Mobility Model has been generated by Impact of MobilityPatterns on Routing in Ad-hoc Network (IMPORTANT). In the present communication; wehave analyzed the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR); Average End to End delay; AverageThroughput; Normalized Routing Load (NRL) and number of Drop packets in CBR and TCPtraffic models using routing protocols namely AODV and DSDV.

Techniques for E cient Routing and Load Balancing in Content-Addressable Networks£,Ozgur D Sahin; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract As a Distributed Hash Table (DHT); a Content Addressable Network (CAN)provides e cient routing and object location in a decentralized manner while offering faulttolerance and dynamic peer operations. However; as opposed to other DHTs that use a at IDspace; CAN uses a multi-dimensional logical space. DHTs usually require O (logN) routinginformation per peer and provide routing in O (logN) hops; where N is the number of peers inthe system. In CAN; on the other hand; each peer keeps only constant amount of routinginformation and the routing takes O (dN1= d) hops; where d is the dimensionality of thelogical space. Hence the routing performance of CAN is worse than other DHTs especiallywhen d is small. In this paper; we describe and evaluate several schemes for e cient routingin CAN by keeping additional routing information at the peers. Furthermore; due to the …,*,*,*

In order to reduce thedemands on I/O and network resources; multi-resolution representations are beingproposed for the storage organization of images. Image decomposition techniques such aswavelets can be used to provide these multi-resolution images. The original image isrepresented by several coefficients; one of them with visual similarity to the original image;but at a lower resolution. These visually similar coefficients can be thought of as thumbnailsor icons of the original image. This paper addresses the problem of storing these multi-resolution coefficients on disks so that thumbnail browsing as well as image reconstructioncan be performed efficiently. Several strategies are evaluated to store the image …,*,*,*

A NOVEL APPROACH OF COLOR AND BRIGHTNESS PRESERVING LOCAL CONTRAST ENHANCEMENT OF COLOR IMAGES USING DIRECTIONAL GRAY RE...,Ritika Kale; Deepak Agrawal,Abstract In this work we proposed a method based on the Directional Grey RelationalAnalysis (DGRA) for image local contrast enhancement. With regard to the drawbacks of thetraditional image local enhancement; we firstly took advantage of the GRA to evaluate themean edge gray value in the window of the neighborhood instead of using otherconventional edge detection operator; and adjusted the contrast enhancement functiondomain in order to enhance the edge and at the same time prevent the smooth region inimage becoming rough. The experiment and simulation results show that the new algorithmoutperforms the classic approaches; can get better visibility improvement without muchaffecting color information of the image. Moreover; the proposed method herein widens theuse of DGRA scope; and has provided us with a new way to image enhancement.,*,*,*
Geo-placement: Geo-replicated Database Placement,Victor Zakhary; Faisal Nawab; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract—Geo-replication is the process of maintaining copies of data at geographicallydispersed datacenters for better availability and fault-tolerance. The distinguishingcharacteristic of geo-replication is the large wide-area latency between datacenters thatvaries widely depending on the location of the datacenters. Thus; choosing whichdatacenters to deploy a cloud application has a direct impact on the observable responsetime. We propose an optimization framework that automatically derives a georeplicationplacement plan with the objective of minimizing latency. By running the optimizationframework on real placement scenarios; we learn a set of placement principles for geo-replication. In this paper; we highlight the geo-replication placement principles.,*,*,*
Exploiting Single-Threaded Model in Multi-Core Systems,Chang Yao; Divyakant Agrawal; Gang Chen; Qian Lin; Beng Chin Ooi; Weng-Fai Wong; Meihui Zhang,ABSTRACT The widely adopted single-threaded OLTP model assigns a single thread toeach static partition of the database for processing transactions in a partition. This simplifiesconcurrency control while retaining parallelism. However; it suffers performance loss arisingfrom skewed workloads as well as transactions that span multiple partitions. In this paper;we present a dynamic single-threaded inmemory OLTP system; called LADS; that extendsthe simplicity of the single-threaded model. The key innovation in LADS is the separation ofdependency resolution and execution into two nonoverlapping phases for batches oftransactions. After the first phase of dependency resolution; the record actions of thetransactions are partitioned and ordered. Each independent partition is then executedsequentially by a single thread; avoiding the need for locking. By careful mapping of the …,*,*,*

Technical Report TRCS00-01 Database Replication Using Epidemic Update,JoAnne Holliday; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Due to severe performance penalties associated with synchronous replication;there is an increasing interest in asynchronous replica management protocols in whichdatabase transactions are executed locally; and the effects of these transactions areincorporated asynchronously on remote database copies. However; the asynchronousprotocols currently in use either do not guarantee consistency and serializability as neededby transactional semantics or they impose restrictions on placement of data and on whichdata objects can be updated. In this paper we investigate an epidemic update protocol thatguarantees consistency and serializability in spite of a write-anywhere capability. Weconducted experiments on a detailed simulation of a distributed; replicated database toevaluate this protocol. Our results establish that this epidemic approach is indeed a viable …,*,*,*

An E cient Implementation of the Quorum Consensus Protocol,ML Liu; D Agrawal; A El Abbadi,While distributed database systems have been the subject of extensive research; itsacceptance in the industry remains tenuous 22]. A key reason for this phenomenon is that forsuch a system to function properly; it must perform correctly in the presence ofcommunication and site failures. Although many protocols which address failures have beenproposed; their implementation has not been widespread. For example; few in the the familyof replica control protocols have ever been put into practice 24; 22]. This lack of acceptanceis largely due to (i) the di culty involved in assessing the performance impact of theprotocols; and (ii) the high complexity typically associated with such protocols. In particular;there are not enough existing distributed database applications to provide a sound basis forempirical judgements that must be exercised by the designer of a distributed database …,*,*,*

The Golden Estimator: E cient Range Query Estimation,Yi-Leh Wu; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract. Query size estimation is crucial for many database system components. Inparticular; query optimizers need e cient and accurate query size estimation when decidingamong alternative query plans. In this paper we propose the Golden Estimator; which isbased on the so called golden rule of sampling proposed by von Neumann; for estimatingthe size of single dimensional range queries. The Golden Estimator randomly samples thefrequency domain using the cumulative frequency distribution. We argue why this approachwill yield good estimates irrespective of the actual underlying distribution of values. We thenexperimentally show that the Golden Estimator gives better approximation than state of theart histogram based and wavelet based approaches under the same space requirement.,*,*,*

E cient Processing of Conical Queries,Hakan Ferhatosmanoglu; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract Conical queries are a novel type of query with an increasing number ofapplications. Traditional index structures and retrieval mechanisms; in general; have beenoptimized for rectangular and circular queries; rather than conical queries. In this paper; wefocus on conical queries which can be de ned as a multi-dimensional cone in a multi-dimensional data space. We develop a model for expressing such queries and suggest ecient techniques for evaluating them. In particular; we explore the retrieval problem in thecontext of conical query processing and develop multi-disk allocation methods speci cally forprocessing conical queries. i,*,*,*

Exploiting Atomic Broadcast in Replicated,Divyakant Agrawal; Gustavo Alonso; Amr El Abbadi; Ioana Stanoi,In spite of the fact that many applications require replicated databases either forperformance or fault-tolerance; replication has remained a research issue until recently.Today; the demand for practical replication schemes has greatly increased and some simpleprotocols are being implemented in databases (Oracle and Sybase; for instance) or inapplication development tools (Lotus Notes). These; however; are ad hoc implementationsand the issue of replicated data management is still a source of controversy amongdatabase practitioners and researchers. On one hand; traditional synchronous protocols aretoo expensive in terms of message cost and communication latency; and they aresusceptible to deadlocks when compared to non-replicated databases. An alternativeapproach based on asynchronous updates may result in inconsistencies and an ever …,*,*,*

MobiCom Poster Abstract: On the (In) Feasibility of Fine Grained Power Control,Vivek Shrivastava; Dheeraj Agrawal; Arunesh Mishra; Suman Banerjeea; Tamer Nadeemb,Spectral efficiency has been a major focus of research in wireless networks. Recenttheoretical work has shown that ideal medium access protocol using optimal power controlcan improve channel utilization by up to a factor of√ ρ; where ρ is the density of nodes in theregion [1]. Although power control mechanisms have been extensively studied in theory andsimulations; their practical evaluation has not been done throughly. Most of the powercontrol mechanisms proposed in literature [3; 4; 5] assume a very fine grained handle ontransmit power of wireless nodes and exercise this control to provide sophisticatedmechanisms of sharing wireless medium among competing flows. In this work; weinvestigate the (in) feasibility of fine-grained power control in wireless networks using realtestbed experiments. We perform detailed experiments to highlight fundamental issues …,*,*,*
Multi-rate Wireless Packets,Arunesh Mishra; Dheeraj Agrawal; Shravan Rayanchu; Suman Banerjee,ABSTRACT We introduce Multi-rate packets—packets in which different segments of theProtocol Data Unit are modulated at different rates. This is a departure from conventionalmodulation mechanisms in which the entire PDU is modulated using a single rate. While thisnotion is fairly general; in nature; we believe that such a mechanism will be particularlyuseful in wireless environments. We present various use cases of Multi-rate packets for thewidely deployed 802.11 standards; describe a software-only design and implementationpath within this standard without changing the underlying PHY and MAC layers;demonstrate the benefits of such an approach with some simple evaluation; and discussvarious challenges ahead to realize the full potential of this notion.,*,*,*

Exotica/FMDC: A Workflow Management System for Mobile and Disconnected Clients,D AGRAWAL,Abstract. Work ow Management Systems (WFMS) automate the execution of businessprocesses in environments encompassing large numbers of users distributed over a widegeographic area and using heterogeneous resources. Current implementations allow the denition and controlled execution of complex and long lived business processes as the basisfor an enterprise-wide collaborative system but; in most cases; the autonomy of the users isgreatly restricted due to architectural and design considerations. In particular; existingsystems are built around a centralized server. As a result; users need to maintain anuninterrupted connection with the server to perform the di erent tasks assigned to them. Thisis a severe restriction; especially when considering the emergence of mobile computing;and the increase in use of laptops and small computers which are connected to the …,*,*,*

Optimal Partitioning for E cient I/O in Spatial Databases,Hakan Ferhatosmanoglu; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract It is desirable to design partitioning techniques that minimize the I/O time incurredduring query execution in spatial databases. In this paper; we explore optimal partitioningtechniques for spatial data for di erent types of queries; and develop multi-disk allocationtechniques that maximize the degree of I/O parallelism obtained during the retrieval. Weshow that hexagonal partitioning has optimal I/O cost for circular queries compared to allpossible non-overlapping partitioning techniques that use convex regions. For rectangularqueries; we show that although for the special case when queries are rectilinear; rectangulargrid partitioning gives superior performance; hexagonal partitioning has overall better I/Ocost for a general class of range queries. We then discuss parallel storage and retrievaltechniques for hexagonal partitioning using current techniques for rectangular grid …,*,*,*
Technical Report TRCS00-07 Planned Disconnections for Mobile Databases,JoAnne Holliday; Divyakant Agrawal; Amr El Abbadi,Abstract As mobility permeates into todays computing and communication arena; weenvision application infrastructures that will increasingly rely on mobile technologies.Traditional database applications and information service applications will need to integratemobile entities: people and computers. In this paper; we develop a distributed databaseframework for mobile environments. A key requirement in such an environment is to supportfrequent connection and disconnection of database sites. We present algorithms thatimplement this framework in an asynchronous system.,*,*,*
Query Processing Over Peer-To-Peer Data Sharing Systems,OD Sahin A Gupta D Agrawal; A El Abbadi,Abstract Peer-to-peer systems are mainly used for object sharing currently; but they canprovide the infrastructure for many other applications. In this paper; we extend the idea ofobject sharing to data sharing on a peer-to-peer system. We propose a method; which isbased on the CAN [9] system; for efficiently evaluating range queries on such a system. Theanswers of the range queries are cached at the peers and then they are used to answerfurther range queries. The scalability and efficiency of our design is shown throughsimulation.,*,*,*
