The Design of the Borealis Stream Processing Engine.,Daniel J Abadi; Yanif Ahmad; Magdalena Balazinska; Ugur Cetintemel; Mitch Cherniack; Jeong-Hyon Hwang; Wolfgang Lindner; Anurag Maskey; Alex Rasin; Esther Ryvkina; Nesime Tatbul; Ying Xing; Stanley B Zdonik,Abstract Borealis is a second-generation distributed stream processing engine that is beingdeveloped at Brandeis University; Brown University; and MIT. Borealis inherits core streamprocessing functionality from Aurora [14] and distribution functionality from Medusa [51].Borealis modifies and extends both systems in non-trivial and critical ways to provideadvanced capabilities that are commonly required by newly-emerging stream processingapplications. In this paper; we outline the basic design and functionality of Borealis. Throughsample real-world applications; we motivate the need for dynamically revising query resultsand modifying query specifications. We then describe how Borealis addresses thesechallenges through an innovative set of features; including revision records; time travel; andcontrol lines. Finally; we present a highly flexible and scalable QoS-based optimization …,Cidr,2005,1512
HaLoop: Efficient iterative data processing on large clusters,Yingyi Bu; Bill Howe; Magdalena Balazinska; Michael D Ernst,Abstract The growing demand for large-scale data mining and data analysis applicationshas led both industry and academia to design new types of highly scalable data-intensivecomputing platforms. MapReduce and Dryad are two popular platforms in which thedataflow takes the form of a directed acyclic graph of operators. These platforms lack built-insupport for iterative programs; which arise naturally in many applications including datamining; web ranking; graph analysis; model fitting; and so on. This paper presents HaLoop;a modified version of the Hadoop MapReduce framework that is designed to serve theseapplications. HaLoop not only extends MapReduce with programming support for iterativeapplications; it also dramatically improves their efficiency by making the task scheduler loop-aware and by adding various caching mechanisms. We evaluated HaLoop on real …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,863
Scalable Distributed Stream Processing.,Mitch Cherniack; Hari Balakrishnan; Magdalena Balazinska; Donald Carney; Ugur Cetintemel; Ying Xing; Stanley B Zdonik,Abstract Stream processing fits a large class of new applications for which conventionalDBMSs fall short. Because many stream-oriented systems are inherently geographicallydistributed and because distribution offers scalable load management and higheravailability; future stream processing systems will operate in a distributed fashion. They willrun across the Internet on computers typically owned by multiple cooperating administrativedomains. This paper describes the architectural challenges facing the design of large-scaledistributed stream processing systems; and discusses novel approaches for addressing loadmanagement; high availability; and federated operation issues. We describe two streamprocessing systems; Aurora* and Medusa; which are being designed to explorecomplementary solutions to these challenges. This paper discusses the architectural …,CIDR,2003,616
Building the internet of things using RFID: the RFID ecosystem experience,Evan Welbourne; Leilani Battle; Garrett Cole; Kayla Gould; Kyle Rector; Samuel Raymer; Magdalena Balazinska; Gaetano Borriello,At the University of Washington; the RFID ecosystem creates a microcosm for the Internet ofThings. The authors developed a suite of Web-based; user-level tools and applicationsdesigned to empower users by facilitating their understanding; management; and control ofpersonal RFID data and privacy settings. They deployed these applications in the RFIDecosystem and conducted a four-week user study to measure trends in adoption andutilization of the tools and applications as well as users' qualitative reactions.,IEEE Internet computing,2009,607
Characterizing mobility and network usage in a corporate wireless local-area network,Magdalena Balazinska; Paul Castro,Abstract Wireless local-area networks are becoming increasingly popular. They arecommonplace on university campuses and inside corporations; and they have started toappear in public areas [17]. It is thus becoming increasingly important to understand usermobility patterns and network usage characteristics on wireless networks. Such anunderstanding would guide the design of applications geared toward mobile environments(eg; pervasive computing applications); would help improve simulation tools by providing amore representative workload and better user mobility models; and could result in a moreeffective deployment of wireless network components. Several studies have recently beenperformed on wire-less university campus networks and public networks. In this paper; wecomplement previous research by presenting results from a four week trace collected in a …,Proceedings of the 1st international conference on Mobile systems; applications and services,2003,589
INS/Twine: A scalable peer-to-peer architecture for intentional resource discovery,Magdalena Balazinska; Hari Balakrishnan; David Karger,Abstract The decreasing cost of computing technology is speeding the deployment ofabundant ubiquitous computation and communication. With increasingly large and dynamiccomputing environments comes the challenge of scalable resource discovery; where clientapplications search for resources (services; devices; etc.) on the network by describingsome attributes of what they are looking for. This is normally achieved through directoryservices (also called resolvers); which store resource information and resolve queries. Thispaper describes the design; implementation; and evaluation of INS/Twine; an approach toscalable intentional resource discovery; where resolvers collaborate as peers to distributeresource information and to resolve queries. Our system maps resources to resolvers bytransforming descriptions into numeric keys in a manner that preserves their …,International Conference on Pervasive Computing,2002,353
Skewtune: mitigating skew in mapreduce applications,YongChul Kwon; Magdalena Balazinska; Bill Howe; Jerome Rolia,Abstract We present an automatic skew mitigation approach for user-defined MapReduceprograms and present SkewTune; a system that implements this approach as a drop-inreplacement for an existing MapReduce implementation. There are three key challenges:(a)require no extra input from the user yet work for all MapReduce applications;(b) becompletely transparent; and (c) impose minimal overhead if there is no skew. The SkewTuneapproach addresses these challenges and works as follows: When a node in the clusterbecomes idle; SkewTune identifies the task with the greatest expected remaining processingtime. The unprocessed input data of this straggling task is then proactively repartitioned in away that fully utilizes the nodes in the cluster and preserves the ordering of the input data sothat the original output can be reconstructed by concatenation. We implement SkewTune …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,351
High-availability algorithms for distributed stream processing,J-H Hwang; Magdalena Balazinska; Alex Rasin; Ugur Cetintemel; Michael Stonebraker; Stan Zdonik,Stream-processing systems are designed to support an emerging class of applications thatrequire sophisticated and timely processing of high-volume data streams; often originating indistributed environments. Unlike traditional data-processing applications that require preciserecovery for correctness; many stream-processing applications can tolerate and benefit fromweaker recovery guarantees. In this paper; we study various recovery guarantees andpertinent recovery techniques that can meet the correctness and performance requirementsof stream-processing applications. We discuss the design and algorithmic challengesassociated with the proposed recovery techniques and describe how each can providedifferent guarantees with proper combinations of redundant processing; checkpointing; andremote logging. Using analysis and simulations; we quantify the cost of our recovery …,Data Engineering; 2005. ICDE 2005. Proceedings. 21st International Conference on,2005,303
Overview of SciDB: large scale array storage; processing and analysis,Paul G Brown,Abstract SciDB [4; 3] is a new open-source data management system intended primarily foruse in application domains that involve very large (petabyte) scale array data; for example;scientific applications such as astronomy; remote sensing and climate modeling; bio-scienceinformation management; risk management systems in financial applications; and theanalysis of web log data.

Advanced clone-analysis to support object-oriented system refactoring,Magdalena Balazinska; Ettore Merlo; Michel Dagenais; Bruno Lague; Kostas Kontogiannis,Manual source code copy and modification is often used by programmers as an easy meansfor functionality reuse. Nevertheless; such practice produces duplicated pieces of code orclones whose consistent maintenance might be difficult to achieve. It also creates implicitlinks between classes sharing a functionality. Clones are therefore good candidates forsystem redesign. This paper presents a novel approach for computer-aided clone-basedobject-oriented system refactoring. The approach is based on an advanced clone analysiswhich focuses on the extraction of clone differences and their interpretation in terms ofprogramming language entities. It also focuses on the study of contextual dependencies ofcloned methods. The clone analysis has been applied to JDK 1.1. 5; a large scale system of150 KLOC.,Reverse Engineering; 2000. Proceedings.

Fault-tolerance in the Borealis distributed stream processing system,Magdalena Balazinska; Hari Balakrishnan; Samuel Madden; Michael Stonebraker,Abstract We present a replication-based approach to fault-tolerant distributed streamprocessing in the face of node failures; network failures; and network partitions. Ourapproach aims to reduce the degree of inconsistency in the system while guaranteeing thatavailable inputs capable of being processed are processed within a specified timethreshold. This threshold allows a user to trade availability for consistency: a larger timethreshold decreases availability but limits inconsistency; while a smaller threshold increasesavailability but produces more inconsistent results based on partial data. In addition; whenfailures heal; our scheme corrects previously produced results; ensuring eventualconsistency. Our scheme uses a data-serializing operator to ensure that all replicas processdata in the same order; and thus remain consistent in the absence of failures.

This experience paper summarizes the key lessons we learned throughout thedesign and implementation of the Aurora stream-processing engine. For the past 2 years;we have built five stream-based applications using Aurora. We first describe in detail theseapplications and their implementation in Aurora. We then reflect on the design of Aurorabased on this experience. Finally; we discuss our initial ideas on a follow-on project; calledBorealis; whose goal is to eliminate the limitations of Aurora as well as to address new keychallenges and applications in the stream-processing domain.,The VLDB Journal,2004,192
The aurora and medusa projects,Ugur Cetintemel,Abstract This document summarizes the research conducted in two interrelated projects. TheAurora project being implemented at Brown and Brandeis under the direction of UgurCetintemel; Mitch Cherniack; Michael Stonebraker and Stan Zdonik strives to build a single-site high performance stream processing engine. It has an innovative collection of operators;workflow orientation; and strives to maximize quality of service for connecting applications. Afurther goal of Aurora is to extend this engine to a distributed environment in which multiplemachines closely co-operate in achieving high quality of service. In contrast; the Medusaproject being investigated at MIT under the direction of Hari Balakrishnan and MichaelStonebraker is providing networking infrastructure for Aurora operations. In addition;Medusa is stressing distributed environments where the various machines belong to …,Data Engineering,2003,190
Infranet: Circumventing Web Censorship and Surveillance.,Nick Feamster; Magdalena Balazinska; Greg Harfst; Hari Balakrishnan; David R Karger,Abstract An increasing number of countries and companies routinely block or monitoraccess to parts of the Internet. To counteract these measures; we propose Infranet; a systemthat enables clients to surreptitiously retrieve sensitive content via cooperating Web serversdistributed across the global Internet. These Infranet servers provide clients access tocensored sites while continuing to host normal uncensored content. Infranet uses a tunnelprotocol that provides a covert communication channel between its clients and servers;modulated over standard HTTP transactions that resemble innocuous Web browsing. In theupstream direction; Infranet clients send covert messages to Infranet servers by associatingmeaning to the sequence of HTTP requests being made. In the downstream direction;Infranet servers return content by hiding censored data in uncensored images using …,USENIX Security Symposium,2002,183
Measuring clone based reengineering opportunities,Magdalena Balazinska; Ettore Merlo; Michel Dagenais; Bruno Lague; Kostas Kontogiannis,Code duplication; plausibly caused by copying source code and slightly modifying it; is oftenobserved in large systems. Clone detection and documentation have been investigated byseveral researchers in the past years. Recently; research focus has shifted towards theinvestigation of software and process restructuring actions based on clone detection. Thispaper presents an original definition of a clone classification scheme useful to assess andmeasure different system reengineering opportunities. The proposed classificationconsiders each group of cloned methods in terms of the meaning of the differences existingbetween them. The algorithm used for automatic classification of clones is presentedtogether with results obtained by classifying cloned methods and measuring reengineeringopportunities in six freely available systems whose total size is about 500 KLOC of Java …,Software Metrics Symposium; 1999.

Contract-Based Load Management in Federated Distributed Systems.,Magdalena Balazinska; Hari Balakrishnan; Michael Stonebraker,Abstract This paper focuses on load management in loosely-coupled federated distributedsystems. We present a distributed mechanism for moving load between autonomousparticipants using bilateral contracts that are negotiated offline and that set bounded pricesfor moving load. We show that our mechanism has good incentive properties; efficientlyredistributes excess load; and has a low overhead in practice.,NSDI,2004,175
ParaTimer: a progress indicator for MapReduce DAGs,Kristi Morton; Magdalena Balazinska; Dan Grossman,Abstract Time-oriented progress estimation for parallel queries is a challenging problem thathas received only limited attention. In this paper; we present ParaTimer; a new type of time-remaining indicator for parallel queries. Several parallel data processing systems exist.ParaTimer targets environments where declarative queries are translated into ensembles ofMapReduce jobs. ParaTimer builds on previous techniques and makes two keycontributions. First; it estimates the progress of queries that translate into directed acyclicgraphs of MapReduce jobs; where jobs on different paths can execute concurrently (unlikeprior work that looked at sequences only). For such queries; we use a new type of critical-path-based progress-estimation approach. Second; ParaTimer handles a variety of realsystems challenges such as failures and data skew. To handle unexpected changes in …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,166
Fault-tolerance in the borealis distributed stream processing system,Magdalena Balazinska; Hari Balakrishnan; Samuel R Madden; Michael Stonebraker,Abstract Over the past few years; Stream Processing Engines (SPEs) have emerged as anew class of software systems; enabling low latency processing of streams of data arriving athigh rates. As SPEs mature and get used in monitoring applications that must continuouslyrun (eg; in network security monitoring); a significant challenge arises: SPEs must be able tohandle various software and hardware faults that occur; masking them to provide highavailability (HA). In this article; we develop; implement; and evaluate DPC (Delay; Process;and Correct); a protocol to handle crash failures of processing nodes and network failures ina distributed SPE. Like previous approaches to HA; DPC uses replication and masks manytypes of node and network failures. In the presence of network partitions; the designer of anyreplication system faces a choice between providing availability or data consistency …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2008,155

These included a nested-array data model; science-specific operations such as regrid; and support for uncertainty; lineage; and named versions.In this paper; we present an overview of SciDB's key features and outline a demonstration ofthe first version of SciDB on data and operations from one of our lighthouse users; the LargeSynoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,153
Skew-resistant parallel processing of feature-extracting scientific user-defined functions,YongChul Kwon; Magdalena Balazinska; Bill Howe; Jerome Rolia,Abstract Scientists today have the ability to generate data at an unprecedented scale andrate and; as a result; they must increasingly turn to parallel data processing engines toperform their analyses. However; the simple execution model of these engines can make itdifficult to implement efficient algorithms for scientific analytics. In particular; many scientificanalytics require the extraction of features from data represented as either amultidimensional array or points in a multidimensional space. These applications exhibitsignificant computational skew; where the runtime of different partitions depends on morethan just input size and can therefore vary dramatically and unpredictably. In this paper; wepresent SkewReduce; a new system implemented on top of Hadoop that enables users toeasily express feature extraction analyses and execute them efficiently.

Estimating the progress of MapReduce pipelines,Kristi Morton; Abram Friesen; Magdalena Balazinska; Dan Grossman,In parallel query-processing environments; accurate; time-oriented progress indicators couldprovide much utility given that inter-and intra-query execution times can have high variance.However; none of the techniques used by existing tools or available in the literature providenon-trivial progress estimation for parallel queries. In this paper; we introduce Parallax; thefirst such indicator. While several parallel data processing systems exist; the work in thispaper targets environments where queries consist of a series of MapReduce jobs. Parallaxbuilds on recently-developed techniques for estimating the progress of single-site SQLqueries; but focuses on the challenges related to parallelism and variable execution speeds.We have implemented our estimator in the Pig system and demonstrate its performancethrough experiments with the PigMix benchmark and other queries running in a real …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,138
Towards correcting input data errors probabilistically using integrity constraints,Nodira Khoussainova; Magdalena Balazinska; Dan Suciu,Abstract Mobile and pervasive applications frequently rely on devices such as RFIDantennas or sensors (light; temperature; motion) to provide them information about thephysical world. These devices; however; are unreliable. They produce streams ofinformation where portions of data may be missing; duplicated; or erroneous. Current stateof the art is to correct errors locally (eg; range constraints for temperature readings) or usespatial/temporal correlations (eg; smoothing temperature readings). However; errors areoften apparent only in a global setting; eg; missed readings of objects that are known to bepresent; or exit readings from a parking garage without matching entry readings. In thispaper; we present StreamClean; a system for correcting input data errors automaticallyusing application defined global integrity constraints. Because it is frequently impossible …,Proceedings of the 5th ACM international workshop on Data engineering for wireless and mobile access,2006,138
The HaLoop approach to large-scale iterative data analysis,Yingyi Bu; Bill Howe; Magdalena Balazinska; Michael D Ernst,Abstract The growing demand for large-scale data mining and data analysis applicationshas led both industry and academia to design new types of highly scalable data-intensivecomputing platforms.

SnipSuggest: Context-aware autocompletion for SQL,Nodira Khoussainova; YongChul Kwon; Magdalena Balazinska; Dan Suciu,Abstract In this paper; we present SnipSuggest; a system that provides on-the-go; context-aware assistance in the SQL composition process. SnipSuggest aims to help the increasingpopulation of non-expert database users; who need to perform complex analysis on theirlarge-scale datasets; but have difficulty writing SQL queries. As a user types a query;SnipSuggest recommends possible additions to various clauses in the query using relevantsnippets collected from a log of past queries. SnipSuggest's current capabilities includesuggesting tables; views; and table-valued functions in the FROM clause; columns in theSELECT clause; predicates in the WHERE clause; columns in the GROUP BY clause;aggregates; and some support for sub-queries.

Partial redesign of Java software systems based on clone analysis,Magdalena Balazinska; Ettore Merlo; Michel Dagenais; Bruno Lague; Kostas Kontogiannis,Code duplication; plausibly caused by copying source code and slightly modifying it; is oftenobserved in large systems. Clone detection and documentation have been investigated byseveral researchers in past years. Recently; research focus has shifted towards theinvestigation of software and process restructuring actions based on clone detection. Thepaper presents a new redesign approach developed for Java software systems. Theapproach factorizes the common parts of cloned methods and parameterizes theirdifferences using the strategy design pattern. The new entities created by suchtransformations are also decoupled from the original contexts of their use; thus facilitatingreuse and increasing maintainability.

Hadoop's adolescence: an analysis of Hadoop usage in scientific workloads,Kai Ren; YongChul Kwon; Magdalena Balazinska; Bill Howe,Abstract We analyze Hadoop workloads from three di? erent research clusters from a user-centric perspective. The goal is to better understand data scientists' use of the system andhow well the use of the system matches its design. Our analysis suggests that Hadoopusage is still in its adolescence. We see underuse of Hadoop features; extensions; andtools. We see significant diversity in resource usage and application styles; including someinteractive and iterative workloads; motivating new tools in the ecosystem. We also observesignificant opportunities for optimizations of these workloads. We find that job customizationand configuration are used in a narrow scope; suggesting the future pursuit of automatictuning systems. Overall; we present the first user-centered measurement study of Hadoopand find significant opportunities for improving its efficient use for data scientists.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,94
ArrayStore: a storage manager for complex parallel array processing,Emad Soroush; Magdalena Balazinska; Daniel Wang,Abstract We present the design; implementation; and evaluation of ArrayStore; a newstorage manager for complex; parallel array processing. ArrayStore builds on prior work inthe area of multidimensional data storage; but considers the new problem of supporting aparallel and more varied workload comprising not only range-queries; but also binaryoperations such as joins and complex user-defined functions. This paper makes two keycontributions. First; it examines several existing single-site storage management strategiesand array partitioning strategies to identify which combination is best suited for the array-processing workload above. Second; it develops a new and efficient storage-managementmechanism that enables parallel processing of operations that must access data fromadjacent partitions.,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,94

Cascadia: a system for specifying; detecting; and managing RFID events,Evan Welbourne; Nodira Khoussainova; Julie Letchner; Yang Li; Magdalena Balazinska; Gaetano Borriello; Dan Suciu,Abstract Cascadia is a system that provides RFID-based pervasive computing applicationswith an infrastructure for specifying; extracting and managing meaningful high-level eventsfrom raw RFID data. Cascadia provides three important services. First; it allows applicationdevelopers and even users to specify events using either a declarative query language oran intuitive visual language based on direct manipulation. Second; it provides an API thatfacilitates the development of applications which rely on RFID-based events. Third; itautomatically detects the specified events; forwards them to registered applications andstores them for later use (eg; for historical queries). We present the design andimplementation of Cascadia along with an evaluation that includes both a user study andmeasurements on traces collected in a building-wide RFID deployment.

Probabilistic event extraction from rfid data,Nodira Khoussainova; Magdalena Balazinska; Dan Suciu,Abstract-We present PEEX; a system that enables applica- tions to define and extract meaningfulprobabilistic high-level events from RFID data. PEEX effectively copes with errors in the dataand the inherent ambiguity of event extraction. I. INTRODUCTION The success of Radio FrequencyIdentification technology in industrial settings is leading many to consider pervasive deploymentsof the technology; where objects and people carry tags and RFID readers are scattered throughthe environment. RFID holds the promise of enabling many user-oriented ap- plications fromasset tracking [11] and alerting services [1]; to sophisticated elder-careapplications [9]. ExploitingRFID data presents significant challenges. RFID readers produce streams of low-level eventsof the form: "Tag 3 was seen at antenna 64 at 15:20". This low-level data must be transformedinto high-level events meaningful to applications; such as "Alice entered the conference …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008.

Homeviews: peer-to-peer middleware for personal data sharing applications,Roxana Geambasu; Magdalena Balazinska; Steven D Gribble; Henry M Levy,Abstract This paper presents HomeViews; a peer-to-peer middleware system for buildingpersonal data management applications. HomeViews provides abstractions and services fordata organization and distributed data sharing. The key innovation in HomeViews is theintegration of three concepts: views and queries from databases; a capability-basedprotection model from operating systems; and a peer-to-peer distributed architecture. UsingHomeViews; applications can (1) create views to organize files into dynamic collections;(2)share these views in a protected way across the Internet through simple exchange ofcapabilities; and (3) transparently integrate remote views and data into a user's localorganizational structures.

A case for a collaborative query management system,Nodira Khoussainova; Magda Balazinska; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; YongChul Kwon; Dan Suciu,Abstract: Over the past 40 years; database management systems (DBMSs) have evolved toprovide a sophisticated variety of data management capabilities. At the same time; tools formanaging queries over the data have remained relatively primitive. One reason for this isthat queries are typically issued through applications. They are thus debugged once and re-used repeatedly. This mode of interaction; however; is changing. As scientists (and others)store and share increasingly large volumes of data in data centers; they need the ability toanalyze the data by issuing exploratory queries. In this paper; we argue that; in these newsettings; data management systems must provide powerful query management capabilities;from query browsing to automatic query recommendations. We first discuss the requirementsfor a collaborative query management system. We outline an early system architecture …,arXiv preprint arXiv:0909.1778,2009,75
Analyzing massive astrophysical datasets: Can Pig/Hadoop or a relational DBMS help?,Sarah Loebman; Dylan Nunley; YongChul Kwon; Bill Howe; Magdalena Balazinska; Jeffrey P Gardner,As the datasets used to fuel modern scientific discovery grow increasingly large; theybecome increasingly difficult to manage using conventional software. Parallel databasemanagement systems (DBMSs) and massive-scale data processing systems such asMapReduce hold promise to address this challenge. However; since these systems have notbeen expressly designed for scientific applications; their efficacy in this domain has not beenthoroughly tested. In this paper; we study the performance of these engines in one specificdomain: massive astrophysical simulations. We develop a use case that comprises fiverepresentative queries. We implement this use case in one distributed DBMS and in thePig/Hadoop system. We compare the performance of the tools to each other and to hand-written IDL scripts. We find that certain representative analyses are easy to express in …,Cluster Computing and Workshops; 2009. CLUSTER'09. IEEE International Conference on,2009,74
Thwarting web censorship with untrusted messenger discovery,Nick Feamster; Magdalena Balazinska; Winston Wang; Hari Balakrishnan; David Karger,Abstract All existing anti-censorship systems for the Web rely on proxies to grant clientsaccess to censored information. Therefore; they face the proxy discovery problem: how canclients discover the proxies without having the censor discover and block these proxies? Toavoid widespread discovery and blocking; proxies must not be widely published and shouldbe discovered in-band. In this paper; we present a proxy discovery mechanism calledkeyspace hopping that meets this goal. Similar in spirit to frequency hopping in wirelessnetworks; keyspace hopping ensures that each client discovers only a small fraction of thetotal number of proxies. However; requiring clients to independently discover proxies from alarge set makes it practically impossible to verify the trustworthiness of every proxy andcreates the possibility of having untrusted proxies. To address this; we propose …,International Workshop on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,2003,73
Scalable clustering algorithm for N-body simulations in a shared-nothing cluster,YongChul Kwon; Dylan Nunley; Jeffrey P Gardner; Magdalena Balazinska; Bill Howe; Sarah Loebman,Abstract Scientists' ability to generate and collect massive-scale datasets is increasing. As aresult; constraints in data analysis capability rather than limitations in the availability of datahave become the bottleneck to scientific discovery. MapReduce-style platforms hold thepromise to address this growing data analysis problem; but it is not easy to express manyscientific analyses in these new frameworks. In this paper; we study data analysischallenges found in the astronomy simulation domain. In particular; we present a scalable;parallel algorithm for data clustering in this domain. Our algorithm makes two contributions.First; it shows how a clustering problem can be efficiently implemented in a MapReduce-style framework. Second; it includes optimizations that enable scalability; even in thepresence of skew.

Query-based data pricing,Paraschos Koutris; Prasang Upadhyaya; Magdalena Balazinska; Bill Howe; Dan Suciu,Abstract Data is increasingly being bought and sold online; and Web-based marketplaceservices have emerged to facilitate these activities. However; current mechanisms for pricingdata are very simple: buyers can choose only from a set of explicit views; each with aspecific price. In this article; we propose a framework for pricing data on the Internet that;given the price of a few views; allows the price of any query to be derived automatically. Wecall this capability query-based pricing. We first identify two important properties that thepricing function must satisfy; the arbitrage-free and discount-free properties. Then; we provethat there exists a unique function that satisfies these properties and extends the seller'sexplicit prices to all queries. Central to our framework is the notion of query determinacy; andin particular instance-based determinacy: we present several results regarding the …,Journal of the ACM (JACM),2015,68
Challenges for pervasive RFID-based infrastructures,Evan Welbourne; Magdalena Balazinska; Gaetano Borriello; Waylon Brunette,The success of RFID in supply chain management is leading many to consider morepersonal and pervasive deployments of this technology. Unlike industrial settings; however;deployments that involve humans raise new and critical problems related to privacy;security; uncertainty; and a more diverse and evolving set of applications. At the University ofWashington; we are deploying a building-wide RFID-based infrastructure with hundreds ofantennas and thousands of tags. Our goal is to uncover the issues of pervasive RFIDdeployments and devise techniques for addressing these issues before such deploymentsbecome common place. In this paper; we present the challenges encountered and lessonslearned during a smaller-scale pilot deployment of the system.

The bigdawg polystore system,Jennie Duggan; Aaron J Elmore; Michael Stonebraker; Magda Balazinska; Bill Howe; Jeremy Kepner; Sam Madden; David Maier; Tim Mattson; Stan Zdonik,Abstract This paper presents a new view of federated databases to address the growingneed for managing information that spans multiple data models. This trend is fueled by theproliferation of storage engines and query languages based on the observation that “no onesize fits all”. To address this shift; we propose a polystore architecture; it is designed to unifyquerying over multiple data models. We consider the challenges and opportunitiesassociated with polystores. Open questions in this space revolve around query optimizationand the assignment of objects to storage engines. We introduce our approach to thesetopics and discuss our prototype in the context of the Intel Science and Technology Centerfor Big Data,ACM Sigmod Record,2015,63
Fault-tolerant stream processing using a distributed; replicated file system,YongChul Kwon; Magdalena Balazinska; Albert Greenberg,Abstract We present SGuard; a new fault-tolerance technique for distributed streamprocessing engines (SPEs) running in clusters of commodity servers. SGuard is lessdisruptive to normal stream processing and leaves more resources available for normalstream processing than previous proposals. Like several previous schemes; SGuard isbased on rollback recovery [18]: it checkpoints the state of stream processing nodesperiodically and restarts failed nodes from their most recent checkpoints. In contrast toprevious proposals; however; SGuard performs checkpoints asynchronously: ie; operatorscontinue processing streams during the checkpoint thus reducing the potential disruptiondue to the checkpointing activity. Additionally; SGuard saves the checkpointed state into anew type of distributed and replicated file system (DFS) such as GFS [22] or HDFS [9] …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,60
Access methods for markovian streams,Julie Letchner; Christopher Re; Magdalena Balazinska; Matthai Philipose,Model-based views have recently been proposed as an effective method for querying noisysensor data. Commonly used models from the AI literature (eg; the hidden Markov model)expose to applications a stream of probabilistic and correlated state estimates computedfrom the sensor data. Many applications want to detect sophisticated patterns of states fromthese Markovian streams. Such queries are called event queries. In this paper; we present anew Markovian stream storage manager; Caldera. We develop and evaluate Caldera as acomponent of Lahar; a Markovian stream event query processing system developed inprevious work. At the heart of Caldera is a set of access methods for Markovian streams thatcan improve event query performance by orders of magnitude compared to existingtechniques; which must scan the entire stream. Our access methods use new adaptations …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,59
Physical access control for captured RFID data,Travis Kriplean; Evan Welbourne; Nodira Khoussainova; Vibhor Rastogi; Magdalena Balazinska; Gaetano Borriello; Tadayoshi Kohno; Dan Suciu,To protect the privacy of RFID data after an authorized system captures it; this policy-basedapproach constrains the data users can access to system events that occurred when andwhere they were physically present. RFID security is a vibrant research area; with manyprotection mechanisms against unauthorized RFID cloning and reading attacks emerging.However; little work has yet addressed the complementary issue of protecting the privacy ofRFID data after an authorized system has captured and stored it. We've investigated peer-to-peer privacy for personal RFID data through an access-control policy called Physical AccessControl. PAC protects privacy by constraining the data a user can obtain from the system tothose events that occurred when and where that user was physically present. While strictlylimiting information disclosure; PAC also affords a database view that augments users' …,IEEE Pervasive Computing,2007,59

Astronomy in the cloud: using mapreduce for image co-addition,Keith Wiley; Andrew Connolly; Jeff Gardner; S Krughoff; Magdalena Balazinska; Bill Howe; Y Kwon; Yingyi Bu,Abstract In the coming decade; astronomical surveys of the sky will generate tens ofterabytes of images and detect hundreds of millions of sources every night. The study ofthese sources will involve computation challenges such as anomaly detection andclassification and moving-object tracking. Since such studies benefit from the highest-qualitydata; methods such as image co-addition; ie; astrometric registration followed by per-pixelsummation; will be a critical preprocessing step prior to scientific investigation. With arequirement that these images be analyzed on a nightly basis to identify moving sourcessuch as potentially hazardous asteroids or transient objects such as supernovae; these datastreams present many computational challenges. Given the quantity of data involved; thecomputational load of these problems can only be addressed by distributing the workload …,Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific,2011,57

From theory to practice: Efficient join query evaluation in a parallel database system,Shumo Chu; Magdalena Balazinska; Dan Suciu,Abstract Big data analytics often requires processing complex queries using massiveparallelism; where the main performance metrics is the communication cost incurred duringdata reshuffling. In this paper; we describe a system that can compute efficiently complexjoin queries; including queries with cyclic joins; on a massively parallel architecture. Webuild on two independent lines of work for multi-join query evaluation: a communication-optimal algorithm for distributed evaluation; and a worst-case optimal algorithm forsequential evaluation. We evaluate these algorithms together; then describe novel; practicaloptimizations for both algorithms.,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,50
A latency and fault-tolerance optimizer for online parallel query plans,Prasang Upadhyaya; YongChul Kwon; Magdalena Balazinska,Abstract We address the problem of making online; parallel query plans fault-tolerant: ie;provide intra-query fault-tolerance without blocking. We develop an approach that not onlyachieves this goal but does so through the use of different fault-tolerance techniques atdifferent operators within a query plan. Enabling each operator to use a different fault-tolerance strategy leads to a space of fault-tolerance plans amenable to cost-basedoptimization. We develop FTOpt; a cost-based fault-tolerance optimizer that automaticallyselects the best strategy for each operator in a query plan in a manner that minimizes theexpected processing time with failures for the entire query. We implement our approach in aprototype parallel query-processing engine. Our experiments demonstrate that (1) there isno single best fault-tolerance strategy for all query plans;(2) often hybrid strategies that …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,48

This reportsummarizes the discussion and conclusions of the eighth such meeting; held October 14-15;2013 in Irvine; California. It observes that Big Data has now become a defining challenge ofour time; and that the database research community is uniquely positioned to address it; withenormous opportunities to make transformative impact. To do so; the report recommendssignificantly more attention to five research areas: scalable big/fast data infrastructures;coping with diversity in the data management landscape; end-to-end processing andunderstanding of data; cloud services; and managing the diverse roles of people in the datalife cycle.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2014,47
Moirae: History-Enhanced Monitoring.,Magdalena Balazinska; YongChul Kwon; Nathan Kuchta; Dennis Lee,ABSTRACT In this paper; we investigate the benefits and challenges of integrating historyinto a near-real-time monitoring system; and present a general purpose continuousmonitoring engine; called Moirae; that supports this integration. Moirae is designed toenable different types of queries over live and historical data. In particular; Moirae supports(1) queries that look up specific historical information for each newly detected event and (2)queries that complement new events with information about similar past events. Moiraefocuses on applications where querying a historical log in its entirety would be too slow tomeet application needs; and could potentially yield an overwhelming number of results. Thegoal of the system is to produce the most relevant approximate results quickly and; whennecessary; additional more precise results incrementally. In this paper; we discuss the …,CIDR,2007,47

Support the data enthusiast: Challenges for next-generation data-analysis systems,Kristi Morton; Magdalena Balazinska; Dan Grossman; Jock Mackinlay,Abstract We present a vision of next-generation visual analytics services. We argue thatthese services should have three related capabilities: support visual and interactive dataexploration as they do today; but also suggest relevant data to enrich visualizations; andfacilitate the integration and cleaning of that data. Most importantly; they should provide allthese capabilities seamlessly in the context of an uninterrupted data analysis cycle.

Tiresias: the database oracle for how-to queries,Alexandra Meliou; Dan Suciu,Abstract How-To queries answer fundamental data analysis questions of the form:" Howshould the input change in order to achieve the desired output". As a Reverse DataManagement problem; the evaluation of how-to queries is harder than their" forward"counterpart: hypothetical; or what-if queries. In this paper; we present Tiresias; the firstsystem that provides support for how-to queries; allowing the definition and integratedevaluation of a large set of constrained optimization problems; specifically Mixed IntegerProgramming problems; on top of a relational database system. Tiresias generates theproblem variables; constraints and objectives by issuing standard SQL statements; allowingfor its integration with any RDBMS.,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,43
Perfxplain: debugging mapreduce job performance,Nodira Khoussainova; Magdalena Balazinska; Dan Suciu,Abstract While users today have access to many tools that assist in performing large scaledata analysis tasks; understanding the performance characteristics of their parallelcomputations; such as MapReduce jobs; remains difficult. We present PerfXplain; a systemthat enables users to ask questions about the relative performances (ie; runtimes) of pairs ofMapReduce jobs. PerfXplain provides a new query language for articulating performancequeries and an algorithm for generating explanations from a log of past MapReduce jobexecutions. We formally define the notion of an explanation together with three metrics;relevance; precision; and generality; that measure explanation quality. We present theexplanation-generation algorithm based on techniques related to decision-tree building.

A probabilistic optimization framework for the empty-answer problem,Davide Mottin; Alice Marascu; Senjuti Basu Roy; Gautam Das; Themis Palpanas; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract We propose a principled optimization-based interactive query relaxation frameworkfor queries that return no answers. Given an initial query that returns an empty answer set;our framework dynamically computes and suggests alternative queries with less conditionsthan those the user has initially requested; in order to help the user arrive at a query with anon-empty answer; or at a query for which no matter how many additional conditions areignored; the answer will still be empty. Our proposed approach for suggesting queryrelaxations is driven by a novel probabilistic framework based on optimizing a wide varietyof application-dependent objective functions. We describe optimal and approximatesolutions of different optimization problems using the framework. We analyze thesesolutions; experimentally verify their efficiency and effectiveness; and illustrate their …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,42
Believe it or not: adding belief annotations to databases,Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Magdalena Balazinska; Nodira Khoussainova; Dan Suciu,Abstract We propose a database model that allows users to annotate data with beliefstatements. Our motivation comes from scientific database applications where a communityof users is working together to assemble; revise; and curate a shared data repository. As thecommunity accumulates knowledge and the database content evolves over time; it maycontain conflicting information and members can disagree on the information it should store.For example; Alice may believe that a tuple should be in the database; whereas Bobdisagrees. He may also insert the reason why he thinks Alice believes the tuple should be inthe database; and explain what he thinks the correct tuple should be instead. We propose aformal model for Belief Databases that interprets users' annotations as belief statements.These annotations can refer both to the base data and to other annotations.

Successes of thistechnology in industrial settings are leading many to consider other uses of RFID; includinguser-oriented public deployments. However; the noisy; low-level data produced by RFIDreaders is almost impossible to use or comprehend in most but the simplest settings. Wepresent PEEX (Probabilistic Event EXtractor); a system that manages probabilistic high-levelevents from imprecise and erroneous RFID data. PEEX allows users to define probabilisticevents from lower-level events. By using probabilities; the system copes with the noise in thedata and the inherent ambiguity in the event extraction.

Managing Skew in Hadoop.,YongChul Kwon; Kai Ren; Magdalena Balazinska; Bill Howe; Jerome Rolia,Abstract Challenges in Big Data analytics stem not only from volume; but also variety:extreme diversity in both data types (eg; text; images; and graphs) and in operations beyondrelational algebra (eg; machine learning; natural language processing; image processing;and graph analysis). As a result; any competitive Big Data system must support some form ofparallel user-defined operations (UDOs) that can capture complex data processing tasksover complex data types without changing the core of the parallel data processing engine.Hadoop and other popular systems have been shown to provide a convenient programmingmodel for implementing parallel UDOs; but the “black-box” nature of UDOs complicates theautomatic load balancing required to achieve parallel scalability.

Hadoop's Adolescence; A Comparative Workloads Analysis from Three Research Clusters.,Kai Ren; Garth Gibson; YongChul Kwon; Magdalena Balazinska; Bill Howe,ABSTRACT We analyze Hadoop workloads from three different research clusters from anapplication-level perspective; with two goals:(1) explore new issues in application patternsand user behavior and (2) understand key performance challenges related to IO and loadbalance. Our analysis suggests that Hadoop usage is still in its adolescence. We seeunderuse of Hadoop features; extensions; and tools as well as significant opportunities foroptimization. We see significant diversity in application styles; including some “interactive”workloads; motivating new tools in the ecosystem. We find that some conventionalapproaches to improving performance are not especially effective and suggest somealternatives. Overall; we find significant opportunity for simplifying the use and optimizationof Hadoop; and make recommendations for future research. Acknowledgements: This …,SC Companion,2012,37
How to price shared optimizations in the cloud,Prasang Upadhyaya; Magdalena Balazinska; Dan Suciu,Abstract Data-management-as-a-service systems are increasingly being used incollaborative settings; where multiple users access common datasets. Cloud providers havethe choice to implement various optimizations; such as indexing or materialized views; toaccelerate queries over these datasets. Each optimization carries a cost and may benefitmultiple users. This creates a major challenge: how to select which optimizations to performand how to share their cost among users. The problem is especially challenging when usersare selfish and will only report their true values for different optimizations if doing somaximizes their utility. In this paper; we present a new approach for selecting and pricingshared optimizations by using Mechanism Design. We first show how to apply the ShapleyValue Mechanism to the simple case of selecting and pricing additive optimizations …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,35
Longitudinal study of a building-scale rfid ecosystem,Evan Welbourne; Karl Koscher; Emad Soroush; Magdalena Balazinska; Gaetano Borriello,Abstract Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) deployments are becoming increasinglypopular in both industrial and consumer-oriented settings. To effectively exploit and operatesuch deployments; important challenges must be addressed; from managing RFID datastreams to handling limitations in reader accuracy and coverage. Furthermore; deploymentsthat support pervasive computing raise additional issues related to user acceptance andsystem utility. To better understand these challenges; we conducted a four-week study of abuilding-scale EPC Class-1 Generation-2 RFID deployment; the" RFID Ecosystem"; with 47readers (160 antennas) installed throughout an 8;000 square meter building.

Toward practical query pricing with QueryMarket,Paraschos Koutris; Prasang Upadhyaya; Magdalena Balazinska; Bill Howe; Dan Suciu,Abstract We develop a new pricing system; QueryMarket; for flexible query pricing in a datamarket based on an earlier theoretical framework (Koutris et al.; PODS 2012). To build sucha system; we show how to use an Integer Linear Programming formulation of the pricingproblem for a large class of queries; even when pricing is computationally hard. Further; weleverage query history to avoid double charging when queries purchased over time haveoverlapping information; or when the database is updated. We then present a technique thatfairly shares revenue when multiple sellers are involved. Finally; we implement ourapproach in a prototype and evaluate its performance on several query workloads.,proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD international conference on management of data,2013,29
A comparison of stream-oriented high-availability algorithms,Jeong-Hyon Hwang; Magdalena Balazinska; Alexander Rasin; Ugur Cetintemel; Michael Stonebraker; Stan Zdonik,Abstract Recently; significant efforts have focused on developing novel data-processingsystems to support a new class of applications that commonly require sophisticated andtimely processing of high-volume data streams. Early work in stream processing hasprimarily focused on streamoriented languages and resource-constrained; one-pass query-processing. High availability; an increasingly important goal for virtually all data processingsystems; is yet to be addressed. In this paper; we first describe how the standardhighavailability approaches used in data management systems can be applied to distributedstream processing. We then propose a novel stream-oriented approach that exploits theunique data-flow nature of streaming systems. Using analysis and a detailed simulationstudy; we characterize the performance of each approach and demonstrate that the …,*,2003,26
Time travel in a scientific array database,Emad Soroush; Magdalena Balazinska,In this paper; we present TimeArr; a new storage manager for an array database. TimeArrsupports the creation of a sequence of versions of each stored array and their explorationthrough two types of time travel operations: selection of a specific version of a (sub)-arrayand a more general extraction of a (sub)-array history; in the form of a series of (sub)-arrayversions. TimeArr contributes a combination of array-specific storage techniques toefficiently support these operations. To speed-up array exploration; TimeArr furtherintroduces two additional techniques. The first is the notion of approximate time travel withtwo types of operations: approximate version selection and approximate history. For theseoperations; users can tune the degree of approximation tolerable and thus trade-offaccuracy and performance in a principled manner.

Fault-tolerance and high availability in data stream management systems,Magdalena Balazinska; Jeong-Hyon Hwang; Mehul A Shah,Just like any other software system; a data stream management system (DSMS) can experiencefailures of its different components. Failures are especially common in distributed DSMSs; wherequery operators are spread across multiple processing nodes; ie; independent processes typicallyrunning on different physical machines in a local-area network (LAN) or in a wide-area network(WAN). Failures of processing nodes or failures in the underlying communication network cancause continuous queries (CQ) in a DSMS to stall or produce erroneous results. These failurescan adversely affect critical client applications relying on these queries … Traditionally; availabilityhas been defined as the fraction of time that a system remains operational and properly servicesrequests. In DSMSs; however; availability often also incorporates end-to-end latencies as applicationsneed to quickly react to real-time events and thus can tolerate only small delays. A DSMS …,*,2009,24
Querymarket demonstration: Pricing for online data markets,Paraschos Koutris; Prasang Upadhyaya; Magdalena Balazinska; Bill Howe; Dan Suciu,Abstract Increasingly data is being bought and sold online. To facilitate such transactions;online data market-places have emerged to provide a service for sellers to price views ontheir data; and buyers to buy such views. These marketplaces neither support the sale of ad-hoc queries (that are not one of the specified views); nor do they support queries that joindatasets. We present QueryMarket; a prototype data marketplace that automaticallyextrapolates prices to ad-hoc queries; including those with joins; from the manually pricedviews. We call this capability" query-based pricing" and describe how it is superior toexisting pricing methods; and how it provides more flexible pricing for the sellers. We thenshow how QueryMarket implements query-based pricing and how it generates explanationsfor the prices it computes.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,21
Session-based browsing for more effective query reuse,Nodira Khoussainova; YongChul Kwon; Wei-Ting Liao; Magdalena Balazinska; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Dan Suciu,Scientists today are able to generate and collect data at an unprecedented scale [1]. Af-terwards; scientists analyze and explore these datasets. Composing SQL queries; how-ever; is a significant challenge for scientists because most are not database experts. In thiswork; we leverage the collaborative environment that many scientists work in; which often includesa shared database with many scientists asking queries over it. As such; we utilize the collectiveknowledge of all the users by providing new users with access to a log of past queries; whichcan be used as starting points for writing new queries. However; navigating a large log of queriescan be difficult and overwhelming. In this paper; we introduce the Smart Query Browser(SQB) system. SQB supports efficient retrieval of relevant queries using what we callsession-based browsing.

Asynchronous and fault-tolerant recursive datalog evaluation in shared-nothing engines,Jingjing Wang; Magdalena Balazinska; Daniel Halperin,Abstract We present a new approach for data analytics with iterations. Users express theiranalysis in Datalog with bag-monotonic aggregate operators; which enables the expressionof computations from a broad variety of application domains. Queries are translated intoquery plans that can execute in shared-nothing engines; are incremental; and support avariety of iterative models (synchronous; asynchronous; different processing priorities) andfailure-handling techniques. The plans require only small extensions to an existing shared-nothing engine; making the approach easily implementable. We implement the approach inthe Myria big-data management system and use our implementation to empirically study theperformance characteristics of different combinations of iterative models; failure handlingmethods; and applications. Our evaluation uses workloads from a variety of application …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,19

Fault-tolerance and load management in a distributed stream processing system,Magdalena Balazinska,(cont.) When network partitions occur; DPC addresses the traditional availability-consistencytrade-off by maintaining; when possible; a desired availability specified by the application oruser; but eventually also delivering the correct results. While maintaining the desiredavailability bounds; DPC also strives to minimize the number of inaccurate results that mustlater be corrected. In contrast to previous proposals for fault tolerance in SPEs; DPCsimultaneously supports a variety of applications that differ in their preferred trade-offbetween availability and consistency. For load management; we present a Bounded-PriceMechanism (BPM) that enables autonomous participants to collaboratively handle their loadwithout individually owning the resources necessary for peak operation.

A vision for personalized service level agreements in the cloud,Jennifer Ortiz; Victor Teixeira De Almeida; Magdalena Balazinska,Abstract Public Clouds today provide a variety of services for data analysis such as AmazonElastic MapReduce and Google BigQuery. Each service comes with a pricing model andservice level agreement (SLA). Today's pricing models and SLAs are described at the levelof compute resources (instance-hours or gigabytes processed). They are also different fromone service to the next. Both conditions make it difficult for users to select a service; pick aconfiguration; and predict the actual analysis cost. To address this challenge; we propose anew abstraction; called a Personalized Service Level Agreement; where users arepresented with what they can do with their data in terms of query capabilities; guaranteedquery performance and fixed hourly prices.,Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Data Analytics in the Cloud,2013,17

The demonstrationhas two parts. First; we demonstrate how SkewTune mitigates skew in real MapReduceapplications at runtime by running a real application in a public cloud. Second; through aninteractive graphical interface; we demonstrate the details of the skew mitigation processusing both real and synthetic workloads that represent various skew configurations.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,17
Approximate lifted inference with probabilistic databases,Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Dan Suciu,Abstract This paper proposes a new approach for approximate evaluation of# P-hardqueries with probabilistic databases. In our approach; every query is evaluated entirely inthe database engine by evaluating a fixed number of query plans; each providing an upperbound on the true probability; then taking their minimum. We provide an algorithm that takesinto account important schema information to enumerate only the minimal necessary plansamong all possible plans. Importantly; this algorithm is a strict generalization of all knownresults of PTIME self-join-free conjunctive queries: A query is safe if and only if our algorithmreturns one single plan. We also apply three relational query optimization techniques toevaluate all minimal safe plans very fast. We give a detailed experimental evaluation of ourapproach and; in the process; provide a new way of thinking about the value of …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,16
Approximation trade-offs in markovian stream processing: An empirical study,Julie Letchner; Christopher Ré; Magdalena Balazinska; Matthai Philipose,A large amount of the world's data is both sequential and imprecise. Such data is commonlymodeled as Markovian streams; examples include words/sentences inferred from raw audiosignals; or discrete location sequences inferred from RFID or GPS data. The rich semanticsand large volumes of these streams make them difficult to query efficiently. In this paper; westudy the effects-on both efficiency and accuracy-of two common stream approximations.Through experiments on a realworld RFID data set; we identify conditions under which theseapproximations can improve performance by several orders of magnitude; with only minimaleffects on query results. We also identify cases when the full rich semantics are necessary.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,16

A discussion on pricing relational data,Magdalena Balazinska; Bill Howe; Paraschos Koutris; Dan Suciu; Prasang Upadhyaya,Abstract There exists a growing market for structured data on the Internet today; and thismotivates a theoretical study of how relational data should be priced. We advocate for aframework where the seller defines a pricing scheme; by essentially stipulating the price ofsome queries; and the buyer is allowed to purchase data expressed by any query they wish:the system will derive the price automatically from the pricing scheme. We show that; inorder to understand pricing; one needs to understand determinacy first. We also discusssome other open problems in pricing relational data.,*,2013,14
Specification and verification of complex location events with panoramic,Evan Welbourne; Magdalena Balazinska; Gaetano Borriello; James Fogarty,Abstract We present the design and evaluation of Panoramic; a tool that enables end-usersto specify and verify an important family of complex location events. Our approach aims toreduce or eliminate critical barriers to deployment of emerging location-aware businessactivity monitoring applications in domains like hospitals and office buildings. Panoramicdoes not require users to write code; understand complex models; perform elaboratedemonstrations; generate test location traces; or blindly trust deterministic events. Instead; itallows end-users to specify and edit complex events with a visual language that embodiesnatural concepts of space and time. It also takes a novel approach to verification; in whichevents are extracted from historical sensor data traces and then presented with intelligible;hierarchical visualizations that represent uncertainty with probabilities. We build on our …,International Conference on Pervasive Computing,2010,14

TheAurora project being implemented at Brown and Brandeis under the direction of U gur Cetintemel; Mitch Cherniack; Michael Stonebraker and Stan Zdonik strives to build a single-site high performance stream processing engine. It has an innovative collection of operators;workflow orientation; and strives to maximize quality of service for connecting applications. Afurther goal of Aurora is to extend this engine to a distributed environment in which multiplemachines closely co-operate in achieving high quality of service.,IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin,2003,14
The Aurora and Borealis Stream Processing Engines,Uğur Çetintemel; Daniel Abadi; Yanif Ahmad; Hari Balakrishnan; Magdalena Balazinska; Mitch Cherniack; Jeong-Hyon Hwang; Samuel Madden; Anurag Maskey; Alexander Rasin; Esther Ryvkina; Mike Stonebraker; Nesime Tatbul; Ying Xing; Stan Zdonik,Abstract Over the last several years; a great deal of progress has been made in the area ofstream-processing engines (SPEs). Three basic tenets distinguish SPEs from current dataprocessing engines. First; they must support primitives for streaming applications. UnlikeOnline Transaction Processing (OLTP); which processes messages in isolation; streamingapplications entail time series operations on streams of messages. Second; streamingapplications entail a real-time component. If one is content to see an answer later; then onecan store incoming messages in a data warehouse and run a historical query on thewarehouse to find information of interest. This tactic does not work if the answer must beconstructed in real time. The need for real-time answers also dictates a fundamentallydifferent storage architecture.

Squeezing a Big Orange into Little Boxes: The AscotDB System for Parallel Processing of Data on a Sphere.,Jacob VanderPlas; Emad Soroush; K Simon Krughoff; Magdalena Balazinska; Andrew Connolly,Abstract AscotDB is a new; extensible data analysis system developed at the University ofWashington for the interactive analysis of data from astronomical surveys. AscotDB is alayered system: It builds on SciDB to provide a shared-nothing; parallel array processingand data management engine. AscotDB wraps SciDB with a Python middleware thatenables efficient storage and manipulation of spherical data; such as images fromtelescopes or satellites. The goal is to support the efficient storage of raw pixel-level datawithout any prior preprocessing steps. To enable both exploratory and deep analysis of thedata; AscotDB's front-end design integrates a python interface with a graphical interfacebased on the Astronomy Collaborative Toolkit (ASCOT). AscotDB supports seamlessswitching between these two modes of interaction and captures a precise trace of a user's …,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2013,13
Clustering events on streams using complex context information,YongChul Kwon; Wing Yee Lee; Magdalena Balazinska; Guiping Xu,Monitoring applications play an increasingly important role in many domains. They detectevents in monitored systems and take actions such as invoke a program or notify anadministrator. Often administrators must then manually investigate events to figure out thesource of a problem. Stream processing engines (SPEs) are general purpose datamanagement systems for monitoring applications. They provide low-latency streamprocessing but have limited or no support for manual event investigation. In this paper; wepropose a new technique for an SPE to support event investigation by automaticallyclassifying events on streams. Unlike previous stream clustering algorithms; our approachtakes into account complex user-defined contexts for events. Our approach comprises threekey components: an event context data model; a distance measure for event contexts …,Data Mining Workshops; 2008. ICDMW'08. IEEE International Conference on,2008,13

Expressing privacy policies using authorization views,Vibhor Rastogi; Evan Welbourne; Nodira Khoussainova; Travis Kriplean; Magdalena Balazinska; Gaetano Borriello; Tadayoshi Kohno; Dan Suciu,Abstract In this paper; we design a rule-based privacy policy for the RFID Ecosystem; anRFID-based ubiquitous computing system. We start from the physical access control (PAC)rule (Kriplean et al.; IEEE Pervasive Computing 2007) that provides a default level of privacybut constrains the possible set of applications. We extend it by using principled ways ofdefining other access control rules that retain the simplicity of PAC and yet provideincreased flexibility for users and applications. We then propose authorization views as adatabase technique to implent rule-based privacy policies and demonstrate the use ofauthorization views over the privacy policy designed for the RFID Ecosystem.,Proceedings of 9th international conference on ubiquitous computing (workshop on privacy).

Challenges for event queries over markovian streams,Julie Letchner; Christopher Ré; Magdalena Balazinska; Matthai Philipose,Building applications on top of sensor data streams is challenging because sensor data isnoisy. A model-based view can reduce noise by transforming raw sensor streams intostreams of probabilistic state estimates; which smooth out errors and gaps. The authorspropose a novel model-based view; the Markovian stream; to represent correlatedprobabilistic sequences. Applications interested in evaluating event queries-extractingsophisticated state sequences-can improve robustness by querying a Markovian streamview instead of querying raw data directly. The primary challenge is to properly handle theMarkovian stream's correlations.,IEEE Internet Computing,2008,11

Efficient iterative processing in the SciDB parallel array engine,Emad Soroush; Magdalena Balazinska; Simon Krughoff; Andrew Connolly,Abstract Many scientific data-intensive applications perform iterative computations on arraydata. There exist multiple engines specialized for array processing. These engines efficientlysupport various types of operations; but none includes native support for iterativeprocessing. In this paper; we develop a model for iterative array computations and a seriesof optimizations. We evaluate the benefits of an optimized; native support for iterative arrayprocessing on the SciDB engine and real workloads from the astronomy domain.,Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2015,10
Designing good algorithms for MapReduce and beyond,Foto N Afrati; Magdalena Balazinska; Anish Das Sarma; Bill Howe; Semih Salihoglu; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract As MapReduce/Hadoop grows in importance; we find more exotic applicationsbeing written this way. Not every program written for this platform performs as well as wemight wish. There are several reasons why a MapReduce program can underperformexpectations. One is the need to balance the communication cost of transporting data fromthe mappers to the reducers against the computation done at the mappers and reducersthemselves. A second important issue is selecting the number of rounds of MapReduce. Athird issue is that of skew. If wall-clock time is important; then using many different reduce-keys and many compute nodes may minimize the time to finish the job. Yet if the data isuncooperative; and no provision is made to distribute the data evenly; much of the work isdone by a single node.,Proceedings of the Third ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing,2012,10
On-Demand View Materialization and Indexing for Network Forensic Analysis.,Roxana Geambasu; Tanya Bragin; Jaeyeon Jung; Magdalena Balazinska,Abstract Today; network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) use custom solutions to loghistorical network flows and support forensic analysis by network administrators. Thesesolutions are expensive; inefficient; and lack flexibility. In this paper; we investigate databasesupport for interactive network forensic analysis. We show that an" out-of-the-box" relationaldatabase management system (RDBMS) can support moderate flow rates in a manner thatensures high query performance. To enable support for significantly higher data rates; wepropose a technique based on on-demand view materialization and indexing. In ourapproach; when an event occurs; the system proactively extracts relevant historical data andindexes it in preparation for forensic queries over that data.

Automatic enforcement of data use policies with datalawyer,Prasang Upadhyaya; Magdalena Balazinska; Dan Suciu,Abstract Data has value and is increasingly being exchanged for commercial and researchpurposes. Data; however; is typically accompanied by terms of use; which limit how it can beused. To date; there are only a few; ad-hoc methods to enforce these terms. We proposeDataLawyer; a new system to formally specify usage policies and check them automaticallyat query runtime in a relational database management system (DBMS). We develop a newmodel to specify policies compactly and precisely. We introduce novel algorithms toefficiently evaluate policies that can cut policy-checking overheads to only a few percent ofthe total query runtime. We implement DataLawyer and evaluate it on a real database fromthe health-care domain.,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,8

Peex: Extracting probabilistic events from RFID data,Nodira Khoussainova; Magdalena Balazinska; Dan Suciu,Abstract Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology is increasingly being used tosupport various industrial and ubiquitous computing applications. Although this technologyholds the promise to facilitate many of our every day activities; the noisy and low-level dataproduced by RFID readers today is extremely difficult to use or comprehend in most but thesimplest settings. In this paper; we present PEEX; a system that enables applications toeasily define; extract; and manage meaningful probabilistic highlevel events from low-levelRFID data. By using a declarative query language; the system simplifies definitions of newevents. By using probabilities; the system copes with the noise and errors in the data and theinherent ambiguity in the event extraction.

Pipegen: Data pipe generator for hybrid analytics,Brandon Haynes; Alvin Cheung; Magdalena Balazinska,Abstract As the number of big data management systems continues to grow; usersincreasingly seek to leverage multiple systems in the context of a single data analysis task.To efficiently support such hybrid analytics; we develop a tool called PipeGen for efficientdata transfer between database management systems (DBMSs). PipeGen automaticallygenerates data pipes between DBMSs by leveraging their functionality to transfer data viadisk files using common data formats such as CSV. PipeGen creates data pipes byextending such functionality with efficient binary data transfer capabilities that avoid filesystem materialization; include multiple important format optimizations; and transfer data inparallel when possible. We evaluate our PipeGen prototype by generating 20 data pipesautomatically between five different DBMSs. The results show that PipeGen speeds up …,Proceedings of the Seventh ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing,2016,7

Hybrid merge/overlap execution technique for parallel array processing,Emad Soroush; Magdalena Balazinska,Abstract Whether in business or science; multi-dimensional arrays are a commonabstraction in data analytics and many systems exist for efficiently processing arrays. Asdataset grow in size; it is becoming increasingly important to process these arrays inparallel. In this paper; we discuss different types of array operations and review how theycan be processed in parallel using two different existing techniques. The first technique;which we call merge; consists in partitioning an array; processing the partitions in parallel;then merging the results to reconcile computations that span partition boundaries. Thesecond technique; which we call overlap; consists in partitioning an array into subarrays thatoverlap by a given number of cells along each dimension. Thanks to this overlap; the arraypartitions can be processed in parallel without any merge phase. We discuss when each …,Proceedings of the EDBT/ICDT 2011 Workshop on Array Databases,2011,7
Identifying similar past events in a continuous monitoring system,YongChul Kwon; Guiping Xu; Magdalena Balazinska,ABSTRACT Previous work on data stream management systems has enabled sophisticatedtools for continuous; low latency stream processing. These tools are useful in manyapplication domains including computer system monitoring and network monitoring. In mostmonitoring applications; however; when an abnormal event occurs; an administrator mustmanually examine the current state and the history of the system to understand whathappened and diagnose the problem. To facilitate this process; we propose a newtechnique that automatically compares events on streams and identifies past events similarto newly detected events. With our technique; an administrator is shown not only an alert butalso past alerts that resemble the current situation. At the heart of our technique is a newsimilarity measure geared specifically toward the continuous monitoring domain. In this …,Proceedings of the Very Large Data Bases Conference,2007,6
Comparative evaluation of Big-Data systems on scientific image analytics workloads,Parmita Mehta; Sven Dorkenwald; Dongfang Zhao; Tomer Kaftan; Alvin Cheung; Magdalena Balazinska; Ariel Rokem; Andrew Connolly; Jacob Vanderplas; Yusra AlSayyad,Abstract Scientific discoveries are increasingly driven by analyzing large volumes of imagedata. Many new libraries and specialized database management systems (DBMSs) haveemerged to support such tasks. It is unclear how well these systems support real-worldimage analysis use cases; and how performant the image analytics tasks implemented ontop of such systems are. In this paper; we present the first comprehensive evaluation of large-scale image analysis systems using two real-world scientific image data processing usecases. We evaluate five representative systems (SciDB; Myria; Spark; Dask; andTensorFlow) and find that each of them has shortcomings that complicate implementation orhurt performance. Such shortcomings lead to new research opportunities in making large-scale image analysis both efficient and easy to use.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,5

We implement this algorithm in theMyria shared-nothing relational data management system; which performs the computationin memory. We study resulting memory utilization challenges and implement severaloptimizations that yield an efficient and scalable solution. Empirical evaluations on largeastronomy and oceanography datasets confirm that our Myria approach scales well andperforms up to an order of magnitude faster than Hadoop.,Proceedings of the 3rd VLDB Workshop on In-Memory Data Mangement and Analytics,2015,5

Toward elastic memory management for cloud data analytics,Jingjing Wang; Magdalena Balazinska,1. INTRODUCTION Recently; big data analytics systems have been emerging rapidly. Thesesystems are often deployed in a cluster shared by multiple systems and users. Within each dataanalytics system; there can also be multiple analytics applications (aka; queries) runningsimultaneously. Different applications; systems; and users have different resourcerequirements. As a result; cluster- wide resource management is an important problem. Amongall types of resources; memory has become espe- cially critical in recent years. There are twomain reasons for that: (1) Modern data analytics systems; such as Spark [30]; Im- pala [15]; GraphLab[18]; Giraph [23]; and many more; strive to achieve high performance by maximally utilizingmemory. (2) Data scientists have increasingly moved to using public clouds; where they paydirectly for the resources that they need; and thus care to optimize them.

Approximation trade-offs in a Markovian stream warehouse: An empirical study,Julie Letchner; Magdalena Balazinska; Christopher Ré; Matthai Philipose,Abstract A large amount of the world's data is both sequential and low-level. Manyapplications need to query higher-level information (eg; words and sentences) that isinferred from these low-level sequences (eg; raw audio signals) using a model (eg; a hiddenMarkov model). This inference process is typically statistical; resulting in high-levelsequences that are imprecise. Once archived; these imprecise streams are difficult to queryefficiently because of their rich semantics and large volumes; forcing applications to sacrificeeither performance or accuracy. There exists little work; however; that characterizes thistrade-off space and helps applications make an appropriate choice. In this paper; we studythe effects–on both efficiency and accuracy–of various stream approximations such asignoring correlations; ignoring low-probability states; or retaining only the single most …,Information Systems,2014,4

Context-aware suggestions for structured queries,*,A suggestion system for providing suggestions of features for inclusion in a clause of astructured query. The suggestion system receives a partial query that is being created by auser. The suggestion system analyzes a query log having queries submitted by one or moreusers to identify features to suggest to the user based on a likelihood that users whosubmitted queries similar to the partial query included that feature in the query. The querysystem then presents to the user the identified features as suggestions to include in thepartial query.,*,2013,4

As data hasbecome more widely accessible through the Web; online visual analytics systems haveemerged as a popular tool for data analysis and sharing. In spite of their growing popularity;however; little is known about how these systems are being utilized. The study presented inthis paper addresses this shortcoming and shows details about the workloads of thesesystems; their users; the types of analysis they perform over single or integrated datasets;and their degree of collaboration. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first study of itskind; and presents important details about the user of online; visual analytics systems.,*,2012,4
Availability-consistency trade-offs in a fault-tolerant stream processing system,Magdalena Balazinska; Hari Balakrishnan; Samuel Madden; Mike Stonebraker,processing. In contrast to previous techniques that handlenode failures; our approach alsotolerates network failuresand network partitions. The approach is based on a principledtrade-off between consistency and availability in theface of failure; that (1) ensures that all data onan inputstream is processed within a specified time threshold; but (2) reduces the impact offailures by limiting if possible thenumber of results produced based on partially availableinputdata; and (3) corrects these results when failures heal. Our approach is well-suited forapplications such as environmentmonitoring; where high availability and Â real-timeÂresponse is preferable to perfect answers. Our approach uses replication and guaranteesthat all processingreplicas achieve state consistency; both in the absenceof failures andafter a failure heals. We achieve consistencyin the former case by defining a data …,*,2004,4
PerfEnforce: a dynamic scaling engine for analytics with performance guarantees,Jennifer Ortiz; Brendan Lee; Magdalena Balazinska; Joseph L Hellerstein,Abstract: In this paper; we present PerfEnforce; a scaling engine designed to enable cloudproviders to sell performance levels for data analytics cloud services. PerfEnforce scales acluster of virtual machines allocated to a user in a way that minimizes cost whileprobabilistically meeting the query runtime guarantees offered by a service level agreement.With PerfEnforce; we show how to scale a cluster in a way that minimally disrupts a user'squery session. We further show when to scale the cluster using one of three methods:feedback control; reinforcement learning; or perceptron learning.

Big data research: will industry solve all the problems?,Magdalena Balazinska,Abstract The need for effective tools for big data data management and analytics continuesto grow. While the ecosystem of tools is expanding many research problems remain open:they include challenges around efficient processing; flexible analytics; ease of use; andoperation as a service. Many new systems and much innovation; however; come fromindustry (or from academic projects that quickly became big players in industry). Animportant question for our community is whether industry will solve all the problems orwhether there is a place for academic research in big data and what is that place. In thispaper; we address this question by looking back at our research on the Nuage; CQMS;Myria; and Data Pricing projects; and the SciDB collaboration.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,3

Optimizing index deployment order for evolving OLAP,Hideaki Kimura; Carleton Coffrin; Alexander Rasin; Stanley B Zdonik,Abstract Many database applications deploy hundreds or thousands of indexes to speed upquery execution. Despite a plethora of prior work on index selection; designing anddeploying indexes remains a difficult task for database administrators. First; real-worldbusinesses often require online index deployment; and the traditional off-line approach toindex selection ignores intermediate workload performance during index deployment.Second; recent work on on-line index selection does not address effects of complexinteractions that manifest during index deployment. In this paper; we propose a newapproach that incorporates transitional design performance into the overall problem ofphysical database design. We call our approach Incremental Database Design. As the firststep in this direction; we study the problem of ordering index deployment. The benefits of …,Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2012,3

Capability-based access control for peer-to-peer data sharing,Roxana Geambasu; Magdalena Balazinska; Steven D Gribble; Henry M Levy,Abstract This paper describes SharedViews; a peer-to-peer data management system thatsimplifies file organization and facilitates file sharing and protection among home users onthe Internet. The key innovation of SharedViews is the integration of queries and dynamicviews from database systems with a capability-based protection model from the operatingsystems world. Users organize their files using views and share their views by exchangingcapabilities. We show that the resulting system is easy to use and provides clients withflexible protection; but without the account creation and centralized protection managementproblems inherent in current shared-data systems. We have prototyped SharedViews on asmall network of Linux-based personal computers.

Price-optimal querying with data apis,Prasang Upadhyaya; Magdalena Balazinska; Dan Suciu,Abstract Data is increasingly being purchased online in data markets and REST APIs haveemerged as a favored method to acquire such data. Typically; sellers charge buyers basedon how much data they purchase. In many scenarios; buyers need to make repeated calls tothe seller's API. The challenge is then for buyers to keep track of the data they purchase andavoid purchasing the same data twice. In this paper; we propose lightweight modifications todata APIs to achieve optimal history-aware pricing so that buyers are only charged once fordata that they have purchased and that has not been updated. The key idea behind ourapproach is the notion of refunds: buyers buy data as needed but have the ability to ask forrefunds of data that they had already purchased before. We show that our techniques canprovide significant data cost savings while reducing overheads by two orders of …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,2
Lineage for Markovian stream event queries,Julie Letchner; Magdalena Balazinska,Abstract Imprecise; sequential data; such as location sequences inferred from RFID/GPS;are often represented as Markovian (probabilistic; temporally-correlated) streams. Eventqueries; which detect instances of specific patterns in these streams; have become thestandard tool for analysis of these streams; however; many data mining applications requirericher information such as how a pattern is matched; how long the match is; or what streamelements matched specific pattern predicates. Such queries can dramatically increase thepower of applications; but they cannot be answered by existing tools. In this paper; wepresent novel techniques for processing the above queries on Markovian streams. Central toour approach are algorithms for computing and manipulating the lineage of Markovianstream event queries. We provide formal definitions and linear-time algorithms for …,Proceedings of the 10th ACM International Workshop on Data Engineering for Wireless and Mobile Access,2011,2
The case for being lazy: How to leverage lazy evaluation in MapReduce,Kristi Morton; Magdalena Balazinska; Dan Grossman; Christopher Olston,Abstract In this paper; we study the benefits and overheads of lazy MapReduce processing;where the input data is partitioned and only the smallest subset of these partitions areprocessed to meet a user's need at any time.

AURA: Enabling attribute-based spatial search in RFID rich environments,Tejas A Bapat; K Selçuk Candan; V Snehith Cherukuri; Hari Sundaram,In this paper; we introduce AURA; a novel framework for enriching the physical environmentwith information about objects and activities in order to support searches in the physicalworld. The goal is to enable individuals to use the environment in which they function as aliving (short-term) memory of their activities and of the objects with which they interact in thisenvironment. In order to act as a memory; the physical environment must be transparentlyembedded with relevant information and made accessible by in-situ search mechanisms.We achieve this embedding through innovative algorithms that leverage a collection ofparasitic RFID tags distributed in the environment to act as a distributed storage cloud.Information about the activities of the users and objects with which they interact are encodedand stored; in a decentralized way; on these RFID tags to support attribute-based search …,Data Engineering; 2009.

Event detection in mobile sensor networks,Magdalena Balazinska,Sensors are now sufficiently small and cheap that people can carry them around. Couplingthese sensors with portable communication devices that can relay data from the sensors tothe Internet opens the door to many new types of applications. One application scenario thathas been proposed [1] envisions people in a city using their cell phones to collectinformation about the city (take pictures of pot holes; etc). If users also choose to reportinformation about their location (either based on nearby cell towers or using a separate GPSdevice) to their family and friends; various tracking applications become possible. Whencombined with environmental sensors (eg; temperature; humidity; noise); cell phones canalso serve to automatically collect information about the carrier and his environment. Thereare several challenges in exploiting such mobile sensor networks. One challenge is that …,National Science Foundation (NSF) Workshop on Data Management for Mobile Sensor Networks (MobiSensors) 2007.

A study on eye movement strategies for a depth discrimination task in a" pseudo" natural context,F Labonté; M Balazinska; J Faubert,Purpose. Visual strategies used during the accomplishment of a" pseudo" natural taskinvolving depth perception from dynamic stereograms were studied by recording eyemovements. A situation typically encountered in the context of teleoperation; where thepresence of distractors may induce eye movements that bring the fixation point away fromthe image region associated with the main task; was simulated. The purpose of theexperiment was to characterize; in term of their motion parameters; the distractors that leadto fixation displacements during the accomplishment of a depth discrimination task.Methods. Subjects had to indicate whether objects in the image center were approaching orreceding. They also had the possibility to make distractors disappear as their path crossedthe central region and consequently masked the discrimination task.

Probabilistic database summarization for interactive data exploration,Laurel Orr; Magdalena Balazinska; Dan Suciu,Abstract We present a probabilistic approach to generate a small; query-able summary of adataset for interactive data exploration. Departing from traditional summarization techniques;we use the Principle of Maximum Entropy to generate a probabilistic representation of thedata that can be used to give approximate query answers. We develop the theoreticalframework and formulation of our probabilistic representation and show how to use it toanswer queries. We then present solving techniques and give three critical optimizations toimprove preprocessing time and query accuracy. Lastly; we experimentally evaluate ourwork using a 5 GB dataset of flights within the United States and a 210 GB dataset from anastronomy particle simulation.

Towards efficient and precise queries over ten million asteroid trajectory models,Yusra AlSayyad; K Simon Krughoff; Bill Howe; Andrew J Connolly; Magdalena Balazinska; Lynne Jones,Abstract The new generation of telescopes under construction return to the same area of thesky with sufficient frequency to enable tracking of moving objects such as asteroids; near-earth objects; and comets [4; 5]. To detect these moving objects; one image may besubtracted from another (separated by several days or weeks) to differentiate variable andmoving sources from the dense background of stars and galaxies. Moving sources may thenbe identified by querying against a database of expected positions of known asteroids. At ahigh-level; this task maps onto executing the query:“Return all known asteroids that areexpected to be located within a given region at a given time.” We consider the problem ofquerying for asteroids in a specified interval in space and time; specifically as applied topopulating the simulations of the data flow from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope …,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2011,1
Sensor Data Stream Exploration for Monitoring Applications,Shengliang Xu; Magdalena Balazinska,ABSTRACT This paper presents StreamXPlore; a system that enables users to explorehistorical stream data in order to determine what events to monitor in the future. At the heartof StreamXPlore is a new event modeling mechanism. StreamXPlore enables thespecification; analysis; and mining of these new types of events. Event analysis enablesevent refinement using data-cube-style slice; dice; drilldown; and roll-up operations. Eventdata mining consists of event clustering for pattern identification. Preliminary experiments ona real stream of hydro-sensor data show that the proposed exploration mechanisms canindeed be helpful in identifying interesting patterns and are sufficiently fast for exploration ofgigabyte-size stream repositories.,*,2011,1
SQB: Session-based Query Browsing for More Effective Query Reuse,Nodira Khoussainova; Y Kwon; Wei-Ting Liao; Magdalena Balazinska; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Dan Suciu,Abstract. Scientists are generating more data than ever before and are increasingly puttingthat data (or corresponding metadata) inside a relational database accessible through SQL.Composing non-trivial SQL queries; however; is difficult. Just like code reuse; query reusecan facilitate and accelerate the task of composing new queries. A key challenge is how bestto facilitate this reuse. In this paper; we introduce Smart Query Browser (SQB); a tool forsearching and browsing through a repository of SQL queries. SQB applies the idea of aquery session to improve query browsing and reuse. Informally; a query session is a set ofqueries authored by a single user to achieve a specific information goal. To evaluate SQB;we conduct a user study with 16 users and find that SQB reduces the query composition timeby 57% compared with a traditional; unassisted query composition setting.,*,2011,1
A latency and fault-tolerance optimizer for parallel data processing systems,Prasang Upadhyaya; Y Kwon; Magdalena Balazinska,Abstract—An important problem faced by today's parallel data processing systems is fault-tolerance: how to handle failures during the execution of long-running queries. Existingsystems either restart queries when failures occur or materialize intermediate results in ablocking fashion. The problem is that the former leads to expensive recovery while the latterslows-down normal processing and prevents pipelining. In this paper; we address the aboveproblem of intra-query fault-tolerance in parallel data processing systems. Our keyhypothesis is that a parallel system can achieve best performance by supporting efficientfault-tolerance strategies that do not require blocking but also by supporting the use ofdifferent strategies at different operators within a single query plan. Enabling each operatorto use a different fault tolerance strategy leads to a space of possible fault tolerance plans …,Univ. of Washington; Tech. Rep,2010,1
Believe it or not,Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Magdalena Balazinska; Nodira Khoussainova; Dan Suciu,Abstract We propose a database model that allows users to annotate data with beliefstatements. Our motivation comes from scientic database applications where a community ofusers is working together to assemble; revise; and curate a shared data repository. As thecommunity accumulates knowledge and the database content evolves over time; it maycontain conflicting information and members can disagree on the information it should store.For example; Alice may believe that a tuple should be in the database; whereas Bobdisagrees. He may also insert the reason why he thinks Alice believes the tuple should be inthe database; and explain what he thinks the correct tuple should be instead. We propose aformal model for Belief Databases that interprets users' annotations as belief statements.These annotations can refer both to the base data and to other annotations. We give a …,*,2009,1

Specification; Detection; and Notification of RFID Events with Cascadia,Evan Welbourne; Garret Cole; Nodira Khoussainova; Julie Letchner; Yang Li; Magdalena Balazinska; Gaetano Borriello; Dan Suciu,The Cascadia system [5] greatly simplifies the development of pervasive RFID applicationsin spite of the inherent uncertainty in RFID data. It provides applications with aninfrastructure for specifying; extracting and managing meaningful high-level events from rawRFID data. Cascadia allows end users to specify events using a web-based tool with anintuitive visual language based on direct manipulation. It also extracts specified events fromthe data in spite of the unreliability of RFID technology and the inherent ambiguity in eventextraction. We demonstrate Cascadia's workings with a map-based interface that displaysstreams of RFID events and with a digital diary application that automatically populates acalendar with events in which the user participated.

Cuttlefish: A Lightweight Primitive for Adaptive Query Processing,Tomer Kaftan; Magdalena Balazinska; Alvin Cheung; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract: Modern data processing applications execute increasingly sophisticated analysisthat requires operations beyond traditional relational algebra. As a result; operators in queryplans grow in diversity and complexity. Designing query optimizer rules and cost models tochoose physical operators for all of these novel logical operators is impractical. To addressthis challenge; we develop Cuttlefish; a new primitive for adaptively processing online queryplans that explores candidate physical operator instances during query execution andexploits the fastest ones using multi-armed bandit reinforcement learning techniques.

Thisproduces repeatable measurements; but remains subjective and does not offer informationon the precision of the measured parameters or strict reproducibility of analyzed data. Wedeveloped a processing tool chain; which first segments the diffraction image into regions ofinterest using highly conserved features and then samples the possible parameter valueswith a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. Our approach produces an automated;reproducible; objective estimate of relevant image parameters.,*,2015,*

RFID Event Specification Using Templates in Scenic and Event Notification,Kayla Gould; Evan Welbourne; Magdalena Balazinska,ABSTRACT Scenic is a program that allows the user to graphically specify an event to bedetected by the RFID Ecosystem in the Paul G. Allen Center at the University of Washington.The user drags icons representing people; places; items and “event primitives”[5]. In thispaper we discuss how Scenic has been extended to (1) save and recall an eventdefinition;(2) edit previously created events; and (3) create event templates. Notifier is a newprogram we created that allows the user to subscribe to notification for an event that theyhave created using Scenic. The user enters contact information such as an email or a phonenumber and specifies which method to use to be notified when the event occurs. The systemmonitors the readings from the RFID Ecosystem and when it has detected that the event hasoccurred; it sends out a notification via the specified medium.,*,2008,*
Message from the RFDM’08 general co-chairs,Magdalena Balazinska; Karin Murthy,Recent technology advances in automated identification (Auto ID) have caused a spike inthe number of new traceability applications in the enterprise and beyond. In particular; RadioFrequency Identification (RFID) is becoming increasingly popular as a means forinexpensive tagging and wireless identification. RFID deployments are now commonly usedin supply-chain management; asset tracking; and other enterprise applications.

11th Annual USENIX Security Symposium &# 151; Technical Paper,Nick Feamster; Magdalena Balazinska; Greg Harfst; Hari Balakrishnan; David Karger,Abstract An increasing number of countries and companies routinely block or monitoraccess to parts of the Internet. To counteract these measures; we propose Infranet; a systemthat enables clients to surreptitiously retrieve sensitive content via cooperating Web serversdistributed across the global Internet. These Infranet servers provide clients access tocensored sites while continuing to host normal uncensored content. Infranet uses a tunnelprotocol that provides a covert communication channel between its clients and servers;modulated over standard HTTP transactions that resemble innocuous Web browsing. In theupstream direction; Infranet clients send covert messages to Infranet servers by associatingmeaning to the sequence of HTTP requests being made. In the downstream direction;Infranet servers return content by hiding censored data in uncensored images using …,*,*,*

To paraphrase Mike Stonebraker; machine learning is no longer a zero-billion-dollar business. As the home of high-value; data-driven applications for over four decades; anatural question for database researchers to ask is: what role should the databasecommunity play in these new datadriven machine-learning-based applications? The last fewyears have seen increasing crossover between database research and machine learning.But is this crossover a wise choice for database research? What are the opportunities andthe costs of this approach to industry; to the future of database research; and to academics?Do database researchers have something to contribute to this trend?

Toward Supporting the Data Enthusiast: Unlocking the Potential of Data for Analysis,Kristi Morton; Magdalena Balazinska; Dan Grossman; Jock Mackinlay,ABSTRACT We present a vision for the next-generation of visual analytics services. Weargue that these services should provide three related capabilities:(1) support visual andinteractive data exploration as they do today; but also (2) suggest relevant data to enrichvisualizations; and (3) facilitate the integration and cleaning of that data. Most importantly;they should provide all these capabilities seamlessly in the context of an uninterrupted dataanalysis cycle. We present the challenges and opportunities in building such next-generation visual analytics services.,*,*,*

Toward A Progress Indicator for Parallel Queries,Kristi Morton; Abe Friesen; Magdalena Balazinska; Dan Grossman,Abstract—In parallel query-processing environments; accurate; time-oriented progressindicators could provide much utility to users given that queries take a very long time tocomplete and both inter-and intra-query execution times can have high variance. In thesesystems; query times depend on the query plans and the amount of data being processed;but also on the amount of parallelism available; the types of operators (often user-defined)that perform the processing; and the overall system load. None of the techniques used byexisting tools or available in the literature provide a non-trivial progress indicator for parallelqueries. In this paper; we introduce Parallax; the first such indicator. Several parallel dataprocessing systems exist. In this paper; we target environments where queries consist of aseries of MapReduce jobs. Parallax builds on recently-developed techniques for …,*,*,*

UW TR:# TR08-07-01,Julie Letchner; Christopher Ré; Magdalena Balazinska; Matthai Philipose,Abstract Model-based views have recently been proposed as an effective method forquerying noisy sensor data. Commonly used models from the AI literature (eg; the HiddenMarkov Model) expose to applications a stream of probabilistic and correlated stateestimates computed from the sensor data. Many applications want to detect sophisticatedpatterns of states from these Markovian streams. Such queries are called event queries. Inthis paper; we present a new system; Caldera; for processing event queries over storedMarkovian streams. At the heart of our system is a set of access methods for Markovianstreams that can improve event query performance by orders of magnitude compared toexisting techniques; which must scan the entire stream. These access methods use newadaptations of traditional B+ tree indexes; and a new index; called the Markov-chain …,*,*,*
Looking Inside the Virtualization Layer for Performance; Security and Software Fault Tolerance………………………………… 3,Andreas Polze; Danilo Montesi; Harold Castro; Werner Kurschl; Alexander Schmidt; Kurt Vanmechelen; Juan G Lalinde-Pulido; Christian Schalk; Armando Fox; Ken Birman; Jan Rellermeyer; Rosa M Badia; Yogesh Simmhan,The ability to analyze massive-scale datasets has become a critical requirement forbusinesses and scientists today. Cloud-computing platforms can facilitate this task byoffering powerful parallel data processing systems such as Dryad or MapReduce as aservice with the option to scale these systems in an elastic fashion depending on a user'sdata analysis needs. MapReduce-type parallel processing systems; however; provide onlybatch processing; where a user must wait for an entire query to complete before seeing ananswer. This strategy complicates exploratory data analytics; where a user wants to ask avariety of ad-hoc queries. One challenge associated with more interactive types of dataanalysis; as possible in Dryad; is fault-tolerance: if a set of interconnected operators executein a pipelined fashion and one crashes; the whole set may need to be restarted.

The Science of Cloud Computing–PI Meeting Application,Magdalena Balazinska,2 Current Research Activities Data Intensive Scalable Computing In our Nuage project [21];we are looking at challenges related to efficiently analyzing massive scale datasets usingparallel data processing engines (parallel relational database management systems orMapReduce [10] type systems) running on either private or public clouds. In collaborationwith domain scientists on campus; we have ported several real scientific analysis tasks ontorelational databases (single-node and parallel) and Hadoop [12]. We found that porting theanalysis logic to these engines was only half the problem. Extracting high-performance fromthese engines was the bigger challenge [15; 17; 27]. Based on our experience above; wehave developed several extensions to MapReduce. Our goal is to help users more easily gethigh-performance from parallel data processing systems without having to rely on experts …,*,*,*
Creating a Desktop Search Application That Utilizes RFID Ecosystem© and Google Desktop©,Kyle Rector; Evan Welbourne; Magdalena Balazinska,The amount of emails and computer files that we deal with daily are increasing. The amountof information stored on one's computer can be overwhelming; and parsing through thisinformation can be very difficult. This is also true for the Internet; but search engines havemade surfing the net much more feasible. On the computer; there are filing systems to helporganize various files and emails. This becomes less helpful if someone has misfiledsomething or if they have forgotten the location of a file. In the event that something ismisfiled; one can use a desktop search in order to find the file. However; one has toremember the name or content of the file in order to do so. If a file was made a long time ago;this process could be very challenging. The goal of this project is to be able to use othermethods of finding files including using the events involved with developing the file as …,*,*,*
Improving Query Processing on Imprecise Data Streams,Eugenia Gabrielova; Julie Letchner; Magdalena Balazinska,ABSTRACT Many applications; such as monitored health care and theft detection; dependon higher-level data inferred from lowlevel location sensors such as RFID and GPS. Thishigh level data occurs in the form of imprecise; correlated sequences; which are modeled byMarkovian streams. Such data is too difficult to manage with traditional databases. Lahar is asystem that warehouses and processes queries on such streams; returning a set of queryanswers annotated with probabilities. Some queries return many partial results; whichwastes computing resources. Processing streams and queries in a reversed direction mayresult in fewer partial matches.,*,*,*
