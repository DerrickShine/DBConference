Processing XML streams with deterministic automata,Todd J Green; Gerome Miklau; Makoto Onizuka; Dan Suciu,Abstract We consider the problem of evaluating a large number of XPath expressions on anXML stream. Our main contribution consists in showing that Deterministic Finite Automata(DFA) can be used effectively for this problem: in our experiments we achieve a throughputof about 5.4 MB/s; independent of the number of XPath expressions (up to 1;000;000 in ourtests). The major problem we face is that of the size of the DFA. Since the number of statesgrows exponentially with the number of XPath expressions; it was previously believed thatDFAs cannot be used to process large sets of expressions. We make a theoretical analysisof the number of states in the DFA resulting from XPath expressions; and consider both thecase when it is constructed eagerly; and when it is constructed lazily. Our analysis indicatesthat; when the automaton is constructed lazily; and under certain assumptions about the …,International Conference on Database Theory,2003,313
Processing XML streams with deterministic automata and stream indexes,Todd J Green; Ashish Gupta; Gerome Miklau; Makoto Onizuka; Dan Suciu,Abstract We consider the problem of evaluating a large number of XPath expressions on astream of XML packets. We contribute two novel techniques. The first is to use a singleDeterministic Finite Automaton (DFA). The contribution here is to show that the DFA can beused effectively for this problem: in our experiments we achieve a constant throughput;independently of the number of XPath expressions. The major issue is the size of the DFA;which; in theory; can be exponential in the number of XPath expressions. We provide aseries of theoretical results and experimental evaluations that show that the lazy DFA has asmall number of states; for all practical purposes. These results are of general interest inXPath processing; beyond stream processing. The second technique is the Streaming IndeX(SIX); which consists of adding a small amount of binary data to each XML packet that …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2004,262

Fast and exact top-k search for random walk with restart,Yasuhiro Fujiwara; Makoto Nakatsuji; Makoto Onizuka; Masaru Kitsuregawa,Abstract Graphs are fundamental data structures and have been employed for centuries tomodel real-world systems and phenomena. Random walk with restart (RWR) provides agood proximity score between two nodes in a graph; and it has been successfully used inmany applications such as automatic image captioning; recommender systems; and linkprediction. The goal of this work is to find nodes that have top-k highest proximities for agiven node. Previous approaches to this problem find nodes efficiently at the expense ofexactness. The main motivation of this paper is to answer; in the affirmative; the question;'Is itpossible to improve the search time without sacrificing the exactness?'.

Fast algorithm for modularity-based graph clustering.,Hiroaki Shiokawa; Yasuhiro Fujiwara; Makoto Onizuka,Abstract In AI and Web communities; modularity-based graph clustering algorithms arebeing applied to various applications. However; existing algorithms are not applied to largegraphs because they have to scan all vertices/edges iteratively. The goal of this paper is toefficiently compute clusters with high modularity from extremely large graphs with more thana few billion edges. The heart of our solution is to compute clusters by incrementally pruningunnecessary vertices/edges and optimizing the order of vertex selections. Our experimentsshow that our proposal outperforms all other modularity-based algorithms in terms ofcomputation time; and it finds clusters with high modularity.,AAAI,2013,53
Light-weight XPath processing of XML stream with deterministic automata,Makoto Onizuka,Abstract Several applications based on XML stream processing have recently emerged;such as those for air traffic control and the selective dissemination of information (SDI). Theircommon need is to process a large number of XPath expressions in continuous XMLstreams at high throughput. This paper proposes four techniques for XPath expressionprocessing based on Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) for two purposes: to improve thememory usage efficiency of the automata and to support the processing of branching XPathexpressions. The first technique; called n-DFA; clusters the given XPath expressions into nclusters to reduce the number of DFA states. The second; called shared NFA state table; letsthe Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) state set be shared among the DFA states. Ourexperiments show that memory usage in an 8-DFA can; with the shared NFA state table …,Proceedings of the twelfth international conference on Information and knowledge management,2003,49
Efficient personalized pagerank with accuracy assurance,Yasuhiro Fujiwara; Makoto Nakatsuji; Takeshi Yamamuro; Hiroaki Shiokawa; Makoto Onizuka,Abstract Personalize PageRank (PPR) is an effective relevance (proximity) measure ingraph mining. The goal of this paper is to efficiently compute single node relevance and top-k/highly relevant nodes without iteratively computing the relevances of all nodes. Based ona" random surfer model"; PPR iteratively computes the relevances of all nodes in a graphuntil convergence for a given user preference distribution. The problem with this iterativeapproach is that it cannot compute the relevance of just one or a few nodes. The heart of oursolution is to compute single node relevance accurately in non-iterative manner based onsparse matrix representation; and to compute top-k/highly relevant nodes exactly by pruningunnecessary relevance computations based on upper/lower relevance estimations.

Incremental maintenance for materialized XPath/XSLT views,Makoto Onizuka; Fong Yee Chan; Ryusuke Michigami; Takashi Honishi,Abstract This paper proposes an incremental maintenance algorithm that efficiently updatesthe materialized XPath/XSLT views defined using XPath expressions in XP ([];*;//; vars). Thealgorithm consists of two processes. 1) The dynamic execution flow of an XSLT program isstored as an XT (XML Transformation) tree during the full transformation. 2) In response to asource XML data update; the impacted portions of the XT-tree are identified and maintainedby partially re-evaluating the XSLT program. This paper discusses the XPath/XSLT featuresof incremental view maintenance for subtree insertion/deletion and applies them to themaintenance algorithm. Experiments show that the incremental maintenance algorithmoutperforms full XML transformation algorithms by factors of up to 500.,Proceedings of the 14th international conference on World Wide Web,2005,36
Efficient search algorithm for SimRank,Yasuhiro Fujiwara; Makoto Nakatsuji; Hiroaki Shiokawa; Makoto Onizuka,Graphs are a fundamental data structure and have been employed to model objects as wellas their relationships. The similarity of objects on the web (eg; webpages; photos; music;micro-blogs; and social networking service users) is the key to identifying relevant objects inmany recent applications. SimRank; proposed by Jeh and Widom; provides a good similarityscore and has been successfully used in many applications such as web spam detection;collaborative tagging analysis; link prediction; and so on. SimRank computes similaritiesiteratively; and it needs O (N 4 T) time and O (N 2) space for similarity computation where Nand T are the number of nodes and iterations; respectively. Unfortunately; this iterativeapproach is computationally expensive. The goal of this work is to process top-k search andrange search efficiently for a given node.

SCAN++: efficient algorithm for finding clusters; hubs and outliers on large-scale graphs,Hiroaki Shiokawa; Yasuhiro Fujiwara; Makoto Onizuka,Abstract Graph clustering is one of the key techniques for understanding the structurespresent in graphs. Besides cluster detection; identifying hubs and outliers is also a key task;since they have important roles to play in graph data mining. The structural clusteringalgorithm SCAN; proposed by Xu et al.; is successfully used in many application because itnot only detects densely connected nodes as clusters but also identifies sparsely connectednodes as hubs or outliers. However; it is difficult to apply SCAN to large-scale graphs due toits high time complexity. This is because it evaluates the density for all adjacent nodesincluded in the given graphs. In this paper; we propose a novel graph clustering algorithmnamed SCAN++. In order to reduce time complexity; we introduce new data structure ofdirectly two-hop-away reachable node set (DTAR).

Efficient ad-hoc search for personalized pagerank,Yasuhiro Fujiwara; Makoto Nakatsuji; Hiroaki Shiokawa; Takeshi Mishima; Makoto Onizuka,Abstract Personalized PageRank (PPR) has been successfully applied to variousapplications. In real applications; it is important to set PPR parameters in an ad-hoc mannerwhen finding similar nodes because of dynamically changing nature of graphs. Throughinteractive actions; interactive similarity search supports users to enhance the efficacy ofapplications. Unfortunately; if the graph is large; interactive similarity search is infeasible dueto its high computation cost. Previous PPR approaches cannot effectively handle interactivesimilarity search since they need precomputation or approximate computation of similarities.The goal of this paper is to efficiently find the top-k nodes with exact node ranking so as toeffectively support interactive similarity search based on PPR.

Processing XPath queries with forward and downward axes over XML streams,Makoto Onizuka,Abstract We propose an XPath processing algorithm that efficiently evaluates XPath queriesin XP {↓;→;*;[]} over XML streams. An XPath query is expressed with axes; which are binaryrelations between nodes in XML streams:'↓'identifies the child/descendant axesand'→'indicates the following/following-sibling axes. The proposed algorithm evaluatesXPath queries within one XML parsing pass and outputs the fragments found in XMLstreams as the query results. The difficulty of XP {↓;→;*;[]} evaluation lies in establishingdynamic scope control for the following/following-sibling axes. The algorithm uses double-layered non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) to resolve this issue. First layer NFA iscompiled from XPath queries and is able to evaluate sub-queries in XP {↓;→;*}. Secondlayer NFA handles predicate parts. It is dynamically maintained during XML parsing: a …,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2010,18
Fast and Exact Top-k Algorithm for PageRank.,Yasuhiro Fujiwara; Makoto Nakatsuji; Hiroaki Shiokawa; Takeshi Mishima; Makoto Onizuka,Abstract In AI and Web communities; many applications utilize PageRank. To obtain highPageRank score nodes; the original approach iteratively computes the PageRank score ofeach node until convergence by using the whole graph. If the graph is large; this approach isinfeasible due to its high computational cost. The goal of this study is to find top-k PageRankscore nodes efficiently for a given graph without sacrificing accuracy. Our solution; F-Rank;is based on two ideas:(1) It iteratively estimates lower/upper bounds of PageRank scores;and (2) It constructs subgraphs in each iteration by pruning unnecessary nodes and edgesto identify top-k nodes. Our theoretical analysis shows that F-Rank guarantees resultexactness. Experiments show that F-Rank finds top-k nodes much faster than the originalapproach.,AAAI,2013,15

Optimization for iterative queries on MapReduce,Makoto Onizuka; Hiroyuki Kato; Soichiro Hidaka; Keisuke Nakano; Zhenjiang Hu,Abstract We propose OptIQ; a query optimization approach for iterative queries in distributedenvironment. OptIQ removes redundant computations among different iterations byextending the traditional techniques of view materialization and incremental view evaluation.First; OptIQ decomposes iterative queries into invariant and variant views; and materializesthe former view. Redundant computations are removed by reusing the materialized viewamong iterations. Second; OptIQ incrementally evaluates the variant view; so that redundantcomputations are removed by skipping the evaluation on converged tuples in the variantview. We verify the effectiveness of OptIQ through the queries of PageRank and k-meansclustering on real datasets. The results show that OptIQ achieves high efficiency; up to fivetimes faster than is possible without removing the redundant computations among …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,14
Distributed XML stream filtering system with high scalability,Hiroyuki Uchiyama; Makoto Onizuka; Takashi Honishi,We propose a distributed XML stream filtering system that uses a large number ofsubscribers' profiles; written in XPath expressions; to filter XML streams and then publish thefiltered data in real-time. To realize the proposed system; we define XPath expressionfeatures on XML data and utilize them to forecast the servers' loads. Our method is realizedby combining methods to share the total transfer loads of each filtering server and toequalize the sum of overlap size between filtering servers. Experiments show that the rate atwhich the publishing time increases with the number of XPath expressions is three timessmaller in the proposed system than in the round-robin method. Furthermore; the overheadof the proposed method is quite low.,Data Engineering; 2005. ICDE 2005. Proceedings. 21st International Conference on,2005,14
Content-based retrieval applications on a common database management system,Naoko Kosugi; Go Nishimura; Junji Teramoto; Kazuyoshi Mii; Makoto Onizuka; Seiichi Kon'ya; Akira Kojima; Ryoji Kataoka; Takashi Honishi; Kazuhiko Kushima,1 Introduction The use of multimedia data is widespread among general PC users. Thus; it isimportant to construct large multime- dia databases and to develop easy-to-use and fast retrievalsystems for such databases. General retrieval systems accept only key words as queries.However; formulating a query in words is often difficult in the case of multimedia dataretrieval. Thus; content-based retrieval is attracting increasing interest as a solution to thisproblem[lO]. To address this need; we have been developing a media- independent databasemanagement system (DBMS) as well as media-dependent data processing techniques. Thisen- ables us to provide various types of practical multimedia re- trieval applications in a timelyfashion by developing content- based retrieval systems for various types of media and their extensionsbased on the common DBMS framework.

Rabbit order: Just-in-time parallel reordering for fast graph analysis,Junya Arai; Hiroaki Shiokawa; Takeshi Yamamuro; Makoto Onizuka; Sotetsu Iwamura,Ahead-of-time data layout optimization by vertex reordering is a widely used technique toimprove memory access locality in graph analysis. While reordered graphs yield betteranalysis performance; the existing reordering algorithms use significant amounts ofcomputation time to provide efficient vertex ordering; hence; they fail to reduce end-to-endprocessing time. This paper presents a first algorithm for just-in-time parallel reordering;named Rabbit Order. It reduces end-to-end runtime by achieving high locality and fastreordering at the same time through two approaches. The first approach is hierarchicalcommunity-based ordering; which exploits the locality derived from hierarchical communitystructures in real-world graphs. Our ordering fully leverages low-latency cache levels bymapping hierarchical communities into hierarchical caches.

VAST-Tree: A vector-advanced and compressed structure for massive data tree traversal,Takeshi Yamamuro; Makoto Onizuka; Toshio Hitaka; Masashi Yamamuro,Abstract We propose a compact and efficient index structure for massive data sets. Severalindexing techniques are widely-used and well-known such as binary trees and B+ trees.Unfortunately; we find that these techniques suffer major two shortcomings when applied tomassive sets; first; their indices are so large they could overflow regular main memory; and;second; they suffer from a variety of penalties (eg; conditional branches; low cache hits; andTLB misses); which restricts the number of instructions executed per processor cycle. Ourstate-of-the-art index structure; called VAST-Tree; classifies branch nodes into multiplelayers. It applies existing techniques such as cache-conscious; aligned; and branch-freestructures to the top layers of branch nodes in trees. Next; it applies the adaptivecompression technique to save space and harness data parallelism with SIMD …,Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2012,7
Scaling manifold ranking based image retrieval,Yasuhiro Fujiwara; Go Irie; Shari Kuroyama; Makoto Onizuka,Abstract Manifold Ranking is a graph-based ranking algorithm being successfully applied toretrieve images from multimedia databases. Given a query image; Manifold Rankingcomputes the ranking scores of images in the database by exploiting the relationshipsamong them expressed in the form of a graph. Since Manifold Ranking effectively utilizes theglobal structure of the graph; it is significantly better at finding intuitive results compared withcurrent approaches. Fundamentally; Manifold Ranking requires an inverse matrix tocompute ranking scores and so needs O (n 3) time; where n is the number of images.Manifold Ranking; unfortunately; does not scale to support databases with large numbers ofimages. Our solution; Mogul; is based on two ideas:(1) It efficiently computes ranking scoresby sparse matrices; and (2) It skips unnecessary score computations by estimating upper …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,6

Real-time diameter monitoring for time-evolving graphs,Yasuhiro Fujiwara; Makoto Onizuka; Masaru Kitsuregawa,Abstract The goal of this work is to identify the diameter; the maximum distance between anytwo nodes; of graphs that evolve over time. This problem is useful for many applicationssuch as improving the quality of P2P networks. Our solution; G-Scale; can track the diameterof time-evolving graphs in the most efficient and correct manner. G-Scale is based on twoideas:(1) It estimates the maximal distances at any time to filter unlikely nodes that cannot beassociated with the diameter; and (2) It maintains answer node pairs by exploiting thedistances from a newly added node to other nodes. Our theoretical analyses show that G-Scale guarantees exactness in identifying the diameter. We perform several experiments onreal and large datasets. The results show that G-Scale can detect the diameter significantlyfaster than existing approaches.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2011,4
Lazy view maintenance for social networking applications,Keita Mikami; Shinji Morishita; Makoto Onizuka,Abstract We introduce CAMEL; a lazy view maintenance system for social networkingapplications on a database server with a distributed memory cache. System administratorscan control the throughput of the system by tuning the level of freshness of materializedviews. CAMEL employs the existing view maintenance techniques of incrementalmaintenance; lazy maintenance; and control table. In addition; CAMEL optimizes viewmaintenance performance by pushing the top-k operation down to before join operationsand by constructing a reverse index. We evaluate CAMEL using real data from a mini-blogservice. The results show that CAMEL is 6.13 and 11.2 times faster than the method of eagerview maintenance while keeping the freshness of materialized views at 66.2% and 38.0%;respectively.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,4
XTL: An XML Transformation Language and XSLT generator for XTL.,Makoto Onizuka,Abstract This paper describes a new query and transformation language XTL (An XMLtransformation language). XTL is based on both output driven and schema driven approach:1) To specify an output structure of transformation using XML schema language (so far wechoose DTD); 2) To map from well-formed input XML documents to an output structure usingXPath that is embedded in DTD. XTL has a simple syntax; as it is declarative and it has fewextensions. Users only have to understand DTD and XPath specifications with fewextensions and rules of XTL. XTL is powerful because it has efficient operations forextraction and transformation for XML data. This paper also describes XTL processor totranslate XTL expression to XSLT expression. This generator is useful for XSLT users whowould like to transform XML; because XTL is much simpler than XSLT. They can use this …,MARKUP LANGUAGES THEORY AND PRACTICE,2001,4
Efficient centrality monitoring for time-evolving graphs,Yasuhiro Fujiwara; Makoto Onizuka; Masaru Kitsuregawa,Abstract The goal of this work is to identify the nodes that have the smallest sum of distancesto other nodes (the lowest closeness centrality nodes) in graphs that evolve over time.Previous approaches to this problem find the lowest centrality nodes efficiently at theexpense of exactness. The main motivation of this paper is to answer; in the affirmative; thequestion;'Is it possible to improve the search time without sacrificing the exactness?'. Oursolution is Sniper; a fast search method for time-evolving graphs. Sniper is based on twoideas:(1) It computes approximate centrality by reducing the original graph size whileguaranteeing the answer exactness; and (2) It terminates unnecessary distancecomputations early when pruning unlikely nodes.

XML-based e-barter system for circular supply exchange,Shuichi Nishioka; Yuri Yaguchi; Takahiro Hamada; Makoto Onizuka; Masashi Yamamuro,Abstract A key function for any barter service is to detect circular exchanges in which alldemands and supplies of a circle of users are satisfied. We call the demand and supply of auser his queries and data; respectively. The problem of finding a circular exchange is todetect directed cycles in an exchange graph where an edge connects one user's supply toanother user's supply that satisfies the first user's demand. Our contributions to solving thisproblem are two-fold; 1) a process model of constructing an exchange graph; and 2) twocycle detection algorithms that can find all possible directed cycles.

Fast ad-hoc search algorithm for personalized pagerank,Yasuhiro Fujiwara; Makoto Nakatsuji; Hiroaki Shiokawa; Takeshi Mishima; Makoto Onizuka,Personalized PageRank (PPR) is a typical similarity metric between nodes in a graph; andnode searches based on PPR are widely used. In many applications; graphs changedynamically; and in such cases; it is desirable to perform ad hoc searches based on PPR.An ad hoc search involves performing searches by varying the search parameters or graphs.However; as the size of a graph increases; the computation cost of performing an ad hocsearch can become excessive. In this paper; we propose a method called Castanet thatoffers fast ad hoc searches of PPR. The proposed method features (1) iterative estimation ofthe upper and lower bounds of PPR scores; and (2) dynamic pruning of nodes that are notneeded to obtain a search result. Experiments confirm that the proposed method does offerfaster ad hoc PPR searches than existing methods.,IEICE TRANSACTIONS on Information and Systems,2017,1

The distributed graph engines executeanalysis process after partitioning input graph data and assign them to distributedcomputers; so the quality of graph partitioning largely affects the communication cost andload balance among computers during the analysis process. We propose an effective graphpartitioning technique that achieves low communication cost and good load balance amongcomputers at the same time. We first generate more clusters than the number of computersby extending the modularity-based clustering; and then merge those clusters into balanced-size clusters until the number of clusters becomes the number of computers by usingtechniques designed for graph packing problem.

The system collects a lot of dementia care information fromcaregivers and; in the future; it will extract good dementia care methods from the informationby using the text mining technology. The web system was released for about 40 users inJuly; 2015 to validate the system functions and to get feedbacks for the system. The systemwas well received by the users. We also found that the caregivers spend about 20 minuteson average for inputting care information in a single session. In addition; the number of inputdata of the choice was almost double of those of the blank input. We will improve the websystem based on these results and the feedbacks from the users in the future.,Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Information Integration and Web-based Applications & Services,2015,1

Grouping method of dementia care text information to share dementiacare information in a website named Ninchisho Chienowa-net,Hisae Nakajima; Naoko Kosugi; Makoto Onizuka; Hiroaki Kazui; Manabu Ikeda,Abstract This paper proposes a grouping technique of sentences that contain dementia careinformation and describes analytical results of statistical information which influences thegrouping. This paper focuses on the grouping of the" incidents" in sentences. One of theproblems to group the incidents is that the sentences input by caregivers are redundant. Inother words; the sentences contain care information which were related to the incidents; butwere unnecessary for the grouping. In order to extract the incident information from thesentences; we divide them into sub-sentences for every verbs and auxiliary verbs.Similarities among sub-sentences are used for the grouping and the accuracy is evaluatedwith the precision. As a result; we found that a sub-sentence containing seven words is goodfor the grouping.,Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Information Integration and Web-based Applications and Services,2016,*
Tree Contraction for Compressed Suffix Arrays on Modern Processors,Takeshi Yamamuro; Makoto Onizuka; Toshimori Honjo,Abstract We propose a novel processor-aware compaction technique for pattern matchingthat is widely-used in databases; information retrieval; and text mining. As the amount ofdata increases; it is getting important to efficiently store data on memory. A compressedsuffix array (CSA) is a compact data structure for in-memory pattern matching. However;CSA suffers from tremendous processor penalties; such as a flood of instructions andcache/TLB misses due to the lack of processor-aware design. To mitigate these penalties;we propose a novel compaction technique for CSA; called suffix trie contraction (STC). Thefrequently accessed suffixes of CSA are transformed to a trie (eg; a suffix trie); and then inter-connected nodes in the trie are repeatedly'contracted'to a single node; which enableslightweight sequential scans in a processor-friendly way. In detail; STC consists of two …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2015,*

Hierarchical Space Model for Multimedia Data Retrieval,Makoto Onizuka; Shuichi Nishioka,Abstract Database management systems for multimedia data retrieval are becoming moreimportant; as digital videos and cameras increase in popularity. An important feature ofmultimedia data retrieval is that users rarely specify their first queries exactly; and mustclarify what they want by browsing the query results; refining their query by trial and error. Itis therefore desirable for a multimedia database management system (DBMS) to develop arough query result quickly and refine it over time. This paper describes a hierarchical spacemodel for the multimedia data retrieval that is similar to that of the human memory hierarchy.The aim of the hierarchical space model is to improve the similarity retrieval's performancewith little loss in query result quality. We implemented the hierarchical space model on theORDBMS LiteObject and applied it to an image retrieval application. The results of this …,*,2000,*
Object management for a visual data analysis tool,Makoto Onizuka; Seiji Isobe; Kyotaro Horiguchi,Abstract This paper reports the advantages and disadvantages in applying an ODBMS(Object-oriented database management system) and an ORDBMS (Object relationaldatabase management system) to INFOVISER's object management scheme; a visual dataanalysis tool that we have been researching and developing. This paper also surveys aDBMS called LiteObject; which solves the main problems found in existing DBMSs; such asthe complexity of implementing a versioning procedure and performance problems inloading a large number of instances. LiteObject offers version management based onconstraints that exclude check in/out procedures from the application source code whichdecreases the degree of complexity. In addition; LiteObject offers a bulk loading interface toapplications and manages several instances in one container. This reduces the amount …,Theory and Practice of Object Systems,1999,*
動的制約分析による OODB 設計法,鬼塚真， 山室雅司,This paper presents a methodology to design object-oriented databases (OOlDB) to dealwith constraints to be satisfied before and after some processes on the data depending onthe states of data. It handles instance evolution as well. The methodology comprisesanalysis of constraints to be considered and implementation of the constraints using C++base OODBMS. Since it takes into account both analysis and implementation; the gap whichis usually seen in OODB design between analy-sis and implementation proves to be fairlyfilled by desiging a CASE tool dictionary as an OODB example.,情報処理学会研究報告データベースシステム (DBS),1994,*

GRACE TECHNICAL REPORTS,Makoto ONIZUKA; Hiroyuki KATO; Soichiro HIDAKA; Keisuke NAKANO; Zhenjiang HU,Abstract Automatic generation of application-specific big graphs is becoming one of the mostimportant features of a benchmark. In this paper; we report our on-going work and partialresults on big graph generation based on reverse query processing. We show how to dealwith iterative queries by transforming iterative query computation to computation of the fixedpoint of a flat query function; from which a set of constraints can be systematically derived forreverse query processing. And we propose three approaches to parallelizing reverse queryprocessing; namely by query rewriting; virtual node introduction and Kronecker's product.,*,*,*
