Much ofthis diversity remains unexplained; although diet; environment; host genetics and earlymicrobial exposure have all been implicated. Accordingly; to characterize the ecology ofhuman-associated microbial communities; the Human Microbiome Project has analysed thelargest cohort and set of distinct; clinically relevant body habitats so far. We found thediversity and abundance of each habitat's signature microbes to vary widely even amonghealthy subjects; with strong niche specialization both within and among individuals.

Microbial co-occurrence relationships in the human microbiome,Karoline Faust; J Fah Sathirapongsasuti; Jacques Izard; Nicola Segata; Dirk Gevers; Jeroen Raes; Curtis Huttenhower,The healthy microbiota show remarkable variability within and among individuals. Inaddition to external exposures; ecological relationships (both oppositional and symbiotic)between microbial inhabitants are important contributors to this variation. It is thus of interestto assess what relationships might exist among microbes and determine their underlyingreasons. The initial Human Microbiome Project (HMP) cohort; comprising 239 individualsand 18 different microbial habitats; provides an unprecedented resource to detect; catalog;and analyze such relationships. Here; we applied an ensemble method based on multiplesimilarity measures in combination with generalized boosted linear models (GBLMs) totaxonomic marker (16S rRNA gene) profiles of this cohort; resulting in a global network of3;005 significant co-occurrence and co-exclusion relationships between 197 clades …,PLoS computational biology,2012,516

Animal models suggest a role forintestinal bacteria in supporting the systemic immune response required for jointinflammation. Here we performed 16S sequencing on 114 stool samples from rheumatoidarthritis patients and controls; and shotgun sequencing on a subset of 44 such samples. Weidentified the presence of Prevotella copri as strongly correlated with disease in new-onsetuntreated rheumatoid arthritis (NORA) patients. Increases in Prevotella abundancecorrelated with a reduction in Bacteroides and a loss of reportedly beneficial microbes inNORA subjects.

A guide to enterotypes across the human body: meta-analysis of microbial community structures in human microbiome datasets,Omry Koren; Dan Knights; Antonio Gonzalez; Levi Waldron; Nicola Segata; Rob Knight; Curtis Huttenhower; Ruth E Ley,Recent analyses of human-associated bacterial diversity have categorized individuals into'enterotypes' or clusters based on the abundances of key bacterial genera in the gutmicrobiota. There is a lack of consensus; however; on the analytical basis for enterotypesand on the interpretation of these results. We tested how the following factors influenced thedetection of enterotypes: clustering methodology; distance metrics; OTU-pickingapproaches; sequencing depth; data type (whole genome shotgun (WGS) vs. 16S rRNAgene sequence data); and 16S rRNA region. We included 16S rRNA gene sequences fromthe Human Microbiome Project (HMP) and from 16 additional studies and WGS sequencesfrom the HMP and MetaHIT.

The genome of Th17 cell-inducing segmented filamentous bacteria reveals extensive auxotrophy and adaptations to the intestinal environment,Andrew Sczesnak; Nicola Segata; Xiang Qin; Dirk Gevers; Joseph F Petrosino; Curtis Huttenhower; Dan R Littman; Ivaylo I Ivanov,Summary Perturbations of the composition of the symbiotic intestinal microbiota can haveprofound consequences for host metabolism and immunity. In mice; segmented filamentousbacteria (SFB) direct the accumulation of potentially proinflammatory Th17 cells in theintestinal lamina propria. We present the genome sequence of SFB isolated frommonocolonized mice; which classifies SFB phylogenetically as a unique member ofClostridiales with a highly reduced genome. Annotation analysis demonstrates that SFBdepend on their environment for amino acids and essential nutrients and may utilize hostand dietary glycans for carbon; nitrogen; and energy. Comparative analyses reveal that SFBare functionally related to members of the genus Clostridium and several pathogenic orcommensal “minimal” genera; including Finegoldia; Mycoplasma; Borrelia; and …,Cell Host & Microbe,2011,121

A Kalman filter based background updating algorithm robust to sharp illumination changes,Stefano Messelodi; Carla Maria Modena; Nicola Segata; Michele Zanin,Abstract A novel algorithm; based on Kalman filtering is presented for updating thebackground image within video sequences. Unlike existing implementations of the Kalmanfilter for this task; our algorithm is able to deal with both gradual and sudden globalillumination changes. The basic idea is to measure global illumination change and to use itas an external control of the filter. This allows the system to better fit the assumptions aboutthe process to be modeled. Moreover; we propose methods to estimate measurement noisevariance and to deal with the problem of saturated pixels; to improve the accuracy androbustness of the algorithm. The algorithm has been successfully tested in a trafficsurveillance task by comparing it to a background updating algorithm; based on Kalmanfiltering; taken from literature.,International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing,2005,85

Evidence of natural Wolbachia infections in field populations of Anopheles gambiae,Francesco Baldini; Nicola Segata; Julien Pompon; Perrine Marcenac; W Robert Shaw; Roch K Dabiré; Abdoulaye Diabaté; Elena A Levashina; Flaminia Catteruccia,Abstract Wolbachia are maternally transmitted intracellular bacteria that invade insectpopulations by manipulating their reproduction and immunity and thus limiting the spread ofnumerous human pathogens. Experimental Wolbachia infections can reduce Plasmodiumnumbers in Anopheles mosquitoes in the laboratory; however; natural Wolbachia infectionsin field anophelines have never been reported. Here we show evidence of Wolbachiainfections in Anopheles gambiae in Burkina Faso; West Africa. Sequencing of the 16S rRNAgene identified Wolbachia sequences in both female and male germlines across twoseasons; and determined that these sequences are vertically transmitted from mother tooffspring. Whole-genome sequencing of positive samples suggests that the genetic materialidentified in An. gambiae belongs to a novel Wolbachia strain; related to but distinct from …,Nature communications,2014,57

Noise reduction for instance-based learning with a local maximal margin approach,Nicola Segata; Enrico Blanzieri; Sarah Jane Delany; Pádraig Cunningham,Abstract To some extent the problem of noise reduction in machine learning has beenfinessed by the development of learning techniques that are noise-tolerant. However; it isdifficult to make instance-based learning noise tolerant and noise reduction still plays animportant role in k-nearest neighbour classification. There are also other motivations fornoise reduction; for instance the elimination of noise may result in simpler models or datacleansing may be an end in itself. In this paper we present a novel approach to noisereduction based on local Support Vector Machines (LSVM) which brings the benefits ofmaximal margin classifiers to bear on noise reduction. This provides a more robustalternative to the majority rule on which almost all the existing noise reduction techniquesare based.

Carbohydrates are considered keycarbon sources for the gut microbiota; imposing strong selective pressure on the complexmicrobial consortium of the gut. Despite its importance; the genetic traits that facilitatecarbohydrate utilization by gut microbiota members are still poorly characterized. Here;genome analyses of 47 representative Bifidobacterium (sub) species revealed the genespredicted to be required for the degradation and internalization of a wide range ofcarbohydrates; outnumbering those found in many other gut microbiota members. Theglycan-degrading abilities of bifidobacteria are believed to reflect available carbon sourcesin the mammalian gut.

Toward an Efficient Method of Identifying Core Genes for Evolutionary and Functional Microbial Phylogenies,Nicola Segata; Curtis Huttenhower,Microbial community metagenomes and individual microbial genomes are becomingincreasingly accessible by means of high-throughput sequencing. Assessing organismalmembership within a community is typically performed using one or a few taxonomic markergenes such as the 16S rDNA; and these same genes are also employed to reconstructmolecular phylogenies. There is thus a growing need to bioinformatically catalog stronglyconserved core genes that can serve as effective taxonomic markers; to assess theagreement among phylogenies generated from different core gene; and to characterize thebiological functions enriched within core genes and thus conserved throughout largemicrobial clades. We present a method to recursively identify core genes (ie genesubiquitous within a microbial clade) in high-throughput from a large number of complete …,PloS one,2011,29

Fast local support vector machines for large datasets,Nicola Segata; Enrico Blanzieri,Abstract Local SVM is a classification approach that combines instance-based learning andstatistical machine learning. It builds an SVM on the feature space neighborhood of thequery point in the training set and uses it to predict its class. There is both empirical andtheoretical evidence that Local SVM can improve over SVM and k NN in terms ofclassification accuracy; but the computational cost of the method permits the application onlyon small datasets. Here we propose FastLSVM; a classifier based on Local SVM thatdecreases the number of SVMs that must be built in order to be suitable for large datasets.FastLSVM precomputes a set of local SVMs in the training set and assigns to each model allthe points lying in the central neighborhood of the k points on which it is trained. Theprediction is performed applying to the query point the model corresponding to its nearest …,Machine Learning and Data Mining in Pattern Recognition,2009,27
Host and gut microbiota symbiotic factors: lessons from inflammatory bowel disease and successful symbionts,Sonia A Ballal; Carey Ann Gallini; Nicola Segata; Curtis Huttenhower; Wendy S Garrett,Summary Humans are colonized by a diverse collection of microbes; the largest numbers ofwhich reside in the distal gut. The vast majority of humans coexist in a beneficial equilibriumwith these microbes. However; disruption of this mutualistic relationship can manifest itself inhuman diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease. Thus the study of inflammatory boweldisease and its genetics can provide insight into host pathways that mediate host–microbiota symbiosis. Bacteria of the human intestinal ecosystem face numerous challengesimposed by human dietary intake; the mucosal immune system; competition from fellowmembers of the gut microbiota; transient ingested microbes and invading pathogens.Considering features of human resident gut bacteria provides the opportunity to understandhow microbes have achieved their symbiont status. While model symbionts have …,Cellular microbiology,2011,26
Evaluation of bifidobacterial community composition in the human gut by means of a targeted amplicon sequencing (ITS) protocol,Christian Milani; Gabriele A Lugli; Francesca Turroni; Leonardo Mancabelli; Sabrina Duranti; Alice Viappiani; Marta Mangifesta; Nicola Segata; Douwe van Sinderen; Marco Ventura,Abstract The precise appraisal of the composition of the human gut microbiota stillrepresents a challenging task. The advent of next generation sequencing approaches hasopened new ways to dissect the microbial biodiversity of this ecosystem through the use of16S rRNA gene-based microbiota analysis approaches. However; the detailedrepresentation of specific groups or members of the human gut microbiota; for exampleBifidobacteria; may be skewed by the PCR primers employed in the amplification step of the16S rRNA gene-based microbial profiling pipeline and by the limited resolution of the 16SrRNA gene variable regions. Here; we define the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)sequences of all currently known Bifidobacterium taxa; providing a Bifidobacterium-specificprimer pair that targets a hypervariable region within the ITS suitable for precise …,FEMS microbiology ecology,2014,23
High-specificity targeted functional profiling in microbial communities with ShortBRED,James Kaminski; Molly K Gibson; Eric A Franzosa; Nicola Segata; Gautam Dantas; Curtis Huttenhower,Profiling microbial community function from metagenomic sequencing data remains acomputationally challenging problem. Mapping millions of DNA reads from such samples toreference protein databases requires long run-times; and short read lengths can result inspurious hits to unrelated proteins (loss of specificity). We developed ShortBRED (Short;Better Representative Extract Dataset) to address these challenges; facilitating fast; accuratefunctional profiling of metagenomic samples. ShortBRED consists of two components:(i) amethod that reduces reference proteins of interest to short; highly representative amino acidsequences (“markers”) and (ii) a search step that maps reads to these markers to quantifythe relative abundance of their associated proteins. After evaluating ShortBRED on syntheticdata; we applied it to profile antibiotic resistance protein families in the gut microbiomes of …,PLoS computational biology,2015,21

Empirical assessment of classification accuracy of Local SVM,Nicola Segata; Enrico Blanzieri,The combination of maximal margin classifiers and k-nearest neighbors rule constructing anSVM on the neighborhood of the test sample in the feature space (called kNNSVM); waspresented as a promising way of improving classification accuracy. Since no extensivevalidation of the method was performed yet; in this work we test the kNNSVM method on 13widely used datasets using four different kernels obtaining good classification results.Moreover we present two artificial datasets in which kNNSVM performs substantially betterthan SVM with RBF kernel. Statistically significant testing of the method as well as the resultson the artificial datasets; lead us to conclude that kNNSVM performs sensibly better thanSVM.,*,2008,18
Clinical populations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from acute infections show a wide virulence range partially correlated with population structure and virule...,Hussnain A Janjua; Nicola Segata; Paola Bernabo; Sabrina Tamburini; Albert Ellen; Olivier Jousson,Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium responsible for a varietyof infections in humans; as well as in animal hosts. While the evolution of virulence in P.aeruginosa strains isolated from chronic lung infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients hasbeen extensively studied; the virulence phenotype of P. aeruginosa isolated from otherinfection types or from the environment is currently not well characterized. Here we report anextensive analysis of the virulence of P. aeruginosa strains isolated from acute infectionscompared with population structure. Virulence profiles of individual strains were alsocompared with the expression levels of the rhlR gene; the transcriptional regulator of the rhlquorum-sensing system; and the gene encoding Crc; a global regulator controllingcatabolite repression and carbon metabolism.

A scalable noise reduction technique for large case-based systems,Nicola Segata; Enrico Blanzieri; Pádraig Cunningham,Abstract Because case-based reasoning (CBR) is instance-based; it is vulnerable to noisydata. Other learning techniques such as support vector machines (SVMs) and decision treeshave been developed to be noise-tolerant so a certain level of noise in the data can becondoned. By contrast; noisy data can have a big impact in CBR because inference isnormally based on a small number of cases. So far; research on noise reduction has beenbased on a majority-rule strategy; cases that are out of line with their neighbors areremoved. We depart from that strategy and use local SVMs to identify noisy cases. This ismore powerful than a majority-rule strategy because it explicitly considers the decisionboundary in the noise reduction process. In this paper we provide details on how such alocal SVM strategy for noise reduction can be made scale to very large datasets (> …,Case-Based Reasoning Research and Development,2009,17

Links between the configuration of the infant gutmicrobiome and infant health are being shown; but a comprehensive strain-levelassessment of microbes vertically transmitted from mother to infant is still missing. Wecollected fecal and breast milk samples from multiple mother-infant pairs during the first yearof life and applied shotgun metagenomic sequencing followed by computational strain-levelprofiling. We observed that several specific strains; including those of Bifidobacteriumbifidum; Coprococcus comes; and Ruminococcus bromii; were present in samples from thesame mother-infant pair; while being clearly distinct from those carried by other pairs; whichis indicative of vertical transmission. We further applied metatranscriptomics to study the …,mSystems,2017,16

Simultaneous quantification of multiple bacteria by the BactoChip microarray designed to target species-specific marker genes,Annalisa Ballarini; Nicola Segata; Curtis Huttenhower; Olivier Jousson,Bacteria are ubiquitous throughout the environment; the most abundant inhabitants of thehealthy human microbiome; and causal pathogens in a variety of diseases. Theiridentification in disease is often an essential step in rapid diagnosis and targetedintervention; particularly in clinical settings. At present; clinical bacterial detection anddiscrimination is primarily culture-based; requiring both time and microbiological expertise;especially for bacteria that are not easily cultivated. Higher-throughput molecular methodsbased on PCR amplification or; recently; microarrays are reaching the clinic as well.However; these methods are currently restricted to a small set of microbes or based onconserved phylogenetic markers such as the 16S rRNA gene; which are difficult to resolve atthe species or strain levels.

MetaMLST: multi-locus strain-level bacterial typing from metagenomic samples,Moreno Zolfo; Adrian Tett; Olivier Jousson; Claudio Donati; Nicola Segata,Abstract Metagenomic characterization of microbial communities has the potential tobecome a tool to identify pathogens in human samples. However; software tools able toextract strain-level typing information from metagenomic data are needed. Low-throughputmolecular typing schema such as Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) are still widely usedand provide a wealth of strain-level information that is currently not exploited bymetagenomic methods. We introduce MetaMLST; a software tool that reconstructs the MLSTloci of microorganisms present in microbial communities from metagenomic data. Tested onsynthetic and spiked-in real metagenomes; the pipeline was able to reconstruct the MLSTsequences with> 98.5% accuracy at coverages as low as 1×.

Profiling instances in noise reduction,Sarah Jane Delany; Nicola Segata; Brian Mac Namee,Abstract The dependency on the quality of the training data has led to significant work innoise reduction for instance-based learning algorithms. This paper presents an empiricalevaluation of current noise reduction techniques; not just from the perspective of theircomparative performance; but from the perspective of investigating the types of instancesthat they focus on for removal. A novel instance profiling technique known as RDCL profilingallows the structure of a training set to be analysed at the instance level categorising eachinstance based on modelling their local competence properties. This profiling approachoffers the opportunity of investigating the types of instances removed by the noise reductiontechniques that are currently in use in instance-based learning.

Thequasi-local kernels maintain the possibly global properties of the input kernel and theyincrease the kernel value as the points get closer in the feature space of the input kernel;mixing the effect of the input kernel with a kernel which is local in the feature space of theinput one. If applied on a local kernel the operators introduce an additional level of localityequivalent to use a local kernel with non-stationary kernel width.

Here; we performed a large-scale comparative analysis by using 183publicly available genomes supplemented with a Lactobacillus strain isolated from thehuman upper respiratory tract. On the basis of this analysis; we identified inconsistencies inthe taxonomy and reclassified all of the genomes according to their most closely related typestrains. This led to the identification of a catalase-encoding gene in all 10 L. casei sensustricto strains; making it the first described catalase-positive species in the Lactobacillusgenus.

Barriers include the need forsubstantial investments of time; computational resources and specialized bioinformaticexpertise as well as inconsistencies in annotation and formatting between individualstudies.To overcome these challenges; we developed the curatedMetagenomicData data …,Nature methods,2017,3
Local approaches for fast; scalable and accurate learning with kernels,Nicola Segata,The present thesis deals with the fundamental machine learning issues of increasing theaccuracy of learning systems and their computational performances. The key concept whichis exploited throughout the thesis; is the tunable trade-off between local and globalapproaches to learning; integrating the effective setting of Instance Based Learning with thesound foundations of Statistical Learning Theory. Four are the main contributions of thethesis in this context:(i) a theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation of the Local SVMapproach;(ii) a family of operators on kernels to obtain Quasi-Local kernels;(iii) theframework of Local Kernel Machines; and (iv) a local maximal margin approach to noisereduction. In our analysis of Local SVM; we derive a new learning bound starting from thetheory of Local Learning Algorithms; and we showed that Local SVM statistically …,*,2009,3
Stochastic π-Calculus Modelling of Multisite Phosphorylation Based Signaling: The PHO Pathway in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae,Nicola Segata; Enrico Blanzieri,Abstract We propose a stochastic π-calculus modelling approach able to handle thecomplexity of post-translational signalling and to overcome some limitations of the ordinarydifferential equations based methods. The model we developed is customizable without apriori assumptions to every multisite phosphorylation regulation. We applied it to themultisite phosphorylation of the Pho4 transcription factor that plays a crucial role in thephosphate starvation signalling in Saccharomyces cerevisiae; using available in vitroexperiments for the model tuning and validation. The in silico simulation of the sub-path withthe stochastic π-calculus allows quantitative analyses of the kinetic characteristics of thePho4 phosphorylation; the different phosphorylation dynamics for each site (possiblycombined) and the variation of the kinase activity as the reaction goes to completion.

A different microbiome gene repertoire in the airways of cystic fibrosis patients with severe lung disease,Giovanni Bacci; Alessio Mengoni; Ersilia Fiscarelli; Nicola Segata; Giovanni Taccetti; Daniela Dolce; Patrizia Paganin; Patrizia Morelli; Vanessa Tuccio; Alessandra De Alessandri; Vincenzina Lucidi; Annamaria Bevivino,In recent years; next-generation sequencing (NGS) was employed to decipher the structureand composition of the microbiota of the airways in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. However;little is still known about the overall gene functions harbored by the resident microbialpopulations and which specific genes are associated with various stages of CF lungdisease. In the present study; we aimed to identify the microbial gene repertoire of CFmicrobiota in twelve patients with severe and normal/mild lung disease by performingsputum shotgun metagenome sequencing. The abundance of metabolic pathways encodedby microbes inhabiting CF airways was reconstructed from the metagenome. We identified aset of metabolic pathways differently distributed in patients with different pulmonary function;namely; pathways related to bacterial chemotaxis and flagellar assembly; as well as …,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2017,2
Long-adapter single-strand oligonucleotide probes for the massively multiplexed cloning of kilobase genome regions,Lorenzo Tosi; Viswanadham Sridhara; Yunlong Yang; Dongli Guan; Polina Shpilker; Nicola Segata; H Benjamin Larman; Biju Parekkadan,Abstract As the catalogue of sequenced genomes and metagenomes continues to grow;massively parallel approaches for the comprehensive and functional analysis of geneproducts and regulatory elements are becoming increasingly valuable. Current strategies tosynthesize or clone complex libraries of DNA sequences are limited by the length of theDNA targets; throughput and cost. Here; we show that long-adapter single-strandoligonucleotide (LASSO) probes can capture and clone thousands of kilobase DNAfragments in a single reaction. As proof of principle; we simultaneously cloned over 3;000bacterial open reading frames (ORFs) from Escherichia coli genomic DNA (spanning 400-to5;000-bp targets). Targets were enriched up to a median of around 60-fold compared withnon-targeted genomic regions. At a cutoff of three times the median non-target reads per …,Nature biomedical engineering,2017,2
The new phylogenesis of the genus Mycobacterium,Enrico Tortoli; Tarcisio Fedrizzi; Monica Pecorari; Elisabetta Giacobazzi; Veronica De Sanctis; Roberto Bertorelli; Antonella Grottola; Anna Fabio; Pamela Ferretti; Francesca Di Leva; Giulia Fregni Serpini; Sara Tagliazucchi; Fabio Rumpianesi; Olivier Jousson; Nicola Segata,Abstract Phylogenetic knowledge of the genus Mycobacterium is based on comparativeanalysis of their genetic sequences. The 16S rRNA has remained for many years the onlytarget of such analyses; but in the last few years; other housekeeping genes have beeninvestigated and the phylogeny based on their concatenated sequences become astandard. It is now clear that the robustness of the phylogenetic analysis is strictly related tothe size of the genomic target used. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is nowadaysbecoming widely accessible and comparatively cheap. It was decided; therefore; to use thisapproach to reconstruct the ultimate phylogeny of the genus Mycobacterium. Over 50 typesof strains of the same number of species of Mycobacterium were sequenced using theIllumina HiSeq platform.

Kernel Integration using von Neumann Entropy,Andrea Malossini; Nicola Segata; Enrico Blanzieri,Kernel methods provide a computational framework to integrate heterogeneous biologicaldata from different sources for a wide range of learning algorithms by designing a kernel foreach di® erent information source and combining them in a unique kernel through simplemathematical operations. We develop here a novel technique for weighting kernels basedon their von Neumann entropy. This permits to assess the kernel quality without using labelinformation; and to integrate kernels before the beginning of the learning process. Moreover;we carry out a comparison with the unweighted kernel summation and a popular techniquebased on semi-definite programming on kernel integration benchmark data sets. Finally; weempirically study the variation of the performance of a support vector machine classi¯ erconsidering pairs of kernels combined in di® erent ratios; and we show how; surprisingly …,*,2009,2

For whatconcerns the genus Mycobacterium these approaches support the separation of rapidly andslowly growing species and the clustering of most species in well-defined phylogeneticgroups. The advent of high-throughput shotgun sequencing leads us to revise conventionaltaxonomy of mycobacteria on the light of genomic data. For this purpose we investigated 88newly sequenced species in addition to 60 retrieved from GenBank and used the AverageNucleotide Identity pairwise scores to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships within thisgenus.

Metabolic reconstruction of microbial communities from metagenomic data,S Abubucker; N Segata; J Goll; A Schubert; B Rodriguez-Mueller; J Zucker; PD Schloss; D Gevers; M Mitreva; C Huttenhower,Abstract Microbial communities carry out the majority of biochemical activity on the planet;and they play integral roles in metabolism and immune homeostasis in humans. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing of community metagenomes is becoming an increasinglyfeasible means of studying their functional potential; complementing organismal informationfrom taxonomic marker genes and reference genomes. Shotgun data assaying thesecommunities typically comprise short reads from hundreds of organisms and it can bechallenging to assemble these sequences comparably to single-organism genomes. Here;we propose an alternative means to determine the functional and metabolic potential of amicrobial community metagenome directly from short reads. We infer the gene families andpathways present or absent within a community and their relative abundances in order to …,Companion Paper,2011,*
FaLKM-lib,Nicola Segata,FaLKM-lib is a library for fast local kernel machine implemented in C++ extedning LibSVM. Itcontains modules for classification; regression and noise reduction. All the neighbourhood operationsare implemented with our implementation of Cover Trees [Beygelzimer; Kakade; Langford;2006] for computational reasons; whereas the training and testing of the Local SVMs is performedusing LibSVM [Chang; Lin 2001] version 2.88. FaLKM-lib contains modules for very fast andscalable learning that showed to be statistically more accurate than SVM and; using some implementedstrategies; faster than SVM and thus scalable for very large datasets (some million of samplesfor non high-dimensional data). The FaLKM-lib library and its algorithms are concisely introducedand formally described in the document [Segata; 2009] available here … If you have any generalcomments; suggestions or problems using the code; please write to …,*,2010,*
COMPARATIVE METAGENOMIC,Matthias Scholz; Doyle V Ward; Edoardo Pasolli; Thomas Tolio; Moreno Zolfo; Francesco Asnicar; Duy Tin Truong; Adrian Tett; Ardythe L Morrow; Nicola Segata,▪ Network analysis suggested similar conclusions and identified a strain closely related tothe German outbreak in a data set of Chinese individuals▪ The Chinese sample appears tocontain an O104: H4 strain encoding genes associated with the enterohemorrhagicplasmids; but it differs from the German outbreak strain in that it lacks the Shiga toxin–encoding region▪ This observation was confirmed in an independent; ad hoc coverageanalysis and assessed the impact on profiling accuracy in the case of multiple strains withsimilar relative abundance,*,*,*
