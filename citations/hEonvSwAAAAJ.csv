A review of intelligent CALL systems,Johann Gamper; Judith Knapp,Computer-assisted language learning is a research field which explores the use ofcomputational methods and techniques as well as new media for language learning andteaching. Recently; an increasing number of language learning systems began to adoptArtificial Intelligence techniques. This paper provides an overview about intelligent computer-assisted language learning. The most advanced systems have been investigated andclassified along five dimension: supported languages; Artificial Intelligence techniques;language skills; language elements; and availability. The paper concludes with a discussionabout outstanding problems that need further research in order to exploit the full potential ofintelligent technologies in language learning envoronments.,Computer Assisted Language Learning,2002,146
Approximate matching of hierarchical data using pq-grams,Nikolaus Augsten; Michael Böhlen; Johann Gamper,Abstract When integrating data from autonomous sources; exact matches of data items thatrepresent the same real world object often fail due to a lack of common keys. Yet in manycases structural information is available and can be used to match such data. As a runningexample we use residential address information. Addresses are hierarchical structures andare present in many databases. Often they are the best; if not only; relationship betweenautonomous data sources. Typically the matching has to be approximate since therepresentations in the sources differ. We propose pq-grams to approximately matchhierarchical information from autonomous sources. We define the pq-gram distancebetween ordered labeled trees as an effective and efficient approximation of the well-knowntree edit distance. We analyze the properties of the pq-gram distance and compare it with …,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,96
The pq-gram distance between ordered labeled trees,Nikolaus Augsten; Michael Böhlen; Johann Gamper,Abstract When integrating data from autonomous sources; exact matches of data items thatrepresent the same real-world object often fail due to a lack of common keys. Yet in manycases structural information is available and can be used to match such data. Typically thematching must be approximate since the representations in the sources differ. We proposepq-grams to approximately match hierarchical data from autonomous sources and define thepq-gram distance between ordered labeled trees as an effective and efficient approximationof the fanout weighted tree edit distance. We prove that the pq-gram distance is a lowerbound of the fanout weighted tree edit distance and give a normalization of the pq-gramdistance for which the triangle inequality holds. Experiments on synthetic and real-worlddata (residential addresses and XML) confirm the scalability of our approach and show …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2010,63
Supporting teachers as content authors in intelligent educational systems,Peter Brusilovsky; Judith Knapp; Johann Gamper,Intelligent Educational Systems (IESs) need large amounts of educational content that istypically not provided by the creators of these systems. In this paper we discuss a newapproach for authoring practical IESs where core authoring is done by professional designteams; while the educational content is mainly developed by teachers who use the system intheir classes. The major bottleneck of this approach is the lack of intelligent authoringsupport tools that allow regular teachers to author intelligent content that an IES needs inorder to perform its functions. As a contribution to solving this problem; we present our recentwork on authoring support for an adaptive vocabulary acquisition system; ELDIT. The paperdescribes the ELDIT system; the needs and challenges of language content authoring byteachers; and the two authoring support components that we have developed for two …,International Journal of Knowledge and Learning,2006,61
Abstract temporal diagnosis in medical domains,Johann Gamper; Wolfgang Nejdl,Abstract Most current model-based diagnosis formalisms and algorithms are defined only forstatic systems; which is often inadequate for medical reasoning. In this paper we describe amodel-based framework plus algorithms for diagnosing time-dependent systems where wecan define qualitative temporal scenarios. Complex temporal behavior is described within alogical framework extended by qualitative temporal constraints. Abstract observationsaggregate from observations at time points to assumptions over time intervals. Theseconcepts provide a very natural representation and make diagnosis independent of thenumber of actual observations and the temporal resolution. The concept of abstract temporaldiagnosis captures in a natural way the kind of indefinite temporal knowledge which isfrequently available in medical diagnoses. We use viral hepatitis B (including a set of real …,Artificial Intelligence in Medicine,1997,52

Temporal alignment,Anton Dignös; Michael H Böhlen; Johann Gamper,Abstract In order to process interval timestamped data; the sequenced semantics has beenproposed. This paper presents a relational algebra solution that provides native support forthe three properties of the sequenced semantics: snapshot reducibility; extended snapshotreducibility; and change preservation. We introduce two temporal primitives; temporal splitterand temporal aligner; and define rules that use these primitives to reduce the operators of atemporal algebra to their nontemporal counterparts. Our solution supports the threeproperties of the sequenced semantics through interval adjustment and timestamppropagation. We have implemented the temporal primitives and reduction rules in the kernelof PostgreSQL to get native database support for processing interval timestamped data. Thesupport is comprehensive and includes outer joins; antijoins; and aggregations with …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,45
Multi-dimensional aggregation for temporal data,Michael Böhlen; Johann Gamper; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Business Intelligence solutions; encompassing technologies such as multi-dimensional data modeling and aggregate query processing; are being applied increasinglyto non-traditional data. This paper extends multi-dimensional aggregation to apply to datawith associated interval values that capture when the data hold. In temporal databases;intervals typically capture the states of reality that the data apply to; or capture when the dataare; or were; part of the current database state. This paper proposes a new aggregationoperator that addresses several challenges posed by interval data. First; the intervals to beassociated with the result tuples may not be known in advance; but depend on the actualdata. Such unknown intervals are accommodated by allowing result groups that arespecified only partially. Second; the operator contends with the case where an interval …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,44
Approximate joins for data-centric XML,Nikolaus Augsten; Michael Bohlen; Curtis Dyreson; Johann Gamper,In data integration applications; a join matches elements that are common to two datasources. Often; however; elements are represented slightly different in each source; so anapproximate join must be used. For XML data; most approximate join strategies are basedon some ordered tree matching technique. But in data-centric XML the order is irrelevant:two elements should match even if their subelement order varies. In this paper we give asolution for the approximate join of unordered trees. Our solution is based on windowed pq-grams. We develop an efficient technique to systematically generate windowed pq-grams ina three-step process: sorting the unordered tree; extending the sorted tree with dummynodes; and computing the windowed pq-grams on the extended tree. The windowed pq-gram distance between two sorted trees approximates the tree edit distance between the …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,41

How would you like to aggregate your temporal data?,Michael H Bohlen; Johann Gamper; Christian S Jensen,Real-world data management applications generally manage temporal data; ie; theymanage multiple states of time-varying data. Many contributions have been made by theresearch community for how to better model; store; and query temporal data. In particular;several dozen temporal data models and query languages have been proposed. Motivatedin part by the emergence of non-traditional data management applications and theincreasing proliferation of temporal data; this paper puts focus on the aggregation oftemporal data. In particular; it provides a general framework of temporal aggregationconcepts; and it discusses the abilities of five approaches to the design of temporal querylanguages with respect to temporal aggregation.

A data model and its implementation for a Web-based language learning system,Johann Gamper; Judith Knapp,Abstract: At the European Academy of Bozen-Bolzano we are currently developing anadaptive Web-based language learning system for the German and Italian languages. In thispaper we focus on the development and implementation of a data model for this system.While in the general context of e-learning the basic building blocks-often called learningobjects-represent domain concepts; for our learning material the basic building blocks arewords and expressions. Moreover; these pieces of data are highly interlinked. This situationrequires a very fine-grained data model which stores meta-information at the word level andbelow. We present such a data model and discuss its implementation using XML.,Proceedings of the Twelfth International World Wide Web Conference (WWW2003),2003,22

Overlap interval partition join,Anton Dignös; Michael H Böhlen; Johann Gamper,Abstract Each tuple in a valid-time relation includes an interval attribute T that represents thetuple's valid time. The overlap join between two valid-time relations determines all pairs oftuples with overlapping intervals. Although overlap joins are common; existing partitioningand indexing schemes are inefficient if the data includes long-lived tuples or if intervalsintersect partition boundaries. We propose Overlap Interval Partitioning (OIP); a newpartitioning approach for data with an interval. OIP divides the time range of a relation into kbase granules and defines overlapping partitions for sequences of contiguous granules. OIPis the first partitioning method for interval data that gives a constant clustering guarantee: thedifference in duration between the interval of a tuple and the interval of its partition isindependent of the duration of the tuple's interval. We offer a detailed analysis of the …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2014,21
Parsimonious temporal aggregation,Juozas Gordevičius; Johann Gamper; Michael Böhlen,Abstract Temporal aggregation is an important operation in temporal databases; anddifferent variants thereof have been proposed. In this paper; we introduce a novel temporalaggregation operator; termed parsimonious temporal aggregation (PTA); that overcomesmajor limitations of existing approaches. PTA takes the result of instant temporalaggregation (ITA) of size n; which might be up to twice as large as the argument relation;and merges similar tuples until a given error (ϵ) or size (c) bound is reached. The newoperator is data-adaptive and allows the user to control the trade-off between the result sizeand the error introduced by merging. For the precise evaluation of PTA queries; we proposetwo dynamic programming–based algorithms for size-and error-bounded queries;respectively; with a worst-case complexity that is quadratic in n.

Corpus-based terminology,Johann Gamper; Oliviero Stock,The manual acquisition of terminological material from the domain-specific text material is avery time-consuming task. Recent advances in text-processing research provide a basis forautomating this task. Computer-assisted term acquisition improves both the quantity and thequality of terminological work. This paper gives a brief overview of this new approach interminology acquisition. Three subtasks are distinguished: compilation of an electronic textcorpus; extraction of terminological data; and management of terminological data. Each ofthe subtasks will be discussed in some detail by identifying the core problems as well asproposed solutions. As a concrete initiative in this emerging field; we present an ongoingresearch project at the European Academy Bolzano; which illustrates the importance ofcomputer-assisted terminology acquisition and of the resulting steps that have been taken …,Terminology.

Efficient haplotype block recognition of very long and dense genetic sequences,Daniel Taliun; Johann Gamper; Cristian Pattaro,The new sequencing technologies enable to scan very long and dense genetic sequences;obtaining datasets of genetic markers that are an order of magnitude larger than previouslyavailable. Such genetic sequences are characterized by common alleles interspersed withmultiple rarer alleles. This situation has renewed the interest for the identification ofhaplotypes carrying the rare risk alleles. However; large scale explorations of the linkage-disequilibrium (LD) pattern to identify haplotype blocks are not easy to perform; becausetraditional algorithms have at least Θ (n2) time and memory complexity. We derived threeincremental optimizations of the widely used haplotype block recognition algorithmproposed by Gabriel et al. in 2002. Our most efficient solution; called MIG++; has only Θ (n)memory complexity and; on a genome-wide scale; it omits> 80% of the calculations …,BMC bioinformatics,2014,18
Scalable computation of isochrones with network expiration,Johann Gamper; Michael Böhlen; Markus Innerebner,Abstract An isochrone in a spatial network is the possibly disconnected set of all locationsfrom where a query point is reachable within a given time span and by a given arrival time.In this paper we propose an efficient and scalable evaluation algorithm; termed (MINEX); forthe computation of isochrones in multimodal spatial networks with different transportationmodes. The space complexity of MINEX is independent of the network size and its runtime isdetermined by the incremental loading of the relevant network portions. We show thatMINEX is optimal in the sense that only those network portions are loaded that eventuallywill be part of the isochrone. To keep the memory requirements low; we eagerly expire theisochrone and only keep in memory the minimal set of expanded vertices that is necessaryto avoid cyclic expansions. The concept of expired vertices reduces MINEX's memory …,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2012,18
Diversifying search results of controversial queries,Mouna Kacimi; Johann Gamper,Abstract Diversifying search results of queries seeking for different view points aboutcontroversial topics is key to improving satisfaction of users. The challenge for findingdifferent opinions is how to maximize the number of discussed arguments without beingbiased against specific sentiments. This paper addresses the issue by first introducing a newmodel that represents the patterns occurring in documents about controversial topics.Second; proposing an opinion diversification model that uses (1) relevance of documents;(2)semantic diversification to capture different arguments and (3) sentiment diversification toidentify positive; negative and neutral sentiments about the query topic. We have conductedour experiments using queries on various controversial topics and applied our diversificationmodel on the set of documents returned by Google search engine.

Sequenced event set pattern matching,Bruno Cadonna; Johann Gamper; Michael H Böhlen,Abstract Event pattern matching is a query technique where a sequence of input events ismatched against a complex pattern that specifies constraints on extent; order; values; andquantification of matching events. The increasing importance of such query techniques isunderpinned by a significant amount of research work; the availability of commercialproducts; and by a recent proposal to extend SQL for event pattern matching. The proposedSQL extension includes an operator PERMUTE; which allows to express patterns that matchany permutation of a set of events. No implementation of this operator is known to theauthors. In this paper; we study the sequenced event set pattern matching problem; which isthe problem of matching a sequence of input events against a complex pattern that specifiesa sequence of sets of events rather than a sequence of single events.

Defining isochrones in multimodal spatial networks,Johann Gamper; Michael Böhlen; Willi Cometti; Markus Innerebner,Abstract An isochrone in a spatial network is the minimal; possibly disconnected subgraphthat covers all locations from where a query point is reachable within a given time span andby a given arrival time. In this paper we formally define isochrones for multimodal spatialnetworks with different transportation modes that can be discrete or continuous in;respectively; space and time. For the computation of isochrones we propose the multimodalincremental network expansion (MINE) algorithm; which is independent of the actualnetwork size and depends only on the size of the isochrone. An empirical study using real-world data confirms the analytical results.,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,15
Determining objects within isochrones in spatial network databases,Sarunas Marciuska; Johann Gamper,Abstract Isochrones are generally defined as the set of all space points from which a querypoint can be reached in a given timespan; and they are used in urban planning to conductreachability and coverage analyzes in a city. In a spatial network representing the streetnetwork; an isochrone is represented as a subgraph of the street network. Such a networkrepresentation is not always sufficient to determine all objects within an isochrone; sinceobjects are not only on the network but might be in the immediate vicinity of links (eg; housesalong a street). Thus; the spatial area covered by an isochrone needs to be considered. Inthis paper we present two algorithms for determining all objects that are within an isochrone.The main idea is to first transform an isochrone network into an isochrone area; which isthen intersected with the objects. The first approach constructs a spatial buffer around …,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2010,15

An incrementally maintainable index for approximate lookups in hierarchical data,Nikolaus Augsten; Michael Böhlen; Johann Gamper,Abstract Several recent papers argue for approximate lookups in hierarchical data andpropose index structures that support approximate searches in large sets of hierarchicaldata. These index structures must be updated if the underlying data changes. Since theperformance of a full index reconstruction is prohibitive; the index must be updatedincrementally. We propose a persistent and incrementally maintainable index forapproximate lookups in hierarchical data. The index is based on small tree patterns; calledpq-grams. It supports efficient updates in response to structure and value changes inhierarchical data and is based on the log of tree edit operations. We prove the correctness ofthe incremental maintenance for sequences of edit operations. Our algorithms identify asmall set of pq-grams that must be updated to maintain the index.

Efficient itinerary planning with category constraints,Paolo Bolzoni; Sven Helmer; Kevin Wellenzohn; Johann Gamper; Periklis Andritsos,Abstract We propose a more realistic approach to trip planning for tourist applications byadding category information to points of interest (POIs). This makes it easier for tourists toformulate their preferences by stating constraints on categories rather than individual POIs.However; solving this problem is not just a matter of extending existing algorithms. In ourapproach we exploit the fact that POIs are usually not evenly distributed but tend to appearin clusters. We develop a group of efficient algorithms based on clustering with guaranteedtheoretical bounds. We also evaluate our algorithms experimentally; using real-world datasets; showing that in practice the results are better than the theoretical guarantees and veryclose to the optimal solution.,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSPATIAL international conference on advances in geographic information systems,2014,11
Query time scaling of attribute values in interval timestamped databases,Anton Dignös; Michael Böhlen; Johann Gamper,In valid-time databases with interval timestamping each tuple is associated with a timeinterval over which the recorded fact is true in the modeled reality. The adjustment of theseintervals is an essential part of processing interval timestamped data. Some attribute valuesremain valid if the associated interval changes; whereas others have to be scaled along withthe time interval. For example; attributes that record total (cumulative) quantities over time;such as project budgets; total sales or total costs; often must be scaled if the timestamp isadjusted. The goal of this demo is to show how to support the scaling of attribute values inSQL at query time.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,11
Windowed pq-grams for approximate joins of data-centric XML,Nikolaus Augsten; Michael Böhlen; Curtis Dyreson; Johann Gamper,Abstract In data integration applications; a join matches elements that are common to twodata sources. Since elements are represented slightly different in each source; anapproximate join must be used to do the matching. For XML data; most existing approximatejoin strategies are based on some ordered tree matching technique; such as the tree editdistance. In data-centric XML; however; the sibling order is irrelevant; and two elementsshould match even if their subelement order varies. Thus; approximate joins for data-centricXML must leverage unordered tree matching techniques. This is computationally hard sincethe algorithms cannot rely on a predefined sibling order. In this paper; we give a solution forapproximate joins based on unordered tree matching. The core of our solution arewindowed pq-grams which are small subtrees of a specific shape.

Temporal aggregation,Johann Gamper; Michael Böhlen; Christian S Jensen,There are two kinds of tables: frequency tables that display the count of respondents at thecrossing of the categorical attributes (in N) and magnitude tables that display information ona numerical attribute at the crossing of the categorical attributes (in R). For example; givensome census microdata containing attributes “Job” and “Town;” one can generate afrequency table displaying the count of respondents doing each job type in each town. If thecensus microdata also contain the “Salary;” attribute; one can generate a magnitude tabledisplaying the average salary for each job type in each town. The number n of cells in atable is normally much less than the number r of respondent records in a microdata file.However; tables must satisfy several linear constraints: marginal row and column totals.Additionally; a set of tables is called linked if they share some of the crossed categorical …,*,2009,10

ISOGA: a system for geographical reachability analysis,Markus Innerebner; Michael Böhlen; Johann Gamper,Abstract In this paper; we present a web-based system; termed ISOGA; that uses isochronesto perform geographical reachability analysis. An isochrone in a spatial network covers allspace points from where a query point is reachable within given time constraints. The core ofthe system builds an efficient algorithm for the computation of isochrones in multimodalspatial networks. By joining isochrones with other databases; various kinds of geospatialreachability analysis can be performed; such as how well is a city covered by public servicesor where to look for an apartment at moderate prices that is close to the working place.ISOGA adopts a service-oriented three-tier architecture and uses technologies that arecompliant with OGC standards.

Thispaper is the first to propose a method to efficiently evaluate SST aggregation queries for theCOUNT; SUM; and AVG aggregation functions.

Model-based diagnosis with qualitative temporal uncertainty,Wolfgang Nejdl; Johann Gamper,Abstract In this paper we describe a framework for model-based diagnosis of dynamicsystems; which extends previous work in this field by using and expressing temporaluncertainty in the form of qualitative interval relations a la Allen. Based on a logicalframework extended by qualitative and quantitative temporal constraints we show how todescribe behavioral models (both consistency-and abductive-based); discuss how to useabstract observations and show how abstract temporal diagnoses are computed. This yieldsan expressive framework; which allows the representation of complex temporal behaviorallowing us to represent temporal uncertainty. Due to its abstraction capabilities computationis made independent of the number of observations and time points in a temporal setting.

Memory-efficient centroid decomposition for long time series,Mourad Khayati; Michael Bohlen; Johann Gamper,Real world applications that deal with time series data often rely on matrix decompositiontechniques; such as the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The Centroid Decomposition(CD) approximates the Singular Value Decomposition; but does not scale to long time seriesbecause of the quadratic space complexity of the sign vector computation. In this paper; wepropose a greedy algorithm; termed Scalable Sign Vector (SSV); to efficiently determine signvectors for CD applications with long time series; ie; where the number of rows(observations) is much larger than the number of columns (time series). The SSV algorithmstarts with a sign vector consisting of only 1s and iteratively changes the sign of the elementthat maximizes the benefit. The space complexity of the SSV algorithm is linear in the lengthof the time series.

An algebraic framework for temporal attribute characteristics,Michael Böhlen; Johann Gamper; Christian S Jensen,Most real-world database applications manage temporal data; ie; data with associated timereferences that capture a temporal aspect of the data; typically either when the data is validor when the data is known. Such applications abound in; eg; the financial; medical; andscientific domains. In contrast to this; current database management systems offer preciouslylittle built-in query language support for temporal data management. This situation persistsalthough an active temporal database research community has demonstrated thatapplication development can be simplified substantially by built-in temporal support. Thispaper's contribution is motivated by the observation that existing temporal data models andquery languages generally make the same rigid assumption about the semantics of theassociation of data and time; namely that if a subset of the time domain is associated with …,Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence,2006,6

XML for an Electronic Learners' Dictionary.,Johann Gamper; Judith Knapp,ABSTRACT This paper describ es some implementation issues of the electronic learner'sdictionary ELDIT; focusing on the use of XML as uniform data representation language. Thedictionary is part of a web-based; adaptive vocabulary acquisition system for the languagesGerman and English and stores a rich set of highly interlinked pieces of information for eachword; such as translations; definitions; collocations; sample sentences; derivations; etc. XMLturned out to be a very powerful data modeling and representation language for suchcomplex; semi-structured data sets as the ELDIT dictionary entries. We argue that XMLprovides several advantages over other languages and systems; which are of particularimportance during a prototyping phase.,ICWI,2002,6
Formalizing reasoning about change: A temporal diagnosis approach,Johann Gamper; Wolfgang Nejdl,Abstract In this paper we describe a framework for reasoning about temporal explanationproblems; which is based on our previous work on model-based diagnosis of dynamicsystems. We use an explicit representation of qualitative temporal information whichprovides a simpler and more natural representation than the situation calculus. We showhow to generate more specific explanations by instantiating explanations and assuming anOpen World Assumption. We argue that a framework for reasoning about action should beable to deal with concurrent and durative actions and show how they can be represented inour system.,Congress of the Italian Association for Artificial Intelligence,1995,6
Proposing Measurements in Dynamic Systems.,Johann Gamper; Wolfgang Nejdl,Abstract Proposing measurements in diagnosis systems for static systems is a wellunderstood task. Usually; entropy based approaches are used; sometimes extended by costand other considerations. How to do the same task in dynamic systems is less clear; and sofar measurement proposal algorithms have been ignored in the recent approachesadvanced for dynamic systems. In this paper we will describe a set of techniques andalgorithms suitable for measurement proposal in a temporal diagnosis formalism discussedin our previous work. This formalism is based on qualitative Allen constraints. The currentpaper introduces a measurement proposal algorithm and improves it in several ways. Finallyan entropy-based computation method is described for this temporal setting.,IJCAI (1),1995,6
Qualitative temporal behavior description and temporal diagnosis using interval algebra,Wolfgang Nejdl; Johann Gamper,Abstract As noticed in some recent work; describing and diagnosing temporal behavior andfaults is an important; but complex task.

Fast sampling-based whole-genome haplotype block recognition,Daniel Taliun; Johann Gamper; Ulf Leser; Cristian Pattaro,Scaling linkage disequilibrium (LD) based haplotype block recognition to the entire humangenome has always been a challenge. The best-known algorithm has quadratic runtimecomplexity and; even when sophisticated search space pruning is applied; still requiresseveral days of computations. Here; we propose a novel sampling-based algorithm; called S-MIG $^{++} $; where the main idea is to estimate the area that most likely contains allhaplotype blocks by sampling a very small number of SNP pairs. A subsequent refinementstep computes the exact blocks by considering only the SNP pairs within the estimated area.This approach significantly reduces the number of computed LD statistics; making therecognition of haplotype blocks very fast. We theoretically and empirically prove that thearea containing all haplotype blocks can be estimated with a very high degree of certainty …,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,2016,5
Alternative routing: k-shortest paths with limited overlap,Theodoros Chondrogiannis; Panagiotis Bouros; Johann Gamper; Ulf Leser,Abstract Shortest path computation is a fundamental problem in road networks withapplication in various domains in research and industry. However; returning only theshortest path is often not satisfying; users are also interested in alternative paths which mightbe longer but have other advantages; eg; less frequent traffic congestion. In this paper; weformally introduce the k-Shortest Paths with Limited Overlap (k-SPwLO) problem seeking torecommend k alternative paths which are (a) as short as possible and (b) sufficientlydissimilar based on a user-controlled similarity threshold. We propose two algorithms thatexamine the paths from a source s to a target t in increasing order of their length andprogressively construct the result set. The baseline algorithm BSL builds upon a standardalgorithm for computing k-Shortest Paths; followed by a filter step.

Efficient event pattern matching with match windows,Bruno Cadonna; Johann Gamper; Michael H Böhlen,Abstract In event pattern matching a sequence of input events is matched against a complexquery pattern that specifies constraints on extent; order; values; and quantification ofmatching events. In this paper we propose a general pattern matching strategy that consistsof a pre-processing step and a pattern matching step. Instead of eagerly matching incomingevents; the pre-processing step buffers events in a match window to apply different pruningtechniques (filtering; partitioning; and testing for necessary match conditions). In the secondstep; an event pattern matching algorithm; A; is called only for match windows that satisfy thenecessary match conditions. This two-phase strategy with a lazy call of the matchingalgorithm significantly reduces the number of events that need to be processed by A as wellas the number of calls to A. This is important since pattern matching algorithms tend to be …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2012,5
Reuse of Lexicographic Examples in a Web-based Learners' Dictionary,Judith Knapp; Johann Gamper; Peter Brusilovsky,Abstract Content creation for a language learning system is a time-consuming; laborious;and expensive task. It is therefore desirable to reuse content as much as possible in differentlearning situation. An important part of content is the illustrative content; ie examplesentences. Such examples show a typical context in which a given rule can be used. Wediscuss a solution to reuse illustrative content in a Web-based learners' dictionary for theGerman and Italian languages. We explore fully the potential of hypertext; which allowsbuilding complex networks of small pieces of learning material. Natural languageprocessing techniques are applied to facilitate the reuse of the manually created content.Our approach can be combined with other; more classical initiatives for sharing and reusinglearning material. A first evaluation shows promising results.,E-Learn: World Conference on E-Learning in Corporate; Government; Healthcare; and Higher Education,2004,5

Exact computation of graph edit distance for uniform and non-uniform metric edit costs,David B Blumenthal; Johann Gamper,Abstract The graph edit distance is a well-established and widely used distance measure forlabelled; undirected graphs. However; since its exact computation is NP NP-hard; researchhas mainly focused on devising approximative heuristics and only few exact algorithms havebeen proposed. The standard approach A^ ⋆ A⋆-GED GED; a node-based best-first searchthat works for both uniform and non-uniform metric edit costs; suffers from huge runtime andmemory requirements. Recently; two better performing algorithms have been proposed: DFDF-GED GED; a node-based depth-first search that works for uniform and non-uniformmetric edit costs; and CSI\_GED CSI _ GED; an edge-based depth-first search that worksonly for uniform edit costs. Our paper contains two contributions: First; we propose a speed-up DF DF-GED^ u GED u of DF DF-GED GED for uniform edit costs.

Sequenced spatiotemporal aggregation for coarse query granularities,Igor Timko; Michael Böhlen; Johann Gamper,Abstract Sequenced spatiotemporal aggregation (SSTA) is an important query for manyapplications of spatiotemporal databases; such as traffic analysis. Conceptually; an SSTAquery returns one aggregate value for each individual spatiotemporal granule. While thedata is typically recorded at a fine granularity; at query time a coarser granularity is common.This calls for efficient evaluation strategies that are granularity aware. In this paper; weformally define an SSTA operator that includes a data-to-query granularity conversion.Based on a discrete time model and a discrete 1.5 dimensional space model; we generalizethe concept of time constant intervals to constant rectangles; which represent maximalrectangles in the spatiotemporal domain over which an aggregation result is constant.

Individualized hiking time estimation,Arthur Pitman; Markus Zanker; Johann Gamper; Periklis Andritsos,Route planning algorithms attempt to find the optimum path between two nodes in a graph;where a cost function specifies a weight for each edge. In many situations cost is related todistance or time. While time estimates are rather straightforward for automotive applications;real-world route planning for hiking and other outdoor activities requires carefulconsideration of a variety of different factors in order to produce reliable time estimates.Static estimates such as Naismith's Rule for estimating hike times do not consider individualfactors such as a hiker's fitness or current progress along the trail. In this paper we addressthese aspects and develop a model for individual weight estimation that can be exploited inroute planning applications. An evaluation conducted on GPS traces from hikes in SouthTyrol; Italy indicates that the model can outperform Naismith's estimate by up to 23%.,Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA); 2012 23rd International Workshop on,2012,3
Representing public transport schedules as repeating trips,Romans Kasperovics; Michael H Böehlen; Johann Gamper,The movement in public transport networks is organized according to schedules. The real-world schedules are specified by a set of periodic rules and a number of irregularities fromthese rules. The irregularities appear as cancelled trips or additional trips on specialoccasions such as public holidays; strikes; cultural events; etc. Under such conditions; it is achallenging problem to capture real-world schedules in a concise way. This paper presentsa practical approach for modelling real-world public transport schedules. We propose a newdata structure; called repeating trip; that combines route information and the schedule at thestarting station of the route; the schedules at other stations can be inferred. We defineschedules as semi-periodic temporal repetitions; and store them as pairs of rules andexceptions. Both parts are represented in a tree structure; termed multislice; which can …,Temporal Representation and Reasoning; 2008. TIME'08. 15th International Symposium on,2008,3

Extending the kernel of a relational dbms with comprehensive support for sequenced temporal queries,Anton Dignös; Michael H Böhlen; Johann Gamper; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Many databases contain temporal; or time-referenced; data and use intervals tocapture the temporal aspect. While SQL-based database management systems (DBMSs)are capable of supporting the management of interval data; the support they offer can beimproved considerably. A range of proposed temporal data models and query languagesoffer ample evidence to this effect. Natural queries that are very difficult to formulate in SQLare easy to formulate in these temporal query languages. The increased focus on analyticsover historical data where queries are generally more complex exacerbates the difficultiesand thus the potential benefits of a temporal query language. Commercial DBMSs haverecently started to offer limited temporal functionality in a step-by-step manner; focusing onthe representation of intervals and neglecting the implementation of the query evaluation …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2016,2
ParDiSP: A partition-based framework for distance and shortest path queries on road networks,Theodoros Chondrogiannis; Johann Gamper,To process shortest path and distance queries on road networks; various preprocessingtechniques have been proposed. State-of-the-art methods for distance queries offer superiorquery time but do not provide any efficient retrieval mechanism for the shortest path. Incontrast; state-of-the-art methods for shortest path queries show relatively poor performancefor distance queries. In this paper; we propose a Partition-based framework for Distance andShortest Path queries (ParDiSP); which efficiently supports both types of queries. Afterpartitioning a road network into components; ParDiSP precomputes the distances betweenany node in a component and the border nodes of the same component; the pair wisedistances between all border nodes; and the union of the shortest paths between all bordernodes.

Exploring Graph Partitioning for Shortest Path Queries on Road Networks.,Theodoros Chondrogiannis; Johann Gamper,ABSTRACT Computing the shortest path between two locations in a road network is animportant problem that has found numerous applications. The classic solution for theproblem is Dijkstra's algorithm [1]. Although simple and elegant; the algorithm has proven tobe inefficient for very large road networks. To address this deficiency of Dijkstra's algorithm;a plethora of techniques that introduce some preprocessing to reduce the query time havebeen proposed. In this paper; we propose Partition-based Shortcuts (PbS); a techniquebased on graph-partitioning which offers fast query processing and supports efficient edgeweight updates. We present a shortcut computation scheme; which exploits the traits of agraph partition. We also present a modified version of the bidirectional search [2]; whichuses the precomputed shortcuts to efficiently answer shortest path queries. Moreover; we …,Grundlagen von Datenbanken,2014,2
Missing value imputation in time series using Top-k case matching,Kevin Wellenzohn; Hannes Mitterer; Johann Gamper; Michael H Böhlen; Mourad Khayati,In this paper; we present a simple yet effective algorithm; called the Top-k Case Matchingalgorithm; for the imputation of missing values in streams of time series data that are similarto each other. The key idea of the algorithm is to look for the k situations in the historical datathat are most similar to the current situation and to derive the missing value from themeasured values at these k time points. To efficiently identify the top-k most similar historicalsituations; we adopt Fagin's Threshold Algorithm; yielding an algorithm with sub-linearruntime complexity with high probability; and linear complexity in the worst case (excludingthe initial sorting of the data; which is done only once). We provide the results of a firstexperimental evaluation using real-world meteorological data.

SQL-based temporal query languages,Michael Böhlen; Johann Gamper; Christian S Jensen; Richard T Snodgrass,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}. A query Q is called domain independent if the value of Qwhen applied to any database is the same for any two domains containing the databasevalues or; equivalently; if the value of Q when applied to a database contains only values …,*,2009,2
Towards General Temporal Aggregation,Michael H Böhlen; Johann Gamper; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Most database applications manage time-referenced; or temporal; data. Temporaldata management is difficult when using conventional database technology; and manycontributions have been made for how to better model; store; and query temporal data.Temporal aggregation illustrates well the problems associated with the management oftemporal data. Indeed; temporal aggregation is complex and among the most difficult; andthus interesting; temporal functionality to support.

A greedy approach towards parsimonious temporal aggregation,Juozas Gordevicius; Johann Gamper; Michael Böhlen,Temporal aggregation is a crucial operator in temporal databases and has been studied invarious flavors. In instant temporal aggregation (ITA) the aggregate value at time instant t iscomputed from the tuples that hold at t. ITA considers the distribution of the input data andworks at the smallest time granularity; but the result size depends on the input timestampsand can get twice as large as the input relation. In span temporal aggregation (STA) the userspecifies the timestamps over which the aggregates are computed and thus controls theresult size. In this paper we introduce a new temporal aggregation operator; called greedyparsimonious temporal aggregation (gPTA); which combines features from ITA and STA.The operator extends and approximates ITA by greedily merging adjacent tuples with similaraggregate values until the number of result tuples is sufficiently small; which can be …,Temporal Representation and Reasoning; 2008.

A scalable dynamic programming scheme for the computation of optimal k-segments for ordered data,Giovanni Mahlknecht; Anton Dignös; Johann Gamper,Abstract The optimal k-segments of an ordered dataset of size n consists of k tuples that areobtained by merging consecutive tuples such that a given error metric is minimized. Theproblem is general and has been studied in various flavors; eg; piecewise-constantapproximation; parsimonious temporal aggregation; and v-optimal histograms. A well-knowncomputation scheme for the optimal k-segments is based on dynamic programming; whichcomputes ak× n error matrix E and a corresponding split point matrix J of the same size. Thisyields O (n· k) space and O (n 2· k) runtime complexity. In this paper; we propose threeoptimization techniques for the runtime complexity and one for the space complexity. First;diagonal pruning identifies regions of the error matrix E that need not to be computed sincethey cannot lead to a valid solution. Second; for those cells in E that are computed; we …,Information Systems,2017,1
Computing Isochrones in Multimodal Spatial Networks using Tile Regions,Nikolaus Krismer; Doris Silbernagl; Günther Specht; Johann Gamper,Abstract This paper describes a new method to compute isochrones in multimodal spatialnetworks; which aims at finding a good trade-off between memory usage and runtime. In thepast; approaches based on Dijkstra's algorithm have been proposed. For small networks;the entire network is first loaded in main memory; where the network is expanded todetermine the isochrone. For large networks that do not fit in main memory; approaches thatload the network vertex-by-vertex during the expansion phase have been proposed. Theykeep the memory footprint minimal; but have to query the database for each node in theisochrone; which can be very time consuming. The method presented in this paper uses tiles(which are well known from interactive online maps) to realize chunk-loading of vertices byutilizing so-called tile regions. This approach significantly reduces the number of …,Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2017,1
Correcting and speeding-up bounds for non-uniform graph edit distance,David B Blumenthal; Johann Gamper,The problem of deriving lower and upper bounds for the edit distance between labelledundirected graphs has recently received increasing attention. However; only one algorithmhas been proposed that allegedly computes not only an upper but also a lower bound fornon-uniform metric edit costs and incorporates information about both node and edgelabels. In this paper; we show that this algorithm is incorrect in the sense that; in general; itdoes not compute a lower bound. We present BRANCH; a corrected version of the algorithmthat runs in O (n 5) time. We also develop a speed-up BRANCHFAST that runs in O (n 4)time and computes a lower bound; which is only slightly less accurate than the onecomputed by BRANCH.

Efficient computation of parsimonious temporal aggregation,Giovanni Mahlknecht; Anton Dignös; Johann Gamper,Abstract Parsimonious temporal aggregation (PTA) has been introduced to overcomelimitations of previous temporal aggregation operators; namely to provide a concise yet datasensitive summary of temporal data. The basic idea of PTA is to first compute instanttemporal aggregation (ITA) as an intermediate result and then to merge similar adjacenttuples in order to reduce the final result size. The best known algorithm to compute a correctPTA result is based on dynamic programming (DP) and requires O (n^ 2) O (n 2) space tostore a so-called split point matrix; where n is the size of the intermediate data. The matrixstores the split points between which the intermediate tuples are merged. In this paper; wepropose two optimizations of the DP algorithm for PTA queries.

Incremental Calculation of Isochrones Regarding Duration.,Nikolaus Krismer; Günther Specht; Johann Gamper,ABSTRACT An isochrone in a spatial network is the minimal; possibly disconnectedsubgraph that covers all locations from where a query point is reachable within a given timespan and by a given arrival time [5]. A novel approach for computing isochrones inmultimodal spatial networks is presented in this paper. The basic idea of this incrementalcalculation is to reuse already computed isochrones when a new request with the samequery point is sent; but with different duration. Some of the major challenges of the newcalculation attempt are described and solutions to the most problematic ones are outlined onbasis of the already established MINE and MINEX algorithms. The development of theincremental calculation is done by using six different cases of computation. Three of themapply to the MINEX algorithm; which uses a vertex expiration mechanism; and three …,Grundlagen von Datenbanken,2014,1
Scalable centroid decomposition,Mourad Khayati; Michael Böhlen; Johann Gamper,Abstract Real world applications that deal with time series data often rely on matrixdecomposition techniques; such as the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The CentroidDecomposition (CD) approximates the Singular Value Decomposition; but does not scale tolong time series because of the quadratic space complexity of the sign vector computation.In this report; we propose a greedy algorithm; termed Scalable Sign Vector (SSV); toefficiently determine sign vectors for CD applications with long time series; ie; where thenumber of rows (observations) is much larger than the number of columns (time series). TheSSV algorithm starts with a sign vector consisting of only 1s and iteratively changes the signof the element that maximizes the benefit. The space complexity of the SSV algorithm islinear in the length of the time series. We provide proofs for the scalability; the termination …,*,2013,1
The address connector: noninvasive synchronization of hierarchical data sources,Nikolaus Augsten; Michael Böhlen; Johann Gamper,Abstract Different databases often store information about the same or related objects in thereal world. To enable collaboration between these databases; data items that refer to thesame object must be identified. Residential addresses are data of particular interest as theyoften provide the only link between related pieces of information in different databases.Unfortunately; residential addresses that describe the same location might vary considerablyand hence need to be synchronized. Non-matching street names and addresses stored atdifferent levels of granularity make address synchronization a challenging task.

Similarity of chemotherapy histories based on imputed values,Mourad Khayati; Jay Martin Anderson; Michael H Böhlen; Johann Gamper; Manfred Mitterer,The comparison of time series of multivariate data is a long-standing problem in manyapplications in the clinical domain. We propose two approaches to retrieve from a hospitaldata warehouse the k patients P 1;…; Pn with a chemotherapy history that is most similar topatient Q: the first is based on warping distance; together with an initial alignment usingimputed values. The second is based on the volume of the Kiviat tube. In implementing theEuclidean distance; we investigate the addition of null events to achieve similar cardinality;and dynamic time warping; a widely-used technique in the comparison of time series data.The investigations are based on a real world clinical database.,International Journal of Medical Engineering and Informatics,2012,1
θ‐Constrained multi-dimensional aggregation,Michael Akinde; Michael H Böhlen; Damianos Chatziantoniou; Johann Gamper,Abstract The SQL: 2003 standard introduced window functions to enhance the analyticalprocessing capabilities of SQL. The key concept of window functions is to sort the inputrelation and to compute the aggregate results during a scan of the sorted relation. For multi-dimensional OLAP queries with aggregation groups defined by a general θ condition anappropriate ordering does not exist; though; and hence expensive join-based solutions arerequired. In this paper we introduce θ‐constrained multi-dimensional aggregation (θ‐MDA);which supports multi-dimensional OLAP queries with aggregation groups defined byinequalities. θ‐MDA is not based on an ordering of the data relation. Instead; the tuples thatshall be considered for computing an aggregate value can be determined by a general θcondition. This facilitates the formulation of complex queries; such as multi-dimensional …,Information Systems,2011,1
Ranking of evolving stories through meta-aggregation,Juozas Gordevicius; Francisco J Estrada; Hyun Chul Lee; Periklis Andritsos; Johann Gamper,Abstract In this paper we focus on the problem of ranking news stories within their historicalcontext by exploiting their content similarity. We observe that news stories evolve and thushave to be ranked in a time and query dependent manner. We do this in two steps. First; themining step discovers metastories; which constitute meaningful groups of similar stories thatoccur at arbitrary points in time. Second; the ranking step uses well known measures ofcontent similarity to construct implicit links among all metastories; and uses them to rankthose metastories that overlap the time interval provided in a user query. We use real datafrom conventional and social media sources (weblogs) to study the impact of different meta-aggregation techniques and similarity measures in the final ranking. We evaluate theframework using both objective and subjective criteria; and discuss the selection of …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,1
Evaluating exceptions on time slices,Romans Kasperovics; Michael H Böhlen; Johann Gamper,Abstract Public transport schedules contain temporal data with many regular patterns thatcan be represented compactly. Exceptions come as modifications of the initial schedule andbreak the regular patterns increasing the size of the representation. A typical strategy topreserve the compactness of schedules is to keep exceptions separately. This; however;complicates the automated processing of schedules and imposes a more complex model onapplications. In this paper we evaluate exceptions by incorporating them into the patternsthat define schedules. We employ sets of time slices; termed multislices; as a representationformalism for schedules and exceptions. The difference of multislices corresponds to theevaluation of exceptions and produces an updated schedule in terms of a multislice. Wepropose a relational model for multislices; provide an algorithm for efficient evaluating the …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2009,1
Safety and Domain Independence.,Rodney W Topor,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}. A query Q is called domain independent if the value of Qwhen applied to any database is the same for any two domains containing the databasevalues or; equivalently; if the value of Q when applied to a database contains only values …,*,2009,1

The corpus; which contains approximately 5 mio.words; is primarily intended as a resource for (semi-) automatic terminology acquisition. Theguidelines of the Corpus Encoding Standard have been applied for encoding structuralinformation; segmentation information; and sentence alignment. Since the parallel textshave a one-to-one correspondence on the sentence level; building a perfect sentencealignment is rather straightforward. As a result of this the corpus constitutes also a valuabletestbed for the evaluation of alignment algorithms. The paper discusses the intended use …,LREC,2000,1

Improved Lower Bounds for Graph Edit Distance,David B Blumenthal; Johann Gamper,The problem of deriving lower and upper bounds for the edit distance between undirected;labeled graphs has recently received increasing attention. However; only one algorithm hasbeen proposed that allegedly computes not only an upper but also a lower bound for non-uniform edit costs and incorporates information about both node and edge labels. In thispaper; we demonstrate that this algorithm is incorrect.

Sparse Prefix Sums,Michael Shekelyan; Anton Dignös; Johann Gamper,Abstract The prefix sum approach is a powerful technique to answer range-sum queries overmulti-dimensional arrays in constant time by requiring only a few look-ups in an array ofprecomputed prefix sums. In this paper; we propose the sparse prefix sum approach that isbased on relative prefix sums and exploits sparsity in the data to vastly reduce the storagecosts for the prefix sums. The proposed approach has desirable theoretical properties andworks well in practice. It is the first approach achieving constant query time with sub-linearupdate costs and storage costs for range-sum queries over sparse low-dimensional arrays.Experiments on real-world data sets show that the approach reduces storage costs by anorder of magnitude with only a small overhead in query time; thus preserving microsecond-fast query answering.,Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2017,*

DigitHist: a histogram-based data summary with tight error bounds,Michael Shekelyan; Anton Dignös; Johann Gamper,Abstract We propose DigitHist; a histogram summary for selectivity estimation on multi-dimensional data with tight error bounds. By combining multi-dimensional and one-dimensional histograms along regular grids of different resolutions; DigitHist provides anaccurate and reliable histogram approach for multi-dimensional data. To achieve a compactsummary; we use a sparse representation combined with a novel histogram compressiontechnique that chooses a higher resolution in dense regions and a lower resolutionelsewhere. For the construction of DigitHist; we propose a new error measure; termed u-error; which minimizes the width between the guaranteed upper and lower bounds of theselectivity estimate. The construction algorithm performs a single data scan and has lineartime complexity. An in-depth experimental evaluation shows that DigitHist delivers …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,*
VISOR: Visualizing Summaries of Ordered Data,Giovanni Mahlknecht; Michael H Bohlen; Anton Dignös; Johann Gamper,Abstract In this paper; we present the VISOR tool; which helps the user to explore data andtheir summary structures by visualizing the relationships between the size k of a datasummary and the induced error. Given an ordered dataset; VISOR allows to vary the size kof a data summary and to immediately see the effect on the induced error; by visualizing theerror and its dependency on k in an &epsis;-graph and Δ-graph; respectively. The user caneasily explore different values of k and determine the best value for the summary size.VISOR allows also to compare different summarization methods; such as piecewise constantapproximation; piecewise aggregation approximation or V-optimal histograms.

Exact and Approximate Algorithms for Finding k-Shortest Paths with Limited Overlap.,Theodoros Chondrogiannis; Panagiotis Bouros; Johann Gamper; Ulf Leser,ABSTRACT Shortest path computation is a fundamental problem in road networks withvarious applications in research and industry. However; returning only the shortest path isoften not satisfying. Users might also be interested in alternative paths that are slightlylonger but have other desired properties; eg; less frequent traffic congestion. In this paper;we study alternative routing and; in particular; the k-Shortest Paths with Limited Overlap (k-SPwLO) query; which aims at computing paths that are (a) sufficiently dissimilar to eachother; and (b) as short as possible. First; we propose MultiPass; an exact algorithm whichtraverses the network k− 1 times and employs two pruning criteria to reduce the number ofpaths that have to be examined. To achieve better performance and scalability; we alsopropose two approximate algorithms that trade accuracy for efficiency. OnePass+ …,EDBT,2017,*

A Robust Skip-Till-Next-Match Selection Strategy for Event Pattern Matching,Bruno Cadonna; Johann Gamper; Michael H Böhlen,Abstract In event pattern matching; various selection strategies have been proposed toimpose additional constraints on the events that participate in a match. The skip-till-next-match selection strategy is used in scenarios where some incoming events are noise andtherefore should be ignored. Skip-till-next-match is prone to blocking noise; ie; noise thatprevents the detection of matches. In this paper; we propose the robust skip-till-next-matchselection strategy; which is robust against noise and finds matches that are missed by skip-till-next-match when blocking noise occurs in the input stream. To implement the newstrategy in automaton-based pattern matching algorithms; we propose a backtrackingmechanism. Extensive experiments using real-world data and different event patternmatching algorithms show that with skip-till-next-match the number of matches not …,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2014,*

Efficient Evaluation of Ad-Hoc Range Aggregates,Christian Ammendola; Michael H Böhlen; Johann Gamper,Abstract θ-MDA is a flexible and efficient operator for complex ad-hoc multi-dimensionalaggregation queries. It separates the specification of aggregation groups for whichaggregate values are computed (base table b) and the specification of aggregation tuplesfrom which aggregate values are computed. Aggregation tuples are subsets of the detailtable r and are defined by a general θ-condition. The θ-MDA requires one scan of r; duringwhich the aggregates are incrementally updated. In this paper; we propose a two-stepevaluation strategy for θ-MDA to optimize the computation of ad-hoc range aggregates byreducing them to point aggregates. The first step scans r and computes point aggregates asa partial intermediate result x̃; which can be done efficiently. The second step combines thepoint aggregates to the final aggregates. This transformation significantly reduces the …,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2013,*
On the efficient construction of multislices from recurrences,Romans Kasperovics; Michael H Böhlen; Johann Gamper,Abstract Recurrences are defined as sets of time instants associated with events and theyare present in many application domains; including public transport schedules and personalcalendars. Because of their large size; recurrences are rarely stored explicitly; but some formof compact representation is used. Multislices are a compact representation that is wellsuited for storage in relational databases. A multislice is a set of time slices where each sliceemploys a hierarchy of time granularities to compactly represent multiple recurrences. In thispaper we investigate the construction of multislices from recurrences. We define thecompression ratio of a multislice; show that different construction strategies producemultislices with different compression ratios; and prove that the construction of minimalmultislices; ie; multislices with a maximal compression ratio; is an NP-hard problem.

MIRIS contains both legal documents as well as factualknowledge and provides a coherent presentation with powerful query capabilities includingcontentbased search. We adopt a knowledge-based approach; heavily relying on the use ofontologies and metadata. An ontology will be used to annotate the documents with contents;to expand queries; and to provide different views on the information. Various possibilities toaccess the information system will be provided; from a focused search for specificinformation and documents up to the generation of reports to a certain topic.

Towards a Semantic Portal for Minority Rights in Europe,Johann Gamper; Paolo Dongilli,Due to a new sensibility towards minority questions; the documentation and easy availabilityof data on ethnic; national; and linguistic minorities is increasingly significant. Whiledocuments of international organisations are mostly available on the Web; the gathering ofextensive information on the legal standards in different countries; such as nationallegislation or case-law; is still a difficult task. The existing databases are either limited to afew countries (eg MINELRES and CEDIME-SE) or they only cover a few topics (egMercator). Furthermore; those databases are mostly unstructured; basically providing asimple list of documents without being organized by keywords or topics. Thus; a quicksearch or a comparison between different countries is often difficult.,*,*,*

Reasoning Over Description Logic Ontologies under non-standard Assumptions,Yazmín Angélica Ibáñez García,Abstract The use of description logics (DLs) ontologies to provide a formal and general-purpose conceptual model of a domain of interest has become a popular choice due to theincreasing need to add a semantic dimension to information processing. In that context;ontologies constitute an ideal tool to provide a conceptualization of the domain of interest inareas such as Enterprise Application Integration; Data Integration; and the Semantic Web.Nevertheless; conceptual models are still usually designed in some class-based languagesuch as UML diagrams or ER schemata because of their intuitive and user-friendly interface.The downside of using graphical languages is; however; the lack of formal semantics.Formalizing the semantics of conceptual modeling languages in DLs has the advantage ofkeeping the graphic interface for modeling; while providing reasoning capabilities that aid …,*,*,*

The term is borrowed fromphilosophy; where an Ontology is a systematic account of existence. For computerprograms; what “exists” is that which can be represented. An ontology provides a particular viewof some part of the world by specifying the concepts and relationships between theconcepts. This set of concepts and the describable relationships among them are reflected inthe vocabulary used to denote both concepts and relationships. Thus; an ontology defines theshared vocabulary which can be used to communicate between computer programs.
