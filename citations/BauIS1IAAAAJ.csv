Database architecture optimized for the new bottleneck: Memory access,Peter A Boncz; Stefan Manegold; Martin L Kersten,Abstract In the past decade; advances in speed of commodity CPUs have far out-pacedadvances in memory latency. Main-memory access is therefore increasingly a performancebottleneck for many computer applications; including database systems. In this article; weuse a simple scan test to show the severe impact of this bottleneck. The insights gained aretranslated into guidelines for database architecture; in terms of both data structures andalgorithms. We discuss how vertically fragmented data structures optimize cacheperformance on sequential data access. We then focus on equi-join; typically a random-access operation; and introduce radix algorithms for partitioned hash-join. The performanceof these algorithms is quantified using a detailed analytical model that incorporates memoryaccess cost.

MonetDB/XQuery: a fast XQuery processor powered by a relational engine,Peter Boncz; Torsten Grust; Maurice Van Keulen; Stefan Manegold; Jan Rittinger; Jens Teubner,Abstract Relational XQuery systems try to re-use mature relational data managementinfrastructures to create fast and scalable XML database technology. This paper describesthe main features; key contributions; and lessons learned while implementing such asystem. Its architecture consists of (i) a range-based encoding of XML documents intorelational tables;(ii) a compilation technique that translates XQuery into a basic relationalalgebra;(iii) a restricted (order) property-aware peephole relational query optimizationstrategy; and (iv) a mapping from XML update statements into relational updates. Thus; thissystem implements all essential XML database functionalities (rather than a single feature)such that we can learn from the full consequences of our architectural decisions.

Database Cracking.,Stratos Idreos; Martin L Kersten; Stefan Manegold,ABSTRACT Database indices provide a non-discriminative navigational infrastructure tolocalize tuples of interest. Their maintenance cost is taken during database updates. In thispaper; we study the complementary approach; addressing index maintenance as part ofquery processing using continuous physical reorganization; ie; cracking the database intomanageable pieces. The motivation is that by automatically organizing data the way usersrequest it; we can achieve fast access and the much desired self-organized behavior. Wepresent the first mature cracking architecture and report on our implementation of cracking inthe context of a full fledged relational system. It led to a minor enhancement to its relationalalgebra kernel; such that cracking could be piggy-backed without incurring too muchprocessing overhead. Furthermore; we illustrate the ripple effect of dynamic …,CIDR,2007,242
Column-store support for RDF data management: not all swans are white,Lefteris Sidirourgos; Romulo Goncalves; Martin Kersten; Niels Nes; Stefan Manegold,Abstract This paper reports on the results of an independent evaluation of the techniquespresented in the VLDB 2007 paper" Scalable Semantic Web Data Management UsingVertical Partitioning"; authored by D.

Breaking the memory wall in MonetDB,Peter A Boncz; Martin L Kersten; Stefan Manegold,Abstract In the past decades; advances in speed of commodity CPUs have far outpacedadvances in RAM latency. Main-memory access has therefore become a performancebottleneck for many computer applications; a phenomenon that is widely known as the"memory wall." In this paper; we report how research around the MonetDB database systemhas led to a redesign of database architecture in order to take advantage of modernhardware; and in particular to avoid hitting the memory wall. This encompasses (i) aredesign of the query execution model to better exploit pipelined CPU architectures andCPU instruction caches;(ii) the use of columnar rather than row-wise data storage to betterexploit CPU data caches;(iii) the design of new cache-conscious query processingalgorithms; and (iv) the design and automatic calibration of memory cost models to …,Communications of the ACM,2008,217

Optimizing main-memory join on modern hardware,Stefan Manegold; Peter Boncz; Martin Kersten,In the past decade; the exponential growth in commodity CPU's speed has far outpacedadvances in memory latency. A second trend is that CPU performance advances are notonly brought by increased clock rates; but also by increasing parallelism inside the CPU.Current database systems have not yet adapted to these trends and show poor utilization ofboth CPU and memory resources on current hardware. In this paper; we show how theseresources can be optimized for large joins and translate these insights into guidelines forfuture database architectures; encompassing data structures; algorithms; cost modeling andimplementation. In particular; we discuss how vertically fragmented data structures optimizecache performance on sequential data access. On the algorithmic side; we refine thepartitioned hash-join with a new partitioning algorithm called" radix-cluster"; which is …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2002,167

Self-organizing tuple reconstruction in column-stores,Stratos Idreos; Martin L Kersten; Stefan Manegold,Abstract Column-stores gained popularity as a promising physical design alternative. Eachattribute of a relation is physically stored as a separate column allowing queries to load onlythe required attributes. The overhead incurred is on-the-fly tuple reconstruction for multi-attribute queries. Each tuple reconstruction is a join of two columns based on tuple IDs;making it a significant cost component. The ultimate physical design is to have multiplepresorted copies of each base table such that tuples are already appropriately organized inmultiple different orders across the various columns. This requires the ability to predict theworkload; idle time to prepare; and infrequent updates. In this paper; we propose a noveldesign; partial sideways cracking; that minimizes the tuple reconstruction cost in a self-organizing way. It achieves performance similar to using presorted data; but without …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,151

Generic database cost models for hierarchical memory systems,Stefan Manegold; Peter Boncz; Martin L Kersten,This chapter proposes a generic technique to create accurate cost functions for databaseoperations. Accurate prediction of operator execution time is a prerequisite for databasequery optimization. Although extensively studied for conventional disk-based DBMSs; costmodeling in main memory DBMSs is still an open issue. Recent database research hasdemonstrated that memory access is more and more becoming a significant—if not themajor—cost component of database operations. If used properly; fast but small cachememories—usually organized in cascading hierarchy between CPU and main memory—can help to reduce memory access costs. However; they make the cost estimation problemmore complex. Database cost models provide the foundation for query optimizers to derivean efficient execution plan. Such models consist of two parts; a logical and a physical …,*,2002,140
Merging what's cracked; cracking what's merged: adaptive indexing in main-memory column-stores,Stratos Idreos; Stefan Manegold; Harumi Kuno; Goetz Graefe,Abstract Adaptive indexing is characterized by the partial creation and refinement of theindex as side effects of query execution. Dynamic or shifting workloads may benefit frompreliminary index structures focused on the columns and specific key ranges actuallyqueried---without incurring the cost of full index construction. The costs and benefits ofadaptive indexing techniques should therefore be compared in terms of initialization costs;the overhead imposed upon queries; and the rate at which the index converges to a statethat is fully-refined for a particular workload component. Based on an examination ofdatabase cracking and adaptive merging; which are two techniques for adaptive indexing;we seek a hybrid technique that has a low initialization cost and also converges rapidly.

Hardware-oblivious parallelism for in-memory column-stores,Max Heimel; Michael Saecker; Holger Pirk; Stefan Manegold; Volker Markl,Abstract The multi-core architectures of today's computer systems make parallelism anecessity for performance critical applications. Writing such applications in a generic;hardware-oblivious manner is a challenging problem: Current database systems thus relyon labor-intensive and error-prone manual tuning to exploit the full potential of modernparallel hardware architectures like multi-core CPUs and graphics cards. We propose analternative design for a parallel database engine; based on a single set of hardware-oblivious operators; which are compiled down to the actual hardware at runtime. This designreduces the development overhead for parallel database engines; while achievingcompetitive performance to hand-tuned systems. We provide a proof-of-concept for thisdesign by integrating operators written using the parallel programming framework …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,85
The researcher’s guide to the data deluge: Querying a scientific database in just a few seconds,Martin L Kersten; Stratos Idreos; Stefan Manegold; Erietta Liarou,ABSTRACT There is a clear need for interactive exploration of extremely large databases;especially in the area of scientific data management where ingestion of multiple Terabyteson a daily basis is foreseen. Unfortunately; current data management technology is not well-suited for such overwhelming demands. In light of these challenges; we should rethink someof the strict requirements database systems adopted in the past. We envision that nextgeneration database systems should interpret queries by their intent; rather than as acontract carved in stone for complete and correct answers. The result set should aid the userin understanding the database's content and provide guidance to continue the dataexploration journey. A scientist can stepwise explore deeper and deeper into the database;and stop when the result content and quality reaches his satisfaction point. At the same …,PVLDB Challenges and Visions,2011,85
Updating a cracked database,Stratos Idreos; Martin L Kersten; Stefan Manegold,Abstract A cracked database is a datastore continuously reorganized based on operationsbeing executed. For each query; the data of interest is physically reclustered to speed-upfuture access to the same; overlapping or even disjoint data. This way; a cracking DBMS self-organizes and adapts itself to the workload. So far; cracking has been considered for staticdatabases only. In this paper; we introduce several novel algorithms for high-volumeinsertions; deletions and updates against a cracked database. We show that the niceperformance properties of a cracked database can be maintained in a dynamic environmentwhere updates interleave with queries. Our algorithms comply with the cracking philosophy;ie; a table is informed on pending insertions and deletions; but only when the relevant datais needed for query processing just enough pending update actions are applied.,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,79

Slot index spatial join,Nikos Mamoulis; Dimitris Papadias,Efficient processing of spatial joins is very important due to their high cost and frequentapplication in spatial databases and other areas involving multidimensional data. This paperproposes slot index spatial join (SISJ); an algorithm that joins a nonindexed data set withone indexed by an R-tree. We explore two optimization techniques that reduce the spacerequirements and the computational cost of SISJ and we compare it; analytically andexperimentally; with other spatial join methods for two cases: 1) when the nonindexed inputis read from disk and 2) when it is an intermediate result of a preceding database operator ina complex query plan. The importance of buffer splitting between consecutive join operatorsis also demonstrated through a two-join case study and a method that estimates the optimalsplitting is proposed. Our evaluation shows that SISJ outperforms alternative methods in …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2003,61
Pathfinder: XQuery---the relational way,Peter Boncz; Torsten Grust; Maurice van Keulen; Stefan Manegold; Jan Rittinger; Jens Teubner,Abstract Relational query processors are probably the best understood (as well as the bestengineered) query engines available today. Although carefully tuned to process instances ofthe relational model (tables of tuples); these processors can also provide a foundation forthe evaluation of" alien"(non-relational) query languages: if a relational encoding of the aliendata model and its associated query language is given; the RDBMS may act like a special-purpose processor for the new language.,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,57
Data vaults: a symbiosis between database technology and scientific file repositories,Milena Ivanova; Martin Kersten; Stefan Manegold,Abstract In this short paper we outline the data vault; a database-attached external filerepository. It provides a true symbiosis between a DBMS and existing file-basedrepositories. Data is kept in its original format while scalable processing functionality isprovided through the DBMS facilities. In particular; it provides transparent access to all datakept in the repository through an (array-based) query language using the file-type specificscientific libraries. The design space for data vaults is characterized by requirements comingfrom various fields. We present a reference architecture for their realization in (commercial)DBMSs and a concrete implementation in MonetDB for remote sensing data geared atcontent-based image retrieval.,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2012,52
Cracking the database store,Martin L Kersten; Stefan Manegold,Abstract Query performance strongly depends on finding an execution plan that touches asfew superfluous tuples as possible. The access structures deployed for this purpose;however; are non-discriminative. They assume every subset of the domain being indexed isequally important; and their structures cause a high maintenance overhead during updates.This approach often fails in decision support or scientific environments where indexselection represents a weak compromise amongst many plausible plans. An alternativeroute; explored here; is to continuously adapt the database organization by makingreorganization an integral part of the query evaluation process. Every query is first analyzedfor its contribution to break the database into multiple pieces; such that both the requiredsubset is easily retrieved and subsequent queries may benefit from the new partitioning …,CIDR,2005,47
Cache-conscious radix-decluster projections,Stefan Manegold; Peter Boncz; Niels Nes; Martin Kersten,Abstract As CPUs become more powerful with Moore's law and memory latencies stayconstant; the impact of the memory access performance bottleneck continues to grow onrelational operators like join; which can exhibit random access on a memory region largerthan the hardware caches. While cache-conscious variants for various relational algorithmshave been described; previous work has mostly ignored (the cost of) projection columns.However; real-life joins almost always come with projections; such that proper projectioncolumn manipulation should be an integral part of any generic join algorithm. In this paper;we analyze cache-conscious hash-join algorithms including projections on two storageschemes: N-ary Storage Model (NSM) and Decomposition Storage Model (DSM). It turnsout; that the strategy of first executing the join and only afterwards dealing with the …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,47
Accelerating Foreign-Key Joins using Asymmetric Memory Channels.,Holger Pirk; Stefan Manegold; Martin L Kersten,ABSTRACT Indexed Foreign-Key Joins expose a very asymmetric access pattern: theForeign-Key Index is sequentially scanned whilst the Primary-Key table is target of manyquasi-random lookups which is the dominant cost factor. To reduce the costs of the randomlookups the fact-table can be (re-) partitioned at runtime to increase access locality on thedimension table; and thus limit the random memory access to inside the CPU's cache.However; this is very hard to optimize and the performance impact on recent architectures islimited because the partitioning costs consume most of the achievable join improvement [3].GPGPUs on the other hand have an architecture that is well suited for this operation: arelatively slow connection to the large system memory and a very fast connection to thesmaller internal device memory. We show how to accelerate Foreign-Key Joins by …,ADMS@ VLDB,2011,42
Understanding sources of ineffciency in general-purpose chips,Rehan Hameed; Wajahat Qadeer; Megan Wachs; Omid Azizi; Alex Solomatnikov; Benjamin C Lee; Stephen Richardson; Christos Kozyrakis; Mark Horowitz,Abstract Scaling the performance of a power limited processor requires decreasing theenergy expended per instruction executed; since energy/op* op/second is power. To betterunderstand what improvement in processor efficiency is possible; and what must be done tocapture it; we quantify the sources of the performance and energy overheads of a 720p HDH. 264 encoder running on a general-purpose four-processor CMP system. The initialoverheads are large: the CMP was 500 x less energy efficient than an Application SpecificIntegrated Circuit (ASIC) doing the same job. We explore methods to eliminate theseoverheads by transforming the CPU into a specialized system for H. 264 encoding. Broadlyapplicable optimizations like single instruction; multiple data (SIMD) units improve CMPperformance by 14 x and energy by 10x; which is still 50x worse than an ASIC.

Concurrency control for adaptive indexing,Goetz Graefe; Felix Halim; Stratos Idreos; Harumi Kuno; Stefan Manegold,Abstract Adaptive indexing initializes and optimizes indexes incrementally; as a side effect ofquery processing. The goal is to achieve the benefits of indexes while hiding or minimizingthe costs of index creation. However; index-optimizing side effects seem to turn read-onlyqueries into update transactions that might; for example; create lock contention. This paperstudies concurrency control in the context of adaptive indexing. We show that the design andimplementation of adaptive indexing rigorously separates index structures from indexcontents; this relaxes the constraints and requirements during adaptive indexing comparedto those of traditional index updates. Our design adapts to the fact that an adaptive index isrefined continuously; and exploits any concurrency opportunities in a dynamic way.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,38

Understanding; modeling; and improving main-memory database performance,Stefan Manegold,Databases have not only become essential to business and science; but also begin toappear more and more in everyday life. Classically; databases are used to maintain internalbusiness data about employees; clients; accounting; stock; and manufacturing processes.Furthermore; companies nowadays use them to present data to customers and clients on theWorld-Wide-Web. In science; databases store the data gathered by astronomers; byinvestigators of the human genome; and by biochemists exploring the medical properties ofproteins; to name only a few examples. With home-PC's becoming more and more powerful—one can easily get 1 gigabyte (GB) of mainmemory and up to 160 GB on a single commoditydisk drive—database systems are beginning to appear as a common tool for variouscomputer applications; much as spreadsheets and word processors did before them …,*,2002,37
ROX: run-time optimization of XQueries,Riham Abdel Kader; Peter Boncz; Stefan Manegold; Maurice Van Keulen,Abstract Optimization of complex XQueries combining many XPath steps and joins iscurrently hindered by the absence of good cardinality estimation and cost models forXQuery. Additionally; the state-of-the-art of even relational query optimization still strugglesto cope with cost model estimation errors that increase with plan size; as well as with theeffect of correlated joins and selections. In this research; we propose to radically depart fromthe traditional path of separating the query compilation and query execution phases; byhaving the optimizer execute; materialize partial results; and use sampling based estimationtechniques to observe the characteristics of intermediates. The proposed technique takes asinput a Join Graph where the edges are either equi-joins or XPath steps; and the executionenvironment provides value-and structural-join algorithms; as well as structural and value …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,35
Benchmarking adaptive indexing,Goetz Graefe; Stratos Idreos; Harumi Kuno; Stefan Manegold,Abstract Ideally; realizing the best physical design for the current and all subsequentworkloads would impact neither performance nor storage usage. In reality; workloads anddatasets can change dramatically over time and index creation impacts the performance ofconcurrent user and system activity. We propose a framework that evaluates the key premiseof adaptive indexing—a new indexing paradigm where index creation and re-organizationtake place automatically and incrementally; as a side-effect of query execution. We focus onhow the incremental costs and benefits of dynamic reorganization are distributed across theworkload's lifetime. We believe measuring the costs and utility of the stages of adaptationare relevant metrics for evaluating new query processing paradigms and comparing them totraditional approaches.,Technology Conference on Performance Evaluation and Benchmarking,2010,34
Updating the Pre/Post Plane in MonetDB/XQuery.,Peter A Boncz; Stefan Manegold; Jan Rittinger,ABSTRACT We outline an efficient ACID-compliant mechanism for structural inserts anddeletes in relational XML document storage that uses a region based pre/size/levelencoding (equivalent to the pre/post encoding). Updates to such node-numbering schemesare considered prohibitive (ie physical cost linear to document size); because structuralupdates cause shifts in all pre-numbers after the update point; and require updates of thesize of all ancestors; such that the root of the tree becomes a locking bottleneck. We showhow such locking can be avoided by updating the size of ancestors using deltaincrements;which are transaction-commutative operations. We also reduce the physical cost to theminimum (ie linear to update volume) by carefully exploiting the virtual column feature ofMonetDB to store pre numbers (virtual columns are never materialized; and thus need not …,*,2005,33
CPU and cache efficient management of memory-resident databases,Holger Pirk; Florian Funke; Martin Grund; Thomas Neumann; Ulf Leser; Stefan Manegold; Alfons Kemper; Martin Kersten,Memory-Resident Database Management Systems (MRDBMS) have to be optimized for tworesources: CPU cycles and memory bandwidth. To optimize for bandwidth in mixedOLTP/OLAP scenarios; the hybrid or Partially Decomposed Storage Model (PDSM) hasbeen proposed. However; in current implementations; bandwidth savings achieved bypartial decomposition come at increased CPU costs. To achieve the aspired bandwidthsavings without sacrificing CPU efficiency; we combine partially decomposed storage withJust-in-Time (JiT) compilation of queries; thus eliminating CPU inefficient function calls.Since existing cost based optimization components are not designed for JiT-compiled queryexecution; we also develop a novel approach to cost modeling and subsequent storagelayout optimization.

Waste not… Efficient co-processing of relational data,Holger Pirk; Stefan Manegold; Martin Kersten,The variety of memory devices in modern computer systems holds opportunities as well aschallenges for data management systems. In particular; the exploitation of GraphicsProcessing Units (GPUs) and their fast memory has been studied quite intensively.However; current approaches treat GPUs as systems in their own right and fail to provide ageneric strategy for efficient CPU/GPU cooperation. We propose such a strategy forrelational query processing: calculating an approximate result based on lossily compressed;GPU-resident data and refine the result using residuals; ie; the lost data; on the CPU. Wedeveloped the required algorithms; implemented the strategy in an existing DBMS andfound up to 8 times performance improvement; even for datasets larger than the availableGPU memory.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,27
Database cracking: fancy scan; not poor man's sort!,Holger Pirk; Eleni Petraki; Stratos Idreos; Stefan Manegold; Martin Kersten,Abstract Database Cracking is an appealing approach to adaptive indexing: on every range-selection query; the data is partitioned using the supplied predicates as pivots. The core ofdatabase cracking is; thus; pivoted partitioning. While pivoted partitioning; like scanning;requires a single pass through the data it tends to have much higher costs due to lower CPUefficiency. In this paper; we conduct an in-depth study of the reasons for the low CPUefficiency of pivoted partitioning. Based on the findings; we develop an optimized versionwith significantly higher (single-threaded) CPU efficiency. We also develop a number ofmulti-threaded implementations that are effectively bound by memory bandwidth. Combiningall of these optimizations we achieve an implementation that has costs close to or better thanan ordinary scan on a variety of systems ranging from low-end (cheaper than $300) …,Proceedings of the Tenth International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware,2014,25

A multi-query optimizer for Monet,Stefan Manegold; Arjan Pellenkoft; Martin Kersten,Abstract Database systems allow for concurrent use of several applications (and queryinterfaces). Each application generates an “optimal” plan—a sequence of low-leveldatabase operators—for accessing the database. The queries posed by users through thesame application can be optimized together using traditional multi-query optimizationtechniques. However; the commonalities among queries of different applications are notexploited. In this paper we present an efficient inter-application multi-query optimizer that re-uses previously computed (intermediate) results and eliminates redundant work.Experimental results on a single CPU system and a parallel system show that the inter-application multi-query optimizer improves the query evaluation performance significantly.,British National Conference on Databases,2000,21
Holistic indexing in main-memory column-stores,Eleni Petraki; Stratos Idreos; Stefan Manegold,Abstract Great database systems performance relies heavily on index tuning; ie; creatingand utilizing the best indices depending on the workload. However; the complexity of theindex tuning process has dramatically increased in recent years due to ad-hoc workloadsand shortage of time and system resources to invest in tuning. This paper introduces holisticindexing; a new approach to automated index tuning in dynamic environments. Holisticindexing requires zero set-up and tuning effort; relying on adaptive index creation as a side-effect of query processing. Indices are created incrementally and partially; they arecontinuously refined as we process more and more queries. Holistic indexing takes the state-of-the-art adaptive indexing ideas a big step further by introducing the notion of a systemwhich never stops refining the index space; taking educated decisions about which index …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,19

Enhanced stream processing in a DBMS kernel,Erietta Liarou; Stratos Idreos; Stefan Manegold; Martin Kersten,Abstract Continuous query processing has emerged as a promising query processingparadigm with numerous applications. A recent development is the need to handle bothstreaming queries and typical one-time queries in the same application. For example; datawarehousing can greatly benefit from the integration of stream semantics; ie; online analysisof incoming data and combination with existing data. This is especially useful to provide lowlatency in data-intensive analysis in big data warehouses that are augmented with new dataon a daily basis. However; state-of-the-art database technology cannot handle streamsefficiently due to their" continuous" nature. At the same time; state-of-the-art streamtechnology is purely focused on stream applications. The research efforts are mostly gearedtowards the creation of specialized stream management systems built with a different …,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2013,15
Load balanced query evaluation in shared-everything environments,Stefan Manegold; Johann K Obermaier; Florian Waas,Abstract In this paper; we present data threaded execution; a new strategy to exploit both;pipelining and intra-operator parallelism in shared-everything environments. Data threadedexecution is intuitive; straightforward to implement; but resistant against workload estimationerrors and resistant against the discretization error of processor scheduling; thatconventional strategies suffer from. Furthermore; data threaded execution minimizes startupand shutdown execution delays. Simulation results show that data threaded executionoutperforms conventional strategies significantly due to the better utilization of parallelprocessing resources.,European Conference on Parallel Processing,1997,15
GeoTriples: a Tool for Publishing Geospatial Data as RDF Graphs Using R2RML Mappings.,Kostis Kyzirakos; Ioannis Vlachopoulos; Dimitrianos Savva; Stefan Manegold; Manolis Koubarakis,Abstract. A plethora of Earth Observation data that is becoming available at no charge inEurope and the US recently reflects the strong push for more open Earth Observation data.Linked data is a paradigm which studies how one can make data available on the Web; andinterconnect it with other data with the aim of making the value of the resulting “Web of data”greater than the sum of its parts. Open Earth Observation data that are currently madeavailable by space agencies such as ESA and NASA are not following the linked dataparadigm. Therefore; Earth Observation data and other kinds of geospatial data that arenecessary for a user to satisfy her information needs can only be found in different data silos;where each silo may contain only part of the needed data. Publishing the content of thesesilos as RDF graphs; enables the development of data analytics applications with great …,International Semantic Web Conference (Posters & Demos),2014,14
X-device query processing by bitwise distribution,Holger Pirk; Thibault Sellam; Stefan Manegold; Martin Kersten,Abstract The diversity of hardware components within a single system calls for strategies forefficient cross-device data processing. For example; existing approaches to CPU/GPU co-processing distribute individual relational operators to the" most appropriate" device. Whilepleasantly simple; this strategy has a number of problems: it may leave the" inappropriate"devices idle while overloading the" appropriate" device and putting a high pressure on thePCI bus. To address these issues we distribute data among the devices by partiallydecomposing relations at the granularity of individual bits. Each of the resulting bit-partitionsis stored and processed on one of the available devices. Using this strategy; weimplemented a processor for spatial range queries that makes efficient use of all availabledevices. The performance gains achieved indicate that bitwise distribution makes a good …,Proceedings of the Eighth International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware,2012,13
Genome sequence analysis with MonetDB,Robin Cijvat; Stefan Manegold; Martin Kersten; Gunnar W Klau; Alexander Schönhuth; Tobias Marschall; Ying Zhang,Abstract Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has led the life sciences into the bigdata era. Today; sequencing genomes takes little time and cost; but yields terabytes of datato be stored and analyzed. Biologists are often exposed to excessively time consuming anderror-prone data management and analysis hurdles. In this paper; we propose a databasemanagement system (DBMS) based approach to accelerate and substantially simplifygenome sequence analysis. We have extended MonetDB; an open-source column-basedDBMS; with a BAM module; which enables easy; flexible; and rapid management andanalysis of sequence alignment data stored as Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM/BAM) files.We describe the main features of MonetDB/BAM using a case study on Ebola virusgenomes.,Datenbank-Spektrum,2015,11
Instant-On Scientific Data Warehouses,Yağız Kargın; Holger Pirk; Milena Ivanova; Stefan Manegold; Martin Kersten,Abstract In the dawn of the data intensive research era; scientific discovery deploys dataanalysis techniques similar to those that drive business intelligence. Similar to classicalExtract; Transform and Load (ETL) processes; data is loaded entirely from external datasources (repositories) into a scientific data warehouse before it can be analyzed. Thisprocess is both; time and resource intensive and may not be entirely necessary if only asubset of the data is of interest to a particular user. To overcome this problem; we propose anovel technique to lower the costs for data loading: Lazy ETL. Data is extracted and loadedtransparently on-the-fly only for the required data items. Extensive experiments demonstratethe significant reduction of the time from source data availability to query answer comparedto state-of-the-art solutions. In addition to reducing the costs for bootstrapping a scientific …,International Workshop on Business Intelligence for the Real-Time Enterprise,2012,11
MonetDB/XQuery—consistent and efficient updates on the pre/Post plane,Peter Boncz; Jan Flokstra; Torsten Grust; Maurice van Keulen; Stefan Manegold; Sjoerd Mullender; Jan Rittinger; Jens Teubner,Abstract Relational XQuery processors aim at leveraging mature relational DBMS queryprocessing technology to provide scalability and efficiency. To achieve this goal; variousstorage schemes have been proposed to encode the tree structure of XML documents in flatrelational tables. Basically; two classes can be identified:(1) encodings using fixed-lengthsurrogates; like the preorder ranks in the pre/post encoding [5] or the equivalentpre/size/level encoding [8]; and (2) encodings using variable-length surrogates; like; eg;ORDPATH [9] or P-PBiTree [12]. Recent research [1] showed a clear advantage of theformer for efficient evaluation of XPath location steps; exploiting techniques like cheap nodeorder tests; positional lookup; and node skipping in staircase join [7]. However; onceupdates are involved; variable-length surrogates are often considered the better choice …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,10

Adaptive indexing in modern database kernels,Stratos Idreos; Stefan Manegold; Goetz Graefe,Abstract Physical design represents one of the hardest problems for database managementsystems. Without proper tuning; systems cannot achieve good performance. Offline indexingcreates indexes a priori assuming good workload knowledge and idle time. More recently;online indexing monitors the workload trends and creates or drops indexes online. Adaptiveindexing takes another step towards completely automating the tuning process of adatabase system; by enabling incremental and partial online indexing. The main idea is thatphysical design changes continuously; adaptively; partially; incrementally and on demandwhile processing queries as part of the execution operators. As such it brings a plethora ofopportunities for rethinking and improving every single corner of database system design.We will analyze the indexing space between offline; online and adaptive indexing …,Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2012,9

Scalable generation of synthetic GPS traces with real-life data characteristics,Konrad Bösche; Thibault Sellam; Holger Pirk; René Beier; Peter Mieth; Stefan Manegold,Abstract Database benchmarking is most valuable if real-life data and workloads areavailable. However; real-life data (and workloads) are often not publicly available due to IPRconstraints or privacy concerns. And even if available; they are often limited regardingscalability and variability of data characteristics. On the other hand; while easily scalable;synthetically generated data often fail to adequately reflect real-life data characteristics.While there are well established synthetic benchmarks and data generators for; eg; businessdata (TPC-C; TPC-H); there is no such up-to-date data generator; let alone benchmark; forspatiotemporal and/or moving objects data. In this work; we present a data generator forspatiotemporal data. More specifically; our data generator produces synthetic GPS traces;mimicking the GPS traces that GPS navigation devices generate.

Armada: a Reference Model for an Evolving Database System,Fabian Groffen; Martin Leopold Kersten; Stefan Manegold,Abstract: The data on the web; in digital libraries; in scientific repositories; etc. continues togrow at an increasing rate. Distribution is a key solution to overcome this data explosion.However; existing solutions are mostly based on architectures with a single point of failure.In this paper; we present Armada; a model for a database architecture to handle large datavolumes. Armada assumes autonomy of sites; allowing for a decentralised setup; wheresystems can largely work independently. Furthermore; a novel administration schema inArmada; based on lineage trails; allows for flexible adaptation to the (query) work load inhighly dynamic environments. The lineage trails capture the metadata and its history. Theyform the basis to direct updates to the proper sites; to break queries into multi-stage plans;and to provide a reference point for site consistency.

As aresult; Earth Observation (EO) data has been constantly increasing in volume in the last fewyears; and is currently reaching petabytes in many satellite archives. For example; the multi-mission data archive of the TELEIOS partner German Aerospace Center (DLR) is expectedto reach 2PB next year; while ESA estimates that it will be archiving 20PB of data before theyear 2020. As the volume of data in satellite archives has been increasing; so have thescientific and commercial applications of EO data. Nevertheless; it is estimated that up to95% of the data present in existing archives has never been accessed; so the potential forincreasing exploitation is very big.,International conference on web reasoning and rule systems,2012,7

Rox: The robustness of a run-time xquery optimizer against correlated data,Riham Abdel Kader; Peter Boncz; Stefan Manegold; Maurice Van Keulen,We demonstrate ROX; a run-time optimizer of XQueries; that focuses on finding the bestexecution order of XPath steps and relational joins in an XQuery. The problem of joinordering has been extensively researched; but the proposed techniques are stillunsatisfying. These either rely on a cost model which might result in inaccurate estimations;or explore only a restrictive number of plans from the search space. ROX is developed totackle these problems. ROX does not need any cost model; and defers query optimization torun-time intertwining optimization and execution steps. In every optimization step; samplingtechniques are used to estimate the cardinality of unexecuted steps and joins to make adecision which sequence of operators to process next. Consequently; each execution stepwill provide updated and accurate knowledge about intermediate results; which will be …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,6
Performance evaluation in database research: principles and experience,Ioana Manolescu; Stefan Manegold,Significant part of today's database research focuses on improving performance of a specificsystem. Quantitative experiments are the best way to validate such results. However;performing experiments is not always easy. Besides the complexity of the system under test;designing an experiment; choosing the right environment and parameter values; analyzingthe data which is gathered; and reporting it to a third party in an expressive and intelligibleway is hard. In this tutorial; we present a general road-map to the above steps; including tipsand tricks on how to organize and present code that performs experiments; so that anoutsider can repeat them. The tutorial is primarily aimed at MS and PhD students seeking toimprove their experiment practices; but more senior attendants may also find it interesting.,12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2009,6

Loop-lifted staircase join: from XPath to XQuery,Peter Alexander Boncz; Torsten Grust; Maurice vanKeulen; Stefan Manegold; Jan Rittinger; Jens Teubner,textabstractVarious techniques have been proposed for efficient evaluation of XPathexpressions; where the XPath location steps are rooted in a single sequence of contextnodes. Among these techniques; the staircase join allows to evaluate XPath location stepsalong arbitrary axes in at most one scan over the XML document; exploiting the XPathaccelerator encoding (aka. pre/post encoding). In XQuery; however; embedded XPath sub-expressions occur in arbitrarily nested for-loops. Thus; they are rooted in multiple sequencesof context nodes (one per iteration). Consequently; the previously proposed algorithms needto be applied repeatedly; requiring multiple scans over the XML document encoding. In thiswork; we present loop-lifted staircase join; an extension of the staircase join that allows toefficiently evaluate XPath sub-expressions in arbitrarily nested XQuery iteration scopes …,Information Systems [INS],2005,6

The DBMS-your big data sommelier,Yağız Kargın; Martin Kersten; Stefan Manegold; Holger Pirk,When addressing the problem of “big” data volume; preparation costs are one of the keychallenges: the high costs for loading; aggregating and indexing data leads to a long data-to-insight time. In addition to being a nuisance to the end-user; this latency prevents real-timeanalytics on “big” data. Fortunately; data often comes in semantic chunks such as files thatcontain data items that share some characteristics such as acquisition time or location. Adata management system that exploits this trait can significantly lower the data preparationcosts and the associated data-to-insight time by only investing in the preparation of therelevant chunks. In this paper; we develop such a system as an extension of an existingrelational DBMS (MonetDB). To this end; we develop a query processing paradigm and datastorage model that are partial-loading aware. The result is a system that can make a 1.2 …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,5

Optimizing main-memory join on modern hardware,Stefan Manegold; Peter A Boncz; Martin L Kersten,Abstract In the past decade; the exponential growth in commodity CPUs speed has faroutpaced advances in memory latency. A second trend is that CPU performance advancesare not only brought by increased clock rate; but also by increasing parallelism inside theCPU. Current database systems have not yet adapted to these trends; and show poorutilization of both CPU and memory resources on current hardware. In this article; we showhow these resources can be optimized for large joins and translate these insights intoguidelines for future database architectures; encompassing data structures; algorithms; costmodeling; and implementation. In particular; we discuss how vertically fragmented datastructures optimize cache performance on sequential data access. On the algorithmic side;we refine the partitioned hash-join with a new partitioning algorithm called radix-cluster …,*,1999,5
Lazy ETL in action: ETL technology dates scientific data,Yağíz Kargín; Milena Ivanova; Ying Zhang; Stefan Manegold; Martin Kersten,Abstract Both scientific data and business data have analytical needs. Analysis takes placeafter a scientific data warehouse is eagerly filled with all data from external data sources(repositories). This is similar to the initial loading stage of Extract; Transform; and Load (ETL)processes that drive business intelligence. ETL can also help scientific data analysis.However; the initial loading is a time and resource consuming operation. It might not beentirely necessary; eg if the user is interested in only a subset of the data. We propose todemonstrate Lazy ETL; a technique to lower costs for initial loading. With it; ETL is integratedinto the query processing of the scientific data warehouse. For a query; only the requireddata items are extracted; transformed; and loaded transparently on-the-fly.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,4

The newfeatures fall into two categories: XML-enabled interfaces allow the DBMS to speak andunderstand XML formats; whereas XML extensions add novel primitives to the engine core.Both kinds of innovations have the potential to impact the architecture of software systems;namely by bringing about a complexity reduction in multi-tier systems. However; it is oftendifficult to estimate the effect of these innovations. This is where the XML Benchmark Projecttries to help with XMark.

Run-time Optimization for Pipelined Systems,R Abdel Kader; Maurice Van Keulen; Peter Boncz; Stefan Manegold,Abstract Traditional optimizers fail to pick good execution plans; when faced withincreasingly complex queries and large data sets. This failure is even more acute in thecontext of XQuery; due to the structured nature of the XML language. To overcome thevulnerabilities of traditional optimizers; we have previously proposed ROX; a Run-timeOptimizer for XQueries; which interleaves optimization and execution of full tables. ROX hasproved to be robust; even in the presence of strong correlations; but it has one limitation: ituses full materialization of intermediate results making it unsuitable for pipelined systems.Therefore; this paper proposes ROX-sampled; a variant of ROX; which executes small datasamples; thus generating smaller intermediates. We conduct extensive experiments whichproved that ROX-sampled is comparable to ROX in performance; and that it is still robust …,*,2010,3

In such system; posing a query involvescontinuously locating the right node until sufficient data to answer the query has been found.Locating a node involves making a connection to such node. Since making a connection isexpensive in time; avoiding to do so where possible; pays off in the total query executiontime.

On optimal pipeline processing in parallel query execution,Stefan Manegold; Florian Waas; Martin Leopold Kersten; Stefan Manegold; Florian Waas; Martin L Kersten,Abstract A key assumption underlying query optimization schemes for parallel processing isthat their cost models can deal with the multitude of effects encountered during the executionphase. Unfortunately; this is rarely the case and the optimal processing is only achieved in afew situations. In this paper we address the problem to achieve optimal processing under apipelined execution strategy. The approach taken is based on a novel analytical framework---which establishes a formal treatment of both dataflow and processing environment---tovalidate execution strategies. The framework is based on the notion of-optimality whichreflects an execution strategy's ability of ad-hoc resource utilization.-optimal strategies areinsensitive to skew and provide a transparent interface to parallelism as they ensure aprovable near-optimal exploitation of the processing environment.

Integrated querying of XML data in RDBMSs,Albrecht Schmidt; Stefan Manegold; Martin Kersten,Abstract This paper proposes a way to integrate cleanly relational databases and XMLdocuments. The main idea is to draw a clear line of demarcation between the two conceptsby modelling XML documents as a new atomic SQL type. The standardised XML tools likeXPath; XQuery; XSLT are then user-defined functions that operate on this type. Well-definedinteroperability is guaranteed by; on the one hand; defining a standard way to markup SQLrelations as XML documents and; thus; to make them accessible to the XML tools; on theother hand; XPath and XQuery queries run against the XML portion of the database can usethe same predefined schema to make their results accessible to the SQL language forfurther processing. Additionally; a method for set-oriented evaluation of regular pathexpressions is presented that integrates into our implementation framework.,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2003,2
Macro-and micro-parallelism in a dbms,Martin Kersten; Stefan Manegold; Peter Boncz; Niels Nes,Abstract Large memories have become an affordable storage medium for databasesinvolving hundreds of Gigabytes on multi-processor systems. In this short note; we reviewour research on building relational engines to exploit this major shift in hardwareperspective. It illustrates that key design issues related to parallelism poses architecturalproblems at all levels of a system architecture and whose impact is not easily predictable.The sheer size/complexity of a relational DBMS and the sliding requirements of frontierapplications are indicative that a substantial research agenda remains wide open.,European Conference on Parallel Processing,2001,2
In quest of the bottleneck—monitoring parallel database systems,Stefan Manegold; Florian Waas; Daniel Gudlat,Abstract Monitoring query processing has proven to be an effective technique to detectbottlenecks in sequential query execution systems' components. Monitoring distributedexecution in parallel systems; however; is a difficult task. The monitoring data of all nodesmust be collected at the same time to value load-balancing and scheduling. Furthermore; wewant to extract not only information about resource allocation of single processes but alsoallow for monitoring of single tuples and attribute value distribution. The monitoring systemwe present in this paper is a client-server architecture where each process of the paralleldatabase system is a client of the monitoring server. This architecture enables the user tomonitor even load-balancing or scheduling effects. The monitoring extensions; each client isattached with; provide inspection of the processes at a fine granularity.

Building virtual earth observatories using scientific database and semantic web technologies,Kostis Kyzirakos; Stefan Manegold; Charalampos Nikolaou; Manolis Koubarakis,TELEIOS is a recent European project that addresses the need for scalable access topetabytes of Earth Observation (EO) data and the identification of hidden knowledge thatcan be used in applications. To achieve this; TELEIOS builds on scientific databases; linkedgeospatial data and ontologies. TELEIOS was the first project internationally that introducedthe Linked Data paradigm to the EO domain; and developed prototype services such as thereal-time fire monitoring service that has been used for the last two years by decision makersand emergency response managers in Greece. Linked Data is a new research area whichstudies how one can make data available on the Web; and interconnect it with other datawith the aim of making the value of the resulting “Web of data” greater than the sum of itsparts. The Web of data has recently started being populated with geospatial data. Great …,ERCIM News,2014,1

Thinking Big in a Small World—Efficient Query Execution on Small-Scale SMPs,Stefan Manegold; Florian Waas,Abstract Many techniques developed for parallel database systems were focused on large-scale; often prototypical; hardware platforms. Therefore; most results cannot easily betransferred to widely available workstation clusters such as multiprocessor workstations. Inthis paper we address the exploitation of pipelining parallelism in query processing on smallmultiprocessor environments. We present DTE/R; a strategy for executing pipeliningsegments of arbitrary length by replicating the segment's operator. Therefore; DTE/R avoidsstatic processor-to-operator assignment of conventional processing techniques.Consequently; DTE/R achieves automatic load-balancing and skew-handling. DTE/Routperforms conventional pipelining execution techniques substantially.,*,1998,1
Load Balanced Query Evaluation in Shared-Everything Environments (Extended Version),Stefan Manegold; Johann K Obermaier; Florian Waas,Abstract In this paper; we present data threaded execution; a new strategy to exploitpipelining and intraoperator parallelism in a shared-everything environment. Data threadedexecution is very intuitive; straightforward to realize; and resistant against workloadestimation errors and against the discretization error of processor scheduling as it appearsin conventional strategies. Furthermore; data threaded execution minimizes startup andshutdown execution delays. Simulation results show; that data threaded executionoutperforms conventional strategies like segmented right-deep execution due to betterutilization of parallel processing resources.,*,1996,1

Open EO data thatare currently made available by space agencies are not following the linked data paradigm.Therefore; from the perspective of a user; the EO data and other kinds of geospatial datanecessary to satisfy his or her information need can only be found in different data silos;where each silo may contain only part of the needed data. Opening up these silos bypublishing their contents as RDF and interlinking them with semantic connections will allowthe development of data analytics applications with great environmental and financial value.This is the goal of the new European project LEO which we introduce in this paper.,*,2014,*

Transaction Processing in the Hybrid OLTP&OLAP Main-Memory Database System HyPer,Alfons Kemper Thomas Neumann Jan Finis; Florian Funke; Viktor Leis Henrik Mühe Tobias Mühlbauer; Wolf Rödiger,Abstract Two emerging hardware trends have re-initiated the development of in-coredatabase systems: ever increasing main-memory capacities and vast multi-core parallelprocessing power. Main-memory capacities of several TB allow to retain all transactionaldata of even the largest applications in-memory on one (or a few) servers. The vastcomputational power in combination with low data management overhead yieldsunprecedented transaction performance which allows to push transaction processing (awayfrom application servers) into the database server and still “leaves room” for additional queryprocessing directly on the transactional data. Thereby; the often postulated goal of real-timebusiness intelligence; where decision makers have access to the latest version of thetransactional state; becomes feasible.

As opposed to ad-hocquery processing; where one-time queries are evaluated against a stable data base;continuous query processing features long-running queries that are continuously evaluatedagainst ever new arriving data. In general; stream applications gained significant popularityover the last years that lead to the development of specialized stream engines. Thesesystems are designed from scratch with a different philosophy than nowadays databaseengines in order to cope with the stream applications requirements. However; this meansthat they lack the power and sophisticated techniques of a full fledged database system …,*,2011,*

An array data model and query language for EO image databases SciQL; A Query Language for Science Applications,Martin Kersten; Niels Nes; Ying Zhang; Milena Ivanova; Stefan Manegold,Executive Summary Scientific applications are still poorly served by contemporary relationaldatabase systems. At best; the system provides a bridge towards an external library usinguser-defined functions; explicit import/export facilities or linked-in Java/C# interpreters. Timehas come to rectify this with SciQL1; a SQL query language for scientific applications witharrays as first class citizens. It provides a seamless symbiosis of array-; set-; and sequence-interpretation using a clear separation of the mathematical object from its underlyingimplementation. A key innovation is to extend value-based grouping in SQL: 2003 withstructural grouping; ie; fixed-sized and unbounded groups based on explicit relationshipsbetween their dimension attributes. It leads to a generalization of window-based queryprocessing with wide applicability in science domains. This paper is focused on the …,*,2011,*

Benchmarking adaptive indexing,G Goetz; S Idreos; H Kuno; S Manegold,textabstractIdeally; realizing the best physical design for the current and all subsequentworkloads would impact neither performance nor storage usage. In reality; workloads anddatasets can change dramatically over time and index creation impacts the performance ofconcurrent user and system activity. We propose a framework that evaluates the key premiseof adaptive indexing---a new indexing paradigm where index creation and re-organizationtake place automatically and incrementally; as a side-effect of query execution. We focus onhow the incremental costs and benefits of dynamic reorganization are distributed across theworkload's lifetime. We believe measuring the costs and utility of the stages of adaptationare relevant metrics for evaluating new query processing paradigms and comparing them totraditional approaches.,*,2010,*
Run-time Optimization for Pipelined Systems,R Abdel Kader; Maurice vanKeulen; PA Boncz; Stefan Manegold,textabstractTraditional optimizers fail to pick good execution plans; when faced withincreasingly complex queries and large data sets. This failure is even more acute in thecontext of XQuery; due to the structured nature of the XML language. To overcome thevulnerabilities of traditional optimizers; we have previously proposed ROX; a Run-timeOptimizer for XQueries; which interleaves optimization and execution of full tables. ROX hasproved to be robust; even in the presence of strong correlations; but it has one limitation: ituses full materialization of intermediate results making it unsuitable for pipelined systems.Therefore; this paper proposes ROX-sampled; a variant of ROX; which executes small datasamples; thus generating smaller intermediates. We conduct extensive experiments whichproved that ROX-sampled is comparable to ROX in performance; and that it is still robust …,*,2010,*

ROX: The Robustness of a Run-time XQuery Optimizer Against Correlated Data (Demo Paper),R Abdel Kader; PA Boncz; S Manegold; M vanKeulen,textabstractWe demonstrate ROX; a run-time optimizer of XQueries; that focuses on findingthe best execution order of XPath steps and relational joins in an XQuery. The problem ofjoin ordering has been extensively researched; but the proposed techniques are stillunsatisfying. These either rely on a cost model which might result in inaccurate estimations;or explore only a restrictive number of plans from the search space. ROX is developed totackle these problems. ROX does not need any cost model; and defers query optimization torun-time intertwining optimization and execution steps. In every optimization step; samplingtechniques are used to estimate the cardinality of unexecuted steps and joins to make adecision which sequence of operators to process next. Consequently; each execution stepwill provide updated and accurate knowledge about intermediate results; which will be …,*,2010,*

Storing XML Documents in Databases,Albrecht Schmidt; Stefan Manegold; Martin Kersten,Abstract Ever since the Extensible Markup Language (XML)(W3C; 1998b) began to be usedto exchange data between diverse sources; interest has grown in deploying datamanagement technology to store and query XML documents. A number of approachespropose to adapt relational database technology to store and maintain XML documents(Deutsch; Fernandez & Suciu; 1999; Florescu & Kossmann; 1999; Klettke & Meyer; 2000;Shanmugasundaram et al.; 1999; Tatarinov et al.; 2002; O'Neil et al.; 2004).

REPORT INS-E0506 APRIL 2005,PA Boncz; S Manegold; J Rittinger,ABSTRACT We outline an efficient ACID-compliant mechanism for structural inserts anddeletes in relational XML document storage that uses a region based pre/size/levelencoding (equivalent to the pre/post encoding). Updates to such node-numbering schemesare considered prohibitive (ie physical cost linear to document size); because structuralupdates cause shifts in all pre-numbers after the update point; and require updates of thesize of all ancestors; such that the root of the tree becomes a locking bottleneck. We showhow such locking can be avoided by updating the size of ancestors using delta-increments;which are transaction-commutative operations. We also reduce the physical cost to theminimum (ie linear to update volume) by carefully exploiting the virtual column feature ofMonetDB to store pre numbers (virtual columns are never materialized; and thus need not …,*,2005,*

REPORT INS-E0406 JUNE 2004,Cache-Conscious Radix-Decluster Projections; S Manegold; PA Boncz; NJ Nes; ML Kersten,ABSTRACT As CPUs become more powerful with Moore's law and memory latencies stayconstant; the impact of the memory access performance bottleneck continues to grow onrelational operators like join; which can exhibit random access on a memory region largerthan the hardware caches. While cache-conscious variants for various relational algorithmshave been described; previous work has mostly ignored (the cost of) projection columns.However; real-life joins almost always come with projections; such that proper projectioncolumn manipulation should be an integral part of any generic join algorithm. In this paper;we analyze cache-conscious hash-join algorithms including projections on two storageschemes: N-ary Storage Model (NSM) and Decomposition Storage Model (DSM).

REPORT INS-E0408 SEPTEMBER 2004,ML Kersten; S Manegold,ABSTRACT Query performance strongly depends on finding an execution plan that touchesas few superfluous tuples as possible. The access structures deployed for this purpose;however; are non-discriminative. They assume every subset of the domain being indexed isequally important; and their structures cause a high maintenance overhead during updates.This approach often fails in decision support or scientific environments where indexselection represents a weak compromise amongst many plausible plans. An alternativeroute; explored here; is to continuously adapt the database organization by makingreorganization an integral part of the query evaluation process. Every query is first analyzedfor its contribution to break the database into multiple pieces; such that both the requiredsubset is easily retrieved and subsequent queries may benefit from the new partitioning …,*,2004,*

lntegrating l/O Processing and Transparent Parallelism—,Stefan Manegold; Florian Waas,Query processing in parallel database systems stands or falls by efficient resource usageincluding CPU scheduling; I/O processing and memory allocation. Up to now; most researchhas focused on load balancing issues concerning several resources of the same kind only;ie balancing either CPU load or I/O load exclusively. In this chapter we present floatingprobe; a novel strategy to utilize parallel resources in a shared-everything environmentefficiently. The key idea of floating probe is dynamic load balancing of CPU and I/Oresources by overlapping I/O-bound build phase and CPU-bound probe phase of pipelinesegments. The extent of interleaving is only limited by data dependencies. Simulation resultsshow; that floating probe achieves considerably shorter execution times with less memorydemands than conventional pipelining strategies.,Current Trends in Data Management Technology,1999,*
Transparent Parallelism in Query Execution,Stefan Manegold; Florian Waas; Martin L Kersten,textabstractA key assumption underlying query optimization schemes for parallel processingis that their cost models can anticipate the multitude of effects encountered during theexecution phase. Unfortunately; this is rarely the case and the optimal processing is onlyachieved in a few situations. However; enriching cost models with further parametersincreases likelihood and extent of estimate errors; thus; does not guarantee better results ingeneral. In this paper we address the question how to de-couple optimization and executionby transparent means of parallelism; ie once the optimizer determined the degree ofparallelism for a group of operators; the underlying execution engine ensures optimalparallel execution without demanding any static schedule by the optimizer. Based on ananalytical framework we model both dataflow and processing environment for parallel …,*,1998,*

This problem is of major concern; since data processing is a coreprocess for many businesses and applications. Yet a real solution to the data growthproblem has to be found. Scaling into multiple machines to process the data is currentlysuccessfully applied in grids and distributed databases. However; the centralised scalingtechnique using a large number of machines; is fragile from an availability point of view. Allsystems depend on the availability of one.

Integrated Querying of XML Data in RDBMSs,Albrecht Schmidt Stefan Manegold Martin Kersten,ABSTRACT This paper proposes a way to integrate cleanly relational databases and XMLdocuments. The main idea is to draw a clear line of demarcation between the two conceptsby modelling XML documents as a new atomic SQL type. The standardised XML tools likeXPath; XQuery; XSLT are then user-defined functions that operate on this type. Welldefinedinteroperability is guaranteed by; on the one hand; defining a standard way to markup SQLrelations as XML documents and; thus; to make them accessible to the XML tools; on theother hand; XPath and XQuery queries run against the XML portion of the database can usethe same predefined schema to make their results accessible to the SQL language forfurther processing. Additionally; a method for set-oriented evaluation of regular pathexpressions is presented that integrates into our implementation framework.,*,*,*

Big Data Benchmarking: Data Intensive Research and Explorative Data Analysis,Stefan Manegold,• The data is already present in the database; loaded entirely from CSV files into the databasebefore the benchmark starts; or produced inside the DBMS during the benchmark. In otherwords; query processing happens inside the DBMS; only … • The entire physical design; includingall relevant indexes; is optimized completely before query processing starts … • A benchmark'sworkload consists of database queries that are to be evaluated literally and entirely to alwaysproduce complete and correct results … Undoubtedly; these assumptions do hold and are requiredin traditional business-inspired database application scenarios. However; in the light of BigData; there is a clear need for interactive exploration of extremely large databases; especiallyin the area of scientific data management where ingestion of multiple Terabytes on a daily basisis foreseen.

A Linguistic Query Language On Top Of A Column-Oriented Main-Memory Database,Stefan Manegold,Linguists rely on corpora of actual spoken or written language; such as newspaper articles;to study language variety. Natural language processing algorithms; eg; automated part-of-speech tagging or syntax tree generation; have allowed the costruction of large corpora;containing millions of words; which are further enriched with a multitude of data [Lüd11]. Thechallenge posed by these corpora is to quickly identify and retrieve examples of a linguisticphenomenon a researcher is interested in. To satisfy this demand; we have developedAnnis; a database and web-based multi-layer corpus system [ZRLC09]. It provides a simple;yet expressive query language which is translated to SQL and evaluated on PostgreSQL[Pos96]. The current implementation of Annis is able to evaluate complex linguistic querieson multi-layer corpora containing hundreds of thousands of words at a speed which is …,*,*,*
INS-R9805 February 28; 1998,S Manegold; F Waas; ML Kersten,ABSTRACT A key assumption underlying query optimization schemes for parallelprocessing is that their cost models can deal with the multitude of e ects encountered duringthe execution phase. Unfortunately; this is rarely the case and the optimal processing is onlyachieved in a few situations. In this paper we address the problem to achieve optimalprocessing under a pipelined execution strategy. The approach taken is based on a novelanalytical framework| which establishes a formal treatment of both data ow and processingenvironment| to validate execution strategies. The framework is based on the notion of-optimality which re ects an execution strategy's ability of ad-hoc resource utilization.-optimalstrategies are insensitive to skew and provide a transparent interface to parallelism as theyensure a provable near-optimal exploitation of the processing environment.,*,*,*

Doktoringenieur (Dr.-Ing.),Gunter Saake; Kai-Uwe Sattler; Stefan Manegold,Abstract Database management systems (DBMS) were developed decades ago withconsideration for the legacy hardware and data management requirements. Over years;developments in the hardware and the data management have forced DBMS to grow infunctionalities. These functionalities got tightly integrated into the DBMS core because oftheir monolithic architecture. This has resulted in increased complexity of DBMS; whichmakes them difficult to tune for consistent performance. Furthermore; the decreasing cost ofthe hardware and the software has resulted in making the human resource a major factor inthe total cost of ownership for the data management. There exists a need to revisit existingdatabase architecture using unconventional and unexplored techniques towards morediversified and loosely coupled architectures. We present the Cellular DBMS architecture …,*,*,*

INS-R9912 October 31; 1999,S Manegold; P Boncz; ML Kersten,ABSTRACT In the past decade; the exponential growth in commodity CPUs speed has faroutpaced advances in memory latency. A second trend is that CPU performance advancesare not only brought by increased clock rate; but also by increasing parallelism inside theCPU. Current database systems have not yet adapted to these trends; and show poorutilization of both CPU and memory resources on current hardware. In this article; we showhow these resources can be optimized for large joins and translate these insights intoguidelines for future database architectures; encompassing data structures; algorithms; costmodeling; and implementation. In particular; we discuss how vertically fragmented datastructures optimize cache performance on sequential data access. On the algorithmic side;we refine the partitioned hash-join with a new partitioning algorithm called radix-cluster …,*,*,*
INS-R9711 December 31; 1997,S Manegold; JK Obermaier,ABSTRACT E cient resource usage is a key to achieve better performance in paralleldatabase systems. Up to now; most research has focussed on balancing the load on severalresources of the same type; ie balancing either CPU load or I/O load. In this paper; wepresent oating probe; a strategy for parallel evaluation of pipelining segments in a shared-everything environment that provides dynamic load balancing between CPU-and I/O-resources. The key idea of oating probe is to overlap| as much as possible with respect todata dependencies| I/O-bound build phase and CPU-bound probe phase of pipeliningsegments to improve resource utilization. Simulation results show; that oating probeachieves shorter execution times while consuming less memory than conventionalpipelining strategies.,*,*,*
