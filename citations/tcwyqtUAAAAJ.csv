Efficient time series matching by wavelets,Kin-Pong Chan; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Time series stored as feature vectors can be indexed by multidimensional index trees like R-Trees for fast retrieval. Due to the dimensionality curse problem; transformations are appliedto time series to reduce the number of dimensions of the feature vectors. Differenttransformations like Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT);Karhunen-Loeve (KL) transform or Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) can be applied.While the use of DFT and KL transform or SVD have been studied on the literature; to ourknowledge; there is no in-depth study on the application of DWT. In this paper we propose touse Haar Wavelet Transform for time series indexing. The major contributions are:(1) weshow that Euclidean distance is preserved in the Haar transformed domain and no falsedismissal will occur;(2) we show that Haar transform can outperform DFT through …,Data Engineering; 1999.

A fast distributed algorithm for mining association rules,David W Cheung; Jiawei Han; Vincent T Ng; Ada W Fu; Yongjian Fu,With the existence of many large transaction databases; the huge amounts of data; the highscalability of distributed systems; and the easy partitioning and distribution of a centralizeddatabase; it is important to investigate efficient methods for distributed mining of associationrules. The study discloses some interesting relationships between locally large and globallylarge item sets and proposes an interesting distributed association rule mining algorithm;FDM (fast distributed mining of association rules); which generates a small number ofcandidate sets and substantially reduces the number of messages to be passed at miningassociation rules. A performance study shows that FDM has a superior performance over thedirect application of a typical sequential algorithm. Further performance enhancement leadsto a few variations of the algorithm.,Parallel and Distributed Information Systems; 1996.; Fourth International Conference on,1996,669
Entropy-based subspace clustering for mining numerical data,Chun-Hung Cheng; Ada Waichee Fu; Yi Zhang,Abstract Mining numerical data is a relatively difficult problem in data mining. Clustering isone of the techniques. We consider a database with numerical attributes; in which eachtransaction is viewed as a multi-dimensional vector. By studying the clusters formed by thesevectors; we can discover certain behaviors hidden in the data. Traditional clusteringalgorithms find clusters in the full space of the data sets. This results in high dimensionalclusters; which are poorly comprehensible to human. One important task in this setting is theability to discover clusters embedded in the subspaces of a high-dimensional data set. Thisproblem is known as subspace clustering. We follow the basic assumptions of previous workCLIQUE. It is found that the number of subspaces with clustering is very large; and a criterioncalled the coverage is proposed in CLIQUE for the pruning. In addition to coverage; we …,Proceedings of the fifth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,1999,639
Mining fuzzy association rules in databases,Chan Man Kuok; Ada Fu; Man Hon Wong,Abstract Data mining is the discovery of previously unknown; potentially useful and hiddenknowledge in databases. In this paper; we concentrate on the discovery of association rules.Many algorithms have been proposed to find association rules in databases with binaryattributes. We introduce the fuzzy association rules of the form;'If X is A then Y is B'; to dealwith quantitative attributes. X; Y are set of attributes and A; B are fuzzy sets which describe Xand Y respectively. Using the fuzzy set concept; the discovered rules are moreunderstandable to human. Moreover; fuzzy sets handle numerical values better than existingmethods because fuzzy sets soften the effect of sharp boundaries.,ACM Sigmod Record,1998,635
Mining association rules with weighted items,Chun Hing Cai; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; CH Cheng; WW Kwong,Discovery of association rules has been found useful in many applications. In previous work;all items in a basket database are treated uniformly. We generalize this to the case whereitems are given weights to reflect their importance to the user. The weights may correspondto special promotions on some products; or the profitability of different items. We can minethe weighted association rules with weights. The downward closure property of the supportmeasure in the unweighted case no longer exists and previous algorithms cannot beapplied. In this paper; two new algorithms are introduced to handle this problem. In thesealgorithms we make use of a metric called the k-support bound in the mining process.Experimental results show the efficiency of the algorithms for large databases.,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 1998.

Hot sax: Efficiently finding the most unusual time series subsequence,Eamonn Keogh; Jessica Lin; Ada Fu,In this work; we introduce the new problem of finding time series discords. Time seriesdiscords are subsequences of a longer time series that are maximally different to all the restof the time series subsequences. They thus capture the sense of the most unusualsubsequence within a time series. Time series discords have many uses for data mining;including improving the quality of clustering; data cleaning; summarization; and anomalydetection. Discords are particularly attractive as anomaly detectors because they onlyrequire one intuitive parameter (the length of the subsequence) unlike most anomalydetection algorithms that typically require many parameters. We evaluate our work with acomprehensive set of experiments. In particular; we demonstrate the utility of discords withobjective experiments on domains as diverse as Space Shuttle telemetry monitoring …,Data mining; fifth IEEE international conference on,2005,582
Efficient mining of association rules in distributed databases,David W Cheung; Vincent T Ng; Ada W Fu; Yongjian Fu,Many sequential algorithms have been proposed for the mining of association rules.However; very little work has been done in mining association rules in distributeddatabases. A direct application of sequential algorithms to distributed databases is noteffective; because it requires a large amount of communication overhead. In this study; anefficient algorithm called DMA (Distributed Mining of Association rules); is proposed. Itgenerates a small number of candidate sets and requires only O (n) messages for support-count exchange for each candidate set; where n is the number of sites in a distributeddatabase. The algorithm has been implemented on an experimental testbed; and itsperformance is studied. The results show that DMA has superior performance; whencompared with the direct application of a popular sequential algorithm; in distributed …,IEEE transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1996,540
Mining multiple-level association rules in large databases,Jiawei Han; Yongjian Fu,A top-down progressive deepening method is developed for efficient mining of multiple-levelassociation rules from large transaction databases based on the a priori principle. A group ofvariant algorithms is proposed based on the ways of sharing intermediate results; with therelative performance tested and analyzed. The enforcement of different interestingnessmeasurements to find more interesting rules; and the relaxation of rule conditions for finding"level-crossing" association rules; are also investigated. The study shows that efficientalgorithms can be developed from large databases for the discovery of interesting andstrong multiple-level association rules.,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering,1999,495
Utility-based anonymization using local recoding,Jian Xu; Wei Wang; Jian Pei; Xiaoyuan Wang; Baile Shi; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Abstract Privacy becomes a more and more serious concern in applications involvingmicrodata. Recently; efficient anonymization has attracted much research work. Most of theprevious methods use global recoding; which maps the domains of the quasi-identifierattributes to generalized or changed values. However; global recoding may not alwaysachieve effective anonymization in terms of discernability and query answering accuracyusing the anonymized data. Moreover; anonymized data is often for analysis. As wellaccepted in many analytical applications; different attributes in a data set may have differentutility in the analysis. The utility of attributes has not been considered in the previousmethods. In this paper; we study the problem of utility-based anonymization. First; wepropose a simple framework to specify utility of attributes. The framework covers both …,Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2006,415
(α; k)-anonymity: an enhanced k-anonymity model for privacy preserving data publishing,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Jiuyong Li; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang,Abstract Privacy preservation is an important issue in the release of data for miningpurposes. The k-anonymity model has been introduced for protecting individualidentification. Recent studies show that a more sophisticated model is necessary to protectthe association of individuals to sensitive information. In this paper; we propose an (α; k)-anonymity model to protect both identifications and relationships to sensitive information indata. We discuss the properties of (α; k)-anonymity model. We prove that the optimal (α; k)-anonymity problem is NP-hard. We first presentan optimal global-recoding method for the (α;k)-anonymity problem. Next we propose a local-recoding algorithm which is more scalableand result in less data distortion. The effectiveness and efficiency are shown by experiments.We also describe how the model can be extended to more general case.,Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2006,353
K-isomorphism: privacy preserving network publication against structural attacks,James Cheng; Ada Wai-chee Fu; Jia Liu,Abstract Serious concerns on privacy protection in social networks have been raised inrecent years; however; research in this area is still in its infancy. The problem is challengingdue to the diversity and complexity of graph data; on which an adversary can use manytypes of background knowledge to conduct an attack. One popular type of attacks as studiedby pioneer work [2] is the use of embedding subgraphs. We follow this line of work andidentify two realistic targets of attacks; namely; NodeInfo and LinkInfo. Our investigationsshow that k-isomorphism; or anonymization by forming k pairwise isomorphic subgraphs; isboth sufficient and necessary for the protection. The problem is shown to be NP-hard. Wedevise a number of techniques to enhance the anonymization efficiency while retaining thedata utility.

Enhancing effectiveness of outlier detections for low density patterns,Jian Tang; Zhixiang Chen; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; David W Cheung,Abstract Outlier detection is concerned with discovering exceptional behaviors of objects indata sets. It is becoming a growingly useful tool in applications such as credit card frauddetection; discovering criminal behaviors in e-commerce; identifying computer intrusion;detecting health problems; etc. In this paper; we introduce a connectivity-based outlier factor(COF) scheme that improves the effectiveness of an existing local outlier factor (LOF)scheme when a pattern itself has similar neighbourhood density as an outlier. We givetheoretical and empirical analysis to demonstrate the improvement in effectiveness and thecapability of the COF scheme in comparison with the LOF scheme.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2002,285
Minimality attack in privacy preserving data publishing,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang; Jian Pei,Abstract Data publishing generates much concern over the protection of individual privacy.Recent studies consider cases where the adversary may possess different kinds ofknowledge about the data. In this paper; we show that knowledge of the mechanism oralgorithm of anonymization for data publication can also lead to extra information that assiststhe adversary and jeopardizes individual privacy. In particular; all known mechanisms try tominimize information loss and such an attempt provides a loophole for attacks. We call suchan attack a minimality attack. In this paper; we introduce a model called m-confidentialitywhich deals with minimality attacks; and propose a feasible solution. Our experiments showthat minimality attacks are practical concerns on real datasets and that our algorithm canprevent such attacks with very little overhead and information loss.,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,279
Particle size analysis in pharmaceutics: principles; methods and applications,Boris Y Shekunov; Pratibhash Chattopadhyay; Henry HY Tong; Albert HL Chow,Abstract Abstract Physicochemical and biopharmaceutical properties of drug substancesand dosage forms can be highly affected by the particle size; a critical process parameter inpharmaceutical production. The fundamental issue with particle size analysis is the variety ofequivalent particle diameters generated by different methods; which is largely ascribable tothe particle shape and particle dispersion mechanism involved. Thus; to enable selection ofthe most appropriate or optimal sizing technique; cross-correlation between differenttechniques may be required.

Haar wavelets for efficient similarity search of time-series: with and without time warping,FK-P Chan; AW-C Fu; Clement Yu,We address the handling of time series search based on two important distance definitions:Euclidean distance and time warping distance. The conventional method reduces thedimensionality by means of a discrete Fourier transform. We apply the Haar wavelettransform technique and propose the use of a proper normalization so that the method canguarantee no false dismissal for Euclidean distance. We found that this method hascompetitive performance from our experiments. Euclidean distance measurement cannothandle the time shifts of patterns. It fails to match the same rise and fall patterns ofsequences with different scales. A distance measure that handles this problem is the timewarping distance. However; the complexity of computing the time warping distance functionis high. Also; as time warping distance is not a metric; most indexing techniques would …,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2003,250
Scaling and time warping in time series querying,Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Eamonn Keogh; Leo Yung Lau; Chotirat Ann Ratanamahatana; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract The last few years have seen an increasing understanding that dynamic timewarping (DTW); a technique that allows local flexibility in aligning time series; is superior tothe ubiquitous Euclidean distance for time series classification; clustering; and indexing.More recently; it has been shown that for some problems; uniform scaling (US); a techniquethat allows global scaling of time series; may just be as important for some problems. In thiswork; we note that for many real world problems; it is necessary to combine both DTW andUS to achieve meaningful results. This is particularly true in domains where we mustaccount for the natural variability of human actions; including biometrics; query by humming;motion-capture/animation; and handwriting recognition. We introduce the first techniquewhich can handle both DTW and US simultaneously; our techniques involve search …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2008,216
Discovering temporal patterns for interval-based events,Po-shan Kam; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Abstract In many daily transactions; the time when an event takes place is known and storedin databases. Examples range from sales records; stock exchange; patient records; toscientific databases in geophysics and astronomy. Such databases incorporate the conceptof time which describes when an event starts and ends as historical records [9]. Thetemporal nature of data provides us with a better understanding of the trend or pattern overtime. In market-basket data; we can have a pattern like “75% of customers buy peanutswhen butter starts to be in big sales and before bread is sold out”. We observe that theremay be some correlations among peanuts; butter and bread so that we can have betterplanning for marketing strategy. Knowledge discovery in temporal databases thus catchesthe attention of researchers [8; 4].,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge discovery,2000,214
Enhanced nearest neighbour search on the R-tree,King Lum Cheung; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Abstract Multimedia databases usually deal with huge amounts of data and it is necessary tohave an indexing structure such that efficient retrieval of data can be provided. R-Tree withits variations; is a commonly cited indexing method. In this paper we propose an improvednearest neighbor search algorithm on the R-tree and its variants. The improvement lies inthe removal of two hueristics that have been used in previous R*-tree work; which we provecannot improve on the pruning power during a search.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1998,204
Anonymizing transaction databases for publication,Yabo Xu; Ke Wang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Philip S Yu,Abstract This paper considers the problem of publishing" transaction data" for researchpurposes. Each transaction is an arbitrary set of items chosen from a large universe.Detailed transaction data provides an electronic image of one's life. This has twoimplications. One; transaction data are excellent candidates for data mining research. Two;use of transaction data would raise serious concerns over individual privacy. Therefore;before transaction data is released for data mining; it must be made anonymous so that datasubjects cannot be re-identified. The challenge is that transaction data has no structure andcan be extremely high dimensional. Traditional anonymization methods lose too muchinformation on such data. To date; there has been no satisfactory privacy notion and solutionproposed for anonymizing transaction data.

Mining frequent itemsets without support threshold: with and without item constraints,Yin-Ling Cheung; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,In classical association rules mining; a minimum support threshold is assumed to beavailable for mining frequent itemsets. However; setting such a threshold is typically hard.We handle a more practical problem; roughly speaking; it is to mine N k-itemsets with thehighest supports for k up to a certain k/sub max/value. We call the results the N-mostinteresting itemsets. Generally; it is more straightforward for users to determine N and k/submax/. We propose two new algorithms; LOOPBACK and BOMO. Experiments show that ourmethods outperform the previously proposed Itemset-Loop algorithm; and the performanceof BOMO can be an order of magnitude better than the original FP-tree algorithm; even withthe assumption of an optimally chosen support threshold. We also propose the mining of" N-most interesting k-itemsets with item constraints." This allows user to specify different …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2004,156
Dynamic vp-tree indexing for n-nearest neighbor search given pair-wise distances,Ada Wai-chee Fu; Polly Mei-shuen Chan; Yin-Ling Cheung; Yiu Sang Moon,Abstract. For some multimedia applications; it has been found that domain objects cannot berepresented as feature vectors in a multidimensional space. Instead; pair-wise distancesbetween data objects are the only input. To support content-based retrieval; one approachmaps each object to ak-dimensional (kd) point and tries to preserve the distances among thepoints. Then; existing spatial access index methods such as the R-trees and KD-trees cansupport fast searching on the resulting kd points. However; information loss is inevitable withsuch an approach since the distances between data objects can only be preserved to acertain extent. Here we investigate the use of a distance-based indexing method. Inparticular; we apply the vantage point tree (vp-tree) method. There are two importantproblems for the vp-tree method that warrant further investigation; the n-nearest …,The VLDB Journal,2000,148

We employ the clusteringtechniques. Each document is represented by a feature vector. By analyzing the clustersformed by these vectors; we can assign the documents within the same cluster to the sameclass automatically. Our contributions are the following:(1) We propose a feature extractionmechanism which is more suitable to Web page classification.(2) We introduce a treestructure called the DC-tree to make the clustering process incremental and less sensitive tothe document insertion order.(3) We show with experiments on a set of Internet documentsfrom Yahoo! that the proposed clustering algorithm can classify Web pages effectively.,*,2002,136

Anonymity for continuous data publishing,Benjamin Fung; Ke Wang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jian Pei,Abstract k-anonymization is an important privacy protection mechanism in data publishing.While there has been a great deal of work in recent years; almost all considered a singlestatic release. Such mechanisms only protect the data up to the first release or first recipient.In practical applications; data is published continuously as new data arrive; the same datamay be anonymized differently for a different purpose or a different recipient. In suchscenarios; even when all releases are properly k-anonymized; the anonymity of anindividual may be unintentionally compromised if recipient cross-examines all the releasesreceived or colludes with other recipients. Preventing such attacks; called correspondenceattacks; faces major challenges. In this paper; we systematically characterize thecorrespondence attacks and propose an efficient anonymization algorithm to thwart the …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,125
Efficient anomaly monitoring over moving object trajectory streams,Yingyi Bu; Lei Chen; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Dawei Liu,Abstract Lately there exist increasing demands for online abnormality monitoring overtrajectory streams; which are obtained from moving object tracking devices. This problem ischallenging due to the requirement of high speed data processing within limited space cost.In this paper; we present a novel framework for monitoring anomalies over continuoustrajectory streams. First; we illustrate the importance of distance-based anomaly monitoringover moving object trajectories. Then; we utilize the local continuity characteristics oftrajectories to build local clusters upon trajectory streams and monitor anomalies via efficientpruning strategies. Finally; we propose a piecewise metric index structure to reschedule thejoining order of local clusters to further reduce the time cost.

Triangle listing in massive networks and its applications,Shumo Chu; James Cheng,Abstract Triangle listing is one of the fundamental algorithmic problems whose solution hasnumerous applications especially in the analysis of complex networks; such as thecomputation of clustering coefficient; transitivity; triangular connectivity; etc. Existingalgorithms for triangle listing are mainly in-memory algorithms; whose performance cannotscale with the massive volume of today's fast growing networks. When the input graphcannot fit into main memory; triangle listing requires random disk accesses that can incurprohibitively large I/O cost. Some streaming and sampling algorithms have been proposedbut these are approximation algorithms. We propose an I/O-efficient algorithm for trianglelisting. Our algorithm is exact and avoids random disk access.

However; there can be too many or too few resulting rules if the thresholdis set inappropriately. It is difficult for end-users to find the suitable threshold. In this paper;we propose a different setting in which the user does not provide a support threshold; butinstead indicates the amount of results that is required.,International symposium on methodologies for intelligent systems,2000,102

In this paper; we focus on thedensity-based notion that discovers local outliers by means of the local outlier factor (LOF)formulation. Three enhancement schemes over LOF are introduced; namely LOF'and LOF"and GridLOF. Thorough explanation and analysis is given to demonstrate the abilities ofLOF'in providing simpler and more intuitive meaning of local outlier-ness; LOF" in handlingcases where LOF fails to work appropriately; and GridLOF in improving the efficiency andaccuracy.,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2003.

Achieving k-anonymity by clustering in attribute hierarchical structures,Jiuyong Li; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jian Pei,Abstract Individual privacy will be at risk if a published data set is not properly de-identified. k-anonymity is a major technique to de-identify a data set. A more general view of k-anonymityis clustering with a constraint of the minimum number of objects in every cluster. Mostexisting approaches to achieving k-anonymity by clustering are for numerical (or ordinal)attributes. In this paper; we study achieving k-anonymity by clustering in attributehierarchical structures. We define generalisation distances between tuples to characterisedistortions by generalisations and discuss the properties of the distances. We conclude thatthe generalisation distance is a metric distance. We propose an efficient clustering-basedalgorithm for k-anonymisation.

Wedefine risk patterns by a statistical metric; relative risk; which has been widely used inepidemiological research. We characterise the problem of mining risk patterns as an optimalrule discovery problem. We study an anti-monotone property for mining optimal risk patternsets and present an algorithm to make use of the property in risk pattern discovery.

Efficient method for maximizing bichromatic reverse nearest neighbor,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; M Tamer Özsu; Philip S Yu; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Lian Liu,Abstract Bichromatic reverse nearest neighbor (BRNN) has been extensively studied inspatial database literature. In this paper; we study a related problem called MaxBRNN: findan optimal region that maximizes the size of BRNNs. Such a problem has many real lifeapplications; including the problem of finding a new server point that attracts as manycustomers as possible by proximity. A straightforward approach is to determine the BRNNsfor all possible points that are not feasible since there are a large (or infinite) number ofpossible points. To the best of our knowledge; the fastest known method has exponentialtime complexity on the data size. Based on some interesting properties of the problem; wecome up with an efficient algorithm called MaxOverlap.

They thus capture the sense of the most unusualsubsequence within a time series.

Inmany applications; some sensitive values changes freely while others never change. Forexample; in medical applications; the disease attribute changes with time when patientsrecover from one disease and develop another disease. However; patients do not recoverfrom some diseases such as HIV. We call such diseases permanent sensitive values.

Finding maximal cliques in massive networks by h*-graph,James Cheng; Yiping Ke; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Linhong Zhu,Abstract Maximal clique enumeration (MCE) is a fundamental problem in graph theory andhas important applications in many areas such as social network analysis andbioinformatics. The problem is extensively studied; however; the best existing algorithmsrequire memory space linear in the size of the input graph. This has become a seriousconcern in view of the massive volume of today's fast-growing network graphs. Since MCErequires random access to different parts of a large graph; it is difficult to divide the graphinto smaller parts and process one part at a time; because either the result may be incorrectand incomplete; or it incurs huge cost on merging the results from different parts.

However; it is noteasy for users to determine a proper frequency threshold. It is more reasonable to ask usersto set a bound on the result size. We study the problem of mining top K frequent itemsets indata streams. We introduce a method based on the Chernoff bound with a guarantee of theoutput quality and also a bound on the memory usage. We also propose an algorithm basedon the Lossy Counting Algorithm. In most of the experiments of the two proposed algorithms;we obtain perfect solutions and the memory space occupied by our algorithms is very small.Besides; we also propose the adapted approach of these two algorithms in order to handlethe case when we are interested in mining the data in a sliding window.

Clustering text data streams,Yu-Bao Liu; Jia-Rong Cai; Jian Yin; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Abstract Clustering text data streams is an important issue in data mining community andhas a number of applications such as news group filtering; text crawling; documentorganization and topic detection and tracing etc. However; most methods are similarity-based approaches and only use the TF* IDF scheme to represent the semantics of text dataand often lead to poor clustering quality. Recently; researchers argue that semanticsmoothing model is more efficient than the existing TF* IDF scheme for improving textclustering quality. However; the existing semantic smoothing model is not suitable fordynamic text data context. In this paper; we extend the semantic smoothing model into textdata streams context firstly. Based on the extended model; we then present two onlineclustering algorithms OCTS and OCTSM for the clustering of massive text data streams. In …,Journal of computer science and technology,2008,71
Capabilities of outlier detection schemes in large datasets; framework and methodologies,Jian Tang; Zhixiang Chen; Ada Waichee Fu; David W Cheung,Abstract Outlier detection is concerned with discovering exceptional behaviors of objects. Itstheoretical principle and practical implementation lay a foundation for some importantapplications such as credit card fraud detection; discovering criminal behaviors in e-commerce; discovering computer intrusion; etc. In this paper; we first present a unified modelfor several existing outlier detection schemes; and propose a compatibility theory; whichestablishes a framework for describing the capabilities for various outlier formulationschemes in terms of matching users' intuitions. Under this framework; we show that thedensity-based scheme is more powerful than the distance-based scheme when a datasetcontains patterns with diverse characteristics. The density-based scheme; however; is lesseffective when the patterns are of comparable densities with the outliers. We then …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2007,71
Efficient skyline querying with variable user preferences on nominal attributes,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jian Pei; Yip Sing Ho; Tai Wong; Yubao Liu,Abstract Current skyline evaluation techniques assume a fixed ordering on the attributes.However; dynamic preferences on nominal attributes are more realistic in knownapplications. In order to generate online response for any such preference issued by a user;one obvious solution is to enumerate all possible preferences and materialize all results ofthese preferences. However; the pre-processing and storage requirements of a fullmaterialization are typically prohibitive. Instead; we propose a semi-materialization methodcalled the IPO-tree Search which stores partial useful results only. With these partial results;the result of each possible preference can be returned efficiently. We have also conductedexperiments to show the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,70
Wat: Finding top-k discords in time series database,Yingyi Bu; Tat-Wing Leung; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Eamonn Keogh; Jian Pei; Sam Meshkin,Abstract Finding discords in time series database is an important problem in a great varietyof applications; such as space shuttle telemetry; mechanical industry; biomedicine; andfinancial data analysis. However; most previous methods for this problem suffer from toomany parameter settings which are difficult for users. The best known approach to ourknowledge that has comparatively fewer parameters still requires users to choose a wordsize for the compression of subsequences. In this paper; we propose a Haar wavelet andaugmented trie based algorithm to mine the top-K discords from a time series database;which can dynamically determine the word size for compression. Due to the characteristicsof Haar wavelet transform; our algorithm has greater pruning power than previousapproaches. Through experiments with some annotated datasets; the effectiveness and …,*,2007,70
Data mining for inventory item selection with cross-selling considerations,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang,Abstract Association rule mining; studied for over ten years in the literature of data mining;aims to help enterprises with sophisticated decision making; but the resulting rules typicallycannot be directly applied and require further processing. In this paper; we propose amethod for actionable recommendations from itemset analysis and investigate anapplication of the concepts of association rules—maximal-profit item selection with cross-selling effect (MPIS). This problem is about choosing a subset of items which can give themaximal profit with the consideration of cross-selling effect. A simple approach to thisproblem is shown to be NP-hard. A new approach is proposed with consideration of the lossrule—a rule similar to the association rule—to model the cross-selling effect. We show thatMPIS can be approximated by a quadratic programming problem. We also propose a …,Data mining and knowledge discovery,2005,68
Collective spatial keyword queries: a distance owner-driven approach,Cheng Long; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ke Wang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Abstract Recently; spatial keyword queries become a hot topic in the literature. One exampleof these queries is the collective spatial keyword query (CoSKQ) which is to find a set ofobjects in the database such that it covers a set of given keywords collectively and has thesmallest cost. Unfortunately; existing exact algorithms have severe scalability problems andexisting approximate algorithms; though scalable; cannot guarantee near-to-optimalsolutions. In this paper; we study the CoSKQ problem and address the above issues. Firstly;we consider the CoSKQ problem using an existing cost measurement called the maximumsum cost. This problem is called MaxSum-CoSKQ and is known to be NP-hard. We observethat the maximum sum cost of a set of objects is dominated by at most three objects whichwe call the distance owners of the set. Motivated by this; we propose a distance owner …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,67
Mining association rules from stars,E Ka Ka Ng; A Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang,Association rule mining is an important data mining problem. It is found to be useful forconventional relational data. However; previous work has mostly targeted on mining a singletable. In real life; a database is typically made up of multiple tables and one important caseis where some of the tables form a star schema. The tables typically correspond to entity setsand joining the tables in a star schema gives relationships among entity sets which can bevery interesting information. Hence mining on the join result is an important problem. Basedon characteristics of the star schema we propose an efficient algorithm for miningassociation rules on the join result but without actually performing the join operation. Weshow that this approach can significantly out-perform the join-then-mine approach evenwhen the latter adopts a fastest known mining algorithm.,Data Mining; 2002. ICDM 2003.

A robust outlier detection scheme for large data sets,Jian Tang; Zhixiang Chen; Ada Wai-chee Fu; David Cheung,Abstract In this paper; we first propose an outlier detection scheme that unifies severalexisting outlier detection schemes as its instances. We then focus our study on theconnectivity-based outlier factor (COF) scheme that is motivated by not only the densitymeasure of objects but also the the connectivity measure that improves the effectiveness ofthe local outlier factor (LOF) when density measure alone is not sufficient enough for outlierdetection. We present detailed theoretical analysis showing similarity and duality betweenCOF and LOF. We also prove separation theorem to exhibit that there are cases where COFis strictly more capable than LOF in outlier detection. Finally; we give empirical analysis todemonstrate the e ectiveness and the compatibility of the COF scheme in comparison withthe LOF scheme.,In 6th Pacific-Asia Conf. on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2001,66
Clustering categorical data,Yi Zhang; A Fu; C Cai; P Heng,Abstract Clustering has typically been a problem related to numerical data. However; indatabases; oftentimes the data values are categorical and cannot be assigned meaningfulnumerical substitutes. With the recent interest in data mining; we begin to question thepossibility of clustering numerical data. Following some recent work in this area; we proposean algorithm based on dynamical systems. To our knowledge; this is the rst such algorithmthat can guarantee the convergence of the dynamical system; which is a very importantproperty for successful application. We demonstrated the e ectiveness of the proposedmethod on both real data and synthetic data. We also propose a second method based on agraph partitioning approach; for which a new de nition of similarity between two nodes istailored for categorical data.,PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA ENGINEERING,2000,66
Efficient discovery of risk patterns in medical data,Jiuyong Li; Ada Wai-chee Fu; Paul Fahey,Summary Objective This paper studies a problem of efficiently discovering risk patterns inmedical data. Risk patterns are defined by a statistical metric; relative risk; which has beenwidely used in epidemiological research. Methods To avoid fruitless search in the completeexploration of risk patterns; we define optimal risk pattern set to exclude superfluouspatterns; ie complicated patterns with lower relative risk than their corresponding simplerform patterns. We prove that mining optimal risk pattern sets conforms an anti-monotoneproperty that supports an efficient mining algorithm. We propose an efficient algorithm formining optimal risk pattern sets based on this property. We also propose a hierarchicalstructure to present discovered patterns for the easy perusal by domain experts. Results Theproposed approach is compared with two well-known rule discovery methods; decision …,Artificial intelligence in medicine,2009,65
Projective clustering by histograms,Eric Ka Ka Ng; AW-C Fu; RC-W Wong,Recent research suggests that clustering for high-dimensional data should involvesearching for" hidden" subspaces with lower dimensionalities; in which patterns can beobserved when data objects are projected onto the subspaces. Discovering suchinterattribute correlations and location of the corresponding clusters is known as theprojective clustering problem. We propose an efficient projective clustering technique byhistogram construction (EPCH). The histograms help to generate" signatures"; where asignature corresponds to some region in some subspace; and signatures with a largenumber of data objects are identified as the regions for subspace clusters. Hence; projectedclusters and their corresponding subspaces can be uncovered. Compared to the bestprevious methods to our knowledge; this approach is more flexible in that less prior …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2005,65
Active spectral clustering,Xiang Wang; Ian Davidson,The technique of spectral clustering is widely used to segment a range of data from graphsto images. Our work marks a natural progression of spectral clustering from the originalpassive unsupervised formulation to our active semi-supervised formulation. We follow thewidely used area of constrained clustering and allow supervision in the form of pair wiserelations between two nodes: Must-Link and Cannot-Link. Unlike most previous constrainedclustering work; our constraints are specified incrementally by querying an oracle (domainexpert). Since in practice; each query comes with a cost; our goal is to maximally improvethe result with as few queries as possible. The advantages of our approach include: 1) it isprincipled by querying the constraints which maximally reduce the expected error; 2) it canincorporate both hard and soft constraints which are prevalent in practice.

On efficient spatial matching,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Yufei Tao; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract This paper proposes and solves a new problem called spatial matching (SPM). LetP and O be two sets of objects in an arbitrary metric space; where object distances aredefined according to a norm satisfying the triangle inequality. Each object in O represents acustomer; and each object in P indicates a service provider; which has a capacitycorresponding to the maximum number of customers that can be supported by the provider.SPM assigns each customer to her/his nearest provider; among all the providers whosecapacities have not been exhausted in serving other closer customers. We elaborate theapplications where SPM is useful; and develop algorithms that settle this problem with alinear number O (| P|+| O|) of nearest neighbor queries.

Publishing sensitive transactions for itemset utility,Yabo Xu; Benjamin CM Fung; Ke Wang; Ada WC Fu; Jian Pei,We consider the problem of publishing sensitive transaction data with privacy preservation.High dimensionality of transaction data poses unique challenges on data privacy and datautility. On one hand; re-identification attacks tend to use a subset of items that infrequentlyoccur in transactions; called moles. On the other hand; data mining applications typicallydepend on subsets of items that frequently occur in transactions; called nuggets. Thus theproblem is how to eliminate all moles while retaining nuggets as much as possible. Achallenge is that moles and nuggets are multi-dimensional with exponential growth and aretangled together by shared items. We present a novel and scalable solution to this problem.The novelty lies in a compact border data structure that eliminates the need of generating allmoles and nuggets.,Data Mining; 2008. ICDM'08.

Finding maximal cliques in massive networks,James Cheng; Yiping Ke; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Linhong Zhu,Abstract Maximal clique enumeration is a fundamental problem in graph theory and hasimportant applications in many areas such as social network analysis and bioinformatics.The problem is extensively studied; however; the best existing algorithms require memoryspace linear in the size of the input graph. This has become a serious concern in view of themassive volume of today's fast-growing networks. We propose a general framework fordesigning external-memory algorithms for maximal clique enumeration in large graphs. Thegeneral framework enables maximal clique enumeration to be processed recursively insmall subgraphs of the input graph; thus allowing in-memory computation of maximalcliques without the costly random disk access. We prove that the set of cliques obtained bythe recursive local computation is both correct (ie; globally maximal) and complete. The …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2011,58
Anonymization by local recoding in data with attribute hierarchical taxonomies,Jiuyong Li; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jian Pei,Individual privacy will be at risk if a published data set is not properly deidentified. k-anonymity is a major technique to de-identify a data set. Among a number of k-anonymization schemes; local recoding methods are promising for minimizing the distortionof a k-anonymity view. This paper addresses two major issues in local recoding k-anonymization in attribute hierarchical taxonomies. First; we define a proper distance metricto achieve local recoding generalization with small distortion. Second; we propose a meansto control the inconsistency of attribute domains in a generalized view by local recoding.

Utility-based anonymization for privacy preservation with less information loss,Jian Xu; Wei Wang; Jian Pei; Xiaoyuan Wang; Baile Shi; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Abstract Privacy becomes a more and more serious concern in applications involvingmicrodata. Recently; efficient anonymization has attracted much research work. Most of theprevious methods use global recoding; which maps the domains of the quasi-identifierattributes to generalized or changed values. However; global recoding may not alwaysachieve effective anonymization in terms of discernability and query answering accuracyusing the anonymized data. Moreover; anonymized data is often used for analysis. As wellaccepted in many analytical applications; different attributes in a data set may have differentutility in the analysis. The utility of attributes has not been considered in the previousmethods. In this paper; we study the problem of utility-based anonymization. First; wepropose a simple framework to specify utility of attributes. The framework covers both …,ACM Sigkdd Explorations Newsletter,2006,56

Delay-optimal quorum consensus for distributed systems,Ada Waichee Fu,Given a set of nodes S; a coterie is a set of pairwise intersecting subsets of S. Each elementin a coterie is called a quorum. Mutual exclusion in a distributed system can be achieved ifeach request is required to gel consensus from a quorum of nodes. This technique ofquorum consensus is also used for replicated distributed database systems; and bicoteriesand wr-coteries have been defined to capture the requirements of read and write operationsin user transactions. The author is interested in finding coteries; bicoteries; and wr-coterieswith optimal communication delay. The protocols take into account the network topology.They design delay-optimal quorum consensus protocols for network topologies of trees;rings; and clustered networks.,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,1997,51
Non-rigid image registration of brain magnetic resonance images using graph-cuts,Ronald WK So; Tommy WH Tang; Albert CS Chung,Abstract We present a graph-cuts based method for non-rigid medical image registration onbrain magnetic resonance images. In this paper; the non-rigid medical image registrationproblem is reformulated as a discrete labeling problem. Based on a voxel-to-voxel intensitysimilarity measure; each voxel in the source image is assigned a displacement label; whichrepresents a displacement vector indicating which position in the floating image it is spatiallycorresponding to. In the proposed method; a smoothness constraint based on the firstderivative is used to penalize sharp changes in the adjacent displacement labels acrossvoxels. The image registration problem is therefore modeled by two energy terms based onintensity similarity and smoothness of the displacement field. These energy terms aresubmodular and can be optimized by using the graph-cuts method via α‐expansions …,Pattern Recognition,2011,50
Can the utility of anonymized data be used for privacy breaches?,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang; Philip S Yu; Jian Pei,Abstract Group based anonymization is the most widely studied approach for privacy-preserving data publishing. Privacy models/definitions using group based anonymizationincludes k-anonymity; l-diversity; and t-closeness; to name a few. The goal of this article is toraise a fundamental issue regarding the privacy exposure of the approaches using groupbased anonymization. This has been overlooked in the past. The group basedanonymization approach by bucketization basically hides each individual record behind agroup to preserve data privacy. If not properly anonymized; patterns can actually be derivedfrom the published data and be used by an adversary to breach individual privacy.

Finding time series discords based on haar transform,Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Oscar Tat-Wing Leung; Eamonn Keogh; Jessica Lin,Abstract The problem of finding anomaly has received much attention recently. However;most of the anomaly detection algorithms depend on an explicit definition of anomaly; whichmay be impossible to elicit from a domain expert. Using discords as anomaly detectors isuseful since less parameter setting is required. Keogh et al proposed an efficient method forsolving this problem. However; their algorithm requires users to choose the word size for thecompression of subsequences. In this paper; we propose an algorithm which candynamically determine the word size for compression. Our method is based on someproperties of the Haar wavelet transformation. Our experiments show that this method ishighly effective.,International Conference on Advanced Data Mining and Applications,2006,50
Mining changes of classification by correspondence tracing,Ke Wang; Senqiang Zhou; Chee Ada Fu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract We study the problem of mining changes of classification characteristics as the datachanges. Available are an old classifier; representing previous knowledge aboutclassification characteristics; and a new data. We want to find the changes of classificationcharacteristics in the new data. An example of such changes is “members with a large familyno longer shop frequently; but they used to”. Finding this kind of changes holds the key forthe organization to adopt to the changed environment and stay ahead of competitors. Thechallenge is that it is difficult to see what has really changed from comparing the old andnew classifiers that could be very large and different. In this paper; we propose a techniqueto identify such changes. The idea is tracing the characteristics; in the old and newclassifiers; that correspond to each other by classifying the same examples.

Online anonymity for personalized web services,Yabo Xu; Ke Wang; Guoliang Yang; Ada WC Fu,Abstract To receive personalized web services; the user has to provide personal informationand preferences; in addition to the query itself; to the web service. However; detailedpersonal information could identify the sender of sensitive queries; thus compromise userprivacy. We propose the notion of online anonymity to enable users to issue personalizedqueries to an untrusted web service while with their anonymity preserved. The challenge forproviding online anonymity is dealing with unknown and dynamic web users who can getonline and offline at any time. We define this problem; discuss its implications anddifferences from the problems in the literature; and propose a solution.,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,48
Efficient rule-based attribute-oriented induction for data mining,David W Cheung; HY Hwang; Ada W Fu; Jiawei Han,Abstract Data mining has become an important technique which has tremendous potential inmany commercial and industrial applications. Attribute-oriented induction is a powerfulmining technique and has been successfully implemented in the data mining systemDBMiner (Han et al. Proc. 1996 Int'l Conf. on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery(KDD'96); Portland; Oregon; 1996). However; its induction capability is limited by theunconditional concept generalization. In this paper; we extend the concept generalization torule-based concept hierarchy; which enhances greatly its induction power. When previouslyproposed induction algorithm is applied to the more general rule-based case; a problem ofinduction anomaly occurs which impacts its efficiency.

Finding Structure and Characteristics of Web Documents for Classification.,Wai-ching Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Abstract Many Web documents containing the same type of information; would have similarstructure. In this paper; we examine the problem of finding the structure of web documentsand present a hierarchical structure to represent the relation among text data in the webdocuments. Due to the loose standard of web page publishing; different authors can usedifferent wordings (labels) to label the same information. We introduced a labels discoveryalgorithm that uses the hierarchical structure extracted from the web pages. The algorithmdiscovers similar labels which describe the same kind of information. Such labels wouldhelp us find the structure of the web documents. Experiments have shown that the algorithmcan successfully discover similar labels and the structure obtained by our method candistinguish web pages accurately.,ACM SIGMOD Workshop on Research Issues in Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2000,47

The proposed resourceplacement strategy; with better results than existing works; can be generally applied inrandomized P2P systems (Symphony) and deterministic P2P systems (eg; Chord; Pastry;Tapestry; etc.). We apply the proposed resource placement strategy; respectively; to twonovel applications: PCache (a P2P-based caching scheme) and PRing (a P2P ringstructure). The simulation results as well as a real deployment on Planetlab demonstrate theeffectiveness of the proposed resource placement strategy in reducing the average searchcost of the whole system.,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2010,42

Quite a number of indexeshave been proposed to answer such distance queries. However; all of these indexes canonly process graphs of size barely up to 1 million vertices; which is rather small in view ofmany of the fast-growing real-world graphs today such as social networks and Web graphs.We propose an efficient index; which is a novel labeling scheme based on the independentset of a graph. We show that our method can handle graphs of size orders of magnitudelarger than existing indexes.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,40

We model typicality in large data sets systematically. To answerquestions like" Who are the top-k most typical NBA players?"; the measure of simpletypicality is developed. To answer questions like" Who are the top-k most typical guardsdistinguishing guards from other players?"; the notion of discriminative typicality is proposed.Computing the exact answer to a top-k typicality query requires quadratic time which is oftentoo costly for online query answering on large databases.

MPIS: Maximal-profit item selection with cross-selling considerations,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang,In the literature of data mining; many different algorithms for association rule mining havebeen proposed. However; there is relatively little study on how association rules can aid inmore specific targets. One of the applications for association rules-maximal-profit itemselection with cross-selling effect (MPIS) problem-is investigated. The problem is aboutselecting a subset of items; which can give the maximal profit with the consideration of cross-selling. We prove that a simple version of this problem is NP-hard. We propose a newapproach to the problem with the consideration of the loss rule-a kind of association rule tomodel the cross-selling effect. We show that the problem can be transformed to a quadraticprogramming problem. In case quadratic programming is not applicable; we also propose aheuristic approach. Experiments are conducted to show that both of the proposed …,Data Mining; 2003. ICDM 2003. Third IEEE International Conference on,2003,40

Efficient simrank-based similarity join over large graphs,Weiguo Zheng; Lei Zou; Yansong Feng; Lei Chen; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract Graphs have been widely used to model complex data in many real-worldapplications. Answering vertex join queries over large graphs is meaningful and interesting;which can benefit friend recommendation in social networks and link prediction; etc. In thispaper; we adopt" SimRank" to evaluate the similarity of two vertices in a large graphbecause of its generality. Note that" SimRank" is purely structure dependent and it does notrely on the domain knowledge. Specifically; we define a SimRank-based join (SRJ) query tofind all the vertex pairs satisfying the threshold in a data graph G. In order to reduce thesearch space; we propose an estimated shortest-path distance based upper bound forSimRank scores to prune unpromising vertex pairs. In the verification; we propose a novelindex; called h-go cover; to efficiently compute the SimRank score of a single vertex pair …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,37
GBLENDER: towards blending visual query formulation and query processing in graph databases,Changjiu Jin; Sourav S Bhowmick; Xiaokui Xiao; James Cheng; Byron Choi,Abstract Given a graph database D and a query graph g; an exact subgraph matching queryasks for the set S of graphs in D that contain g as a subgraph. This type of queries findimportant applications in several domains such as bioinformatics and chemoinformatics;where users are generally not familiar with complex graph query languages. Consequently;user-friendly visual interfaces which support query graph construction can reduce theburden of data retrieval for these users. Existing techniques for subgraph matching queriesbuilt on top of such visual framework are designed to optimize the time required in retrievingthe result set S from D; assuming that the whole query graph has been constructed. Thisleads to sub-optimal system response time as the query processing is initiated only after theuser has finished drawing the query graph.

Cyclic-cubes: A new family of interconnection networks of even fixed-degrees,Ada Wai-chee Fu; Siu-Cheung Chau,We introduce a new family of interconnection networks that are Cayley graphs with fixeddegrees of any even number greater than or equal to four. We call the proposed graphscyclic-cubes because contracting some cycles in such a graph results in a generalizedhypercube. These Cayley graphs have optimal fault tolerance and logarithmic diameters.For comparable number of nodes; a cyclic-cube can have a diameter smaller thanpreviously known fixed-degree networks. The proposed graphs can adopt an optimumrouting algorithm known for one of its subfamilies of Cayley graphs. We also show that agraph in the new family has a Hamiltonian cycle and; hence; there is an embedding of aring. Embedding of meshes and hypercubes are also discussed.,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,1998,37
Optimal proactive caching in peer-to-peer network: analysis and application,Weixiong Rao; Lei Chen; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; YingYi Bu,Abstract As a promising new technology with the unique properties like high efficiency;scalability and fault tolerance; Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technology is used as the underlyingnetwork to build new Internet-scale applications. However; one of the well known issues insuch an application (for example WWW) is that the distribution of data popularities is heavilytailed with a Zipf-like distribution. With consideration of the skewed popularity we adopt aproactive caching approach to handle the challenge; and focus on two key problems: where(ie the placement strategy: where to place the replicas) and how (ie the degree problem:how many replicas are assigned to one specific content)? For the where problem; wepropose a novel approach which can be generally applied to structured P2P networks. Next;we solve two optimization objectives related to the how problem: MAX_PERF and …,Proceedings of the sixteenth ACM conference on Conference on information and knowledge management,2007,36
Fast graph query processing with a low-cost index,James Cheng; Yiping Ke; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract This paper studies the problem of processing supergraph queries; that is; given adatabase containing a set of graphs; find all the graphs in the database of which the querygraph is a supergraph. Existing works usually construct an index and performs a filtering-and-verification process; which still requires many subgraph isomorphism testings. Thereare also significant overheads in both index construction and maintenance. In this paper; wedesign a graph querying system that achieves both fast indexing and efficient queryprocessing. The index is constructed by a simple but fast method of extracting thecommonality among the graphs; which does not involve any costly operation such as graphmining. Our query processing has two key techniques; direct inclusion and filtering. Directinclusion allows partial query answers to be included directly without candidate …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2011,35
A survey of transfer and multitask learning in bioinformatics,Qian Xu; Qiang Yang,Abstract Machine learning and data mining have found many applications in biologicaldomains; where we look to build predictive models based on labeled training data.However; in practice; high quality labeled data is scarce; and to label new data incurs highcosts. Transfer and multitask learning offer an attractive alternative; by allowing usefulknowledge to be extracted and transferred from data in auxiliary domains helps counter thelack of data problem in the target domain. In this article; we survey recent advances intransfer and multitask learning for bioinformatics applications. In particular; we surveyseveral key bioinformatics application areas; including sequence classification; geneexpression data analysis; biological network reconstruction and biomedical applications.,Journal of Computing Science and Engineering,2011,35
On efficient content matching in distributed pub/sub systems,Weixiong Rao; Lei Chen; AW-C Fu; Hanhua Chen; Futai Zou,The efficiency of matching structures is the key issue for content publish/subscribe systems.In this paper; we propose an efficient matching tree structure; named CobasTree; for adistributed environment. Particularly; we model a predicate in each subscription filter as aninterval and published content value as a data point. The CobasTree is designed to index allsubscription intervals and a matching algorithm is proposed to match the data points tothese indexed intervals. Through a set of techniques including selective multicast bybounding intervals; cost model-based interval division; and CobasTree merging; CobasTreecan match the published contents against subscription filters with a high efficiency. We callthe whole framework including CobasTree and the associated techniques as COBAS. Theperformance evaluation in simulation environment and PlanetLab environment shows …,INFOCOM 2009; IEEE,2009,35
TF-Label: a topological-folding labeling scheme for reachability querying in a large graph,James Cheng; Silu Huang; Huanhuan Wu; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Abstract Reachability querying is a basic graph operation with numerous importantapplications in databases; network analysis; computational biology; software engineering;etc. Although many indexes have been proposed to answer reachability queries; most ofthem are only efficient for handling relatively small graphs. We propose TF-label; an efficientand scalable labeling scheme for processing reachability queries. TF-label is constructedbased on a novel topological folding (TF) that recursively folds an input graph into half so asto reduce the label size; thus improving query efficiency. We show that TF-label is efficient toconstruct and propose efficient algorithms and optimization schemes. Our experiments verifythat TF-label is significantly more scalable and efficient than the state-of-the-art methods inboth index construction and query processing.,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,34
Privacy-preserving frequent pattern mining across private databases,AW-C Fu; RC-W Wong; Ke Wang,Privacy consideration has much significance in the application of data mining. It is veryimportant that the privacy of individual parties is not exposed when data mining techniquesare applied to a large collection of data about the parties. In many scenarios such as datawarehousing or data integration; data from the different parties form a many-to-manyschema. This paper addresses the problem of privacy-preserving frequent pattern mining insuch a schema across two dimension sites. We assume that sites are not trusted and theyare semi-honest. Our method is based on the concept of semi-join and does not involve dataencryption which is used in most previous work. Experiments are conducted to study theefficiency of the proposed models.,Data Mining; Fifth IEEE International Conference on,2005,34
Ix-cubes: iceberg cubes for data warehousing and olap on xml data,Fianny Ming-fei Jiang; Jian Pei; Ada Wai-chee Fu,Abstract With increasing amount of data being stored in XML format; OLAP queries overthese data become important. OLAP queries have been well studied in the relationaldatabase systems. However; the evaluation of OLAP queries over XML data is not a trivialextension of the relational solutions; especially when a schema is not available. In thispaper; we introduce the IX-cube (Iceberg XML cube) over XML data to tackle the problem.We extend OLAP operations to XML data. We also develop efficient approaches to IX-Cubecomputation and OLAP query evaluation using IX-cubes.,Proceedings of the sixteenth ACM conference on Conference on information and knowledge management,2007,32
Mining vague association rules,An Lu; Yiping Ke; James Cheng; Wilfred Ng,Abstract In many online shopping applications; traditional Association Rule (AR) mining haslimitations as it only deals with the items that are sold but ignores the items that are almostsold. For example; those items that are put into the basket but not checked out. We say thatthose almost sold items carry hesitation information since customers are hesitating to buythem. The hesitation information of items is valuable knowledge for the design of goodselling strategies. We apply vague set theory in the context of AR mining as to incorporatethe hesitation information into the ARs. We define the concepts of attractiveness andhesitation of an item; which represent the overall information of a customer's intent on anitem. Based on these two concepts; we propose the notion of Vague Association Rules(VARs) and devise an efficient algorithm to mine the VARs. Our experiments show that …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,32
A transaction replication scheme for a replicated database with node autonomy,Ada Wai-Chee Fu; David Wai-Lok Cheung,Abstract Many proposed protocols for replicated databases consider centralized control ofeach transaction so that given a transaction; some site will monitor the remote data accessand transaction commit. We consider the ap preach of broadcasting transactions to remotesites and handling these transactions in their complete form at each site. We consider dataof two types: shared-private data and public data and show that transactions working only onshared-private data can be executed under a local concurrency control protocol. We assumea synchronized network with possibilities of partition failures. We show that in our schemetransaction execution can be managed with less communication delay compared tocentralized transaction control.,VLDB,1994,30
Online skyline analysis with dynamic preferences on nominal attributes,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Jian Pei; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang,The importance of skyline analysis has been well recognized in multi-criteria decisionmaking applications. All of the previous studies assume a fixed order on the attributes inquestion. However; in some applications; users may be interested in skylines with respect tovarious total or partial orders on nominal attributes. In this paper; we identify and tackle theproblem of online skyline analysis with dynamic preferences on nominal attributes. Weinvestigate how changes of orders in attributes lead to changes of skylines. We address twonovel types of interesting queries: a viewpoint query returns with respect to which orders apoint is (or is not) in the skylines and an order-based skyline query retrieves the skyline withrespect to a specific order. We develop two methods systematically and report an extensiveperformance study using both synthetic and real data sets to verify their effectiveness and …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2009,29
Mining favorable facets,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Jian Pei; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang,Abstract The importance of dominance and skyline analysis has been well recognized inmulti-criteria decision making applications. Most previous studies assume a fixed order onthe attributes. In practice; different customers may have different preferences on nominalattributes. In this paper; we identify an interesting data mining problem; finding favorablefacets; which has not been studied before. Given a set of points in a multidimensional space;for a specific target point p we want to discover with respect to which combinations of orders(eg; customer preferences) on the nominal attributes p is not dominated by any other points.Such combinations are called the favorable facets of p. We consider both the effectivenessand the efficiency of the mining. A given point may have many favorable facets.

Global privacy guarantee in serial data publishing,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jia Liu; Ke Wang; Yabo Xu,While previous works on privacy-preserving serial data publishing consider the scenariowhere sensitive values may persist over multiple data releases; we find that no previouswork has sufficient protection provided for sensitive values that can change over time; whichshould be the more common case. In this work; we propose to study the privacy guaranteefor such transient sensitive values; which we call the global guarantee. We formally definethe problem for achieving this guarantee. We show that the data satisfying the globalguarantee also satisfies a privacy guarantee commonly adopted in the privacy literaturecalled the local guarantee.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,28
Hierarchical classification of documents with error control,Chun-hung Cheng; Jian Tang; Ada Wai-chee Fu; Irwin King,Abstract Classification is a function that matches a new object with one of the predefinedclasses. Document classification is characterized by the large number of attributes involvedin the objects (documents). The traditional method of building a single classifier to do all theclassification work would incur a high overhead. Hierarchical classification is a more efficientmethod—instead of a single classifier; we use a set of classifiers distributed over a classtaxonomy; one for each internal node. However; once a misclassification occurs at a highlevel class; it may result in a class that is far apart from the correct one. An existing approachto coping with this problem requires terms also to be arranged hierarchically. In this paper;instead of overhauling the classifier itself; we propose mechanisms to detectmisclassification and take appropriate actions. We then discuss an alternative that masks …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2001,28
Redundancy-aware maximal cliques,Jia Wang; James Cheng; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Abstract Recent research efforts have made notable progress in improving the performanceof (exhaustive) maximal clique enumeration (MCE). However; existing algorithms still sufferfrom exploring the huge search space of MCE. Furthermore; their results are oftenundesirable as many of the returned maximal cliques have large overlapping parts. Thisredundancy leads to problems in both computational efficiency and usefulness of MCE. Inthis paper; we aim at providing a concise and complete summary of the set of maximalcliques; which is useful to many applications. We propose the notion of τ-visible MCE toachieve this goal and design algorithms to realize the notion. Based on the refined outputspace; we further consider applications including an efficient computation of the top-k resultswith diversity and an interactive clique exploration process.

Efficient Algorithms for Attribute-Oriented Induction.,Hoi-Yee Hwang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Abstract Data mining or knowledge discovery in databases is the search for relationshipsand global patterns that exist but are hidden in large databases. Many different methodshave been proposed and one of them is the attribute-oriented induction method. In thismethod; domain knowledge in the form of concept hierarchies helps to generalize theconcepts of the attributes in the database relations. This approach has been generalized tothe rule-based attribute-oriented induction. The time complexity of the original algorithms isgiven by O (N log N); where N is the number of relevant tuples in the database. In this paper;we make use of the static property of the database schema and the concept hierarchies toderive more efficient algorithms. Given that the concept hierarchies and the resultingknowledge are small in size compared to the database; the complexity of our algorithm is …,KDD,1995,26

Top-k typicality queries and efficient query answering methods on large databases,Ming Hua; Jian Pei; Ada WC Fu; Xuemin Lin; Ho-Fung Leung,Abstract Finding typical instances is an effective approach to understand and analyze largedata sets. In this paper; we apply the idea of typicality analysis from psychology andcognitive science to database query answering; and study the novel problem of answeringtop-k typicality queries. We model typicality in large data sets systematically. Three types oftop-k typicality queries are formulated. To answer questions like “Who are the top-k mosttypical NBA players?”; the measure of simple typicality is developed. To answer questionslike “Who are the top-k most typical guards distinguishing guards from other players?”; thenotion of discriminative typicality is proposed. Moreover; to answer questions like “Who arethe best k typical guards in whole representing different types of guards?”; the notion ofrepresentative typicality is used.

Anonymization-based attacks in privacy-preserving data publishing,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang; Jian Pei,Abstract Data publishing generates much concern over the protection of individual privacy.Recent studies consider cases where the adversary may possess different kinds ofknowledge about the data. In this article; we show that knowledge of the mechanism oralgorithm of anonymization for data publication can also lead to extra information that assiststhe adversary and jeopardizes individual privacy. In particular; all known mechanisms try tominimize information loss and such an attempt provides a loophole for attacks. We call suchan attack a minimality attack. In this article; we introduce a model called m-confidentialitywhich deals with minimality attacks; and propose a feasible solution. Our experiments showthat minimality attacks are practical concerns on real datasets and that our algorithm canprevent such attacks with very little overhead and information loss.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2009,24
Mining top-k itemsets over a sliding window based on zipfian distribution,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Abstract Frequent pattern discovery in data streams can be very useful in differentapplications. In time critical applications; a sliding window model is needed to discount staledata. In this paper; we adopt this model to mine the K most interesting itemsets; or toestimate the K most frequent itemsets of different sizes in a data stream. In our method; thesliding window is partitioned into buckets. We maintain the statistics of the frequency countsof the itemsets for the transactions in each bucket. We prove that our algorithm guaranteesno false negatives for any data distributions. We also show that the number of false positivesreturned is typically small according to Zipfian Distribution. Our experiments on syntheticdata show that the memory used by our method is tens of times smaller than that of a naiveapproach; and the false positives are negligible.,*,2005,24

Integration and efficient lookup of compressed xml accessibility maps,Mingfei Jiang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,XML is emerging as a useful platform-independent data representation language. As moreand more XML data is shared across data sources; it becomes important to consider theissue of XML access control. One promising approach to store the accessibility information isbased on the CAM (compressed accessibility map). We make two advancements in thisdirection: 1) Previous work suggests that for each user group and each operation type; adifferent CAM is built. We observe that the performance and storage requirements can befurther improved by combining multiple CAMs into an ICAM (integrated CAM). We explorethis possibility and propose an integration mechanism. 2) If the change in structure of theXML data is not frequent; we suggest an efficient lookup method; which can be applied toCAMs or ICAMs; with a much lower time complexity compared to the previous approach …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2005,23
Modeling and efficient mining of intentional knowledge of outliers,Zhixiang Chen; Jian Tang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,In this paper; we study in a general setting the notion of outliered patterns as intentionalknowledge of outliers and algorithms to mine those patterns. Our contributions consist of amodel for defining outliered patterns with the help of categorical and behavioral similaritiesof outliers; and efficient algorithms for mining knowledge sets of distance-based outliers andoutliered patterns. Our algorithms require only very limited domain knowledge; and noclassified information. We also present an empirical study to show the feasibility of ouralgorithms.,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2003. Proceedings. Seventh International,2003,23
Maximizing bichromatic reverse nearest neighbor for lp-norm in two-and three-dimensional spaces,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; M Tamer Özsu; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Philip S Yu; Lian Liu; Yubao Liu,Abstract Bichromatic reverse nearest neighbor (BRNN) has been extensively studied inspatial database literature. In this paper; we study a related problem called MaxBRNN: findan optimal region that maximizes the size of BRNNs for L p-norm in two-and three-dimensional spaces. Such a problem has many real-life applications; including the problemof finding a new server point that attracts as many customers as possible by proximity. Astraightforward approach is to determine the BRNNs for all possible points that are notfeasible since there are a large (or infinite) number of possible points. To the best of ourknowledge; there are no existing algorithms which solve MaxBRNN for any L p-norm spaceof two-and three-dimensionality. Based on some interesting properties of the problem; wecome up with an efficient algorithm called MaxOverlap for to solve this problem.

Correlated pattern mining in quantitative databases,Yiping Ke; James Cheng; Wilfred Ng,Abstract We study mining correlations from quantitative databases and show that this is amore effective approach than mining associations to discover useful patterns. We proposethe novel notion of quantitative correlated pattern (QCP); which is founded on two formalconcepts; mutual information and all-confidence. We first devise a normalization on mutualinformation and apply it to the problem of QCP mining to capture the dependency betweenthe attributes. We further adopt all-confidence as a quality measure to ensure; at a finergranularity; the dependency between the attributes with specific quantitative intervals. Wealso propose an effective supervised method that combines the consecutive intervals of thequantitative attributes based on mutual information; such that the interval-combining isguided by the dependency between the attributes.

On complementarity of cluster and outlier detection schemes,Zhixiang Chen; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jian Tang,Abstract We are interested in the problem of outlier detection; which is the discovery of datathat deviate a lot from other data patterns. Hawkins [7] characterizes an outlier in a quiteintuitive way as follows: An outlier is an observation that deviates so much from otherobservations as to arouse suspicion that it was generated by a different mechanism.,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2003,21
Join index hierarchy: An indexing structure for efficient navigation in object-oriented databases,Jiawen Han; Zhaohui Xie; Yongjian Fu,A novel indexing structure-the join index hierarchy-is proposed to handle the" gotos on disk"problem in object-oriented query processing. The method constructs a hierarchy of joinindices and transforms a sequence of pointer-chasing operations into a simple search in anappropriate join index file; and thus accelerates navigation in object-oriented databases.The method extends the join index structure studied in relational and spatial databases;supports both forward and backward navigation among objects and classes; and localizesupdate propagations in the hierarchy. Our performance study shows that a partial join indexhierarchy outperforms several other indexing mechanisms in object-oriented queryprocessing.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1999,21
Hop doubling label indexing for point-to-point distance querying on scale-free networks,Minhao Jiang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Yanyan Xu,Abstract We study the problem of point-to-point distance querying for massive scale-freegraphs; which is important for numerous applications. Given a directed or undirected graph;we propose to build an index for answering such queries based on a novel hop-doublinglabeling technique. We derive bounds on the index size; the computation costs and I/O costsbased on the properties of unweighted scale-free graphs. We show that our method is muchmore efficient and effective compared to the state-of-the-art techniques; in terms of bothquerying time and indexing costs. Our empirical study shows that our method can handlegraphs that are orders of magnitude larger than existing methods.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,20
(α; k)-anonymous data publishing,Raymond Wong; Jiuyong Li; Ada Fu; Ke Wang,Abstract Privacy preservation is an important issue in the release of data for miningpurposes. The k-anonymity model has been introduced for protecting individualidentification. Recent studies show that a more sophisticated model is necessary to protectthe association of individuals to sensitive information. In this paper; we propose an (α; k)-anonymity model to protect both identifications and relationships to sensitive information indata. We discuss the properties of (α; k)-anonymity model. We prove that the optimal (α; k)-anonymity problem is NP-hard. We first present an optimal global-recoding method for the(α; k)-anonymity problem. Next we propose two scalable local-recoding algorithms whichare both more scalable and result in less data distortion. The effectiveness and efficiency areshown by experiments.

Damping-ratio measurements by the spectral-ratio method,Yu-Hsing Wang; Wai Man Yan; Kai Fung Lo,In this paper; bender elements are used as sensors to measure the damping ratio of soil bythe spectral-ratio method. The results of numerical and physical experiments suggest thatadequate measurement precision can be achieved by reducing the two types of inherentbiases arising from (i) the near-field effect and (ii) the different transfer functions of the tworeceiver bender elements. The first bias can be avoided by setting sensors to r 1/λ≥ 2.0 andr 1/r 2≥ 2.0; where r 1 and r 2 are the distances between the source and the first and secondreceivers; respectively; and λ is the wavelength. The second bias can be minimized bymodifying the original spectral-ratio method to accommodate the self-healing technique.

Diamond quorum consensus for high capacity and efficiency in a replicated database system,Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Yat Sheung Wong; Man Hon Wong,Abstract Many quorum consensus protocols have been proposed for the management ofreplicated data in a distributed environment. The advantages of a replicated databasesystem over a non-replicated one include high availability and low response time. We notefurther that the multiple sites can act as multiple agents so that at any time; multiple requestscan be handled in parallel. This feature leads to the desirable consequence of highworkload capacity. In this paper; we define a new metric of read-capacity for this feature. Wepropose a new protocol called diamond quorum consensus which has two major propertiesthat are superior to the previous protocols of majority; tree; grid; and hierarchical quorumconsensus:(1) it has the highest read-capacity;(2) it has the smallest optimal read quorumsize of 2. We show that these two features are achievable without jeopardizing the …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2000,20
STAIRS: Towards efficient full-text filtering and dissemination in DHT environments,Weixiong Rao; Lei Chen; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Abstract Nowadays" live" content; such as weblog; wikipedia; and news; is ubiquitous in theInternet. Providing users with relevant content in a timely manner becomes a challengingproblem. Differing from Web search technologies and RSS feeds/reader applications; thispaper envisions a personalized full-text content filtering and dissemination system in ahighly distributed environment such as a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) based Peer-to-Peer(P2P) Network. Users subscribe to their interested content by specifying input keywords andthresholds as filters. Then; content is disseminated to those users having interest in it. In theliterature; full-text document publishing in DHTs has suffered for a long time from the highcost of forwarding a document to home nodes of all distinct terms. It is aggravated by the factthat a document contains a large number of distinct terms (typically tens or thousands of …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2011,19
ff-anonymity: When quasi-identifiers are missing,Ke Wang; Yabo Xu; Ada WC Fu; Raymond CW Wong,Existing approaches on privacy-preserving data publishing rely on the assumption that datacan be divided into quasi-identifier attributes (QI) and sensitive attribute (SA). Thisassumption does not hold when an attribute has both sensitive values and identifyingvalues; which is typically the case. In this paper; we study how such attributes would impactthe privacy model and data anonymization. We identify a new form of attacks; called"freeform attacks"; that occur on such data without explicit QI attributes and SA attributes. Wepresent a framework for modeling identifying/sensitive information at the value level; definea problem to eliminate freeform attacks; and outline an efficient solution.,Data Engineering; 2009.

Exact top-k nearest keyword search in large networks,Minhao Jiang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract Top-k nearest keyword search has been of interest because of applications rangingfrom road network location search by keyword to search of information on an RDFrepository. We consider the evaluation of a query with a given vertex and a keyword; and theproblem is to find a set of $ k $ nearest vertices that contain the keyword. The knownalgorithms for handling this problem only give approximate answers. In this paper; wepropose algorithms for top-k nearest keyword search that provide exact solutions and whichhandle networks of very large sizes. We have also verified the performance of our solutionscompared with the best-known approximation algorithms with experiments on real datasets.,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,15
Anonymizing temporal data,Ke Wang; Yabo Xu; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Temporal data are time-critical in that the snapshot at each timestamp must be madeavailable to researchers in a timely fashion. However; due to the limited data; each snapshotlikely has a skewed distribution on sensitive values; which renders classical anonymizationmethods not possible. In this work; we propose the “reposition model” to allow a record to bepublished within a close proximity of original timestamp. We show that reposition over asmall proximity of timestamp is sufficient for reducing the skewness of a snapshot; therefore;minimizing the impact on window queries. We formalize the optimal reposition problem andpresent a linear-time solution. The contribution of this work is that it enables classicalmethods on temporal data.,Data Mining (ICDM); 2010 IEEE 10th International Conference on,2010,15

We show that computing MST w is much harder. We designefficient approximation algorithms based on a transformation to the Directed Steiner Treeproblem (DST).

Fast construction of generalized suffix trees over a very large alphabet,Zhixiang Chen; Richard Fowler; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Chunyue Wang,Abstract The work in this paper is motivated by the real-world problems such as miningfrequent traversal path patterns from very large Web logs. Generalized suffix trees over avery large alphabet can be used to solve such problems. However; traditional algorithmssuch as the Weiner; Ukkonen and McCreight algorithms are not sufficient assurance ofpracticality because of large magnitudes of the alphabet and the set of strings in those real-world problems. Two new algorithms are designed for fast construction of generalized suffixtrees over a very large alphabet; and their performance is analyzed in comparison with thewell-known Ukkonen algorithm. It is shown that these two algorithms have betterperformance; and can deal with large alphabets and large string sets well.,International Computing and Combinatorics Conference,2003,13

In this paper we consider twotypes of user access sessions; interval sessions and gap sessions. We design two efficientalgorithms for finding respectively those two types of sessions with the help of new datastructures. We present both theoretical and empirical analysis of the algorithms and provethat both algorithms have optimal time complexity.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2002,12
FP-tree approach for mining N-most interesting itemsets,Yin Ling Cheung; Ada Wai Chee Fu,In classical association rules mining; a minimum support threshold is assumed to beavailable for mining frequent itemsets. However; setting such a threshold is typically hard. Ifthe threshold is set too high; nothing will be discovered; and if it is set too low; too manyitemsets will be generated; which also implies inefficiency. In this paper; we handle a morepractical problem; roughly speaking; it is to mine the N k-itemsets with the highest support fork up to a certain k max value. We call the results the N-most interesting itemsets. Generally; itis more straightforward for users to determine N and k max. This approach also provides asolution for an open issue in the problem of subspace clustering. However; with the aboveproblem definition without the support threshold; the subset closure property of the apriori-gen algorithm no longer holds. We propose three new algorithms; LOOPBACK; BOLB …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery: Theory; Tools; and Technology IV,2002,12
Medical image retrieval by color content,Vincent Ng; David Cheung; Ada Fu,We develop an indexing scheme for medical images. In general; for a given medical image;there is one object which is clinically important amongst the rest. We name this object thedominant object. Our proposed index is composed of three parts:(1) the dominant objects inimages are standardized;(2) each image will have its own quadtree constructed whichdepends on the color composition and the color variation in the image; and (3) an R-tree thatsupports the retrieval of color images. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the indexdeveloped; we use images of skin lesions as the image data.

Distributed maximal clique computation,Yanyan Xu; James Cheng; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Yingyi Bu,Maximal cliques are important substructures in graph analysis. Many algorithms forcomputing maximal cliques have been proposed in the literature; however; most of them aresequential algorithms that cannot scale due to the high complexity of the problem; whileexisting parallel algorithms for computing maximal cliques are mostly immature andespecially suffer from skewed workload. In this paper; we first propose a distributedalgorithm built on a share-nothing architecture for computing the set of maximal cliques. Weeffectively address the problem of skewed workload distribution due to high-degree vertices;which also leads to drastically reduced worst-case time complexity for computing maximalcliques in common real-world graphs. Then; we also devise algorithms to support efficientupdate maintenance of the set of maximal cliques when the underlying graph is updated …,Big Data (BigData Congress); 2014 IEEE International Congress on,2014,11
Privacy-preserving data stream classification,Yabo Xu; Ke Wang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Rong She; Jian Pei,In a wide range of applications; multiple data streams need to be examined together in orderto discover trends or patterns existing across several data streams. One common practice isto redirect all data streams into a central place for joint analysis. This “centralized” practice ischallenged by the fact that data streams often are private in that they come from differentowners. In this paper; we focus on the problem of building a classifier in this context andassume that classification evolves as the current window of streams slides forward. Thisproblem faces two major challenges. First; the many-to-many join relationship of streams willblow up the already fast arrival rate of data streams. Second; the privacy requirement impliesthat data exchange among owners should be minimal. These considerations rule out allclassification methods that require producing the join in the current window. We show that …,*,2008,11
Linear and sublinear time algorithms for mining frequent traversal path patterns from very large Web logs,Zhixiang Chen; Richard H Fowler; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Chunyue Wang,This paper aims for designing algorithms for the problem of mining frequent traversal pathpatterns from very large Web logs with best possible efficiency. We devise two algorithms forthis problem with the help of fast construction of" shallow" generalized suffix trees over avery large alphabet. These two algorithms have respectively provable linear time andsublinear complexity; and their performance is analyzed in comparison with the two a priori-like algorithms in (Chen et al.; 1998) and the well-known Ukkonen algorithm for online suffixtree construction (1995). It is shown that these two algorithms are substantially efficient thanthe two apriori-like algorithms and the Ukkonen algorithm. The linear time algorithm hasoptimal performance in theory; while the sublinear time algorithm has better empiricalperformance.,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2003. Proceedings.

Diversified top-k subgraph querying in a large graph,Zhengwei Yang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ruifeng Liu,Abstract Subgraph querying in a large data graph is interesting for different applications. Arecent study shows that top-k diversified results are useful since the number of matchingsubgraphs can be very large. In this work; we study the problem of top-k diversifiedsubgraph querying that asks for a set of up to k subgraphs isomorphic to a given querygraph; and that covers the largest number of vertices. We propose a novel level-basedalgorithm for this problem which supports early termination and has a theoreticalapproximation guarantee. From experiments; most of our results on real datasets used inprevious works are near optimal with a query time within 10ms on a commodity machine.,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,9
Algorithm for discovering multivalued dependencies,Men Hin Yan; Ada Wai-chee Fu,While extracting functional dependencies has received considerable attention [6; 3; 4; 51;relatively less research effort has been put in finding multivalued dependencies. Based onthe previously proposed techniques of discovering functional dependencies [3]; we proposea new algorithm for finding multivalued dependencies from a large database. We assumethe usual interpretation of a relation (or table) in the relational database model where noduplicate tuples are allowed. The definition of multivalued dependency is given as below:,Proceedings of the tenth international conference on Information and knowledge management,2001,9
From XML to relational database,Yan Men-hin; Ada Wai-chee Fu,The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a relatively new standard for structureddocuments and data on the Web 4]. It is expected that most XML documents will beaccompanied by Document Type De nitions (DTDs) 4; 2]. DTD is essentially a grammar forrestricting the tags and structure of a document. Though an XML document can exist on itsown; there is much interest in storing XML data as relational database; because it allows usto apply well-developed relational techniques on XML data. Database companies areworking on how XML data can t into their relational systems. However; most of the knownapproaches are manual. The problem is how this can be done automatically. One majorissue in this is how to produce the relational schemas from the XML data; and this is theproblem we tackle here. A most related work can be found in 13].

Study of relative effectiveness of features in content-based image retrieval,SR Subramanya; Jui-Che Teng; Yongjian Fu,Content-based retrieval in image databases requires appropriate features of images to bederived and used in the indexing and searching process. Fast and accurate retrieval iscrucial from a user point of view. The kinds of features used; their organization in suitabledata structures; and the similarity search scheme; directly affect the speed and quality ofcontent-based retrieval. In this paper; we evaluate the relative significance of three differentimage features-geometry; moments; and Fourier descriptors in the context of content-basedretrieval; and present experimental results. The evaluation metrics are retrieval quality andsearch time. These could be used to tune the search process which speeds up retrievalwithout significantly affecting retrieval quality.,Cyber Worlds; 2002. Proceedings. First International Symposium on,2002,8

Classification spanning correlated data streams,Yabo Xu; Ke Wang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Rong She; Jian Pei,Abstract In many applications; classifiers need to be built based on multiple related datastreams. For example; stock streams and news streams are related; where the classificationpatterns may involve features from both streams. Thus instead of mining on a single isolatedstream; we need to examine multiple related data streams in order to find such patterns andbuild an accurate classifier. Other examples of related streams include traffic reports and caraccidents; sensor readings of different types or at different locations; etc. In this paper; weconsider the classification problem defined over sliding-window join of several input datastreams. As the data streams arrive in fast pace and the many-to-many join relationshipblows up the data arrival rate even more; it is impractical to compute the join and then buildthe classifier each time the window slides forward.

A gracefully degradable declustered RAID architecture,Siu-Cheung Chau; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Abstract A new layout method Prime-groups is proposed to evenly distribute parity groupsfor declustered RAID. Prime-groups satisfies most of the layout goals for a good declusteredRAID layout. For the goals that are not satisfied; it is near optimal. A new layout goalmaximal write and reconstruction parallelism is also proposed. If a layout satisfies the newgoal; all the surviving disks can be read in parallel and can be rewritten in parallel duringreconstruction and reconfiguration. Prime-groups satisfies the new goal when the writerequest begins in the first disk of the array. It is also near optimal in term of declustering ratiowhen p is a prime. Prime-groups can compliment the layouts proposed by Alvarez et al.[2]for the criteria to obtain a good layout is quite different between Prime-groups and thoseproposed by Alvarez et al.[2].,Cluster Computing,2002,7

In this paper; we study the problem of query rewriting using views for XPathqueries without requiring that the rewriting be complete. This will increase its applicabilitysince in many cases; complete rewritings using views do not exist.

Then we use the improved semanticmodel to improve the clustering quality and present an online clustering algorithm forclustering massive text data streams. In our algorithm; a new cluster statistics structure;cluster profile; is presented in which the semantics of text data streams are captured.

(α; k)-anonymity based privacy preservation by lossy join,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Yubao Liu; Jian Yin; Zhilan Huang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jian Pei,Abstract Privacy-preserving data publication for data mining is to protect sensitiveinformation of individuals in published data while the distortion to the data is minimized.Recently; it is shown that (α; k)-anonymity is a feasible technique when we are given somesensitive attribute (s) and quasi-identifier attributes. In previous work; generalization of thegiven data table has been used for the anonymization. In this paper; we show that we canproject the data onto two tables for publishing in such a way that the privacy protection for (α;k)-anonymity can be achieved with less distortion. In the two tables; one table contains theundisturbed non-sensitive values and the other table contains the undisturbed sensitivevalues. Privacy preservation is guaranteed by the lossy join property of the two tables. Weshow by experiments that the results are better than previous approaches.,*,2007,5
Locating more corruptions in a replicated file,Ada Waichee Fu; Sin-Cheung Chan,When a data file is replicated at more than one site; we are interested in detecting corruptionby comparing the multiple copies. In order to reduce the amount of messaging for large files;techniques based on page signatures and combined signatures have been explored.However; for 3 or more sites; the known methods assume that the number of corrupted pagecopies to be at most [M/2]-1; where M is the number of sites. We point out that thisassumption is unrealistic and the corresponding methods are unnecessarily pessimistic. Inthis paper; we replace this assumption by another assumption which we show to bereasonable. Based on this assumption; we derived a distributed algorithm which in generalachieves better performance than previously known results. Our system model is also morerefined than previous work.,Reliable Distributed Systems; 1996. Proceedings.; 15th Symposium on,1996,5

Reconstruction privacy: Enabling statistical learning,Ke Wang; Chao Han; Ada Waichee Fu; Raymond C WONG; Philip S Yu,Abstract Non-independent reasoning (NIR) allows the information about one record in thedata to be learnt from the information of other records in the data. Most posterior/prior basedprivacy criteria consider NIR as a privacy violation and require to smooth the distribution ofpublished data to avoid sensitive NIR. The drawback of this approach is that it limits theutility of learning statistical relationships. The differential privacy criterion considers NIR as anon-privacy violation; therefore; enables learning statistical relationships; but at the cost ofpotential disclosures through NIR. A question is whether it is possible to (1) allow learningstatistical relationships; yet (2) prevent sensitive NIR about an individual. We present a dataperturbation and sampling method to achieve both (1) and (2). The enabling mechanism is anew privacy criterion that distinguishes the two types of NIR in (1) and (2) with the help of …,*,2015,4
Small sum privacy and large sum utility in data publishing,Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Jia Wang; Minhao Jiang,Abstract While the study of privacy preserving data publishing has drawn a lot of interest;some recent work has shown that existing mechanisms do not limit all inferences aboutindividuals. This paper is a positive note in response to this finding. We point out that not allinference attacks should be countered; in contrast to all existing works known to us; andbased on this we propose a model called SPLU. This model protects sensitive information;by which we refer to answers for aggregate queries with small sums; while queries withlarge sums are answered with higher accuracy. Using SPLU; we introduce a sanitizationalgorithm to protect data while maintaining high data utility for queries with large sums.Empirical results show that our method behaves as desired.,Journal of biomedical informatics,2014,4

Small count privacy and large count utility in data publishing,Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jia Wang; Ke Wang; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract: While the introduction of differential privacy has been a major breakthrough in thestudy of privacy preserving data publication; some recent work has pointed out a number ofcases where it is not possible to limit inference about individuals. The dilemma that isintrinsic in the problem is the simultaneous requirement of data utility in the published data.Differential privacy does not aim to protect information about an individual that can beuncovered even without the participation of the individual. However; this lack of coveragemay violate the principle of individual privacy. Here we propose a solution by providingprotection to sensitive information; by which we refer to the answers for aggregate querieswith small counts. Previous works based on $\ell $-diversity can be seen as providing aspecial form of this kind of protection. Our method is developed with another goal which is …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1202.3253,2012,4
Probabilistic inference protection on anonymized data,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang; Yabo Xu; Jian Pei; S Yu Philip,Background knowledge is an important factor in privacy preserving data publishing.Probabilistic distribution-based background knowledge is a powerful kind of backgroundknowledge which is easily accessible to adversaries. However; to the best of our knowledge;there is no existing work that can provide a privacy guarantee under adversary attack withsuch background knowledge. The difficulty of the problem lies in the high complexity of theprobability computation and the non-monotone nature of the privacy condition. The onlysolution known to us relies on approximate algorithms with no known error bound. In thispaper; we propose a new bounding condition that overcomes the difficulties of the problemand gives a privacy guarantee.

Such collaboration frequently involvesmultiple private sources where free-access to private data is difficult or impossible due toprivacy concerns. Therefore; techniques that address the need of privacy-preservingcollaborative data analysis are critical (Clifton et al.; 2004). For example; a hospitalmaintains the medical histories of patients; denoted as table H; and a research institutemaintains the records of patients' DNA samples; denoted as R. Both tables contain theattribute “Patient_Name” that is not necessarily a key attribute if a patient has severaldiseases or DNA samples.

The load in one cluster may be very high while the otherclusters may have nothing running on the system. A higher throughput can be achieved ifload balancing is added. In this paper; we propose a simple and efficient load balancingmethod to balance loads for heterogeneous computing clusters of various sizes that arequite far away from each other. We assume that the computer clusters are connected in theform of a hypercube. We then use the load balancing method for hypercubes to balance theload between heterogeneous computing clusters.

A gracefully degradable declustered RAID architecture with near optimal maximal read and write parallelism,Siu-Cheung Chau; A Wai-Chee Fu,A new layout method; Prime-groups; is proposed to evenly distribute parity groups fordeclustered RAID. Prime-groups satisfies most of the layout goals for a good declusteredRAID layout. For the goals that are not satisfied; it is near optimal. A new layout goalmaximal write and reconstruction parallelism is also proposed. If a layout satisfies the newgoal; all the surviving disks can be read in parallel and can be rewritten in parallel duringreconstruction and reconfiguration. Prime-groups satisfies the new goal when the writerequest begins in the first disk of the array. It is also near optimal in term of declustering ratiowhen p is a prime. Prime-groups can compliment the layouts proposed by GA Alvarez et.al.(1996); as the criteria to obtain a good layout is quite different between Prime-groups andthose proposed by Alvarez et. al.,Cluster Computing; 2000.

Reads: A random walk approach for efficient and accurate dynamic simrank,Minhao Jiang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract Similarity among entities in graphs plays a key role in data analysis and mining.SimRank is a widely used and popular measurement to evaluate the similarity among thevertices. In real-life applications; graphs do not only grow in size; requiring fast and preciseSimRank computation for large graphs; but also change and evolve continuously over time;demanding an efficient maintenance process to handle dynamic updates. In this paper; wepropose a random walk based indexing scheme to compute SimRank efficiently andaccurately over large dynamic graphs. We show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art static and dynamic SimRank algorithms.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,3
Distributed maximal clique computation and management,Yanyan Xu; James Cheng; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Maximal cliques are elementary substructures in a graph and instrumental in graph analysissuch as the structural analysis of many complex networks; graph clustering and communitydetection; network hierarchy detection; emerging pattern mining; vertex importancemeasures; etc. However; the number of maximal cliques is also notoriously large even formany small real world graphs. This size problem gives rise to challenges in both computingand managing the set of maximal cliques. Many algorithms for computing maximal cliqueshave been proposed in the literature; however; most of them are sequential algorithms thatcannot scale due to the high complexity of the problem; while existing parallel algorithms forcomputing maximal cliques are mostly immature and especially suffer from skewedworkload. As for managing the set of maximal cliques; which is essential due to its large …,IEEE Transactions on Services Computing,2016,3
Rectangle counting in large bipartite graphs,Jia Wang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; James Cheng,Rectangles are the smallest cycles (ie; cycles of length 4) and most elementary sub-structures in a bipartite graph. Similar to triangle counting in uni-partite graphs; rectanglecounting has many important applications where data is modeled as bipartite graphs.However; efficient algorithms for rectangle counting are lacking. We propose three differenttypes of algorithms to cope with different data volumes and the availability of computingresources. We verified the efficiency of our algorithms with experiments on both large real-world and synthetic bipartite graphs.,Big Data (BigData Congress); 2014 IEEE International Congress on,2014,3
IS-LABEL: an independent-set based labeling scheme for point-to-point distance querying on large graphs,Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Huanhuan Wu; James Cheng; Shumo Chu; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract: We study the problem of computing shortest path or distance between two queryvertices in a graph; which has numerous important applications. Quite a number of indexeshave been proposed to answer such distance queries. However; all of these indexes canonly process graphs of size barely up to 1 million vertices; which is rather small in view ofmany of the fast-growing real-world graphs today such as social networks and Web graphs.We propose an efficient index; which is a novel labeling scheme based on the independentset of a graph. We show that our method can handle graphs of size three orders ofmagnitude larger than those existing indexes.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1211.2367,2012,3
Randomization resilient to sensitive reconstruction,Ke Wang; Chao Han; Ada Waichee Fu,Abstract: With the randomization approach; sensitive data items of records are randomizedto protect privacy of individuals while allowing the distribution information to bereconstructed for data analysis. In this paper; we distinguish between reconstruction that haspotential privacy risk; called micro reconstruction; and reconstruction that does not; calledaggregate reconstruction. We show that the former could disclose sensitive informationabout a target individual; whereas the latter is more useful for data analysis than for privacybreaches. To limit the privacy risk of micro reconstruction; we propose a privacy definition;called (epsilon; delta)-reconstruction-privacy. Intuitively; this privacy notion requires thatmicro reconstruction has a large error with a large probability. The promise of this approachis that micro reconstruction is more sensitive to the number of independent trials in the …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1202.3179,2012,3
Publishing skewed sensitive microdata,Yabo Xu; Ke Wang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract A highly skewed microdata contains some sensitive attribute values that occur farmore frequently than others. Such data violates the “eligibility condition” assumed byexisting works for limiting the probability of linking an individual to a specific sensitiveattribute value. Specifically; if the frequency of some sensitive attribute value is too high;publishing the sensitive attribute alone would lead to linking attacks. In many practicalscenarios; however; this eligibility condition is violated. In this paper; we consider how topublish microdata under this case. A natural solution is “minimally” suppressing“dominating” records to restore the eligibility condition. We show that the minimality ofsuppression may lead to linking attacks. To limit the inference probability; we propose arandomized suppression solution. We show that this approach has the least expected …,*,2010,3
Finding multiple new optimal locations in a road network,Ruifeng Liu; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Zitong Chen; Silu Huang; Yubao Liu,Abstract We study the problem of optimal location querying for location-based services inroad networks; which aims to find locations for new servers or facilities. The existing optimalsolutions on this problem consider only the cases with one new server. When two or morenew servers are to be set up; the problem with minmax cost criteria; MinMax; becomes NP-hard. In this work we identify some useful properties about the potential locations for the newservers; from which we derive a novel algorithm for MinMax; and show that it is efficientwhen the number of new servers is small. When the number of new servers is large; wepropose an efficient 3-approximate algorithm. We verify with experiments on real roadnetworks that our solutions are effective and attain significantly better result qualitycompared to the existing greedy algorithms.,Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2016,2
KeyLabel algorithms for keyword search in large graphs,Yue Wang; Ke Wang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Graph keyword search is the process of extracting small subgraphs that contain a set ofquery keywords from a graph. This problem is challenging because there are manyconstraints; including distance constraint; keyword constraint; search time constraint; indexsize constraint; and memory constraint; while the size of data is inflating at a very high speednowadays. Existing greedy algorithms guarantee good performance by sacrificing theaccuracy to generate approximate answers; and exact algorithms promise exact answersbut require a high memory consumption for loading indices and advanced knowledge aboutthe maximum distance constraint. For big data applications; existing techniques areinefficient and impractical due to huge memory consumption and varied distance constraint.We propose a new keyword search algorithm that finds exact answers with low memory …,Big Data (Big Data); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,2

Multidimensional k-anonymization by linear clustering using space-filling curves,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jian Pei; Ke Wang; Steven Chi-Wen Wan; CS Lo,Anonymization has been well-recognized as an effective approach to protect privacy. In thispaper; we study the problem of k-anonymization of numeric data. We propose a simple yeteffective approach to this problem. We transform a data set with a multidimensional numericquasi-identifier into a data set with a one-dimensional numeric quasi-identi er using space-filling curves. Effecacious algorithms are proposed to compute the k-anonymization on thetransformed data set. The k-anonymized data set is then transformed back to the originalmultidimensional space with the k-anonymity preserved. Our empirical studies on both realdata sets and synthetic data sets show that; compared to the state-of-the-art methods; ourmethod achieves a smaller distortion and is more efficient and scalable.,Simon Fraser University School of Computing Science Technical Report,2006,2

Introduction When a data file is replicated at one or more sites in a distributedcomputer network; it is of interest to discover corruptions in the file copies by makingcomparison among the multiple physical copies of the file. An efficient method is as follows.For each page copy; a page signature is computed. From the page signatures; combinedsignatures are computed and transmitted among sites.

Dynamic Policies in Selecting a Caching Set for a Distributed Mobile Computing Environment,Ada Fu; John CS Lui; MH Wong,Abstract The bandwidth of a wireless network is usually very limited as compared to that of astatic network. Therefore; caching the right set of data into the limited storage of mobilecomputers is an important issue in mobile database applications. Caching not only reducesthe contention on the narrow bandwidth of a wireless channel; but also improves theresponse time for read operations. However; we show that the problem of nding an optimalcaching set so as to minimize the bandwidth utilization is NP-hard. In order for the system todetermine the caching set in real time; two heuristic methods; the baseline algorithm and thegreedy algorithm; are proposed. The closed-form solutions of various performancemeasures for the no caching policy; the baseline algorithm and the greedy algorithm arederived based on the queuing model.

A Convex Optimization Approach to Radiation Treatment Planning with Dose Constraints,Anqi Fu; Barıs Ungun; Lei Xing; Stephen Boyd,Abstract We present a method for handling dose constraints as part of a convexprogramming framework for inverse treatment planning. Our method uniformly handlesmean dose; maximum dose; minimum dose; and dose-volume (ie; percentile) constraints aspart of a convex formulation. Since dose-volume constraints are non-convex; we replacethem with a convex restriction. This restriction is; by definition; conservative; to mitigate itsimpact on the clinical objectives; we develop a two-pass planning algorithm that allows eachdose-volume constraint to be met exactly on a second pass by the solver if its correspondingrestriction is feasible on the first pass. In another variant; we add slack variables to eachdose constraint to prevent the problem from becoming infeasible when the user specifies anincompatible set of constraints or when the constraints are made infeasible by our …,*,2017,1
Generalized bucketization scheme for flexible privacy settings,Ke Wang; Peng Wang; Ada Waichee Fu; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract Bucketization is an anonymization technique for publishing sensitive data. The ideais to group records into small buckets to obscure the record-level association betweensensitive information and identifying information. Compared to the traditional generalizationtechnique; bucketization does not require a taxonomy of attribute values; so is applicable tomore data sets. A drawback of previous bucketization schemes is the uniform privacy settingand uniform bucket size; which often results in a non-achievable privacy goal or excessiveinformation loss if sensitive values have variable sensitivity. In this work; we present aflexible bucketization scheme to address these issues. In the flexible scheme; each sensitivevalue can have its own privacy setting and buckets of different sizes can be formed. Thechallenge is to determine proper bucket sizes and group sensitive values into buckets so …,Information Sciences,2016,1

Hydrated Electron Transfer to Nucleobases in Aqueous Solutions Revealed by Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics Simulations,Jing Zhao; Mei Wang; Aiyun Fu; Hongfang Yang; Yuxiang Bu,Abstract We present an ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation study into thetransfer dynamics of an excess electron from its cavity-shaped hydrated electron state to ahydrated nucleobase (NB)-bound state. In contrast to the traditional view that electronlocalization at NBs (G/A/C/T); which is the first step for electron-induced DNA damage; isrelated only to dry or prehydrated electrons; and a fully hydrated electron no longer transfersto NBs; our AIMD simulations indicate that a fully hydrated electron can still transfer to NBs.We monitored the transfer dynamics of fully hydrated electrons towards hydrated NBs inaqueous solutions by using AIMD simulations and found that due to solution-structurefluctuation and attraction of NBs; a fully hydrated electron can transfer to a NB gradually overtime.

Preserving Individual Privacy in Serial Data Publishing,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jia Liu; Ke Wang; Yabo Xu,Abstract: While previous works on privacy-preserving serial data publishing consider thescenario where sensitive values may persist over multiple data releases; we find that noprevious work has sufficient protection provided for sensitive values that can change overtime; which should be the more common case. In this work we propose to study the privacyguarantee for such transient sensitive values; which we call the global guarantee. Weformally define the problem for achieving this guarantee and derive some theoreticalproperties for this problem. We show that the anonymized group sizes used in the dataanonymization is a key factor in protecting individual privacy in serial publication. Wepropose two strategies for anonymization targeting at minimizing the average group sizeand the maximum group size.

Optimal all-to-all personalised exchange in a novel optical multistage interconnection network,Siu-Cheung Chau; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,An all-to-all personalised exchange is one of the most dense collective communicationoperations in parallel and distributed computing and communication applications. Eachnode in the network needs to send a different message to each of the other nodes.Advances in electro-optic switches have made optical communication a good networkingchoice that can satisfy the high channel bandwidth; low communication latency; low errorrate; and gigabit transmission requirements of high performance computing andcommunication applications. Previously proposed optical multistage interconnectionnetworks (MINs) require at least two passes to send a message from each node to a differentnode (to realise a permutation) in the network. In this paper; we propose an MIN thatrequires only one pass to realise a permutation. That is; the new MIN requires n–1 passes …,International Journal of High Performance Computing and Networking,2005,1
Load balancing between heterogenous computing clusters,Siu-Cheung Chau; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Abstract More and more organizations have computing clusters located in different places.The distance between the computing clusters can be quite far away and the computingclusters can also differ in size. The load in one cluster may be very high while the otherclusters may have nothing running on the system. A higher throughput can be achieved ifload balancing is added. In this paper; we propose a simple and efficient load balancingmethod to balance load for computing clusters that are quite far away from each other. Weassume that the computer clusters are connected in the form of a hypercube. We then usethe load balancing method for hypercubes to balance the load between heterogenouscomputing clusters. After applying the propose method; the maximum load differencebetween any two computing clusters can be at most one more than the optimal solution.,The Second International Workshop on Grid and Cooperative Computing,2003,1

Piecewise Linear Histograms for Selectivity Estimation,Xiaohui Yu; Ada Fu,Abstract Selectivity estimation of queries is of critical importance to query optimization. Inorder to get accurate estimations; database management systems must maintain statistics tocapture the underlying data distribution. Histograms are extensively used in commercialdatabase systems for this purpose. Most current histogram techniques make the assumptionthat all values in a single bucket appear with the same frequency; which rarely holds true inpractice. In this paper; we propose a new type of histograms called piecewise linearhistograms. Frequencies of attribute values in a bucket of the piecewise linear histogram is tby a line using linear least squares regression; and the coe cients are stored as synopsis ofthe underlying data distribution. Moreover; since nding the best partition of the domain intobuckets is an NP-hard problem; we propose a heuristic to e ciently determine the …,International Symposium on Information Systems and Engineering (ISE’2001),2001,1
Locating Corruptions in a Replicated File in a Distributed Environment,Ada Waichee Fu; Siu-Cheung Chau,Abstract When a data file is replicated at more than one site; it is of interest to detectcorruption by comparing the multiple copies. In order to reduce the amount of messaging forlarge files; techniques based on page signatures and combined signatures have beenexplored. However; for 3 or more sites; the known methods assume that the number ofcorrupted page copies is at most⌊ M/2⌋− 1; where M is the number of sites. This is apessimistic assumption which is unrealistic. In this paper; this assumption is replaced byanother assumption which is shown to be reasonable. Based on this assumption; and basedon a finer model of the system; three distributed algorithms are derived; which can eitherimprove the performance or provide more tolerance to corruptions compared to previousmethods. As in some previous work; the amount of signature transmission in the …,The Journal of Supercomputing,1999,1

CVXR: An R Package for Disciplined Convex Optimization,Anqi Fu; Balasubramanian Narasimhan; Stephen Boyd,Abstract: CVXR is an R package that provides an object-oriented modeling language forconvex optimization; similar to CVX; CVXPY; YALMIP; and Convex. jl. It allows the user toformulate convex optimization problems in a natural mathematical syntax rather than therestrictive standard form required by most solvers. The user specifies an objective and set ofconstraints by combining constants; variables; and parameters using a library of functionswith known mathematical properties. CVXR then applies signed disciplined convexprogramming (DCP) to verify the problem's convexity. Once verified; the problem isconverted into standard conic form using graph implementations and passed to a conesolver such as ECOS or SCS. We demonstrate CVXR's modeling framework with severalapplications.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.07582,2017,*

However; for manyOSNs; one can only access parts of the network using the application programminginterfaces (APIs). In such cases; conventional algorithms become infeasible. In this paper;we introduce efficient algorithms for estimating the number of edges and triangles in OSNsbased on random walk sampling on OSNs. We also derive a theoretical bound on thesample size and number of APIs calls needed in our algorithms for a probabilistic accuracyguarantee.

SU‐F‐T‐340: Direct Editing of Dose Volume Histograms: Algorithms and a Unified Convex Formulation for Treatment Planning with Dose Constraints,B Ungun; A Fu; S Boyd; L Xing,Purpose: To develop a procedure for including dose constraints in convex programming-based approaches to treatment planning; and to support dynamic modification of suchconstraints during planning.

The first threeconstraint types are convex and readily incorporated. Dose volume constraints are notconvex; however; so we introduce a convex restriction that is related to CVaR-basedapproaches previously proposed in the literature. To compensate for the conservatism of thisrestriction; we propose a new two-pass algorithm that solves the restricted problem on a firstpass and uses this solution to form exact constraints on a second pass.

Inferential or Differential: Privacy Laws Dictate,Ke Wang; Peng Wang; Ada Waichee Fu; Raywong Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract: So far; privacy models follow two paradigms.

The second paradigm; known asdifferential privacy; focuses on the risk to an individual when included in; versus when notincluded in; the database. The contribution of this paper consists of two parts. The first partpresents a critical analysis on differential privacy with two results:(i) the differential privacymechanism does not provide inferential privacy;(ii) the impossibility result about achievingDalenius's privacy goal [5] is based on an adversary simulated by a Turing machine; but ahuman adversary may behave differently; consequently; the practical implication of theimpossibility result remains unclear.

Query by Humming,Yingyi Bu; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,In general; the term Quadtree refers to a class of representations of geometric entities (suchas points; line segments; polygons; regions) in a space of two (or more) dimensions; thatrecursively decompose the space containing these entities into blocks until the data in eachblock satisfy some condition (with respect; for example; to the block size; the number of blockentities; the characteristics of the block entities; etc.). In a more restricted sense; the termQuadtree (Octree) refers to a tree data-structure in which each internal node has four (eight)children and is used for the representation of geometric entities in a two (three) dimensionalspace. The root of the tree represents the whole space/region. Each child of a noderepresents a subregion of the subregion of its parent. The subregions of the siblingsconstitute a partition of the parent's regions. Several variations of quadtrees are possible …,*,2009,*

Continuous Monitoring of Outliers Over High Speed Stream Time Series,Yingyi Bu; Lei Chen; Ada Wai-chee Fu,ABSTRACT Lately there exist increasing demands on stream time series management. Theproblem of real-time and continuous abnormal sequential pattern monitoring over streamtime series arises from many online data analysis and cleaning applications; including highspeed sensory; medical; financial; industrial; trajectory streams and so on. This problem isan emerging research issue due to the specific requirement of high speed data processing.An entwined problem is that memory for the outlier monitoring is usually limited; as more andmore computationally limited and memory-wise constrained embedded devices for themonitoring tasks are of massive demands in the industries. This paper presents a novelframework for monitoring outliers over high speed stream time series; where both the timeand memory efficiencies are considered. To our knowledge; this is the first work to …,*,2007,*

The development of a structural index tree for processing XML data,James Sheung-Chak Cheng,XML has become the de facto standard for data exchange over the Web. However; XMLdata contain a lot of duplicate structures; resulting in much redundant processing on pathnavigation when querying the data. We propose an index structure; the Structure Index Tree(SIT); which is defined on an XML document. The SIT eliminates duplicate structures arisingfrom the equivalent branches and subtrees in an XML document by merging them into aconcise structure. Query evaluation is thus speeded up as a result of pruned search space.The SIT; as well as many other existing indexes that are defined based on the partition ofequivalent classes of nodes in an XML tree; is only efficient for the evaluation of structuralqueries. In the presence of value-based predicates; equivalent nodes in the same partitionbecome distinguishable by their data contents. To enhance the applicability of the index …,*,2004,*

Secure E-Commerce Transactions; Modeling and Implementation Aspects,Jian Tang; Ada Waichee Fu,Abstract The requirement for secure e-commerce transactions arises due to the potentiallyhostile execution environment where not only hardware can fail; but also the messages aresubject to attacks by intruders; and some parties may suffer from negligent or even maliciousbehaviors of some other parties. Most of the existing work paid attention only to messagesecurity. In this paper; we propose a secure e-commerce transaction model. We focus ourattention on modeling the security aspects at the transaction level; and discuss theproperties an e-commerce transaction protocol must have in order to support the semanticsof the transactions. The semantics we use is based in the first instance on the notion ofatomicity proposed in [13]; and then extended to a broader context where the behaviors ofuntrustworthy players are taken into consideration,*,2003,*

An Improved Direct Dimension Exchange Method for Load Balancing in k-ary n-cube Multicomputers.,Siu-Cheung Chau; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Abstract This paper presents an improved direct dimension exchange method (DDE) forsynchronous load balancing for k-ary n-cube multicomputers. The new method is based onthe improved DEM for hypercube. The original DEM when extended to the k-ary n-cuberequires many iterations in exchanging loads between neighboring nodes to converge to abalanced state. The original DDE does not requires iteratively exchanging loads betweennodes. It can balance the load with fewer communication steps and can provide better loadbalancing quality than DEM. The improved DDE has better load balancing quality than theoriginal DDE and has the same complexity of the original DDE.,PDPTA,2000,*
A reconfigurable fault-tolerant hypercube architecture with global sparing,Siu-Cheung Chau; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,We propose a new n-dimensional fault-tolerant hypercube architecture. We use (n-1)switching networks to connect the N= 2/sup n/active processors and k spare processors toform an n-dimensional fault-tolerant hypercube. The k spare processors can be used to back-up any k processor failures in the fault-tolerant hypercube. We call such a method globalsparing and it is optimal in terms of the number of processor failures that can be back-up byk spare processors. The new architecture can achieve a higher level of reliability using lesshardware compared to previously proposed schemes.,Dependable Computing; 2000.

An attribute-oriented induction has been developed in the previous study ofknowledge discovery in databases. A concept tree ascension technique is applied inconcept generalization. In this paper; we extend the background knowledge representationfrom an unconditional non-rule-based concept hierarchy to a rule-based concept hierarchy;which enhances greatly its representation power. An efficient rulebased attribute-orientedinduction algorithm is developed to facilitate learning with a rule-based concept graph. Aninformation loss problem which is special to rule-based induction is described together witha solution suggested.,*,*,*
PROBABILISTIC TOKEN SELECTION VIA FISHER’S METHOD IN TEXT CLASSIFICATION,Anqi Fu; Yiming Sun; Katherine Yu,Abstract. In this project we consider a multiclass text classification problem on threenewsgroups with 1;000 entries each with a feature class consisting of over 50;000 tokens.Our baseline Naive Bayes method gives a misclassification error rate of 4.51%; and wefocus on variable selection methods to improve upon this error. We compare a tokenselection method using Naive Bayes to one using the related Fisher's method and athreshold. We find that token selection with Fisher's method does significantly better usingtwo effective choices for this threshold: first; one that controls the number of tokens selectedto be 1/5 of the original 53;975; second; a threshold we compute based on a probabilisticestimate of the distribution of the test statistic. The final misclassification errors are 2.60%and 2.34%; respectively.,*,*,*
A Proximal Algorithm for Total Variation-Based Phase Retrieval,Anqi Fu,Abstract—In this paper; I study the problem of phase retrieval with total variation (TV)smoothing and denoising. I construct an optimization model with an anisotropic TV penaltyterm; then show how to solve it using a proximal gradient method. This iterative-shrinkage-thresholding phase retrieval algorithm (ISTPRA) combines fixed-point iterations with a fastgradient solver for the convex subproblem. I compare my algorithm's performance to severalalternating projection methods. My results show that ISTPRA achieves a lowerreconstruction error; while remaining robust to noise.,*,*,*

Algorithms for Detecting Distance-Based Outliers in High Dimensions,Zhixiang Chen; Ada Waichee Fu; Bin Fu,Abstract In this paper; we study efficient algorithms for detecting distance-based outliers froma set of n d-dimensional points with respect to two threshold integer parameters k and M;and a radius parameter r. First; we design an algorithm utilizing d-dimensional balls tofacilitate fast local search; achieving an O ((3.1√ 2eπ) dkn) time complexity for detecting DB(k; r) outliers. This algorithm improves the best known O ((2√ 2d+ 1) dkn) time complexity ofthe cell-based algorithm in [13; 14]. Second; we develop a randomized QuickSelect strategyand apply it to design two randomized algorithms for detecting outliers with M largest k-distances or with M largest average k-distances in time O (dnM+(3.1√ 2eπ) dkn) and O(dnM+(1+ k) d (2√ 2eπ) d); respectively. Here; the O () notation suppresses logarithmicterms. We observe that the distancebased outlier detection problem is somehow related …,*,*,*

Privacy-Preserving Classification for Data Streams,Yabo Xu; Ke Wang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Rong She; Jian Pei,ABSTRACT In a wide range of applications; multiple data streams need to be examinedtogether in order to discover trends or patterns existing across several data streams. Onecommon practice is to redirect all data streams into a central place for joint analysis. This“centralized” practice is challenged by the fact that data streams often are private in that theycome from different owners. In this paper; we focus on the problem of building a classifier inthis context and assume that classification evolves as the current window of streams slidesforward. This problem faces two major challenges. First; the many-to-many join relationshipof streams will blow up the already fast arrival rate of data streams. Second; the privacyrequirement implies that data exchange among owners should be minimal. Theseconsiderations rule out all classification methods that require producing the join in the …,*,*,*

Optimal All-to-All Personalized Exchange in an Optical Multistage Interconnection Network,Siu-Cheung Chau; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Abstract _ All-to-all personalized exchange is one of the most dense collectivecommunication patterns and it occurs in many parallel and distributed computingapplications. In an all-to-all personalized exchange; each node in the network has to send amessage to all the other nodes and the messages are all different. Advances in electro-opticswitches have made optical communication a good networking choice that can satisfy thehigh channel bandwidth and low communication latency of high performance computingand/or communication applications. Let n be the number of nodes in a network. Previouslyproposed optical multistage networks require at least two passes to send a message fromeach node to a different node (to realize a permutation) in the network. That is; 2n passesare needed to realize an all-to-all personalized exchange. In this paper; we propose an …,*,*,*

M. Phil.--Term Paper,Cai Xia; Ada Fu,Abstract Component-based technology is gaining popularity in modern softwaredevelopment. This approach helps reduce development cost and time-to-market; as well asimprove maintainability and reliability. One of the key problems in component-basedsoftware development is finding a way to certify the quality of individual components and thatof the integrated component-based software systems. There are several different techniqueswhich have been developed to describe the predictive relationship between softwaremetrics and the reliability of the software components.,*,*,*

Noname manuscript No.(will be inserted by the editor),Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Jiuyong Li; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang,Abstract Privacy preservation is an important issue in the release of data for miningpurposes. The k-anonymity model has been introduced for protecting individualidentification. Recent studies show that a more sophisticated model is necessary to protectthe association of individuals to sensitive information. In this paper; we propose an (α; k)-anonymity model to protect both identifications and relationships to sensitive information indata. We discuss the properties of (α; k)-anonymity model. We prove that the optimal (α; k)-anonymity problem is NP-hard. We first present an optimal global-recoding method for the(α; k)-anonymity problem. Next we propose two scalable local-recoding algorithms whichare both more scalable and result in less data,*,*,*
Minimality Attack in Privacy Preserving Data Publishing Technical Report TR 2006-28,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang; Jian Pei,Abstract Data publishing generates much concern over the protection of individual privacy.In the well-known kanonymity model and the related models such as l-diversity and (α; k)-anonymity; the adversary is assumed to possess knowledge about an external table withinformation of the quasi-identifiers of individuals. In this paper; we show that knowledge ofthe mechanism or algorithm of anonymization for data publication can also lead to extrainformation that assists the adversary and jeopardizes individual privacy. In particular; allknown mechanisms try to minimize information loss and such an attempt provides for aloophole for attacks. We call such an attack a minimality attack. In this paper; we propose amodel called mconfidentiality which deals with the individual privacy issue with theconsideration of minimality attacks. Though the problem of optimal m-confidentiality …,*,*,*

Cloud Computing means using multipleserver computers via a digital network; as though they were one computer. The goal ofCloud Computing is to consolidate infrastructure; and share resources among the serviceconsumers; partners; and vendors in the cloud value chain. Social Networking is a socialstructure made up of individuals called" nodes"; which are tied by one or more specific typesof interdependency networks. Social networking consists of graph types and the analysissocial network is an important research direction.

Querying Streaming XML Data Using Hash-Lookup Query Trees,James Cheng; Wilfred Ng,Abstract The rapid growth in the amount of XML data and the development of publish-subscribe systems have led to great interest in processing streaming XML data. While anumber of efficient systems have been developed to process XPath filters on XML streams;the performance of existing systems that query streaming XML data is inadequate. Wepropose the QstreamX system for querying streaming XML data using a novel structure;called Hash-Lookup Query Trees; which consists of a Hashtable; a Static Query Tree (SQT)and a Dynamic Query Tree (DQT). The Hashtable is used to filter out irrelevant elements andprovide direct access to relevant nodes in the SQT. Based on the SQT; the DQT is builtdynamically at runtime to evaluate queries. QstreamX supports all XPath axes (except thesideways axes); multiple and nested predicates; and/or expressions; a common set of …,*,*,*
