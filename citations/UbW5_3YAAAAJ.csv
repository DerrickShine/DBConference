A reputation-based approach for choosing reliable resources in peer-to-peer networks,Ernesto Damiani; De Capitani di Vimercati; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati; Fabio Violante,Abstract Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications have seen an enormous success; and recentlyintroduced P2P services have reached tens of millions of users. A feature that significantlycontributes to the success of many P2P applications is user anonymity. However; anonymityopens the door to possible misuses and abuses; exploiting the P2P network as a way tospread tampered with resources; including Trojan Horses; viruses; and spam. To addressthis problem we propose a self-regulating system where the P2P network is used toimplement a robust reputation mechanism. Reputation sharing is realized through adistributed polling algorithm by which resource requestors can assess the reliability of aresource offered by a participant before initiating the download. This way; spreading ofmalicious contents will be reduced and eventually blocked. Our approach can be …,Proceedings of the 9th ACM conference on Computer and communications security,2002,874
A fine-grained access control system for XML documents,Ernesto Damiani; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Web-based applications greatly increase information availability and ease ofaccess; which is optimal for public information. The distribution and sharing of informationvia the Web that must be accessed in a selective way; such as electronic commercetransactions; require the definition and enforcement of security controls; ensuring thatinformation will be accessible only to authorized entities. Different approaches have beenproposed that address the problem of protecting information in a Web system. However;these approaches typically operate at the file-system level; independently of the data thathave to be protected from unauthorized accesses. Part of this problem is due to thelimitations of HTML; historically used to design Web documents.

Over-encryption: management of access control evolution on outsourced data,Sabrina De Capitani Di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Data outsourcing is emerging today as a successful paradigm allowing users andorganizations to exploit external services for the distribution of resources. A crucial problemto be addressed in this context concerns the enforcement of selective authorization policiesand the support of policy updates in dynamic scenarios. In this paper; we present a novelsolution to the enforcement of access control and the management of its evolution. Ourproposal is based on the application of selective encryption as a means to enforceauthorizations. Two layers of encryption are imposed on data: the inner layer is imposed bythe owner for providing initial protection; the outer layer is imposed by the server to reflectpolicy modifications. The combination of the two layers provides an efficient and robustsolution. The paper presents a model; an algorithm for the management of the two layers …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,450
Balancing confidentiality and efficiency in untrusted relational DBMSs,Ernesto Damiani; SDCD Vimercati; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract The scope and character of today's computing environments are progressivelyshifting from traditional; one-on-one client-server interaction to the new cooperativeparadigm. It then becomes of primary importance to provide means of protecting the secrecyof the information; while guaranteeing its availability to legitimate clients. Operating on-linequerying services securely on open networks is very difficult; therefore many enterprisesoutsource their data center operations to external application service providers. A promisingdirection towards prevention of unauthorized access to outsourced data is represented byencryption. However; data encryption is often supported for the sole purpose of protectingthe data in storage and assumes trust in the server; that decrypts data for query execution.

XML-GL: a graphical language for querying and restructuring XML documents1,Stefano Ceri; Sara Comai; Ernesto Damiani; Piero Fraternali; Stefano Paraboschi; Letizia Tanca,Abstract The growing acceptance of XML as a standard for semi-structured documents onthe Web opens up challenging opportunities for Web query languages. In this paper weintroduce XML-GL; a graphical query language for XML documents. The use of a visualformalism for representing both the content of XML documents (and of their DTDs) and thesyntax and semantics of queries enables an intuitive expression of queries; even when theyare rather complex. XML-GL is inspired by G-log; a general purpose; logic-based languagefor querying structured and semi-structured data. The paper presents the basic capabilitiesof XML-GL through a sequence of examples of increasing complexity.,Computer networks,1999,407
Specification and implementation of exceptions in workflow management systems,Fabio Casati; Stefano Ceri; Stefano Paraboschi; Guiseppe Pozzi,Abstract Although workflow management systems are most applicable when an organizationfollows standard business processes and routines; any of these processes faces the needfor handling exceptions; ie; asynchronous and anomalous situations that fall outside thenormal control flow. In this paper we concentrate upon anomalous situtations that; althoughunusual; are part of the semantics of workflow applications; and should be specified andmonitored coherently; in most real-life applications; such exceptions affect a significantfraction of workflow cases. However; very few workflow management systems are integratedwith a highly expressive language for specifying this kind of exception and with a systemcomponent capable of handling it.

Designing data marts for data warehouses,Angela Bonifati; Fabiano Cattaneo; Stefano Ceri; Alfonso Fuggetta; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract Data warehouses are databases devoted to analytical processing. They are used tosupport decision-making activities in most modern business settings; when complex datasets have to be studied and analyzed. The technology for analytical processing assumesthat data are presented in the form of simple data marts; consisting of a well-identifiedcollection of facts and data analysis dimensions (star schema). Despite the wide diffusion ofdata warehouse technology and concepts; we still miss methods that help and guide thedesigner in identifying and extracting such data marts out of an enterprisewide informationsystem; covering the upstream; requirement-driven stages of the design process.

Automatic generation of production rules for integrity maintenance,Stefano Ceri; Piero Fraternali; Stefano Paraboschi; Letizia Tanca,Abstract In this article we present an approach to integrity maintenance; consisting ofautomatically generating production rules for integrity enforcement. Constraints areexpressed as particular formulas of Domain Relational Calculus; they are automaticallytranslated into a set of repair actions; encoded as production rules of an active databasesystem. Production rules may be redundant (they enforce the same constraint in differentways) and conflicting (because repairing one constraint may cause the violation of anotherconstraint). Thus; it is necessary to develop techniques for analyzing the properties of the setof active rules and for ensuring that any computation of production rules after any incorrecttransaction terminates and produces a consistent database state. Along these guidelines;we describe a specific architecture for constraint definition and enforcement. The …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1994,202
Combining fragmentation and encryption to protect privacy in data storage,Valentina Ciriani; Sabrina De Capitani Di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract The impact of privacy requirements in the development of modern applications isincreasing very quickly. Many commercial and legal regulations are driving the need todevelop reliable solutions for protecting sensitive information whenever it is stored;processed; or communicated to external parties. To this purpose; encryption techniques arecurrently used in many scenarios where data protection is required since they provide alayer of protection against the disclosure of personal information; which safeguardscompanies from the costs that may arise from exposing their data to privacy breaches.However; dealing with encrypted data may make query processing more expensive. In thisarticle; we address these issues by proposing a solution to enforce the privacy of datacollections that combines data fragmentation with encryption.

P2P-based collaborative spam detection and filtering,Ernesto Damiani; S De Capitani Di Vimercati; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Spam is one of the major problems of today email systems. While many solutions have beenproposed to automatically detect and filter spam; spammers are getting more and moretechnically sophisticated and aware of internal workings of anti-spam systems; finding waysto disguise their emails to get around the different controls that can be enforced.

Fuzzy techniques for trust and reputation management in anonymous peer‐to‐peer systems,Roberto Aringhieri; Ernesto Damiani; Di Vimercati; Sabine De Capitani; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangelo Samarati,Abstract Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications are rapidly gaining acceptance among users ofInternet-based services; especially because of their capability of exchanging resourceswhile preserving the anonymity of both requesters and providers. However; concerns havebeen raised about the possibility that malicious users can exploit the network to spreadtampered-with resources (eg; malicious programs and viruses). A considerable amount ofresearch has thus focused on the development of trust and reputation models in P2Pnetworks. In this article; we propose to use fuzzy techniques in the design of reputationsystems based on collecting and aggregating peers' opinions. Fuzzy techniques are used inthe evaluation and synthesis of all the opinions expressed by peers. The behavior of theproposed system is described by comparison with probabilistic approaches.,Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology,2006,147

Encryption policies for regulating access to outsourced data,Sabrina De Capitani Di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Current access control models typically assume that resources are under the strictcustody of a trusted party which monitors each access request to verify if it is compliant withthe specified access control policy. There are many scenarios where this approach isbecoming no longer adequate. Many clear trends in Web technology are creating a need forowners of sensitive information to manage access to it by legitimate users using the servicesof honest but curious third parties; that is; parties trusted with providing the required servicebut not authorized to read the actual data content. In this scenario; the data owner encryptsthe data before outsourcing and stores them at the server. Only the data owner and userswith knowledge of the key will be able to decrypt the data. Possible access authorizationsare to be enforced by the owner. In this article; we address the problem of enforcing …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2010,137
A data outsourcing architecture combining cryptography and access control,Sabrina De Capitani Di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Data outsourcing is becoming today a successful solution that allows users andorganizations to exploit external servers for the distribution of resources. Some of the mostchallenging issues in such a scenario are the enforcement of authorization policies and thesupport of policy updates. Since a common approach for protecting the outsourced dataconsists in encrypting the data themselves; a promising approach for solving these issues isbased on the combination of access control with cryptography. This idea is in itself not new;but the problem of applying it in an outsourced architecture introduces several challenges. Inthis paper; we first illustrate the basic principles on which an architecture for combiningaccess control and cryptography can be built. We then illustrate an approach for enforcingauthorization policies and supporting dynamic authorizations; allowing policy changes …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM workshop on Computer security architecture,2007,134
Active rules for XML: A new paradigm for E-services,Angela Bonifati; Stefano Ceri; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract. XML is rapidly becoming one of the most widely adopted technologies forinformation exchange and representation. As the use of XML becomes more widespread;we foresee the development of active XML rules; ie; rules explicitly designed for themanagement of XML information. In particular; we argue that active rules for XML offer anatural paradigm for the rapid development of innovative e-services. In the paper; we showhow active rules can be specified in the context of XSLT; a pattern-based language forpublishing XML documents (promoted by the W3C) which is receiving strong commercialsupport; and Lorel; a query language for XML documents that is quite popular in theresearch world. We demonstrate; through simple examples of active rules for XSLT andLorel; that active rules can be effective for the implementation of e-commerce services …,The VLDB Journal,2001,116
Improved rule analysis by means of triggering and activation graphs,Elena Baralis; Stefano Ceri; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract In this paper; we propose new methods for the compile-time analysis of thebehavior of active rules; based on the distinction between mutual triggering and mutualactivation of rules. This distinction motivates the introduction of two graphs defining ruleinteraction; called triggering and activation graphs respectively. Analysis techniquespresented in this paper are focused on the problem of termination; results provide asystematic identification of reactive behaviors which can be guaranteed to terminate andreactive behaviors which may lead to infinite rule processing.,International Workshop on Rules in Database Systems,1995,114
Fine grained access control for SOAP e-services,Ernesto Damiani; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,ABSTRACT Lightweight protocols for remote service invocation via HTTP and XML; such asSOAP; are rapidly gaining acceptance among developers of Internet-based e-services;especially because of their firewall-traversal capabilities. However; no standard techniquefor access control security is currently defined for either HTTP or SOAP itself. Concerns havebeen raised about the possibility that different SOAP applications will deal with embeddedsecurity in different ways; leading to application-dependent security holes. In this paper; wepropose an approach that relies on the XML structure of SOAP requests to support fine-grained authorizations at the level of individual XML elements and attributes that compose aSOAP call. The result is a simple; yet powerful and general; technique to enforce accessrestrictions to SOAP invocations.,Proceedings of the 10th international conference on World Wide Web,2001,113

Keep a few: Outsourcing data while maintaining confidentiality,Valentina Ciriani; Sabrina De Capitani Di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract We put forward a novel paradigm for preserving privacy in data outsourcing whichdeparts from encryption. The basic idea behind our proposal is to involve the owner instoring a limited portion of the data; and maintaining all data (either at the owner or atexternal servers) in the clear. We assume a relational context; where the data to beoutsourced is contained in a relational table. We then analyze how the relational table canbe fragmented; minimizing the load for the data owner. We propose several metrics andpresent a general framework capturing all of them; with a corresponding algorithm finding aheuristic solution to a family of NP-hard problems.,European Symposium on Research in Computer Security,2009,104

In such a scenario; access control is a very important issue;especially if the data owner wishes to publish her data for external use.

This paper presentsanalysis techniques focused on detecting termination of rule execution. We describe anapproach which combines static analysis of a rule set at compile-time and detection ofendless loops during rule processing at runtime. The compile-time analysis technique isbased on the distinction between mutual triggering and mutual activation of rules. Thisdistinction motivates the introduction of two graphs defining rule interaction; calledTriggering and Activation Graphs; respectively. This analysis technique allows us to identifyreactive behaviors which are guaranteed to terminate and reactive behaviors which maylead to infinite rule processing.

An Open Digest-based Technique for Spam Detection.,Ernesto Damiani; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract A promising anti-spam technique consists in collecting users opinions that givenemail messages are spam and using this collective judgment to block message propagationto other users. To be effective; this strategy requires a way to identify similarity among emailmessages; even if the program used by the spammer to generate the messages may try toobfuscate their common origin. In this paper; we investigate the issues arising in the designof a digest-based spam detection mechanism; which has to satisfy many conflictingrequirements: protect message confidentiality; be public; and prove difficult or expensive tofool by obfuscation techniques that automatically introduce differences into the same basespam message. We show that an open digest function is able to satisfy the aboverequirements and contribute to the fight against spam.,ISCA PDCS,2004,98

Modularization techniques for active rules design,Elena Baralis; Stefano Ceri; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract Active database systems can be used to establish and enforce data managementpolicies. A large amount of the semantics that normally needs to be coded in applicationprograms can be abstracted and assigned to active rules. This trend is sometimes called“knowledge independence” a nice consequence of achieving full knowledge independenceis that data management policies can then effectively evolve just by modifying rules insteadof application programs. Active rules; however; may be quite complex to understand andmanage: rules react to arbitrary event sequences; they trigger each other; and sometimesthe outcome of rule processing may depend on the order in which events occur or rules arescheduled. Although reasoning on a large collection of rules is very difficult; the taskbecomes more manageable when the rules are few. Therefore; we are convinced that …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1996,82

We therefore regard XML-related research as the most promising and challenging direction for the community ofdatabase researchers. In this paper; we approach XML-related research by taking threeprogressive perspectives. We first consider XML as a data representation standard (in thesmall); then as a data interchange standard (in the large); and finally as a basis for buildinga new repository technology. After a broad and necessarily coarse-grain analysis; we turnour focus to three specific research projects which are currently ongoing at the Politecnico diMilano; concerned with XML query languages; with active document management; and withXML-based specifications of Web sites.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2000,78

Preserving confidentiality of security policies in data outsourcing,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Gerardo Pelosi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Recent approaches for protecting information in data outsourcing scenarios exploitthe combined use of access control and cryptography. In this context; the number of keys tobe distributed and managed by users can be maintained limited by using a public catalog oftokens that allow key derivation along a hierarchy. However; the public token catalog; byexpressing the key derivation relationships; may leak information on the security policies(authorizations) enforced by the system; which the data owner may instead wish to maintainconfidential. In this paper; we present an approach to protect the privacy of the tokenspublished in the public catalog.

Implementing a reputation-aware gnutella servent,Fabrizio Cornelli; Ernesto Damiani; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Peer-to-peer (P2P) architectures have recently become the subject of consider- ableinterest; both in the population of Internet users and in the research com- munity [4;6;7;8;9;10;11;17]. Internet users find in P2P applications a convenient solution for the anonymous exchangeof resources. The research community has looked with interest to the huge success that theseapplications were achieving and it has started to investigate many issues that arise in thiscontext; like per- formance; usability; and robustness [2;6;12;13]. These architectures appearas an interesting paradigm for the development of many novel network applications. One of theurgent issues to be investigated is the definition of security mech- anisms that would permit toreduce the risks that are currently faced by users of these applications [1]. Anonymity of the interactionis one of the major reasons of the success of these solutions; but it usually implies that no …,International Conference on Research in Networking,2002,61
Selective data encryption in outsourced dynamic environments,Ernesto Damiani; S De Capitani Di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract The amount of information held by organizations' databases is increasing veryquickly. A recently proposed solution to the problem of data management; which isbecoming increasingly popular; is represented by database outsourcing. Severalapproaches have been presented to database outsourcing management; investigating theapplication of data encryption together with indexing information to allow the execution ofqueries at the third party; without the need of decrypting the data. These proposals assumeaccess control to be under the control of the data owner; who has to filter all the accessrequests to data. In this paper; we put forward the idea of outsourcing also the access controlenforcement at the third party. Our approach combines cryptography together withauthorizations; thus enforcing access control via selective encryption. The paper …,Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science,2007,57
Encryption-based policy enforcement for cloud storage,S De Capitani Di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Gerardo Pelosi; Pierangela Samarati,Nowadays; users are more and more exploiting external storage and connectivity for sharingand disseminating user-generated content. To this aim; they can benefit of the servicesoffered by Internet companies; which however assume that the service provider is entitled toaccess the resources. To overcome this limitation; we present an approach that does notrequire complete trust in the external service wrt both resource content and authorizationmanagement; while at the same time allowing users to delegate to the provider theenforcement of the access control policy on their resources. Our solution relies on thetranslation of the access control policy into an equivalent encryption policy on resources andon a hierarchical key structure that limits both the number of keys to be maintained and theamount of encryption to be enforced.,Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW); 2010 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2010,53
Fragmentation design for efficient query execution over sensitive distributed databases,Valentina Ciriani; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,The balance between privacy and utility is a classical problem with an increasing impact onthe design of modern information systems. On the one side it is crucial to ensure thatsensitive information is properly protected; on the other side; the impact of protection on theworkload must be limited as query efficiency and system performance remain a primaryrequirement. We address this privacy/efficiency balance proposing an approach that;starting from a flexible definition of confidentiality constraints on a relational schema; appliesencryption on information in a parsimonious way and mostly relies on fragmentation toprotect sensitive associations among attributes. Fragmentation is guided by workloadconsiderations so to minimize the cost of executing queries over fragments. We discuss theminimization problem when fragmenting data and provide a heuristic approach to its …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2009. ICDCS'09. 29th IEEE International Conference on,2009,53
Metadata management in outsourced encrypted databases,Ernesto Damiani; S De Capitani Di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Database outsourcing is becoming increasingly popular introducing a newparadigm; called database-as-a-service; where a client's database is stored at an externalservice provider. Outsourcing databases to external providers promises higher availabilityand more effective disaster protection than in-house operations. This scenario presents newresearch challenges on which the usability of the system is based. In particular; oneimportant aspect is the metadata that must be provided to support the proper working of thesystem. In this paper; we illustrate the metadata that are needed; at the client and server; tostore and retrieve mapping information for processing a query issued by a client applicationto the server storing the outsourced database. We also present an approach to develop anefficient access control technique and the corresponding metadata needed for its …,Workshop on Secure Data Management,2005,52
Xml access control systems: A component-based approach,Ernesto Damiani; S De Capitani di Vimercati; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract We recently proposed an access control model for XML information that permits thedefinition of authorizations at a fine granularity.

Implementation of a storage mechanism for untrusted DBMSs,Ernesto Damiani; S De Capitani Di Vimercati; Mario Finetti; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati; Sushil Jajodia,Several architectures have been recently proposed that store relational data in encryptedform on untrusted relational databases. Such architectures permit the creation of novelInternet services and also offer an opportunity for a better construction of ASP solutions.Environments where there are limited resources that do not permit an efficient managementof databases or where it is critical to offer a robust Internet access to private data may allbenefit from the above architectures. In this paper we analyze the impact that thisarchitecture has on the typical services of a database. The analysis is based on theexperience gained in the construction of a prototype of a complete architecture for themanagement of encrypted databases. Specifically; we illustrate the impact on querytranslation and optimization; and the main components of the software architecture of the …,Security in Storage Workshop; 2003. SISW'03.

A review of repairing techniques for integrity maintenance,Piero Fraternali; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract In this paper we review the research on integrity enforcement in database systems.Integrity enforcement is the task of ensuring that a user transaction applied to a legaldatabase state leads to a new state which is also legal. The common rationale of theresearch in this area is to centralize the management of data integrity; by extracting this taskfrom application programs and by bringing it into an ad-hoc component; which may beincorporated into the DBMS.,*,1994,46
Fragments and loose associations: Respecting privacy in data publishing,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract We propose a modeling of the problem of privacy-compliant data publishing thatcaptures confidentiality constraints on one side and visibility requirements on the other side.Confidentiality constraints express the fact that some attributes; or associations among them;are sensitive and cannot be released. Visibility requirements express requests for viewsover data that should be provided. We propose a solution based on data fragmentation tosplit sensitive associations while ensuring visibility. In addition; we show how sensitiveassociations broken by fragmentation can be released in a sanitized form as looseassociations formed in a way to guarantee a specified degree of privacy.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,41
Enabling privacy-preserving credential-based access control with XACML and SAML,Claudio A Ardagna; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Gregory Neven; Stefano Paraboschi; Franz-Stefan Preiss; Pierangela Samarati; Mario Verdicchio,In this paper we describe extensions to the access control industry standards XACML andSAML to enable privacy-preserving and credential-based access control. Rather thanassuming that an enforcement point knows all the requester's attributes; our extensionsallow the requester to learn which attributes have to be revealed and which conditions mustbe satisfied; thereby enabling to leverage the advantages of privacy-preservingtechnologies such as anonymous credentials. Moreover; our extensions follow a credential-based approach; ie; attributes are regarded as being bundled together in credentials; andthe policy can refer to attributes within specific credentials. In addition to defining languageextensions; we also show how the XACML architecture and model of evaluating policies canbe adapted to the credential-based setting; and we discuss the problems that such …,Computer and Information Technology (CIT); 2010 IEEE 10th International Conference on,2010,39
Automatic rule generation for constraint enforcement in active databases,Piero Fraternali; Stefano Paraboschi; Letizia Tanca,Abstract In conventional database systems; consistency is preserved either by forbiddingoperations that violate integrity constraints or by rolling back transactions that produceinconsistent database states. A third way to integrity maintenance is that of post processingfaulty transactions; by introducing system-generated compensating actions that lead to adatabase state which is consistent and as close as possible to that intended by the user.Active databases provide the appropriate technology to implement this paradigm. Weintroduce a framework in which constraints are expressed in a logical language andautomatically translated into a set of database rules. We stress automatic derivation not onlyof the triggering conditions of rules but also of the compensating actions; so that the user ispresented with the complete set of actions available to repair constraint violations.

Efficient key management for enforcing access control in outsourced scenarios,Carlo Blundo; Stelvio Cimato; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Alfredo De Santis; Sara Foresti; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Data outsourcing is emerging today as a successful paradigm allowing individualsand organizations to exploit external servers for storing and distributing data. While trustedto properly manage the data; external servers are often not authorized to read them;therefore requiring data to be encrypted. In such a context; the application of an accesscontrol policy requires different data to be encrypted with different keys so to allow theexternal server to directly enforce access control and support selective dissemination andaccess. The problem therefore emerges of designing solutions for the efficient managementof the encryption policy enforcing access control; with the goal of minimizing the number ofkeys to be maintained by the system and distributed to users. Since such a problem is NP-hard; we propose a heuristic approach to its solution based on a key derivation graph …,IFIP International Information Security Conference,2009,38
An experimental evaluation of multi-key strategies for data outsourcing,Ernesto Damiani; S De Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Data outsourcing is emerging today as a successful solution for organizationslooking for a cost-effective way to make their data available for on-line querying. To protectoutsourced data from unauthorized accesses; even from the (honest but curious) hostserver; data are encrypted and indexes associated with them enable the server to executequeries without the need of accessing cleartext. Current solutions consider the wholedatabase as encrypted with a single key known only to the data owner; which therefore hasto be kept involved in the query execution process. In this paper; we propose different multi-key data encryption strategies for enforcing access privileges. Our strategies exploit differentkeys; which are distributed to the users; corresponding to the different authorizations.

Controlled information sharing in collaborative distributed query processing,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,We present a simple; yet powerful; approach for the specification and enforcement ofauthorizations regulating data release among data holders collaborating in a distributedcomputation; to ensure that query processing discloses only data whose release has beenexplicitly authorized. Data disclosure is captured by means of profiles; associated with eachdata computation; that describe the information carried by the result. We also present analgorithm that; given a query plan; determines whether it can be safely executed andproduces a safe execution strategy. The main advantage of our approach is its simplicitythat; without impacting expressiveness; makes it nicely interoperable with current solutionsfor collaborative computations in distributed database systems.,Distributed Computing Systems; 2008.

Our approach relies on different mutually supporting techniques offering strongintegrity protection guarantees at a limited cost. The application of the approach iscompletely transparent to the computational provider; against which data and queryconfidentiality are preserved. The paper introduces our techniques analytically; examiningtheir protection guarantees and performance. It also illustrates experimental results; whichconfirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our solutions.,IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing,2013,31

Run-time detection of non-terminating active rule systems,Elena Baralis; Stefano Ceri; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract Especially during the design and tuning of active rules; it is possible that ruleexecution enters an endless loop; where rules “cascade” by triggering each otherindefinitely; so that their processing does not terminate. Commercial systems detect thissituation in a simple way; by keeping counters on the number or depth of cascading rules;and suspending an execution when the counters exceed given thresholds. However; thesetting of these counters is quite critical: too low thresholds may cause the halting of ruleprocessing in absence of loops; too high thresholds may reveal a loop only after anexpensive processing. In this paper; we propose a technique for revealing loops; which isbased on recognizing that a given situation has already occurred in the past and thereforewill occur an infinite number of times in the future.

Integrating trust management and access control in data-intensive web applications,Sabrina De Capitani Di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Giuseppe Psaila; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract The widespread diffusion of Web-based services provided by public and privateorganizations emphasizes the need for a flexible solution for protecting the informationaccessible through Web applications. A promising approach is represented by credential-based access control and trust management. However; although much research has beendone and several proposals exist; a clear obstacle to the realization of their benefits in data-intensive Web applications is represented by the lack of adequate support in the DBMSs. Asa matter of fact; DBMSs are often responsible for the management of most of the informationthat is accessed using a Web browser or a Web service invocation. In this article; we aim ateliminating this gap; and present an approach integrating trust management with the accesscontrol of the DBMS.

Selective data outsourcing for enforcing privacy,Valentina Ciriani; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Existing approaches for protecting sensitive information outsourced at external“honest-but-curious” servers are typically based on an overlying layer of encryption appliedto the whole database; or on the combined use of fragmentation and encryption. In thispaper; we put forward a novel paradigm for preserving privacy in data outsourcing; whichdeparts from encryption. The basic idea is to involve the owner in storing a limited portion ofthe data; while storing the remaining information in the clear at the external server. Weanalyze the problem of computing a fragmentation that minimizes the owner's workload;which is represented using different metrics and corresponding weight functions; and provethat this minimization problem is NP-hard.

Effective scheduling of detached rules in active databases,Stefano Ceri; Claudio Gennaro; Stefano Paraboschi; Giuseppe Serazzi,While triggers have become a classical ingredient of relational database systems; researchin active databases is aiming at extending the functionality and expressive power of activerules beyond the scope of relational triggers. One of the most important current trendconcerns the support of detached active rules; ie; of rules which are executed as separatetransactions; running outside of the scope of the transaction which generates the triggeringevent. Detached rules have important applications in workflow management and globalintegrity maintenance across transactions. One of the main issues in designing the ruleengine for detached rules is determining their optimal scheduling. In this paper; we study theperformance of a detached rule scheduler whose objective is to minimize the interference ofdetached rule execution with regard to the normal transactional load. This objective is …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2003,30
Enforcing dynamic write privileges in data outsourcing,Sabrina De Capitani Di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Giovanni Livraga; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Users and companies are more and more resorting to external providers for storingtheir data and making them available to others. Since data sharing is typically selective (ie;accesses to certain data should be allowed only to authorized users); there is the problem ofenforcing authorizations on the outsourced data. Recently proposed approaches based onselective encryption provide convenient enforcement of read privileges; but are not directlyapplicable for supporting write privileges. In this paper; we extend selective encryptionapproaches to the support of write privileges. Our proposal enriches the approach based onkey derivation of existing solutions and complements it with a hash-based approach forsupporting write privileges. Enforcement of write privileges and of possible policy updatesrelies on the–controlled–cooperation of the external provider. Our solution also allows the …,Computers & Security,2013,29

Enforcing confidentiality constraints on sensitive databases with lightweight trusted clients,Valentina Ciriani; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Existing approaches for protecting sensitive information stored (outsourced) atexternal “honest-but-curious” servers are typically based on an overlying layer of encryptionthat is applied on the whole information; or use a combination of fragmentation andencryption. The computational load imposed by encryption makes such approaches notsuitable for scenarios with lightweight clients. In this paper; we address this issue andpropose a novel model for enforcing privacy requirements on the outsourced informationwhich departs from encryption. The basic idea of our approach is to store a small portion ofthe data (just enough to break sensitive associations) on the client; which is trusted beingunder the data owner control; while storing the remaining information in clear form at theexternal (honest-but-curious) server.

Private data indexes for selective access to outsourced data,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Cloud storage services have recently emerged as a successful approach formaking resources conveniently available to large communities of users. Several techniqueshave been investigated for enabling such services; including encryption for ensuring dataprotection; as well as indexing for enabling efficient query execution on encrypted data.When data are to be made available selectively; the combined use of the two techniquesmust be handled with care; since indexes can put the confidentiality protection guaranteedby encryption at risk.

One-to-One Personalization of Data-Intensive Web Sites.,Stefano Ceri; Piero Fraternali; Andrea Maurino; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract The main purpose of research on the integration of Web Technology with databasesystems is the delivery of Data-Intensive Web Sites; ie; Web applications whose primarypurpose is to present a large amount of content to a variety of possible users. These sitesmust offer a generic user the possibility to browse a large collection of data; in a way thatfulfills some application-specific goal eg; in electronic commerce; showing to each userexactly those goods that he will most likely purchase.

Fragmentation in presence of data dependencies,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Giovanni Livraga; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Fragmentation has been recently proposed as a promising approach to protect theconfidentiality of sensitive associations whenever data need to undergo external release orstorage. By splitting attributes among different fragments; fragmentation guaranteesconfidentiality of the associations among these attributes under the assumption that suchassociations cannot be reconstructed by re-combining the fragments. We note that therequirement that fragments do not have attributes in common; imposed by previousproposals; is only a necessary; but not sufficient; condition to ensure that information indifferent fragments cannot be recombined as dependencies may exist among data enablingsome form of linkability.

Assessing query privileges via safe and efficient permission composition,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract We propose an approach for the selective enforcement of access control restrictionsin; possibly distributed; large data collections based on two basic concepts: i) flexibleauthorizations identify; in a declarative way; the data that can be released; and ii) queriesare checked for execution not with respect to individual authorizations but rather evaluatingwhether the information release they (directly or indirectly) entail is allowed by theauthorizations. Our solution is based on the definition of query profiles capturing theinformation content of a query and builds on a graph-based modeling of database schema;authorizations; and queries. Access control is then effectively modeled and efficientlyexecuted in terms of graph coloring and composition and on traversal of graph paths. Wethen provide a polynomial composition algorithm for determining if a query is authorized.,Proceedings of the 15th ACM conference on Computer and communications security,2008,24
Ordering and selecting production rules for constraint maintenance: Complexity and heuristic solution,Piero Fraternali; Stefano Paraboschi,Presents a technique for analyzing the run-time behavior of integrity constraint repairactions; ie active database rules that are specifically designed to correct violations ofdatabase integrity. When constraints become violated due to an incorrect user transaction;rule computation is started to restore the database to a correct state. Since repair actionsmay be numerous and may conflict with each other; automated support for the analysis oftheir run-time behavior is necessary. The proposed technique helps the rule baseadministrator define a repair rule selection strategy such that the computation terminates forevery input transaction; the final database state satisfies all the constraints; and the user'spreferences among different ways to restore integrity are taken into account. In addition; itcan be used by the rule designer to spot" dangerous" rules that may be subject to …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1997,23

Privacy of outsourced data,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti,Abstract Data outsourced to an external storage server are usually encrypted since there isthe common assumption that all data are equally sensitive. The encrypted data howevercannot be efficiently queried and their selective release is not possible or require theapplication of specific solutions. To overcome these problems; new proposals have beenrecently developed; which are based on a fragmentation technique possibly combined withencryption. The main advantage of these proposals is that they limit the use of encryption;thus improving query execution efficiency. In this paper; we describe such fragmentation-based approaches focusing in particular on the different data fragmentation modelsproposed in the literature.

Distributed shuffling for preserving access confidentiality,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Stefano Paraboschi; Gerardo Pelosi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract The shuffle index has been recently proposed for organizing and accessing data inoutsourcing scenarios while protecting the confidentiality of the data as well as of theaccesses to them. In this paper; we extend the shuffle index to the use of multiple servers forstoring data; introducing a new protection technique (shadow) and enriching the originalones by operating in a distributed scenario. Our distributed shuffle index produces asignificant increase in the protection of the system; with no additional costs.,European Symposium on Research in Computer Security,2013,18
Authorization enforcement in distributed query evaluation,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract We present a simple; yet powerful; approach for the specification and enforcementof authorizations regulating data release among data holders collaborating in a distributedcomputation; to ensure that query processing discloses only data whose release has beenexplicitly authorized. Data disclosure is captured by means of profiles; associated with eachdata computation; that describe the information carried by a base or a derived (ie; computedby a query) relation. We present an algorithm that; given a query plan; determines whether itcan be safely executed and produces a safe execution strategy for it. For each operation in asafe query plan; the algorithm determines the server (s) responsible for the execution; basedon the entailed information flows; considering different strategies for the execution of joins.Finally; we discuss the architecture of a distributed database system based on the …,Journal of Computer Security,2011,18
Minimising disclosure of client information in credential-based interactions,Claudio A Ardagna; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,The advancements in ICT allow people to use and access resources and services on theweb anywhere and anytime. Servers offering resources typically require users to releaseinformation about them; which is then used to enforce possible access policies on theoffered services. Effective access to such resources requires the development ofapproaches for enabling the user to organise and manage all her credentials and regulatetheir release when interacting with other parties over the web. In this paper; we provide ameans for the user to specify how much she values the release of different properties;credentials; or combinations thereof as well as additional constraints that she might imposeon information disclosure.

Supporting privacy preferences in credential-based interactions,Claudio A Ardagna; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Users can today enjoy the many benefits brought by the development andwidespread adoption of Internet and related services conveniently accessing digitalresources. Servers offering such resources typically require users to release informationabout them; which servers can then use for enforcing possible access policies on the offeredservices. A major problem in this context relates to providing users with the ability ofdetermining which information to release to satisfy the server requests during their electronicinteractions. In this paper; we provide an approach for empowering the user in the release ofher digital portfolio based on simple sensitivity labels expressing how much the user valuesdifferent properties; credentials or combinations thereof; as well as on additional constraintsthat the user might impose on information disclosure.

Constraint management in Chimera,Stefano Ceri; Piero Fraternali; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract Chimera is a novel database language jointly designed by researchers atPolitecnico di Milano; Bonn University; and ECRC of Munich in the context of the EspritProject P6333; IDEA. Chimera integrates an object-oriented data model; a declarative querylanguage based on deductive rules; and an active rule language for reactive processing. Inthis paper; we present the authors' proposal for constraint management in Chimera; whichrelies on the declarative specification of passive constraints as deductive rules and on theirtransformation into different types of active rules.,IEEE Data Eng.

Shuffle index: efficient and private access to outsourced data,Sabrina De Capitani Di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Stefano Paraboschi; Gerardo Pelosi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Data outsourcing and cloud computing have been emerging at an ever-growingrate as successful approaches for allowing users and companies to rely on external servicesfor storing and managing data. As data and access to them are not under the control of thedata owner; there is a clear need to provide proper confidentiality protection. Suchrequirements concern the confidentiality not only of the stored data (content) but also of thespecific accesses (or patterns of them) that users make on such data. In this article; weaddress these issues and propose an approach for guaranteeing content; access; andpattern confidentiality in a data outsourcing scenario. The proposed solution is based on thedefinition of a shuffle index structure; which adapts traditional B+-trees and; by applying acombination of techniques (covers; caches; and shuffling); ensures confidentiality of the …,ACM Transactions on Storage (TOS),2015,15
Extending loose associations to multiple fragments,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Giovanni Livraga; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Data fragmentation has been proposed as a solution for protecting theconfidentiality of sensitive associations when publishing data at external servers. To enrichthe utility of the published fragments; a recent approach has put forward the idea ofcomplementing them with loose associations; a sanitized form of the sensitive associationsbroken by fragmentation. The original proposal considers fragmentations composed of twofragments only; and supports the definition of a loose association between this pair offragments. In this paper; we extend loose associations to multiple fragments. We firstillustrate how the publication of multiple loose associations between pairs of fragments of ageneric fragmentation can potentially expose sensitive associations. We then describe anapproach for supporting the more general case of publishing a loose association among …,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2013,15
Supporting concurrency and multiple indexes in private access to outsourced data 1,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Stefano Paraboschi; Gerardo Pelosi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Data outsourcing has recently emerged as a successful solution allowingindividuals and organizations to delegate data and service management to external thirdparties. A major challenge in the data outsourcing scenario is how to guarantee properprivacy protection against the external server. Recent promising approaches rely on theorganization of data in indexing structures that use encryption and the dynamic allocation ofencrypted data to physical blocks for destroying the otherwise static relationship betweendata and the blocks in which they are stored. However; dynamic data allocation implies theneed to re-write blocks at every read access; thus requesting exclusive locks that can affectconcurrency. Also; these solutions only support search conditions on the values of theattribute used for building the indexing structure.,Journal of Computer Security,2013,15
An intelligent database system application: The design of EMS,Elena Baralis; Stefano Ceri; Gabriella Monteleone; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract Intelligence in database systems is the capability of modeling both the complexstructure of data and its dynamic evolution. The Chimera intelligent database prototype;designed in the context of the IDEA Esprit project; provides an object-oriented data model;deductive rules to express computations; and production rules to implement active reactionsto database events.

Support for write privileges on outsourced data,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract In the last years; data outsourcing has received an increasing attention by theresearch community thanks to the benefits that it brings in terms of data management. Abasic requirement in such a scenario is that outsourced data be made accessible only toauthorized users; that is; no unauthorized party (including the storing server) should haveaccess to the data. While existing proposals provide a sound basis for addressing such aneed with respect to data dissemination (ie; enforcement of read authorizations); they fallshort on the support of write authorizations. In this paper we address such an open problemand present an approach to enforce write privileges over outsourced data. Our work nicelyextends and complements existing solutions; and exploiting key derivation tokens; hashing;and HMAC functions provides efficient and effective controls.,IFIP International Information Security Conference,2012,14
Trust management services in relational databases,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Trust management represents today a promising approach for supporting accesscontrol in open environments. While several approaches have been proposed for trustmanagement and significant steps have been made in this direction; a major obstacle thatstill exists in the realization of the benefits of this paradigm is represented by the lack ofadequate support in the DBMS. In this paper; we present a design that can be used toimplement trust management within current relational DBMSs. We propose a trust modelwith a SQL syntax and illustrate the main issues arising in the implementation of the modelin a relational DBMS. Specific attention is paid to the efficient verification of a delegationpath for certificates. This effort permits a relatively inexpensive realization of the services ofan advanced trust management model within current relational DBMSs.,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM symposium on Information; computer and communications security,2007,14

DockerPolicyModules: mandatory access control for docker containers,Enrico Bacis; Simone Mutti; Steven Capelli; Stefano Paraboschi,The wide adoption of Docker and the ability to retrieve images from different sources imposestrict security constraints. Docker leverages Linux kernel security facilities; such asnamespaces; cgroups and Mandatory Access Control; to guarantee an effective isolation ofcontainers. In order to increase Docker security and flexibility; we propose an extension tothe Dockerfile format to let image maintainers ship a specific SELinux policy for theprocesses that run in a Docker image; enhancing the security of containers.,Communications and Network Security (CNS); 2015 IEEE Conference on,2015,13
A cache-aware mechanism to enforce confidentiality; trackability and access policy evolution in Content-Centric Networks,Michele Mangili; Fabio Martignon; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract The Content-Centric Networking (CCN) paradigm introduces a novelcommunication model where any node in the network can implement caching functionalitiesto directly serve incoming content requests. However; such a radical change in the protocolstack poses new security challenges since the content producer loses control over the datahe provides to the network. Our contribution is to propose ConfTrack-CCN; an efficientencryption-based extension to the CCN proposal; designed to enforce confidential datadissemination; trackable content access and seamless support of policy evolution.ConfTrack-CCN jointly enforces all these three requirements by protecting the data with twolayers of encryption; the latter of which evolves to reflect access privilege updates.

Integrity for distributed queries,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Giovanni Livraga; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,We propose an approach for allowing users to assess the integrity of distributed queriescomputed by a computational cloud; which is trusted neither for data confidentiality nor forquery integrity. In particular; we consider join queries over multiple data sources; maintainedat separate (trusted) storage servers; where join computation is performed by aninexpensive; but potentially untrusted; computational cloud. We illustrate the working of ourapproach and its application in a MapReduce scenario. We also provide an analysis andexperimental results.,Communications and Network Security (CNS); 2014 IEEE Conference on,2014,12
On information leakage by indexes over data fragments,S De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Data fragmentation has recently emerged as a complementary approach to encryption forprotecting confidentiality of sensitive associations when storing data at external parties. Inthis paper; we discuss how the use of indexes; typically associated with the encryptedportion of the data; while desirable for providing effectiveness and efficiency in queryexecution; can-combined with fragmentation-cause potential leakage of confidential(encrypted or fragmented) information. We illustrate how the exposure to leakage variesdepending on the kind of indexes. Such observations can result useful for the design ofapproaches assessing information exposure and for the definition of safe (free frominferences) indexes in fragmented data.,Data Engineering Workshops (ICDEW); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,12
Managing key hierarchies for access control enforcement: Heuristic approaches,Carlo Blundo; Stelvio Cimato; Sabrina de Capitani Di Vimercati; Alfredo De Santis; Sara Foresti; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Data outsourcing is emerging today as a successful paradigm allowing individualsand organizations to resort to external servers for storing their data; and sharing them withothers. The main problem of this trend is that sensitive data are stored on a site that is notunder the data owner's direct control. This scenario poses a major security problem sinceoften the external server is relied upon for ensuring high availability of the data; but it is notauthorized to read them. Data need therefore to be encrypted. In such a context; theapplication of an access control policy requires different data to be encrypted with differentkeys so to allow the external server to directly enforce access control and support selectivedissemination and access. The problem therefore emerges of designing solutions for theefficient management of an encryption policy enforcing access control; with the goal of …,computers & security,2010,12
Sesqlite: Security enhanced sqlite: Mandatory access control for android databases,Simone Mutti; Enrico Bacis; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract SQLite is the most widely deployed in-process library that implements a SQLdatabase engine. It offers high storage efficiency; fast query operation and small memoryneeds. Due to the fact that a complete SQLite database is stored in a single cross-platformdisk file and SQLite does not support multiple users; anyone who has direct access to the filecan read the whole database content. SELinux was originally developed as a MandatoryAccess Control (MAC) mechanism for Linux to demonstrate how to overcome DAClimitations. However; SELinux provides per-file protection; thus the database file is treatedas an atomic unit; impeding the definition of a fine-grained mandatory access control (MAC)policy for database objects. We introduce SeSQLite; an SQLite extension that integratesSELinux access controls into SQLite with minimal performance and storage overhead …,Proceedings of the 31st Annual Computer Security Applications Conference,2015,11
AppPolicyModules: mandatory access control for third-party Apps,Enrico Bacis; Simone Mutti; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract Android has recently introduced the support for Mandatory Access Control; whichextends previous security services relying on the Android Permission Framework and on thekernel-level Discretionary Access Control. This extension has been obtained with the use ofSELinux and its adaptation to Android (SEAndroid). Currently; the use of the MAC model islimited to the protection of system resources. All the apps that are installed by users fall in asingle undifferentiated domain; untrusted_app. We propose an extension of the architecturethat permits to associate with each app a dedicated MAC policy; contained in a dedicatedappPolicyModule; in order to protect app resources even from malware with root privileges.A crucial difference with respect to the support for policy modules already available in someSELinux implementations is the need to constrain the policies in order to guarantee that …,Proceedings of the 10th ACM Symposium on Information; Computer and Communications Security,2015,11

While security is an important aspect in such a scenario; access control systemsavailable today result too rigid and limited.

The approach provides flexible; as it allows toenforce a variety of security policies and requirements at a fine-grained level withoutaffecting the data organization.,IFIP International Information Security Conference,2000,11
Design of active rule applications: Issues and approaches,Stefano Ceri; Elena Baralis; Piero Fraternali; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract The use of objects and rules in modern database systems is the main focus of theIDEA Esprit Project. In particular; it inspires the IDEA Methodology; a comprehensive andsystematic approach to the design of database applications which use both deductive andactive rules. The IDEA Methodology reconciles deductive and active rules by assigning themthe role of expressing knowledge about the application domain; either with a purelydeclarative style; or with a more procedural style. Although active rules are inherentlyprocedural; in many cases they can be automatically or semi-automatically generated fromdeclarative specifications. This paper is focused on active rules; the main research interestof the Politecnico in the IDEA project. We concentrate on active rule analysis; design; andprototyping as developed in the context of the IDEA Methodology.

Recent promisingsolutions for ensuring privacy in such scenarios rely on the use of encryption and on thedynamic allocation of encrypted data to memory blocks for destroying the otherwise staticrelationship between data and blocks in which they are stored. However; dynamic dataallocation implies the need to re-write blocks at every read access; thus requesting exclusivelocks that can affect concurrency.

Fuzzy logic techniques for reputation management in anonymous peer-to-peer systems.,Ernesto Damiani; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Stefano Paraboschi; Marco Pesenti; Pierangela Samarati; Sergio Zara,Abstract Emerging approaches to enforce some form of protection in (pseudo) anonymouspeer to peer systems propose the use of reputations as a means to establish the reliability ofservents and/or resources. How such reputations can be exchanged; aggregated and usedin actually determining the trust one may wish to put in a servent or resource is an issue stillto be investigated and for which fuzzy techniques can play an important role.

Mix&Slice: Efficient access revocation in the cloud,Enrico Bacis; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Stefano Paraboschi; Marco Rosa; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract We present an approach to enforce access revocation on resources stored atexternal cloud providers. The approach relies on a resource transformation that providesstrong mutual inter-dependency in its encrypted representation. To revoke access on aresource; it is then sufficient to update a small portion of it; with the guarantee that theresource as a whole (and any portion of it) will become unintelligible to those from whomaccess is revoked. The extensive experimental evaluation on a variety of configurationsconfirmed the effectiveness and efficiency of our solution; which showed excellentperformance and compatibility with several implementation strategies.,Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2016,9

Conflict detection in security policies using semantic web technology,M Arrigoni Neri; Marco Guarnieri; Eros Magri; Simone Mutti; Stefano Paraboschi,The design of efficient and effective techniques for security policy analysis is a crucial openproblem in modern information systems. Significant attention has been dedicated in the pastto the use of logical tools for the analysis of security policies; but this work has produced alimited impact on enterprise information systems. Important reasons of the limited success ofpast research were the difficult integration of these approaches with the technologicalscenario and the limited scalability of many proposals. Nowadays Semantic Web tools areincreasingly used in modern information systems.

Protecting access confidentiality with data distribution and swapping,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Stefano Paraboschi; Gerardo Pelosi; Pierangela Samarati,The protection of the confidentiality of outsourced data is an important problem. A criticalaspect is the ability to efficiently access data that are stored in an encrypted format; withoutgiving to the server managing access requests the ability to infer knowledge about the datacontent of the access executed by the clients. The approaches that have been proposed tosolve this problem rely on a continuous rewriting and re-encryption of the accessed data;like the shuffle index that has recently been proposed. We here propose a differentapproach that uses three independent servers to manage the data structure. The use ofthree servers is motivated by the increased protection that derives from the use ofindependent servers compared to the use of a single server. The protection shows toincrease in a significant way if a constraint is introduced that at every request an …,Big Data and Cloud Computing (BdCloud); 2014 IEEE Fourth International Conference on,2014,8

Materialized views in multidimensional databases,Stefano Paraboschi; Giuseppe Sindoni; Elena Baralis; Ernest Teniente,ABSTRACT This chapter presents materialized views in the context of multidimensionaldatabases (MDDBs). A materialized view is a view whose content is explicitly stored in thedatabase. The advantage of materializing views is that it is not necessary to recompute thequery every time the view is accessed. The shortcoming is that it has to be kept consistentwith the updates on the base tables. However; efficient incremental maintenance techniqueshave been proposed. MDDBs are an ideal environment for materialized views becausefrequency of updates is low; MDDB data models permit easy adoption of incrementalmaintenance; and queries can be modeled in such away to allow an easy definition of theview selection problem; ie; the problem of selecting which query to materialize in an MDDB.Hence; we present the problemsofchoosing and maintaining materialised views with the …,Multidimensional databases,2002,8

Three-server swapping for access confidentiality,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Stefano Paraboschi; Gerardo Pelosi; Pierangela Samarati,We propose an approach to protect confidentiality of data and accesses to them when dataare stored and managed by external providers; and hence not under direct control of theirowner. Our approach is based on the use of distributed data allocation among threeindependent servers and on a dynamic re-allocation of data at every access. Dynamic re-allocation is enforced by swapping data involved in an access across the servers in such away that accessing a given node implies re-allocating it to a different server; then destroyingthe ability of servers to build knowledge by observing accesses. The use of three serversprovides uncertainty; to the eyes of the servers; of the result of the swapping operation; evenin presence of collusion among them.,IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing,2015,7
Fine-grained disclosure of access policies,Claudio Agostino Ardagna; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Gregory Neven; Stefano Paraboschi; Franz-Stefan Preiss; Pierangela Samarati; Mario Verdicchio,Abstract In open scenarios; where servers may receive requests to access their servicesfrom possibly unknown clients; access control is typically based on the evaluation of(certified or uncertified) properties; that clients can present. Since assuming the client toknow a-priori the properties she should present to acquire access is clearly limiting; serversshould be able to respond to client requests with information on the access control policiesregulating access to the requested services. In this paper; we present a simple; yet flexibleand expressive; approach for allowing servers to specify disclosure policies; regulating ifand how access control policies on services can be communicated to clients. Our approachallows fine-grain specifications; thus capturing different ways in which policies; and portionsthereof; can be communicated.

Bayesian-Networks-Based Misuse and Anomaly Prevention System.,Pablo Garcia Bringas; Yoseba K Penya; Stefano Paraboschi; Paolo Salvaneschi,Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) aim at preventing network attacks andunauthorised remote use of computers. More accurately; depending on the kind of attack ittargets; an NIDS can be oriented to detect misuses (by defining all possible attacks) oranomalies (by modelling legitimate behaviour and detecting those that do not fit on thatmodel). Still; since their problem knowledge is restricted to possible attacks; misusedetection fails to notice anomalies and vice versa. Against this; we present here ESIDE-Depian; the first unified misuse and anomaly prevention system based on BayesianNetworks to analyse completely network packets; and the strategy to create a consistentknowledge model that integrates misuse and anomaly-based knowledge. Finally; weevaluate ESIDE-Depian against well-known and new attacks showing how it outperforms …,ICEIS (2),2008,6

Efficient integrity checks for join queries in the cloud 1,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Cloud computing is receiving massive interest from users and companies for itsconvenient support of scalable access to data and services. The variety and diversification ofoffers by cloud providers allow users to selectively adopt storage and computationalservices as they best suit their needs; including cost saving considerations. In such an opencontext; security remains a major concern; as confidentiality and integrity of data and queriesover them can be at risk. In this paper; we present efficient techniques to verify the integrity ofjoin queries computed by potentially untrusted cloud providers; while also protecting dataand computation confidentiality.

In particular; Section 18.1 illustrates how privacyissues can be effectively tackled by means of a credential-based access control thatincludes anonymous credentials. Section 18.2 shows how the expressivity of policylanguages can be exploited to introduce ontologies that model credential taxonomies andthe relations among them; with a particular stress on the support for delegation mechanisms.Section 18.3 investigates the privacy issues that arise in those access control systems thatare enriched with a dialog framework that enables servers to publish their policies. Finally;Section 18.4 maps these proposals onto a set of possible extensions of the architecture ofthe current de facto standard in access control policy languages: XACML.,*,2011,5

Access control management for secure cloud storage,Enrico Bacis; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Stefano Paraboschi; Marco Rosa; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract With the widespread success and adoption of cloud-based solutions; we arewitnessing an ever increasing reliance on external providers for storing and managing data.This evolution is greatly facilitated by the availability of solutions-typically based onencryption-ensuring the confidentiality of externally outsourced data against the storingprovider itself. Selective application of encryption (ie; with different keys depending on theauthorizations holding on data) provides a convenient approach to access control policyenforcement. Effective realization of such policy-based encryption entails addressingseveral problems related to key management; access control enforcement; andauthorization revocation; while ensuring efficiency of access and deployment with currenttechnology. We present the design and implementation of an approach to realize policy …,International Conference on Security and Privacy in Communication Systems,2016,4

The Algres testbed of CHIMERA: an active object-oriented database system,Stefano Ceri; Piero Fraternali; Stefano Paraboschi; Giuseppe Psaila,Chimera i? a novel database language integrating an object-oriented data model; adeclarative query language based on deductive rules; and an active rule language forreactive processing. In most active object-oriented databases; active rules are associatedwith objects through methods—rules are triggered by method activations; and are used asdevices for testing pre-and post-conditions for method applications to individual objectinstances. The Chimera approach is substantially different: it uses set-orzented active rules;activated as the effect of several; logically indistinguishable events affecting multiple objectinstances. This approach is consistent with the rest of Chimera; which supports a set-oriented; declarative query and update language. Object-orientation in Chimera guaranteesimportant advantages over relational active rules; due to the use of object tdenttjiers. In …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1995,4

Policy specialization to support domain isolation,Simone Mutti; Enrico Bacis; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract The exponential growth of modern information systems has introduced several newchallenges in the management of security requirements. Nowadays; the technologicalscenario has evolved and the introduction of MAC models provides a better isolation amongsoftware components and reduces the damages that the malicious or defective ones cancause to the systems. On one hand it is important to confine applications and limit theprivileges that they can request. On the other hand we want to let applications benefit fromthe flexibility given by MAC models; such as SELinux. In this paper we show how theconstructs already available in SELinux and the specialization of security domains can beleveraged to define boundaries where the applications are confined but still able tointroduce sophisticated security patterns; such as application isolation and the least …,Proceedings of the 2015 Workshop on Automated Decision Making for Active Cyber Defense,2015,3
Loose associations to increase utility in data publishing 1,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Giovanni Livraga; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Data fragmentation has been proposed as a solution for protecting theconfidentiality of sensitive associations when releasing data for publishing or externalstorage. To enrich the utility of data fragments; a recent approach has put forward the idea ofcomplementing a pair of fragments with some (non-precise; hence loose) information on theassociation between them. Starting from the observation that in presence of multiplefragments the publication of several independent associations between pairs of fragmentscan cause improper leakage of sensitive information; in this paper we extend looseassociations to operate over an arbitrary number of fragments.,Journal of Computer Security,2015,3
The PoSecCo security decision support system,Cataldo Basile; Antonio Lioy; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract This paper presents the PoSecCo approach to policy refinement; that is; theproblem of deriving the configurations for the security controls from a set of high-levelsecurity requirements. This process is very important for the security and trustworthiness ofthe IT infrastructure as confirmed by many studies that indicate it as the major cause ofsecurity breaches and availability problems. The PoSecCo project proposes an integratedsystem that refines a high-level policy into a set of configurations for the security controlsavailable in the information system. This is named the PoSecCo Security Decision SupportSystem (SDSS). The SDSS assists the administrators in all the configuration generationphases; it guides them into the policy specification and refinement process; helping them tomake the right decision; and; finally; automatically performs the refinement and analysis.,*,2012,3

Supporting user privacy preferences on information release in open scenarios,CLAUDIO AGOSTINO Ardagna; Sabrina DE CAPITANI DI VIMERCATI; Sara Foresti; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Access control solutions for open systems are typically based on the assumptionthat a client may adopt approached specifically designed for the server to protect thedisclosure of her sensitive information. These solutions however do not consider the specificprivacy requirements characterizing the client. In this paper; we put forward the idea ofadopting a different model at the client-side; aimed at minimizing the amount of sensitiveinformation released to a server. The model should be based on a formal modeling of theclient portfolio and should easily support the definition of privacy preferences and disclosurelimitations for empowering the user in the release of her personal information.,W3C Workshop on Privacy and data usage control,2010,3

Policy-driven system management,Henrik Plate; Cataldo Basile; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract Policy-driven system management or policy-based management (PBM) is aresearch domain that aims to automate the management of large-scale computing systems.The long-term vision of PBM is that humans no longer need to care for low-level aspects ofsystem management; but may focus on the specification of high-level management goalsthat will be autonomously enforced by computer agents. Ultimately; computing systems willbe comparable to; for instance; biological systems that regulate basic body functions such asthe heart rate without conscious intervention by humans. The promise of PBM lies; on theone hand; in reducing system management costs that grew significantly over the pastdecades and; on the other hand; in the improvement in service quality.

Our solution relies on the grouping of resources into buckets then organizedwith a binary search tree. The tree is built on an index computed in a non-invertible non-order preserving way; and supports efficient key-based retrieval. Our approach to provideaccess privacy builds on this data organization providing uniform observability to the serverin access execution and dynamically changing not only the physical storage allocation; butalso the logical structure itself.

Managing Data Sharing in OpenStack Swift with Over-Encryption,Enrico Bacis; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Daniele Guttadoro; Stefano Paraboschi; Marco Rosa; Pierangela Samarati; Alessandro Saullo,Abstract The sharing of large amounts of data is greatly facilitated by the adoption of cloudstorage solutions. In many scenarios; this adoption could be hampered by possibleconcerns about data confidentiality; as cloud providers are not trusted to know the content ofthe data they store. Especially when the data are organized in objects; the application of anencryption layer is an interesting solution to this problem; because it offers strongconfidentiality guarantees with a limited performance overhead. In a data sharing scenario;the management of access privileges then requires an adequate support for key derivationand for managing policy evolution. We present a solution that provides transparent supportfor the encryption of objects stored on Swift.

Rather than present exhaustive coverage;the chapter seeks to identify common approaches to identifying security conflicts;considering three relevant scenarios: access control policies; policy execution; and networkprotection.

In particular; a recent solution for verifying the integrity of equi-join queries is basedon the insertion of checks (markers and twins) whose presence provides probabilisticguarantees on the integrity of the computation. In this paper; we propose an approach forverifying the integrity of approximate join queries; which is based on the introduction of adiscretized version of the join attribute and on the translation of the approximate join into anequi-join defined over the discrete attribute added to the original relations. The proposedapproach guarantees the correctness and completeness of the join result; while causing alimited overhead for the user.,IFIP International Information Security Conference,2015,1

Debugging and Run-time Monitoring of Active Rules,Elena Baralis; Stefano Ceri; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract Especially during the design and tuning of active rules; it is possible that ruleexecution enters an endless loop; where rules “cascade” by triggering each otherindefinitely; so that their processing does not terminate. Commercial systems detect thissituation in a simple way; by keeping counters on the number or depth of cascading rules;and suspending an execution when the counters exceed given thresholds. However; thesetting of these counters is quite critical: too low thresholds may cause the halting of ruleprocessing in absence of loops; too high thresholds may reveal a loop only after anexpensive processing. In this paper; we propose a technique for revealing loops; which isbased on recognizing that a given situation has already occurred in the past and thereforewill occur an infinite number of times in the future.

Enforcing authorizations while protecting access confidentiality,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Stefano Paraboschi; Gerardo Pelosi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract. Cloud computing is the reference paradigm to provide data storage andmanagement in a convenient and scalable manner. However; moving data to the cloudraises several issues; including the confidentiality of data and of accesses that are no moreunder the direct control of the data owner. The shuffle index has been proposed as asolution for addressing these issues when data are stored at an external third party. In thispaper; we extend the shuffle index with support for access control; that is; for enforcingauthorizations on data. Our approach is based on the use of selective encryption and on theorganization of data and authorizations in two shuffle indexes. Owners regulate access totheir data through authorizations that allow different users to access different portions of thedata; while; at the same time; the confidentiality of accesses is guaranteed.

Confidentiality Protection in Large Databases,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Giovanni Livraga; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract A growing trend in today's society is outsourcing large databases to the cloud. Thispermits to move the management burden from the data owner to external providers; whichcan make vast and scalable infrastructures available at competitive prices. Since largedatabases can include sensitive information; effective protection of data confidentiality is akey issue to fully enable data owners to enjoy the benefits of cloud-based solutions. Dataencryption and data fragmentation have been proposed as two natural solutions forprotecting data confidentiality.

Each final user thought that each pieceof information could be always secure and uncorrupted. Nowadays; the problem has beenreconsidered introducing data encryption on the client side. The users hide their data fromuntrusted parties; encrypting and making them accessible only to authorized entities.

Improving Android security by widening the role of Mandatory Access Control,Enrico Bacis; Simone Mutti; Marco Rosa; Stefano Paraboschi,ABSTRACT In the evolution of Android; the Mandatory Access Control (MAC) at the level ofLinux kernel is assuming a central role.

In the MACschema; instead; the access privileges are defined in a global policy; that is enforced by thekernel. Only the system administrator can change the policy; thus preventing many securitythreats coming from malicious or misbehaving applications.

D3. 4–METHODS FOR ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT,Lead Author Org; Stefano Paraboschi; Mario Arrigoni Neri; Simone Mutti; Giuseppe Psaila; Paolo Salvaneschi; Cataldo Basile; Daniele Canavese; Theodoor Scholte,EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In modern distributed information systems; security controls arespread over different layers of the architecture and enforced through different artifacts.Planning the configuration of these numerous artifacts is done manually; based on thesecurity administrator's interpretation of IT level policies. Moreover; the links betweenpolicies and configurations are not recorded; making evolution and change managementdifficult and error prone. A primary goal of PoSecCo is to ameliorate these problems bymeans of tools which support security administrators in the task of bridging the gap betweenpolicies and configurations. By means of these tools; an administrator can define and refinepolicies; and generate the various configurations needed to enforce them. In addition; thetools record inter-connections to enable coherent security management.,*,2013,*
A Review of Repairing Techniques for Integrity,Piero Fraternali; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract In this paper we review the research on integrity enforcement in database systems.Integrity enforcement is the task of ensuring that a user transaction applied to a legaldatabase state leads to a new state which is also legal. The common rationale of theresearch in this area is to centralize the management of data integrity; by extracting this taskfrom application programs and by bringing it into an ad-hoc component; which may beincorporated into the DBMS.,Rules in Database Systems: Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Rules in Database Systems; Edinburgh; Scotland; 30 August–1 September 1993,2012,*
D2. 4–POLICY HARMONIZATION AND REASONING,Lead Author Org; Stefano Paraboschi; Mario Arrigoni Neri; Simone Mutti; Marco Guarnieri; Eros Magri; Marie-Noelle Lepareaux; Beatriz Gallego-Nicasio Crespo; Aldo Basile,EXECUTIVE SUMMARY A crucial issue in the definition of policies for Future InternetApplications is the presence of inconsistencies. Due to the large number; variety andheterogeneity of security requirements; inconsistencies occur with large frequency and it isimperative to define an approach able to cope with them. The identification ofinconsistencies is the task of a Harmonization phase; which analyzes the security policyand; based on the knowledge of the semantics of the constructs of the security policy; checksits consistency. In the same phase; the opportunity arises to identify optimizations of thepolicy or configuration; able to reduce the complexity and cost of the configuration; or toimprove the security of the system. The policy harmonization task (T2. 4) in PoSecCosupports the investigation along different lines; starting from the policy meta-models …,*,2012,*
D3. 3-CONFIGURATION META-MODEL,Annett Laube BFH; Guillaume Gagnerot BFH; Henrik Plate SAP; Gerhard Hassenstein BFH; Matteo Casalino SAP; Stefano Paraboschi; Cataldo Basile; Theodoor Scholte,This document describes the PoSecCo configuration meta-model. This meta-model can beconsidered as an extension of the PoSecCo Functional System Model. It defines capabilitiesand configurations of software components (IT resources) in a product-and vendor-independent way. The PoSecCo configuration meta-model is also the lowest level of thePoSecCo policy chain starting on the Business layer. As described in Deliverable “D2. 1–Meta-Model for Business level policies” the meta-model is highly aligned to the policyrefinement process and the policy models of the IT and Business layer. The starting point ofthe definition of the configuration meta-model was a detailed requirement analysis followedby a top-down specification of the meta-model. Existing configuration models; like CIM andCIM policy; were analysed and reused were possible. For the selected capabilities (data …,*,2012,*
D3. 1–INITIAL SDSS ARCHITECTURE AND WORKFLOW,Lead Author Org; Cataldo Basile; Antonio Lioy; Jacopo Silvestro; Stefano Paraboschi,EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Nowadays; the major weakness in the security management is stillthe same: the human factor. Already back in the year 2000; the “Roadmap for defeatingDenial of Service attacks” highlighted the role of system and security administrators as amajor problem in the global security. Unfortunately; this scenario has not significantlyimproved; as confirmed by recent reports [1]. It is therefore important to support securitymanagers with automatic tools to minimize human errors. Presently; policy-based networkmanagement (PBNM)[2] seems the best approach to cope with system administrationbecause it separates the goals (ie; the policy) from the mechanisms to achieve them (ie; thesecurity controls). Security requirements for information systems are specified using anumber of different levels of abstraction; with different tools and management approaches …,*,2012,*

D3. 2–SECURITY ONTOLOGY DEFINITION,Cataldo Basile; Jacopo Silvestro; Antonio Lioy; Daniele Canavese,The management of security in modern information systems is characterized by acontinuously increasing level of complexity. In most application scenarios; configurations aremanually written by administrators. The integration of the different layers and components islimited and the security management is applied over a set of independent compartments.The overall goal of PoSecCo is to support the management of security policies; giving toadministrators and auditors some models and tools able to realize more efficiently andeffectively the representation and implementation of the great variety of securityrequirements characterizing modern information systems. An important contribution inachieving this goal is expected to come from the use of ontologies.

Selective Exchange of Confidential Data in the Outsourcing Scenario,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Stefano Paraboschi; Gerardo Pelosi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract The evolution of information and communication technologies (ICTs) hasintroduced new ways for sharing and disseminating user-generated content through remotestorage; publishing; and disseminating services. From an enterprise oriented point of view;these services offer cost effective and reliable data storage features that any organisationcan take advantage of without long setup delays and capital expenses. Also; from an end-user point of view; distributed and shared data storage services offer considerableadvantages in terms of reliability and constant availability of data. While on one hand datasharing services encourage and enhance the collaboration among users; on the other handthey need to provide proper protection of data; possibly enforcing access restrictions definedby the data owner. In this chapter; we present an approach for allowing users to delegate …,*,2011,*
Enforcing Conﬁdentiality Constraints on Sensitive Databases with Lightweight Trusted Clients,Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract. Existing approaches for protecting sensitive information stored (outsourced) atexternal “honest-but-curious” servers are typically based on an overlying layer of encryptionthat is applied on the whole information; or use a combination of fragmentation andencryption. The computational load imposed by encryption makes such approaches notsuitable for scenarios with lightweight clients. In this paper; we address this issue andpropose a novel model for enforcing privacy requirements on the outsourced informationwhich departs from encryption. The basic idea of our approach is to store a small portion ofthe data (just enough to break sensitive associations) on the client; which is trusted beingunder the data owner control; while storing the remaining information in clear form at theexternal (honest-butcurious) server. We model the problem and provide a solution for it …,Data and Applications Security XXIII: 23rd Annual IFIP WG 11.3 Working Conference; Montreal; Canada; July 12-15; 2009; Proceedings,2009,*

Access Control,Sabrina De Capitani diVimercati; Sara Foresti; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,An important requirement of any system is to protect its data and resources againstunauthorized disclosure (secrecy or confidentiality) and unauthorized or impropermodifications (integrity); while at the same time ensuring their availability to legitimate users(no denial-of-service or availability)(Samarati and De Capitani di Vimercati 2001). Theproblem of ensuring protection has existed since information has been managed. However;as technology advances and information management systems become more and morepowerful; the problem of enforcing information security also becomes more critical. Thedevelopment of information technology in the past few years has led to the widespread useof computer systems to store and manipulate information and has greatly increased theavailability; the processing power; and the storage power of information systems …,Handbook of Computer Networks: Distributed Networks; Network Planning; Control; Management; and New Trends and Applications; Volume 3,2008,*

SupP2PRep: A Protocol for Reputation Management via Polling in P2P Networks with SuperPeers,Shalendra Chhabra; Ernesto Damiani; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Peer-to-Peer (P2P) applications have recently seen an enormous success andhave reached millions of users. The main reason of this success is the anonymity the usersenjoy. However; as recent experiences with P2P networks such as Gnutella show; thisanonymity offers an opportunity to exploit the network for abuses such as the spread ofmalware (worms; Trojan Horses; viruses; and spam). In this paper we extend our previouswork on P2PRep; a reputation management protocol for pure P2P networks; in the case of adistributed architecture with SuperPeers such as Gnutella 0.6 and KaZaA. We present thedesign and implementation of reputation-aware servents. We also propose the use ofrepeaters among SuperPeers to facilitate interaction between servents behind the firewalls.We finally study the case of malicious peers; malicious SuperPeers and malicious …,*,*,*
