Naga: Searching and ranking knowledge,Gjergji Kasneci; Fabian M Suchanek; Georgiana Ifrim; Maya Ramanath; Gerhard Weikum,The Web has the potential to become the world's largest knowledge base. In order tounleash this potential; the wealth of information available on the Web needs to be extractedand organized. There is a need for new querying techniques that are simple and yet moreexpressive than those provided by standard keyword-based search engines. Searching forknowledge rather than Web pages needs to consider inherent semantic structures likeentities (person; organization; etc.) and relationships (isA; locatedIn; etc.). In this paper; wepropose NAGA; a new semantic search engine. NAGA builds on a knowledge base; which isorganized as a graph with typed edges; and consists of millions of entities and relationshipsextracted from Web-based corpora. A graph-based query language enables the formulationof queries with additional semantic information. We introduce a novel scoring model …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008.

StatiX: making XML count,Juliana Freire; Jayant R Haritsa; Maya Ramanath; Prasan Roy; Jérôme Siméon,Abstract The availability of summary data for XML documents has many applications; fromproviding users with quick feedback about their queries; to cost-based storage design andquery optimization. StatiX is a novel XML Schema-aware statistics framework that exploitsthe structure derived by regular expressions (which define elements in an XML Schema) topinpoint places in the schema that are likely sources of structural skew. As we discussbelow; this information can be used to build concise; yet accurate; statistical summaries forXML data. StatiX leverages standard XML technology for gathering statistics; notably XMLSchema validators; and it uses histograms to summarize both the structure and values in anXML document. In this paper we describe the StatiX system. We develop algorithms thatdecompose schemas to obtain statistics at different granularities and discuss how …,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2002,179
Natural language questions for the web of data,Mohamed Yahya; Klaus Berberich; Shady Elbassuoni; Maya Ramanath; Volker Tresp; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract The Linked Data initiative comprises structured databases in the Semantic-Webdata model RDF. Exploring this heterogeneous data by structured query languages istedious and error-prone even for skilled users. To ease the task; this paper presents amethodology for translating natural language questions into structured SPARQL queriesover linked-data sources. Our method is based on an integer linear program to solve severaldisambiguation tasks jointly: the segmentation of questions into phrases; the mapping ofphrases to semantic entities; classes; and relations; and the construction of SPARQL triplepatterns. Our solution harnesses the rich type system provided by knowledge bases in theweb of linked data; to constrain our semantic-coherence objective function. We presentexperiments on both the question translation and the resulting query answering.,Proceedings of the 2012 Joint Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and Computational Natural Language Learning,2012,142
Star: Steiner-tree approximation in relationship graphs,Gjergji Kasneci; Maya Ramanath; Mauro Sozio; Fabian M Suchanek; Gerhard Weikum,Large graphs and networks are abundant in modern information systems: entity-relationshipgraphs over relational data or Web-extracted entities; biological networks; social onlinecommunities; knowledge bases; and many more. Often such data comes with expressivenode and edge labels that allow an interpretation as a semantic graph; and edge weightsthat reflect the strengths of semantic relations between entities. Finding close relationshipsbetween a given set of two; three; or more entities is an important building block for manysearch; ranking; and analysis tasks. From an algorithmic point of view; this translates intocomputing the best Steiner trees between the given nodes; a classical NP-hard problem. Inthis paper; we present a new approximation algorithm; coined STAR; for relationship queriesover large relationship graphs. We prove that for n query entities; STAR yields an O (log …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,131
The YAGO-NAGA approach to knowledge discovery,Gjergji Kasneci; Maya Ramanath; Fabian Suchanek; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract This paper gives an overview on the YAGO-NAGA approach to informationextraction for building a conveniently searchable; large-scale; highly accurate knowledgebase of common facts. YAGO harvests infoboxes and category names of Wikipedia for factsabout individual entities; and it reconciles these with the taxonomic backbone of WordNet inorder to ensure that all entities have proper classes and the class system is consistent.Currently; the YAGO knowledge base contains about 19 million instances of binary relationsfor about 1.95 million entities. Based on intensive sampling; its accuracy is estimated to beabove 95 percent. The paper presents the architecture of the YAGO extractor toolkit; itsdistinctive approach to consistency checking; its provisions for maintenance and furthergrowth; and the query engine for YAGO; coined NAGA. It also discusses ongoing work on …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2009,114
Language-model-based ranking for queries on RDF-graphs,Shady Elbassuoni; Maya Ramanath; Ralf Schenkel; Marcin Sydow; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract The success of knowledge-sharing communities like Wikipedia and the advances inautomatic information extraction from textual and Web sources have made it possible tobuild large" knowledge repositories" such as DBpedia; Freebase; and YAGO. Thesecollections can be viewed as graphs of entities and relationships (ER graphs) and can berepresented as a set of subject-property-object (SPO) triples in the Semantic-Web datamodel RDF. Queries can be expressed in the W3C-endorsed SPARQL language or bysimilarly designed graph-pattern search. However; exact-match query semantics often fallshort of satisfying the users' needs by returning too many or too few results. Therefore; IR-style ranking models are crucially needed. In this paper; we propose a language-model-based approach to ranking the results of exact; relaxed and keyword-augmented graph …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,86
Database and information-retrieval methods for knowledge discovery,Gerhard Weikum; Gjergji Kasneci; Maya Ramanath; Fabian Suchanek,Our aim here is to advocate for the integration of database systems (DB) and information-retrieval(IR) methods to address applications that are emerging from the ongoing explosion and diversificationof digital information. One grand goal of such an endeavor is the automatic building and maintenanceof a comprehensive knowledge base of facts from encyclopedic sources and the scientificliterature. Facts should be represented in terms of typed entities and relationships and allowexpressive queries that return ranked results with precision in an efficient and scalablemanner. We thus explore how DB and IR methods might contribute toward this ambitiousgoal … DB and IR are separate fields in computer science due to historical accident.

Searching RDF Graphs with SPARQL and Keywords.,Shady Elbassuoni; Maya Ramanath; Ralf Schenkel; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract The proliferation of knowledge-sharing communities like Wikipedia and theadvances in automated information extraction from Web pages enable the construction oflarge knowledge bases with facts about entities and their relationships. The facts can berepresented in the RDF data model; as so-called subject-property-object triples; and canthus be queried by structured query languages like SPARQL. In principle; this allows precisequerying in the database spirit. However; RDF data may be highly diverse and queries mayreturn way too many results; so that ranking by informativeness measures is crucial to avoidoverwhelming users. Moreover; as facts are extracted from textual contexts or havecommunity-provided annotations; it can be beneficial to consider also,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2010,59
Searching for efficient XML-to-relational mappings,Maya Ramanath; Juliana Freire; Jayant R Haritsa; Prasan Roy,Abstract We consider the problem of cost-based strategies to derive efficient relationalconfigurations for XML applications that subscribe to an XML Schema. In particular; wepropose a flexible framework for XML schema transformations and show how it can be usedto design algorithms to search the space of equivalent relational configurations. We studythe impact of the schema transformations and query workload on the search strategies forfinding efficient XML-to-relational mappings. In addition; we propose several optimizations tospeed up the search process. Our experiments indicate that a judicious choice oftransformations and search strategies can lead to relational configurations of substantiallyhigher quality than those recommended by previous approaches.,International XML Database Symposium,2003,49
Query relaxation for entity-relationship search,Shady Elbassuoni; Maya Ramanath; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract Entity-relationship-structured data is becoming more important on the Web. Forexample; large knowledge bases have been automatically constructed by informationextraction from Wikipedia and other Web sources. Entities and relationships can berepresented by subject-property-object triples in the RDF model; and can then be preciselysearched by structured query languages like SPARQL. Because of their Boolean-matchsemantics; such queries often return too few or even no results. To improve recall; it is thusdesirable to support users by automatically relaxing or reformulating queries in such a waythat the intention of the original user query is preserved while returning a sufficient numberof ranked results. In this paper we describe comprehensive methods to relax SPARQL-liketriple-pattern queries in a fully automated manner. Our framework produces a set of …,Extended Semantic Web Conference,2011,48

Deep answers for naturally asked questions on the web of data,Mohamed Yahya; Klaus Berberich; Shady Elbassuoni; Maya Ramanath; Volker Tresp; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract We present DEANNA; a framework for natural language question answering overstructured knowledge bases. Given a natural language question; DEANNA translatesquestions into a structured SPARQL query that can be evaluated over knowledge basessuch as Yago; Dbpedia; Freebase; or other Linked Data sources. DEANNA analyzesquestions and maps verbal phrases to relations and noun phrases to either individualentities or semantic classes. Importantly; it judiciously generates variables for target entitiesor classes to express joins between multiple triple patterns. We leverage the semantic typesystem for entities and use constraints in jointly mapping the constituents of the question torelations; classes; and entities. We demonstrate the capabilities and interface of DEANNA;which allows advanced users to influence the translation process and to see how the …,Proceedings of the 21st international conference on World Wide Web,2012,38
NAGA: harvesting; searching and ranking knowledge,Gjergji Kasneci; Fabian M Suchanek; Georgiana Ifrim; Shady Elbassuoni; Maya Ramanath; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract The presence of encyclopedic Web sources; such as Wikipedia; the Internet MovieDatabase (IMDB); World Factbook; etc. calls for new querying techniques that are simpleand yet more expressive than those provided by standard keyword-based search engines.Searching for explicit knowledge needs to consider inherent semantic structures involvingentities and relationships. In this demonstration proposal; we describe a semantic searchsystem named NAGA. NAGA operates on a knowledge graph; which contains millions ofentities and relationships derived from various encyclopedic Web sources; such as the onesabove. NAGA's graph-based query language is geared towards expressing queries withadditional semantic information.

IQ: The Case for Iterative Querying for Knowledge.,Yosi Mass; Maya Ramanath; Yehoshua Sagiv; Gerhard Weikum,ABSTRACT Large knowledge bases; the Linked Data cloud; and Web 2.0 communitiesopen up new opportunities for deep question answering to support the advancedinformation needs of knowledge workers like students; journalists; or business analysts. Thiscalls for going beyond keyword search; towards more expressive ways of entity-relationship-oriented querying with graph constraints or even full-fledged languages like SPARQL (overgraph-structured; schema-less data). However; a neglected aspect of this active researchdirection is the need to support also query refinements; relaxations; and interactiveexploration; as single-shot queries are often insufficient for the users' tasks. This paperaddresses this issue by discussing the paradigm of Iterative Querying; IQ for short. Wepresent two instantiations for IQ; one based on keyword search over labeled graphs …,CIDR,2011,20
Bridging the XML-relational divide with LegoDB: a demonstration,Philip Bohannon; Juliana Freire; Jayant R Haritsa; Maya Ramanath; Prasan Roy; Jérôme Siméon,XML is becoming the predominant data exchange for- mat in a variety of application domains(supply-chain; sci- entific data processing; telecommunication infrastructure; etc.).

PolariCQ: Polarity classification of political quotations,Rawia Awadallah; Maya Ramanath; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract We consider the problem of automatically classifying quotations about politicaldebates into both topic and polarity. These quotations typically appear in news media andonline forums. Our approach maps quotations onto one or more topics in a category systemof political debates; containing more than a thousand fine-grained topics. To overcome thedifficulty that pro/con classification faces due to the brevity of quotations and sparseness offeatures; we have devised a model of quotation expansion that harnesses antonyms fromthesauri like WordNet. We developed a suite of statistical language models; judiciouslycustomized to our settings; and use these to define similarity measures for unsupervised orsupervised classifications. Experiments show the effectiveness of our method.,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,18

Our approach extracts topic related terms; pro/con related terms; andpairs of topic related and pro/con related terms and uses them as the basis for constructing apro query and a con query. Following standard LM techniques; a document is classified aspro or con depending on which of the query likelihoods is higher for the document.

Personalizing the Search for Knowledge.,Minko Dudev; Shady Elbassuoni; Julia Luxenburger; Maya Ramanath; Gerhard Weikum,ABSTRACT Recent work on building semantic search engines has given rise to large graph-based knowledge repositories and facilities for querying them and more importantly; rankingthe results. While the ranking provided may prove to be acceptable in general; for a trulysatisfactory search experience; it is necessary to tailor the results according to the user'sinterest. In this paper; we address the issue of personalizing query results in the specificsetting of graph-based knowledge bases. In particular; we address two important issues: i)construction of the user profile based on the inference of the user's interest and ii) a formalmodel for personalized scoring which incorporates the user's interest.

How naga uncoils: searching with entities and relations,Gjergji Kasneci; Fabain M Suchanek; Maya Ramanath; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract Current keyword-oriented search engines for theWorld WideWeb do not allowspecifying the semantics of queries. We address this limitation with NAGA 1; a new semanticsearch engine. NAGA builds on a large semantic knowledge base of binary relationships(facts) derived from the Web. NAGA provides a simple; yet expressive query language toquery this knowledge base. The results are then ranked with an intuitive scoring mechanism.We show the effectiveness and utility of NAGA by comparing its output with that of Googleonsome interesting queries.,Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web,2007,12

IMAX: Incremental maintenance of schema-based XML statistics,Maya Ramanath; Lingzhi Zhang; Juliana Freire; Jayant R Haritsa,Current approaches for estimating the cardinality of XML queries are applicable to a staticscenario wherein the underlying XML data does not change subsequent to the collection ofstatistics on the repository. However; in practice; many XML-based applications are dynamicand involve frequent updates to the data. In this paper; we investigate efficient strategies forincrementally maintaining statistical summaries as and when updates are applied to thedata. Specifically; we propose algorithms that handle both the addition of new documents aswell as random insertions in the existing document trees. We also show; through a detailedperformance evaluation; that our incremental techniques are significantly faster than thenaive recomputation approach; and that estimation accuracy can be maintained even with afixed memory budget.,Data Engineering; 2005.

DIASPORA: A highly distributed web-query processing system,Maya Ramanath; Jayant R Haritsa,Abstract Current proposals for web querying systems have assumed a centralizedprocessing architecture wherein data is shipped from the remote sites to the user's site. Wepresent here the design and implementation of DIASPORA; a highly distributed queryprocessing system for the web. It is based on the premise that several web applications aremore naturally processed in a distributed manner; opening up possibilities of significantreductions in network traffic and user response times. DIASPORA is built over an expressivegraph-based data model that utilizes simple heuristics and lends itself to automaticgeneration. The model captures both the content of web documents and the hyperlinkstructural framework of a web site.

Exploratory querying of extended knowledge graphs,Mohamed Yahya; Klaus Berberich; Maya Ramanath; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract Knowledge graphs (KGs) are important assets for search; analytics; andrecommendations. However; querying a KG to explore entities and discover facts is difficultand tedious; even for users with skills in SPARQL. First; users are not familiar with thestructure and labels of entities; classes and relations. Second; KGs are bound to beincomplete; as they capture only major facts about entities and their relationships and missout on many of the more subtle aspects. We demonstrate TriniT; a system that facilitatesexploratory querying of large KGs; by addressing these issues of" vocabulary" mismatch andKG incompleteness. TriniT supports query relaxation rules that are invoked to allow forrelevant answers which are not found otherwise.

Distributed algorithm for relationship queries on large graphs,Puneet Agarwal; Maya Ramanath; Gautam Shroff,Abstract Massive-sized graph-structured data is now ubiquitous; eg; social networks;databases; knowledge-bases; web-graphs; etc. An important class of queries on graph-structured data is" relationship queries". Essentially; given a set of entities (corresponding tonodes in the graph); finding a ranked list of interesting interconnections among them. Whilethis problem has been studied for many years; the solutions proposed in the literature so farfocus on the non-distributed setting. Clearly; such solutions will not scale with large graphshaving billions of nodes and edges that are becoming commonplace. In this paper; wepresent an algorithm for keyword search on large graphs; which is based on the distributedparallel processing paradigm. We also analyze why our algorithm generates optimalanswers. Finally; we report on preliminary empirical results of relationship queries on a …,Proceedings of the 2015 Workshop on Large-Scale and Distributed System for Information Retrieval,2015,2

This paper focuses on data with a temporal dimension; and discussesthe problem of mapping natural-language questions into extended SPARQL queries overRDF-structured data. We specifically address the issue of disambiguating temporal phrasesin the question into temporal entities like dates and named events; and temporal predicates.For the situation where the data has only partial coverage of the time dimension but isaugmented with textual descriptions of entities and facts; we also discuss how to generatequeries that combine structured search with keyword conditions.,Proceedings of Workshop on Time-aware Information Access; TAIA2013.

Xoom: A tool for zooming in and out of XML documents,Maya Ramanath; Kondreddi Sarath Kumar,Abstract Suppose there is a large corpus of XML documents; each of which describes amovie released in the last 30 years (for example; extracted from IMDB). A movie enthusiastwants to make a list of interesting movies based on various criteria; such as; the genre; leadactors; directors; etc. She first decides to narrow the focus to just thrillers. However; she thenhas to look into each document individually; since only then is it possible for her to tellwhether the combination of actors; directors; etc. interests her. This would be time-consuming if the documents in question contain hundreds of tags each. Instead; she coulduse our tool Xoom (XML-Zoom) which can extract and present the key information in everydocument. This would drastically cut down the time to go through the documents.

ESTHETE: a news browsing system to visualize the context and evolution of news stories,Rahul Goyal; Ravee Malla; Amitabha Bagchi; Sameep Mehta; Maya Ramanath,Abstract Providing the history and context (s) of a news article that emerges in the middle ofan evolving news story--sometimes multiple news stories--is a complex task. The complexityof the task is compounded by the fact that different users are interested in different contextsof the article; and it is impossible to guess what a particular user is most interested in. In thispaper; we introduce ESTHETE; a system that provides rich context (s)(through what we callpersonalized flexible context extraction); by preprocessing and storing articles in astructured representation (directed graphs) that makes it easy for the user to explore differentcontexts.

DEANNA: Natural Language Questions for the Web of Data,Mohamed Yahya; Klaus Berberich; Shady Elbassiousni; Maya Ramanath; Volker Tresp; Gerhard Weikum,In 1950; after a decade of stardom in American films; she starred in the Italian film Stromboli;which led to a love affair with director Roberto Rossellini while they were both alreadymarried. The affair and then marriage with Rossellini created a scandal that forced her toremain in Europe until 1956; when she made a successful Hollywood return in Anastasia; forwhich she won her second Academy Award; as well as the forgiveness of her fans. Many ofher personal and film documents can be seen in the Wesleyan University CinemaArchives.[4],*,2012,1
A Flexible Infrastructure for Gathering XML Statistics and Estimating Query Cardinality.,Juliana Freire; Maya Ramanath; Lingzhi Zhang,A key component of XML data management systems is the result size estimator; whichestimates the cardinalities of user queries. Estimated cardinalities are needed in a variety oftasks; including query optimization and cost-based storage design; and they can also beused to give users early feedback about the expected outcome of their queries. In [2]; weproposed StatiX. In contrast to previously proposed result estimators; which use specializeddata structures and estimation algorithms; StatiX uses histograms to uniformly capture boththe structural and value skew present in documents. It also leverages schema information toproduce high-quality and concise statistical summaries. In particular; it exploits XML Schematransformations [1] to obtain statistics at different granularities. The original version of StatiXwas built as a proof of concept. With the goal of making the system publicly available; we …,ICDE,2004,1
Klustree: clustering answer trees from keyword search on graphs,Madhulika Mohanty; Maya Ramanath,Abstract Graph structured data on the web is now massive as well as diverse; ranging fromsocial networks; web graphs to knowledge-bases. Effectively querying this graph structureddata is non-trivial. We are concerned with a class of queries called relationship queries;which are usually expressed as a set of keywords (each keyword denoting a named entity).The results returned are a set of ranked trees; each of which denotes relationships amongthe various keywords. The result list typically consists of hundreds to thousands of answers.A drawback of showing the entire list to the user is that it hinders result analysis and leads toa bad user experience. We propose KlusTree; which presents clustered results to the usersinstead of a list of all the results and thus; improves result interpretation and increasesdiversity in the top results. In our approach; the result trees are represented using …,Proceedings of the ACM India Joint International Conference on Data Science and Management of Data,2018,*
Sampling and reconstruction using Bloom filters,Neha Sengupta; Amitabha Bagchi; Srikanta Bedathur; Maya Ramanath,In this paper; we address the problem of sampling from a set and reconstructing a set storedas a Bloom filter. To the best of our knowledge our work is the first to address this question.We introduce a novel hierarchical data structure called BloomSampleTree that helps usdesign efficient algorithms to extract an almost uniform sample from the set stored in aBloom filter and also allows us to reconstruct the set efficiently. In the case where the hashfunctions used in the Bloom filter implementation are partially invertible; in the sense that it iseasy to calculate the set of elements that map to a particular hash value; we propose asecond; more space-efficient method called HashInvert for the reconstruction. We study theproperties of these two methods both analytically as well as experimentally. We providebounds on run times for both methods and sample quality for the BloomSampleTree …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,*
Spec-QP: Speculative Query Planning for Joins over Knowledge Graphs,Madhulika Mohanty; Maya Ramanath; Mohamed Yahya; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract: Organisations store huge amounts of data from multiple heterogeneous sources inthe form of Knowledge Graphs (KGs). One of the ways to query these KGs is to use SPARQLqueries over a database engine. Since SPARQL follows exact match semantics; the queriesmay return too few or no results. Recent works have proposed query relaxation where thequery engine judiciously replaces a query predicate with similar predicates using weightedrelaxation rules mined from the KG. The space of possible relaxations is potentially too largeto fully explore and users are typically interested in only top-k results; so such query enginesuse top-k algorithms for query processing. However; they may still process all therelaxations; many of whose answers do not contribute towards top-k answers. This leads tocomputation overheads and delayed response times. We propose Spec-QP; a query …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.07581,2017,*
Relationship Queries on Large Graphs,Puneet Agarwal; Maya Ramanath; Gautam Shroff,ABSTRACT Large scale graph data arising from social networks; databases; knowledgebases etc. are now available for analysis. Graph mining often involves “relationship queries”;which seek a ranked list of interesting interconnections among a given set of entities;corresponding to nodes in the graph. While relationship queries have been studied for manyyears; using various terminologies; eg; keyword search; Steiner tree in a graph etc.; thesolutions proposed in the literature so far either don't guarantee the optimality of answersretrieved or don't utilize distributed parallel processing paradigm. Such an approach can beused for scaling relationship queries to large graphs having millions of nodes and edges;such graph are now publicly available in the form of 'linked open data'(LOD). In this paper;we present an algorithm for distributed keyword search (DKS) on large graphs; based on …,*,2017,*
TeKnowbase: Towards Construction of a Knowledge-base of Technical Concepts,Prajna Upadhyay; Tanuma Patra; Ashwini Purkar; Maya Ramanath,Abstract: In this paper; we describe the construction of TeKnowbase; a knowledge-base oftechnical concepts in computer science. Our main information sources are technicalwebsites such as Webopedia and Techtarget as well as Wikipedia and online textbooks. Wedivide the knowledge-base construction problem into two parts--the acquisition of entitiesand the extraction of relationships among these entities. Our knowledge-base consists ofapproximately 100;000 triples. We conducted an evaluation on a sample of triples and reportan accuracy of a little over 90\%. We additionally conducted classification experiments onStackOverflow data with features from TeKnowbase and achieved improved classificationaccuracy. Subjects: Computation and Language (cs.

Tracking the conductance of rapidly evolving topic-subgraphs,Sainyam Galhotra; Amitabha Bagchi; Srikanta Bedathur; Maya Ramanath; Vidit Jain,Abstract Monitoring the formation and evolution of communities in large online socialnetworks such as Twitter is an important problem that has generated considerable interest inboth industry and academia. Fundamentally; the problem can be cast as studying evolvingsugraphs (each subgraph corresponding to a topical community) on an underlying socialgraph-with users as nodes and the connection between them as edges. A key metric ofinterest in this setting is tracking the changes to the conductance of subgraphs induced byedge activations. This metric quantifies how well or poorly connected a subgraph is to therest of the graph relative to its internal connections. Conductance has been demonstrated tobe of great use in many applications; such as identifying bursty topics; tracking the spread ofrumors; and so on. However; tracking this simple metric presents a considerable …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,*
Authors’ Addresses,Maya Ramanath; Kondreddi Sarath Kumar; Georgiana Ifrim,Abstract XML has become the de-facto standard for data representation and exchange;resulting in large scale repositories and warehouses of XML data. In order for users tounderstand and explore these large collections; a summarized; bird's eye view of theavailable data is a necessity. In this paper; we are interested in semantic XML documentsummaries which present the “important” information available in an XML document to theuser. In the best case; such a summary is a concise replacement for the original documentitself. At the other extreme; it should at least help the user make an informed choice as to therelevance of the document to his needs. In this paper; we address the two main issues whicharise in producing such meaningful and concise summaries: i) which tags or text units areimportant and should be included in the summary; ii) how to generate summaries of …,arXiv preprint arXiv:0910.2405,2009,*

A grand challenge that a jointDB&IR endeavor could aim for is to automatically build and maintain a comprehensiveknowledge base that encompasses all important facts from encyclopedic sources and thescientific literature. It should represent facts in terms of typed entities and relations; and allowexpressive queries that return ranked results with high precision in an efficient and scalablemanner.

NAGA: Searching and Ranking Knowledge,Gjergji Kasneci Fabian M Suchanek; Georgiana Ifrim; Maya Ramanath; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract—The Web has the potential to become the world's largest knowledge base. In orderto unleash this potential; the wealth of information available on the Web needs to beextracted and organized. There is a need for new querying techniques that are simple andyet more expressive than those provided by standard keyword-based search engines.Searching for knowledge rather than Web pages needs to consider inherent semanticstructures like entities (person; organization; etc.) and relationships (isA; locatedIn; etc.). Inthis paper; we propose NAGA; a new semantic search engine. NAGA builds on a knowledgebase; which is organized as a graph with typed edges; and consists of millions of entitiesand relationships extracted from Web-based corpora. A graph-based query languageenables the formulation of queries with additional semantic information. We introduce a …,*,*,*
