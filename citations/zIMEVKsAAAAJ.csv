Mining frequent patterns without candidate generation,Jiawei Han; Jian Pei; Yiwen Yin,Abstract Mining frequent patterns in transaction databases; time-series databases; andmany other kinds of databases has been studied popularly in data mining research. Most ofthe previous studies adopt an Apriori-like candidate set generation-and-test approach.However; candidate set generation is still costly; especially when there exist prolific patternsand/or long patterns.

CMAR: Accurate and efficient classification based on multiple class-association rules,Wenmin Li; Jiawei Han; Jian Pei,Previous studies propose that associative classification has high classification accuracy andstrong flexibility at handling unstructured data. However; it still suffers from the huge set ofmined rules and sometimes biased classification or overfitting since the classification isbased on only a single high-confidence rule. The authors propose a new associativeclassification method; CMAR; ie; Classification based on Multiple Association Rules. Themethod extends an efficient frequent pattern mining method; FP-growth; constructs a classdistribution-associated FP-tree; and mines large databases efficiently. Moreover; it applies aCR-tree structure to store and retrieve mined association rules efficiently; and prunes ruleseffectively based on confidence; correlation and database coverage.

Mining sequential patterns by pattern-growth: The prefixspan approach,Jian Pei; Jiawei Han; Behzad Mortazavi-Asl; Jianyong Wang; Helen Pinto; Qiming Chen; Umeshwar Dayal; Mei-Chun Hsu,Sequential pattern mining is an important data mining problem with broad applications.However; it is also a difficult problem since the mining may have to generate or examine acombinatorially explosive number of intermediate subsequences. Most of the previouslydeveloped sequential pattern mining methods; such as GSP; explore a candidategeneration-and-test approach [R. Agrawal et al.(1994)] to reduce the number of candidatesto be examined. However; this approach may not be efficient in mining large sequencedatabases having numerous patterns and/or long patterns. In this paper; we propose aprojection-based; sequential pattern-growth approach for efficient mining of sequentialpatterns. In this approach; a sequence database is recursively projected into a set of smallerprojected databases; and sequential patterns are grown in each projected database by …,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2004,1252
Closet: An efficient algorithm for mining frequent closed itemsets.,Jian Pei; Jiawei Han; Runying Mao,Abstract Association mining may often derive an undesirably large set of frequent itemsetsand association rules. Recent studies have proposed an interesting alternative: miningfrequent closed itemsets and their corresponding rules; which has the same power asassociation mining but substantially reduces the number of rules to be presented. In thispaper; we propose an efficient algorithm; CLOSET; for mining closed itemsets; with thedevelopment of three techniques:(1) applying a compressed; frequent pattern tree FP-treestructure for mining closed itemsets without candidate generation;(2) developing a singleprefix path compression technique to identify frequent closed itemsets quickly; and (3)exploring a partition-based projection mechanism for scalable mining in large databases.Our performance study shows that CLOSET is efficient and scalable over large databases …,ACM SIGMOD workshop on research issues in data mining and knowledge discovery,2000,1198

Mining access patterns efficiently from web logs,Jian Pei; Jiawei Han; Behzad Mortazavi-Asl; Hua Zhu,Abstract With the explosive growth of data available on the World Wide Web; discovery andanalysis of useful information from the World Wide Web becomes a practical necessity. Webaccess pattern; which is the sequence of accesses pursued by users frequently; is a kind ofinteresting and useful knowledge in practice. In this paper; we study the problem of miningaccess patterns from Web logs efficiently. A novel data structure; called Web access patterntree; or WAP-tree in short; is developed for efficient mining of access patterns from pieces oflogs. The Web access pattern tree stores highly compressed; critical information for accesspattern mining and facilitates the development of novel algorithms for mining accesspatterns in large set of log pieces.

Closet+: Searching for the best strategies for mining frequent closed itemsets,Jianyong Wang; Jiawei Han; Jian Pei,Abstract Mining frequent closed itemsets provides complete and non-redundant results forfrequent pattern analysis. Extensive studies have proposed various strategies for efficientfrequent closed itemset mining; such as depth-first search vs. breadthfirst search; verticalformats vs. horizontal formats; tree-structure vs. other data structures; top-down vs. bottom-up traversal; pseudo projection vs. physical projection of conditional database; etc. It is theright time to ask" what are the pros and cons of the strategies?" and" what and how can wepick and integrate the best strategies to achieve higher performance in general cases?" Inthis study; we answer the above questions by a systematic study of the search strategies anddevelop a winning algorithm CLOSET+.

Preserving privacy in social networks against neighborhood attacks,Bin Zhou; Jian Pei,Recently; as more and more social network data has been published in one way or another;preserving privacy in publishing social network data becomes an important concern. Withsome local knowledge about individuals in a social network; an adversary may attack theprivacy of some victims easily. Unfortunately; most of the previous studies on privacypreservation can deal with relational data only; and cannot be applied to social networkdata. In this paper; we take an initiative towards preserving privacy in social network data.We identify an essential type of privacy attacks: neighborhood attacks. If an adversary hassome knowledge about the neighbors of a target victim and the relationship among theneighbors; the victim may be re-identified from a social network even if the victim's identity ispreserved using the conventional anonymization techniques. We show that the problem …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,683
Mining frequent patterns in data streams at multiple time granularities,Chris Giannella; Jiawei Han; Jian Pei; Xifeng Yan; Philip S Yu,Abstract: Although frequent-pattern mining has been widely studied and used; it ischallenging to extend it to data streams. Compared to mining from a static transaction dataset; the streaming case has far more information to track and far greater complexity tomanage. Infrequent items can become frequent later on and hence cannot be ignored. Thestorage structure needs to be dynamically adjusted to reflect the evolution of itemsetfrequencies over time. In this paper; we propose computing and maintaining all the frequentpatterns (which is usually more stable and smaller than the streaming data) and dynamicallyupdating them with the incoming data streams. We extended the framework to mine time-sensitive patterns with approximate support guarantee. We incrementally maintain tilted-timewindows for each pattern at multiple time granularities.

Probabilistic skylines on uncertain data,Jian Pei; Bin Jiang; Xuemin Lin; Yidong Yuan,Abstract Uncertain data are inherent in some important applications. Although aconsiderable amount of research has been dedicated to modeling uncertain data andanswering some types of queries on uncertain data; how to conduct advanced analysis onuncertain data remains an open problem at large. In this paper; we tackle the problem ofskyline analysis on uncertain data. We propose a novel probabilistic skyline model where anuncertain object may take a probability to be in the skyline; and a p-skyline contains all theobjects whose skyline probabilities are at least p. Computing probabilistic skylines on largeuncertain data sets is challenging. We develop two efficient algorithms. The bottom-upalgorithm computes the skyline probabilities of some selected instances of uncertain objects;and uses those instances to prune other instances and uncertain objects effectively.

Context-aware query suggestion by mining click-through and session data,Huanhuan Cao; Daxin Jiang; Jian Pei; Qi He; Zhen Liao; Enhong Chen; Hang Li,Abstract Query suggestion plays an important role in improving the usability of searchengines. Although some recently proposed methods can make meaningful querysuggestions by mining query patterns from search logs; none of them are context-aware-they do not take into account the immediately preceding queries as context in querysuggestion. In this paper; we propose a novel context-aware query suggestion approachwhich is in two steps. In the offine model-learning step; to address data sparseness; queriesare summarized into concepts by clustering a click-through bipartite. Then; from sessiondata a concept sequence suffix tree is constructed as the query suggestion model. In theonline query suggestion step; a user's search context is captured by mapping the querysequence submitted by the user to a sequence of concepts. By looking up the context in …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2008,516
H-mine: Hyper-structure mining of frequent patterns in large databases,Jian Pei; Jiawei Han; Hongjun Lu; Shojiro Nishio; Shiwei Tang; Dongqing Yang,Methods for efficient mining of frequent patterns have been studied extensively by manyresearchers. However; the previously proposed methods still encounter some performancebottlenecks when mining databases with different data characteristics; such as dense vs.sparse; long vs. short patterns; memory-based vs. disk-based; etc. In this study; we proposea simple and novel hyper-linked data structure; H-struct and a new mining algorithm; H-mine; which takes advantage of this data structure and dynamically adjusts links in themining process. A distinct feature of this method is that it has very limited and preciselypredictable space overhead and runs really fast in memory-based setting. Moreover it canbe scaled up to very large databases by database partitioning; and when the data setbecomes dense;(conditional) FP-trees can be constructed dynamically as part of the …,Data Mining; 2001.

Utility-based anonymization using local recoding,Jian Xu; Wei Wang; Jian Pei; Xiaoyuan Wang; Baile Shi; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Abstract Privacy becomes a more and more serious concern in applications involvingmicrodata. Recently; efficient anonymization has attracted much research work. Most of theprevious methods use global recoding; which maps the domains of the quasi-identifierattributes to generalized or changed values. However; global recoding may not alwaysachieve effective anonymization in terms of discernability and query answering accuracyusing the anonymized data. Moreover; anonymized data is often for analysis. As wellaccepted in many analytical applications; different attributes in a data set may have differentutility in the analysis. The utility of attributes has not been considered in the previousmethods. In this paper; we study the problem of utility-based anonymization. First; wepropose a simple framework to specify utility of attributes. The framework covers both …,Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2006,416
Mining frequent itemsets with convertible constraints,Jian Pei; Jiawei Han; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Recent work has highlighted the importance of the constraint based mining paradigm in thecontext of frequent itemsets; associations; correlations; sequential patterns; and many otherinteresting patterns in large databases. The authors study constraints which cannot behandled with existing theory and techniques. For example; avg (S)/spl theta//spl nu/; median(S)/spl theta//spl nu/; sum (S)/spl theta//spl nu/(S can contain items of arbitrary values)(/spltheta//spl isin/{/spl ges/;/spl les/}); are customarily regarded as" tough" constraints in that theycannot be pushed inside an algorithm such as a priori. We develop a notion of convertibleconstraints and systematically analyze; classify; and characterize this class. We alsodevelop techniques which enable them to be readily pushed deep inside the recentlydeveloped FP-growth algorithm for frequent itemset mining. Results from our detailed …,Data Engineering; 2001.

Mining frequent patterns by pattern-growth: methodology and implications,Jiawei Han; Jian Pei,ABSTRACT Mining frequent patterns has been a focused topic in data mining research inrecent years; with the developmeht of numerous interesting algorithms for miningassociation; correlation; causality; sequential patterns; partial periodicity; constraint-basedfrequent pattern mining; associative classification; emerging patterns; etc. Most of theprevious studies adopt an Apriori-like; candidate generation-and-test approach. However;based on our analysis; candidate generation and test may still be expensive; especiallywhen encountering long and numerous patterns. A new methodology; called frequentpattern growth; which mines frequent patterns without candidate generation; has beendeveloped.

Multi-dimensional sequential pattern mining,Helen Pinto; Jiawei Han; Jian Pei; Ke Wang; Qiming Chen; Umeshwar Dayal,Abstract Sequential pattern mining; which finds the set of frequent subsequences insequence databases; is an important data-mining task and has broad applications. Usually;sequence patterns are associated with different circumstances; and such circumstancesform a multiple dimensional space. For example; customer purchase sequences areassociated with region; time; customer group; and others. It is interesting and useful to minesequential patterns associated with multi-dimensional information. In this paper; we proposethe theme of multi-dimensional sequential pattern mining; which integrates themultidimensional analysis and sequential data mining. We also thoroughly explore efficientmethods for multi-dimensional sequential pattern mining.

Ranking queries on uncertain data: a probabilistic threshold approach,Ming Hua; Jian Pei; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Uncertain data is inherent in a few important applications such as environmentalsurveillance and mobile object tracking. Top-k queries (also known as ranking queries) areoften natural and useful in analyzing uncertain data in those applications. In this paper; westudy the problem of answering probabilistic threshold top-k queries on uncertain data;which computes uncertain records taking a probability of at least p to be in the top-k listwhere p is a user specified probability threshold. We present an efficient exact algorithm; afast sampling algorithm; and a Poisson approximation based algorithm. An empirical studyusing real and synthetic data sets verifies the effectiveness of probabilistic threshold top-kqueries and the efficiency of our methods.,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,316
A brief survey on sequence classification,Zhengzheng Xing; Jian Pei; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Sequence classification has a broad range of applications such as genomicanalysis; information retrieval; health informatics; finance; and abnormal detection. Differentfrom the classification task on feature vectors; sequences do not have explicit features. Evenwith sophisticated feature selection techniques; the dimensionality of potential features maystill be very high and the sequential nature of features is difficult to capture. This makessequence classification a more challenging task than classification on feature vectors. In thispaper; we present a brief review of the existing work on sequence classification. Wesummarize the sequence classification in terms of methodologies and application domains.We also provide a review on several extensions of the sequence classification problem;such as early classification on sequences and semi-supervised learning on sequences.,ACM Sigkdd Explorations Newsletter,2010,313
A brief survey on anonymization techniques for privacy preserving publishing of social network data,Bin Zhou; Jian Pei; WoShun Luk,Abstract Nowadays; partly driven by many Web 2.0 applications; more and more socialnetwork data has been made publicly available and analyzed in one way or another. Privacypreserving publishing of social network data becomes a more and more important concern.In this paper; we present a brief yet systematic review of the existing anonymizationtechniques for privacy preserving publishing of social network data. We identify the newchallenges in privacy preserving publishing of social network data comparing to theextensively studied relational case; and examine the possible problem formulation in threeimportant dimensions: privacy; background knowledge; and data utility. We survey theexisting anonymization methods for privacy preservation in two categories: clustering-basedapproaches and graph modification approaches.,ACM Sigkdd Explorations Newsletter,2008,304
Mining sequential patterns with constraints in large databases,Jian Pei; Jiawei Han; Wei Wang,Abstract Constraints are essential for many sequential pattern mining applications. However;there is no systematic study on constraint-based sequential pattern mining. In this paper; weinvestigate this issue and point out that the framework developed for constrained frequent-pattern mining does not fit our missions well. An extended framework is developed based ona sequential pattern growth methodology. Our study shows that constraints can be effectivelyand efficiently pushed deep into sequential pattern mining under this new framework.Moreover; this framework can be extended to constraint-based structured pattern mining aswell.,Proceedings of the eleventh international conference on Information and knowledge management,2002,303
Catching the best views of skyline: A semantic approach based on decisive subspaces,Jian Pei; Wen Jin; Martin Ester; Yufei Tao,Abstract The skyline operator is important for multi-criteria decision making applications.Although many recent studies developed efficient methods to compute skyline objects in aspecific space; the fundamental problem on the semantics of skylines remains open: Whyand in which subspaces is (or is not) an object in the skyline? Practically; users may also beinterested in the skylines in any subspaces. Then; what is the relationship between theskylines in the subspaces and those in the super-spaces? How can we effectively analyzethe subspace skylines? Can we efficiently compute skylines in various subspaces? In thispaper; we investigate the semantics of skylines; propose the subspace skyline analysis; andextend the full-space skyline computation to subspace skyline computation. We introduce anovel notion of skyline group which essentially is a group of objects that are …,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,302
Quotient cube: How to summarize the semantics of a data cube,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Jian Pei; Jiawei Han,Abstract Partitioning a data cube into sets of cells with" similar behavior" often betterexposes the semantics in the cube. Eg; if we find that average boots sales in the West 10thstore of Walmart was the same for winter as for the whole year; it signifies somethinginteresting about the trend of boots sales in that location in that year. In this paper; we areinterested in finding succinct summaries of the data cube; exploiting regularities present inthe cube; with a clear basis. We would like the summary:(i) to be as concise as possible;(ii)to itself form a lattice preserving the rollup/drilldown semantics of the cube; and (iii) to allowthe original cube to be fully recovered. We illustrate the utility of solving this problem anddiscuss the inherent challenges. We develop techniques for partitioning cube cells forobtaining succinct summaries; and introduce the quotient cube. We give efficient …,Proceedings of the 28th international conference on Very Large Data Bases,2002,280
Minimality attack in privacy preserving data publishing,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang; Jian Pei,Abstract Data publishing generates much concern over the protection of individual privacy.Recent studies consider cases where the adversary may possess different kinds ofknowledge about the data. In this paper; we show that knowledge of the mechanism oralgorithm of anonymization for data publication can also lead to extra information that assiststhe adversary and jeopardizes individual privacy. In particular; all known mechanisms try tominimize information loss and such an attempt provides a loophole for attacks. We call suchan attack a minimality attack. In this paper; we introduce a model called m-confidentialitywhich deals with minimality attacks; and propose a feasible solution. Our experiments showthat minimality attacks are practical concerns on real datasets and that our algorithm canprevent such attacks with very little overhead and information loss.,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,279
Efficient computation of iceberg cubes with complex measures,Jiawei Han; Jian Pei; Guozhu Dong; Ke Wang,Abstract It is often too expensive to compute and materialize a complete high-dimensionaldata cube. Computing an iceberg cube; which contains only aggregates above certainthresholds; is an effective way to derive nontrivial multi-dimensional aggregations for OLAPand data mining. In this paper; we study efficient methods for computing iceberg cubes withsome popularly used complex measures; such as average; and develop a methodology thatadopts a weaker but anti-monotonic condition for testing and pruning search space. Inparticular; for efficient computation of iceberg cubes with the average measure; we proposea top-k average pruning method and extend two previously studied methods; Apriori andBUC; to Top-k Apriori and Top-k BUC. To further improve the performance; an interestinghypertree structure; called H-tree; is designed and a new iceberg cubing method; called …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2001,278
MAPO: Mining and recommending API usage patterns,Hao Zhong; Tao Xie; Lu Zhang; Jian Pei; Hong Mei,Abstract To improve software productivity; when constructing new software systems;programmers often reuse existing libraries or frameworks by invoking methods provided intheir APIs. Those API methods; however; are often complex and not well documented. To getfamiliar with how those API methods are used; programmers often exploit a source codesearch tool to search for code snippets that use the API methods of interest. However; thereturned code snippets are often large in number; and the huge number of snippets places abarrier for programmers to locate useful ones. In order to help programmers overcome thisbarrier; we have developed an API usage mining framework and its supporting tool calledMAPO (Mining API usage Pattern from Open source repositories) for mining API usagepatterns automatically. A mined pattern describes that in a certain usage scenario; some …,European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming,2009,263
Can we push more constraints into frequent pattern mining?,Jian Pei; Jiawei Han,Abstract Recent studies show that constraint pushing may substantially improve theperformance of frequent pattern mining; and methods have been proposed to incorporateinteresting constraints in frequent pattern mining. However; some popularly encounteredconstraints are still considered as" tough" constraints which cannot be pushed deep into themining process. In this study; we extend our scope to those tough constraints and identify aninteresting class; called convertible constraints; which can be pushed deep into frequentpattern mining. Then we categorize all the constraints into five classes and show that four ofthem can be integrated into the frequent pattern mining process. This covers most of theconstraints popularly encountered and composed by SQL primitives. Moreover; a newconstraintbased frequent pattern mining method; called constrained frequent pattern …,Proceedings of the sixth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2000,260
Subsky: Efficient computation of skylines in subspaces,Yufei Tao; Xiaokui Xiao; Jian Pei,Given a set of multi-dimensional points; the skyline contains the best points according to anypreference function that is monotone on all axes. In practice; applications that require skylineanalysis usually provide numerous candidate attributes; and various users depending ontheir interests may issue queries regarding different (small) subsets of the dimensions.Formally; given a relation with a large number (eg; ge 10) of attributes; a query aims atfinding the skyline in an arbitrary subspace with a low dimensionality (eg; 2). The existingalgorithms do not support subspace skyline retrieval efficiently because they (i) requirescanning the entire database at least once; or (ii) are optimized for one particular subspacebut incur significant overhead for other subspaces. In this paper; we propose a techniqueSUBSKY which settles the problem using a single B-tree; and can be implemented in any …,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06.

Mining API patterns as partial orders from source code: from usage scenarios to specifications,Mithun Acharya; Tao Xie; Jian Pei; Jun Xu,Abstract A software system interacts with third-party libraries through various APIs. Usingthese library APIs often needs tofollow certain usage patterns. Furthermore; ordering rules(specifications) exist between APIs; and these rules govern the secure and robust operationof the system using these APIs. But these patterns and rules may not be well documented bythe API developers. Previous approaches mine frequent association rules; itemsets; orsubsequences that capture API call patterns shared by API client code. However; thesefrequent API patterns cannot completely capture some useful orderings shared by APIs;especially when multiple APIs are involved across different procedures. In this paper; wepresent a framework to automatically extract usage scenarios among user-specified APIs aspartial orders; directly from the source code (API client code).

An energy-efficient data collection framework for wireless sensor networks by exploiting spatiotemporal correlation,Chong Liu; Kui Wu; Jian Pei,Limited energy supply is one of the major constraints in wireless sensor networks. A feasiblestrategy is to aggressively reduce the spatial sampling rate of sensors; that is; the density ofthe measure points in a field. By properly scheduling; we want to retain the high fidelity ofdata collection. In this paper; we propose a data collection method that is based on a carefulanalysis of the surveillance data reported by the sensors. By exploring the spatial correlationof sensing data; we dynamically partition the sensor nodes into clusters so that the sensorsin the same cluster have similar surveillance time series. They can share the workload ofdata collection in the future since their future readings may likely be similar. Furthermore;during a short-time period; a sensor may report similar readings. Such a correlation in thedata reported from the same sensor is called temporal correlation; which can be explored …,IEEE transactions on parallel and distributed systems,2007,246
Context-aware citation recommendation,Qi He; Jian Pei; Daniel Kifer; Prasenjit Mitra; Lee Giles,Abstract When you write papers; how many times do you want to make some citations at aplace but you are not sure which papers to cite? Do you wish to have a recommendationsystem which can recommend a small number of good candidates for every place that youwant to make some citations? In this paper; we present our initiative of building a context-aware citation recommendation system. High quality citation recommendation ischallenging: not only should the citations recommended be relevant to the paper undercomposition; but also should match the local contexts of the places citations are made.Moreover; it is far from trivial to model how the topic of the whole paper and the contexts ofthe citation places should affect the selection and ranking of citations. To tackle the problem;we develop a context-aware approach. The core idea is to design a novel non-parametric …,Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web,2010,229
On mining cross-graph quasi-cliques,Jian Pei; Daxin Jiang; Aidong Zhang,Abstract Joint mining of multiple data sets can often discover interesting; novel; and reliablepatterns which cannot be obtained solely from any single source. For example; in cross-market customer segmentation; a group of customers who behave similarly in multiplemarkets should be considered as a more coherent and more reliable cluster than clustersfound in a single market. As another example; in bioinformatics; by joint mining of geneexpression data and protein interaction data; we can find clusters of genes which showcoherent expression patterns and also produce interacting proteins. Such clusters may bepotential pathways. In this paper; we investigate a novel data mining problem; mining cross-graph quasi-cliques; which is generalized from several interesting applications such ascross-market customer segmentation and joint mining of gene expression data and …,Proceedings of the eleventh ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery in data mining,2005,215

MAPO: Mining API usages from open source repositories,Tao Xie; Jian Pei,Abstract To improve software productivity; when constructing new software systems;developers often reuse existing class libraries or frameworks by invoking their APIs. ThoseAPIs; however; are often complex and not well documented; posing barriers for developersto use them in new client code. To get familiar with how those APIs are used; developersmay search the Web using a general search engine to find relevant documents or codeexamples. Developers can also use a source code search engine to search open sourcerepositories for source files that use the same APIs. Nevertheless; the number of returnedsource files is often large. It is difficult for developers to learn API usages from a largenumber of returned results. In order to help developers understand API usages and write APIclient code more effectively; we have developed an API usage mining framework and its …,Proceedings of the 2006 international workshop on Mining software repositories,2006,209

QC-Trees: An efficient summary structure for semantic OLAP,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Jian Pei; Yan Zhao,Abstract Recently; a technique called quotient cube was proposed as a summary structurefor a data cube that preserves its semantics; with applications for online exploration andvisualization. The authors showed that a quotient cube can be constructed very efficientlyand it leads to a significant reduction in the cube size. While it is an interesting proposal; thatpaper leaves many issues unaddressed. Firstly; a direct representation of a quotient cube isnot as compact as possible and thus still wastes space. Secondly; while a quotient cube canin principle be used for answering queries; no specific algorithms were given in the paper.Thirdly; maintaining any summary structure incrementally against updates is an importanttask; a topic not addressed there.

Stream cube: An architecture for multi-dimensional analysis of data streams,Jiawei Han; Yixin Chen; Guozhu Dong; Jian Pei; Benjamin W Wah; Jianyong Wang; Y Dora Cai,Abstract Real-time surveillance systems; telecommunication systems; and other dynamicenvironments often generate tremendous (potentially infinite) volume of stream data: thevolume is too huge to be scanned multiple times. Much of such data resides at rather lowlevel of abstraction; whereas most analysts are interested in relatively high-level dynamicchanges (such as trends and outliers). To discover such high-level characteristics; one mayneed to perform on-line multi-level; multi-dimensional analytical processing of stream data.In this paper; we propose an architecture; called stream_cube; to facilitate on-line; multi-dimensional; multi-level analysis of stream data. For fast online multi-dimensional analysisof stream data; three important techniques are proposed for efficient and effectivecomputation of stream cubes. First; a tilted time frame model is proposed as a multi …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2005,188
DHC: a density-based hierarchical clustering method for time series gene expression data,Daxin Jiang; Jian Pei; Aidong Zhang,Clustering the time series gene expression data is an important task in bioinformaticsresearch and biomedical applications. Recently; some clustering methods have beenadapted or proposed. However; some concerns still remain; such as the robustness of themining methods; as well as the quality and the interpretability of the mining results. In thispaper; we tackle the problem of effectively clustering time series gene expression data byproposing algorithm DHC; a density-based; hierarchical clustering method. We use adensity-based approach to identify the clusters such that the clustering results are of highquality and robustness. Moreover; the mining result is in the form of a density tree; whichuncovers the embedded clusters in a data set. The inner-structures; the borders and theoutliers of the clusters can be further investigated using the attraction tree; which is an …,Bioinformatics and Bioengineering; 2003. Proceedings.

The k-anonymity and l-diversity approaches for privacy preservation in social networks against neighborhood attacks,Bin Zhou; Jian Pei,Abstract Recently; more and more social network data have been published in one way oranother. Preserving privacy in publishing social network data becomes an importantconcern. With some local knowledge about individuals in a social network; an adversarymay attack the privacy of some victims easily. Unfortunately; most of the previous studies onprivacy preservation data publishing can deal with relational data only; and cannot beapplied to social network data. In this paper; we take an initiative toward preserving privacyin social network data. Specifically; we identify an essential type of privacy attacks:neighborhood attacks. If an adversary has some knowledge about the neighbors of a targetvictim and the relationship among the neighbors; the victim may be re-identified from asocial network even if the victim's identity is preserved using the conventional …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2011,158
Distance-based representative skyline,Yufei Tao; Ling Ding; Xuemin Lin; Jian Pei,Given an integer $ k $; a {\em representative skyline} contains the $ k $ skyline points thatbest describe the tradeoffs among different dimensions offered by the full skyline. Althoughthis topic has been previously studied; the existing solution may sometimes produce $ k $points that appear in an arbitrarily tiny cluster; and therefore; fail to be representative.Motivated by this; we propose a new definition of representative skyline that minimizes thedistance between a non-representative skyline point and its nearest representative. We alsostudy algorithms for computing distance-based representative skylines. In 2D space; there isa dynamic programming algorithm that guarantees the optimal solution. For dimensionalityat least 3; we prove that the problem is NP-hard; and give a 2-approximate polynomial timealgorithm. Using a multidimensional access method; our algorithm can directly report the …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,156
Mining co-location patterns with rare events from spatial data sets,Yan Huang; Jian Pei; Hui Xiong,Abstract A co-location pattern is a group of spatial features/events that are frequently co-located in the same region. For example; human cases of West Nile Virus often occur inregions with poor mosquito control and the presence of birds. For co-location pattern mining;previous studies often emphasize the equal participation of every spatial feature. As a result;interesting patterns involving events with substantially different frequency cannot becaptured. In this paper; we address the problem of mining co-location patterns with rarespatial features. Specifically; we first propose a new measure called the maximalparticipation ratio (maxPR) and show that a co-location pattern with a relatively high maxPRvalue corresponds to a co-location pattern containing rare spatial events. Furthermore; weidentify a weak monotonicity property of the maxPR measure. This property can help to …,Geoinformatica,2006,147
Online mining of changes from data streams: Research problems and preliminary results,Guozhu Dong; Jiawei Han; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Jian Pei; Haixun Wang; Philip S Yu,ABSTRACT As data streams are gaining prominence in a growing number of emergingapplications; advanced analysis and mining of data streams is becoming increasinglyimportant. While there are some recent studies on mining data streams; we would like to askthe following essential question: What are the distinct features of mining data streamscompared to mining other kinds of data? In this paper; we take the following position: onlinemining of the changes in data streams is one of the core issues. We propose someinteresting research problems and highlight the inherent challenges. Moreover; we sketchsome preliminary results.,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams,2003,147
ApproxMAP: Approximate mining of consensus sequential patterns,Hye-Chung Kum; Jian Pei; Wei Wang; Dean Duncan,Abstract Conventional sequential pattern mining methods may meet inherent difficulties inmining databases with long sequences and noise. They may generate a huge number ofshort and trivial patterns but fail to find interesting patterns approximately shared by manysequences. In this paper; we propose the theme of approximate sequential pattern miningroughly defined as identifying patterns approximately shared by many sequences. Wepresent an efficient and effective algorithm; ApproxMAP; to mine consensus patterns fromlarge sequence databases in two steps. First; sequences are clustered by similarity. Then;consensus patterns are mined directly from each cluster through multiple alignment. We usea real case study to illustrate the effectiveness of ApproxMAP.,*,2003,142
Context-aware ranking in web search,Biao Xiang; Daxin Jiang; Jian Pei; Xiaohui Sun; Enhong Chen; Hang Li,Abstract The context of a search query often provides a search engine meaningful hints foranswering the current query better. Previous studies on context-aware search were eitherfocused on the development of context models or limited to a relatively small scaleinvestigation under a controlled laboratory setting. Particularly; about context-aware rankingfor Web search; the following two critical problems are largely remained unsolved. First; howcan we take advantage of different types of contexts in ranking? Second; how can weintegrate context information into a ranking model? In this paper; we tackle the above twoessential problems analytically and empirically. We develop different ranking principles fordifferent types of contexts. Moreover; we adopt a learning-to-rank approach and integratethe ranking principles into a state-of-the-art ranking model by encoding the context …,Proceedings of the 33rd international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2010,141
Constrained frequent pattern mining: a pattern-growth view,Jian Pei; Jiawei Han,Abstract It has been well recognized that frequent pattern mining plays an essential role inmany important data mining tasks. However; frequent pattern mining often generates a verylarge number of patterns and rules; which reduces not only the efficiency but also theeffectiveness of mining. Recent work has highlighted the importance of the constraint-basedmining paradigm in the context of mining frequent itemsets; associations; correlations;sequential patterns; and many other interesting patterns in large databases. Recently; wedeveloped efficient pattern-growth methods for frequent pattern mining. Interestingly; pattern-growth methods are not only efficient but also effective in mining with various constraints.Many tough constraints which cannot be handled by previous methods can be pushed deepinto the pattern-growth mining process. In this paper; we overview the principles of pattern …,ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter,2002,141
Detecting topic evolution in scientific literature: how can citations help?,Qi He; Bi Chen; Jian Pei; Baojun Qiu; Prasenjit Mitra; Lee Giles,Abstract Understanding how topics in scientific literature evolve is an interesting andimportant problem. Previous work simply models each paper as a bag of words and alsoconsiders the impact of authors. However; the impact of one document on another ascaptured by citations; one important inherent element in scientific literature; has not beenconsidered. In this paper; we address the problem of understanding topic evolution byleveraging citations; and develop citation-aware approaches. We propose an iterative topicevolution learning framework by adapting the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to the citationnetwork and develop a novel inheritance topic model. We evaluate the effectiveness andefficiency of our approaches and compare with the state of the art approaches on a largecollection of more than 650;000 research papers in the last 16 years and the citation …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,130
Efficient pattern-growth methods for frequent tree pattern mining,Chen Wang; Mingsheng Hong; Jian Pei; Haofeng Zhou; Wei Wang; Baile Shi,Abstract Mining frequent tree patterns is an important research problems with broadapplications in bioinformatics; digital library; e-commerce; and so on. Previous studies highlysuggested that pattern-growth methods are efficient in frequent pattern mining. In this paper;we systematically develop the pattern growth methods for mining frequent tree patterns. Twoalgorithms; Chopper and XSpanner; are devised. An extensive performance study showsthat the two newly developed algorithms outperform TreeMinerV [13]; one of the fastestmethods proposed before; in mining large databases. Furthermore; algorithm XSpanner issubstantially faster than Chopper in many cases.,Pacific-Asia conference on knowledge discovery and data mining,2004,129
Anonymity for continuous data publishing,Benjamin Fung; Ke Wang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jian Pei,Abstract k-anonymization is an important privacy protection mechanism in data publishing.While there has been a great deal of work in recent years; almost all considered a singlestatic release. Such mechanisms only protect the data up to the first release or first recipient.In practical applications; data is published continuously as new data arrive; the same datamay be anonymized differently for a different purpose or a different recipient. In suchscenarios; even when all releases are properly k-anonymized; the anonymity of anindividual may be unintentionally compromised if recipient cross-examines all the releasesreceived or colludes with other recipients. Preventing such attacks; called correspondenceattacks; faces major challenges. In this paper; we systematically characterize thecorrespondence attacks and propose an efficient anonymization algorithm to thwart the …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,125
Maple: A fast algorithm for maximal pattern-based clustering,Jian Pei; Xiaoling Zhang; Moonjung Cho; Haixun Wang; Philip S Yu,Pattern-based clustering is important in many applications; such as DNA micro-array dataanalysis; automatic recommendation systems and target marketing systems. However;pattern-based clustering in large databases is challenging. On the one hand; there can be ahuge number of clusters and many of them can be redundant and thus make the pattern-based clustering ineffective. On the other hand; the previous proposed methods may not beefficient or scalable in mining large databases. We study the problem of maximal pattern-based clustering. Redundant clusters are avoided completely by mining only the maximalpattern-based clusters. MaPle; an efficient and scalable mining algorithm is developed. Itconducts a depth-first; divide-and-conquer search and prunes unnecessary branchessmartly. Our extensive performance study on both synthetic data sets and real data sets …,Data Mining; 2003.

Moreimportantly; the fundamental problem on the semantics of skylines remains open: Why andin which subspaces is (or is not) an object in the skyline&quest; Practically; users may alsobe interested in the skylines in any subspaces. Then; what is the relationship between theskylines in the subspaces and those in the super-spaces&quest; How can we effectivelyanalyze the subspace skylines&quest; Can we efficiently compute skylines in varioussubspaces and answer various analytical queries&quest; In this article; we tackle theproblem of multidimensional subspace skyline computation and analysis.

Extracting interpretable features for early classification on time series,Zhengzheng Xing; Jian Pei; Philip S Yu; Ke Wang,Abstract Early classification on time series data has been found highly useful in a fewimportant applications; such as medical and health informatics; industry productionmanagement; safety and security management. While some classifiers have been proposedto achieve good earliness in classification; the interpretability of early classification remainslargely an open problem. Without interpretable features; application domain experts such asmedical doctors may be reluctant to adopt early classification. In this paper; we tackle theproblem of extracting interpretable features on time series for early classification.Specifically; we advocate local shapelets as features; which are segments of time seriesremaining in the same space of the input data and thus are highly interpretable. We extractlocal shapelets distinctly manifesting a target class locally and early so that they are …,*,2011,117
Scalable mining of large disk-based graph databases,Chen Wang; Wei Wang; Jian Pei; Yongtai Zhu; Baile Shi,Abstract Mining frequent structural patterns from graph databases is an interesting problemwith broad applications. Most of the previous studies focus on pruning unfruitful searchsubspaces effectively; but few of them address the mining on large; disk-based databases.As many graph databases in applications cannot be held into main memory; scalable miningof large; disk-based graph databases remains a challenging problem. In this paper; wedevelop an effective index structure; ADI (for< u> ad</u> jacency< u> i</u> ndex); to supportmining various graph patterns over large databases that cannot be held into main memory.The index is simple and efficient to build. Moreover; the new index structure can be easilyadopted in various existing graph pattern mining algorithms. As an example; we adapt thewell-known gSpan algorithm by using the ADI structure.

Mining frequent trajectory patterns for activity monitoring using radio frequency tag arrays,Yunhao Liu; Lei Chen; Jian Pei; Qiuxia Chen; Yiyang Zhao,Activity monitoring; a crucial task in many applications; is often conducted expensively usingvideo cameras. Also; effectively monitoring a large field by analyzing images from multiplecameras remains a challenging problem. In this paper; we introduce a novel application ofthe recently developed RFID technology: using RF tag arrays for activity monitoring; wheredata mining techniques play a critical role. The RFID technology provides an economicallyattractive solution due to the low cost of RF tags and readers. Another novelty of this designis that the tracking objects do not need to attach any transmitters or receivers; such as tagsor readers. By developing a practical fault-tolerant method; we offset the noise of RF tag dataand mine frequent trajectory patterns as models of regular activities. Our empirical studyusing real RFID systems and data sets verifies the feasibility and the effectiveness of our …,Pervasive Computing and Communications; 2007. PerCom'07.

Probabilistic reverse nearest neighbor queries on uncertain data,Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Wei Wang; Wenjie Zhang; Jian Pei,Uncertain data are inherent in various important applications and reverse nearest neighbor(RNN) query is an important query type for many applications. While many different types ofqueries have been studied on uncertain data; there is no previous work on answering RNNqueries on uncertain data. In this paper; we formalize probabilistic reverse nearest neighborquery that is to retrieve the objects from the uncertain data that have higher probability thana given threshold to be the RNN of an uncertain query object. We develop an efficientalgorithm based on various novel pruning approaches that solves the probabilistic RNNqueries on multidimensional uncertain data. The experimental results demonstrate that ouralgorithm is even more efficient than a sampling-based approximate algorithm for most ofthe cases and is highly scalable.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2010,111
Pushing convertible constraints in frequent itemset mining,Jian Pei; Jiawei Han; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Recent work has highlighted the importance of the constraint-based miningparadigm in the context of frequent itemsets; associations; correlations; sequential patterns;and many other interesting patterns in large databases. Constraint pushing techniques havebeen developed for mining frequent patterns and associations with antimonotonic;monotonic; and succinct constraints. In this paper; we study constraints which cannot behandled with existing theory and techniques in frequent pattern mining. For example; avg (S)θ v; median (S) θ v; sum (S) θ v (S can contain items of arbitrary values; θ∈{<;<;≤;≥} and vis a real number.) are customarily regarded as “tough” constraints in that they cannot bepushed inside an algorithm such as Apriori. We develop a notion of convertible constraintsand systematically analyze; classify; and characterize this class. We also develop …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2004,110
Probabilistic path queries in road networks: traffic uncertainty aware path selection,Ming Hua; Jian Pei,Abstract Path queries such as" finding the shortest path in travel time from my hotel to theairport" are heavily used in many applications of road networks. Currently; simple statisticaggregates such as the average travel time between two vertices are often used to answerpath queries. However; such simple aggregates often cannot capture the uncertaintyinherent in traffic. In this paper; we study how to take traffic uncertainty into account inanswering path queries in road networks. To capture the uncertainty in traffic such as thetravel time between two vertices; the weight of an edge is modeled as a random variableand is approximated by a set of samples. We propose three novel types of probabilistic pathqueries using basic probability principles:(1) a probabilistic path query like" what are thepaths from my hotel to the airport whose travel time is at most 30 minutes with a …,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2010,109
Efficient skyline and top-k retrieval in subspaces,Yufei Tao; Xiaokui Xiao; Jian Pei,Skyline and top-k queries are two popular operations for preference retrieval. In practice;applications that require these operations usually provide numerous candidate attributes;whereas; depending on their interests; users may issue queries regarding different subsetsof the dimensions. The existing algorithms are inadequate for subspace skyline/top-k searchbecause they have at least one of the following defects: 1) they require scanning the entiredatabase at least once; 2) they are optimized for one subspace but incur significantoverhead for other subspaces; or 3) they demand expensive maintenance cost or spaceconsumption. In this paper; we propose a technique SUBSKY; which settles both types ofqueries by using purely relational technologies. The core of SUBSKY is a transformation thatconverts multidimensional data to one-dimensional (1D) values. These values are …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2007,106
Mining confident co-location rules without a support threshold,Yan Huang; Hui Xiong; Shashi Shekhar; Jian Pei,Abstract Mining co-location patterns from spatial databases may reveal types of spatialfeatures likely located as neighbors in space. In this paper; we address the problem ofmining confident co-location rules without a support threshold. First; we propose a novelmeasure called the maximal participation index. We show that every confident co-locationrule corresponds to a co-location pattern with a high maximal participation index value.Second; we show that the maximal participation index is non-monotonic; and thus theconventional Apriori-like pruning does not work directly. We identify an interesting weakmonotonic property for the index and develop efficient algorithms to mine confident co-location rules. An extensive performance study shows that our method is both effective andefficient for large spatial databases.,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2003,104
Maintaining k-anonymity against incremental updates,Jian Pei; Jian Xu; Zhibin Wang; Wei Wang; Ke Wang,K-anonymity is a simple yet practical mechanismto protect privacy against attacks of re-identifying individuals by joining multiple public data sources. All existing methods achievingk-anonymity assume implicitly that the data objects to be anonymized are given once andfixed. However; in many applications; the real world data sources are dynamic. In this paper;we investigate the problem of maintaining k-anonymity against incremental updates; andpropose a simple yet effective solution. We analyze how inferences from multiple releasesmay temper the k-anonymity of data; and propose the monotonic incremental anonymizationproperty. The general idea is to progressively and consistently reduce the generalizationgranularity as incremental updates arrive. Our new approach guarantees the k-anonymity oneach release; and also on the inferred table using multiple releases. At the same time; our …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2007.

Towards context-aware search by learning a very large variable length hidden markov model from search logs,Huanhuan Cao; Daxin Jiang; Jian Pei; Enhong Chen; Hang Li,Abstract Capturing the context of a user's query from the previous queries and clicks in thesame session may help understand the user's information need. A context-aware approachto document re-ranking; query suggestion; and URL recommendation may improve users'search experience substantially. In this paper; we propose a general approach to context-aware search. To capture contexts of queries; we learn a variable length Hidden MarkovModel (vlHMM) from search sessions extracted from log data. Although the mathematicalmodel is intuitive; how to learn a large vlHMM with millions of states from hundreds ofmillions of search sessions poses a grand challenge. We develop a strategy for parameterinitialization in vlHMM learning which can greatly reduce the number of parameters to beestimated in practice. We also devise a method for distributed vlHMM learning under the …,Proceedings of the 18th international conference on World wide web,2009,100
Achieving k-anonymity by clustering in attribute hierarchical structures,Jiuyong Li; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jian Pei,Abstract Individual privacy will be at risk if a published data set is not properly de-identified. k-anonymity is a major technique to de-identify a data set. A more general view of k-anonymityis clustering with a constraint of the minimum number of objects in every cluster. Mostexisting approaches to achieving k-anonymity by clustering are for numerical (or ordinal)attributes. In this paper; we study achieving k-anonymity by clustering in attributehierarchical structures. We define generalisation distances between tuples to characterisedistortions by generalisations and discuss the properties of the distances. We conclude thatthe generalisation distance is a metric distance. We propose an efficient clustering-basedalgorithm for k-anonymisation.

Discovering frequent closed partial orders from strings,Jian Pei; Haixun Wang; Jian Liu; Ke Wang; Jianyong Wang; Philip S Yu,Mining knowledge about ordering from sequence data is an important problem with manyapplications; such as bioinformatics; Web mining; network management; and intrusiondetection. For example; if many customers follow a partial order in their purchases of aseries of products; the partial order can be used to predict other related customers' futurepurchases and develop marketing campaigns. Moreover; some biological sequences (eg;microarray data) can be clustered based on the partial orders shared by the sequences.Given a set of items; a total order of a subset of items can be represented as a string. A stringdatabase is a multiset of strings. In this paper; we identify a novel problem of mining frequentclosed partial orders from strings. Frequent closed partial orders capture the nonredundantand interesting ordering information from string databases.

Mining coherent gene clusters from gene-sample-time microarray data,Daxin Jiang; Jian Pei; Murali Ramanathan; Chun Tang; Aidong Zhang,Abstract Extensive studies have shown that mining microarray data sets is important inbioinformatics research and biomedical applications. In this paper; we explore a novel typeof gene-sample-time microarray data sets; which records the expression levels of variousgenes under a set of samples during a series of time points. In particular; we propose themining of coherent gene clusters from such data sets. Each cluster contains a subset ofgenes and a subset of samples such that the genes are coherent on the samples along thetime series. The coherent gene clusters may identify the samples corresponding to somephenotypes (eg; diseases); and suggest the candidate genes correlated to the phenotypes.We present two efficient algorithms; namely the Sample-Gene Search and the Gene-SampleSearch; to mine the complete set of coherent gene clusters.

Mining frequent cross-graph quasi-cliques,Daxin Jiang; Jian Pei,Abstract Joint mining of multiple datasets can often discover interesting; novel; and reliablepatterns which cannot be obtained solely from any single source. For example; inbioinformatics; jointly mining multiple gene expression datasets obtained by different labs orduring various biological processes may overcome the heavy noise in the data. Moreover;by joint mining of gene expression data and protein-protein interaction data; we maydiscover clusters of genes which show coherent expression patterns and also produceinteracting proteins. Such clusters may be potential pathways.

On computing condensed frequent pattern bases,Jian Pei; Guozhu Dong; Wei Zou; Jiawei Han,Frequent pattern mining has been studied extensively. However; the effectiveness andefficiency of this mining is often limited; since the number of frequent patterns generated isoften too large. In many applications it is sufficient to generate and examine only frequentpatterns with support frequency in close-enough approximation instead of in full precision.Such a compact but close-enough frequent pattern base is called a condensed frequentpatterns-base. In this paper we propose and examine several alternatives at the design;representation; and implementation of such condensed frequent pattern-bases. A fewalgorithms for computing such pattern-bases are proposed. Their effectiveness at patterncompression and their efficient computation methods are investigated.

The previous methods extend traditionalpartitioning clustering methods like $(k) $-means and density-based clustering methods likeDBSCAN to uncertain data; thus rely on geometric distances between objects. Suchmethods cannot handle uncertain objects that are geometrically indistinguishable; such asproducts with the same mean but very different variances in customer ratings. Surprisingly;probability distributions; which are essential characteristics of uncertain objects; have notbeen considered in measuring similarity between uncertain objects.

Mining multi-dimensional constrained gradients in data cubes,Guozhu Dong; Jiawei Han; Joyce Lam; Jian Pei; Ke Wang,Abstract Constrained gradient analysis (similar to the “cubegrade” problem posed byImielinski; et al.[9]) is to extract pairs of similar cell characteristics associated with bigchanges in measure in a data cube. Cells are considered similar if they are related by roll-up; drill-down; or 1-dimensional mutation operation. Constrained gradient queries areexpressive; capable of capturing trends in data and answering “what-if” questions. Tofacilitate our discussion; we call one cell in a gradient pair probe cell and the other gradientcell.

Minimum description length principle: Generators are preferable to closed patterns,Jinyan Li; Haiquan Li; Limsoon Wong; Jian Pei; Guozhu Dong,Abstract The generators and the unique closed pattern of an equivalence class of itemsetsshare a common set of transactions. The generators are the minimal ones among theequivalent itemsets; while the closed pattern is the maximum one. As a generator is usuallysmaller than the closed pattern in cardinality; by the Minimum Description Length Principle;the generator is preferable to the closed pattern in inductive inference and classification. Toefficiently discover frequent generators from a large dataset; we develop a depth-firstalgorithm called Gr-growth. The idea is novel in contrast to traditional breadth-first bottom-upgenerator-mining algorithms. Our extensive performance study shows that Gr-growth issignificantly faster (an order or even two orders of magnitudes when the support thresholdsare low) than the existing generator mining algorithms. It can be also faster than the state …,AAAI,2006,77
Citation recommendation without author supervision,Qi He; Daniel Kifer; Jian Pei; Prasenjit Mitra; C Lee Giles,Abstract Automatic recommendation of citations for a manuscript is highly valuable forscholarly activities since it can substantially improve the efficiency and quality of literaturesearch. The prior techniques placed a considerable burden on users; who were required toprovide a representative bibliography or to mark passages where citations are needed. Inthis paper we present a system that considerably reduces this burden: a user simply inputs aquery manuscript (without a bibliography) and our system automatically finds locationswhere citations are needed. We show that naïve approaches do not work well due tomassive noise in the document corpus. We produce a successful approach by carefullyexamining the relevance between segments in a query manuscript and the representativesegments extracted from a document corpus.

Mining preferences from superior and inferior examples,Bin Jiang; Jian Pei; Xuemin Lin; David W Cheung; Jiawei Han,Abstract Mining user preferences plays a critical role in many important applications such ascustomer relationship management (CRM); product and service recommendation; andmarketing campaigns. In this paper; we identify an interesting and practical problem ofmining user preferences: in a multidimensional space where the user preferences on somecategorical attributes are unknown; from some superior and inferior examples provided by auser; can we learn about the user's preferences on those categorical attributes? We modelthe problem systematically and show that mining user preferences from superior and inferiorexamples is challenging. Although the problem has great potential in practice; to the best ofour knowledge; it has not been explored systematically before. As the first attempt to tacklethe problem; we propose a greedy method and show that our method is practical using …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2008,75
Document clustering of scientific texts using citation contexts,Bader Aljaber; Nicola Stokes; James Bailey; Jian Pei,Abstract Document clustering has many important applications in the area of data miningand information retrieval. Many existing document clustering techniques use the “bag-of-words” model to represent the content of a document. However; this representation is onlyeffective for grouping related documents when these documents share a large proportion oflexically equivalent terms. In other words; instances of synonymy between relateddocuments are ignored; which can reduce the effectiveness of applications using a standardfull-text document representation. To address this problem; we present a new approach forclustering scientific documents; based on the utilization of citation contexts. A citation contextis essentially the text surrounding the reference markers used to refer to other scientificworks. We hypothesize that citation contexts will provide relevant synonymous and …,Information Retrieval,2010,71
Mining frequent trajectory patterns for activity monitoring using radio frequency tag arrays,Yunhao Liu; Yiyang Zhao; Lei Chen; Jian Pei; Jinsong Han,Activity monitoring; a crucial task in many applications; is often conducted expensively usingvideo cameras. Effectively monitoring a large field by analyzing images from multiplecameras remains a challenging issue. Other approaches generally require the trackingobjects to attach special devices; which are infeasible in many scenarios. To address theissue; we propose to use RF tag arrays for activity monitoring; where data mining techniquesplay a critical role. The RFID technology provides an economically attractive solution due tothe low cost of RF tags and readers. Another novelty of this design is that the tracking objectsdo not need to be equipped with any RF transmitters or receivers.

Efficient skyline querying with variable user preferences on nominal attributes,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jian Pei; Yip Sing Ho; Tai Wong; Yubao Liu,Abstract Current skyline evaluation techniques assume a fixed ordering on the attributes.However; dynamic preferences on nominal attributes are more realistic in knownapplications. In order to generate online response for any such preference issued by a user;one obvious solution is to enumerate all possible preferences and materialize all results ofthese preferences. However; the pre-processing and storage requirements of a fullmaterialization are typically prohibitive. Instead; we propose a semi-materialization methodcalled the IPO-tree Search which stores partial useful results only. With these partial results;the result of each possible preference can be returned efficiently. We have also conductedexperiments to show the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,70

Wat: Finding top-k discords in time series database,Yingyi Bu; Tat-Wing Leung; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Eamonn Keogh; Jian Pei; Sam Meshkin,Abstract Finding discords in time series database is an important problem in a great varietyof applications; such as space shuttle telemetry; mechanical industry; biomedicine; andfinancial data analysis. However; most previous methods for this problem suffer from toomany parameter settings which are difficult for users. The best known approach to ourknowledge that has comparatively fewer parameters still requires users to choose a wordsize for the compression of subsequences. In this paper; we propose a Haar wavelet andaugmented trie based algorithm to mine the top-K discords from a time series database;which can dynamically determine the word size for compression. Due to the characteristicsof Haar wavelet transform; our algorithm has greater pruning power than previousapproaches.

From sequential pattern mining to structured pattern mining: a pattern-growth approach,Jia-Wei Han; Jian Pei; Xi-Feng Yan,Abstract Sequential pattern mining is an important data mining problem with broadapplications. However; it is also a challenging problem since the mining may have togenerate or examine a combinatorially explosive number of intermediate subsequences.Recent studies have developed two major classes of sequential pattern mining methods:(1)a candidate generation-and-test approach; represented by (i) GSP; a horizontal format-based sequential pattern mining method; and (ii) SPADE; a vertical format-based method;and (2) a pattern-growth method; represented by PrefixSpan and its further extensions; suchas gSpan for mining structured patterns. In this study; we perform a systematic introductionand presentation of the pattern-growth methodology and study its principles and extensions.We first introduce two interesting pattern-growth algorithms; FreeSpan and PrefixSpan; for …,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2004,69
Suppressing model overfitting in mining concept-drifting data streams,Haixun Wang; Jian Yin; Jian Pei; Philip S Yu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Mining data streams of changing class distributions is important for real-timebusiness decision support. The stream classifier must evolve to reflect the current classdistribution. This poses a serious challenge. On the one hand; relying on historical data mayincrease the chances of learning obsolete models. On the other hand; learning only from thelatest data may lead to biased classifiers; as the latest data is often an unrepresentativesample of the current class distribution. The problem is particularly acute in classifying rareevents; when; for example; instances of the rare class do not even show up in the mostrecent training data. In this paper; we use a stochastic model to describe the concept shiftingpatterns and formulate this problem as an optimization one: from the historical and thecurrent training data that we have observed; find the most-likely current distribution; and …,Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2006,68
A rank sum test method for informative gene discovery,Lin Deng; Jian Pei; Jinwen Ma; Dik Lun Lee,Abstract Finding informative genes from microarray data is an important research problem inbioinformatics research and applications. Most of the existing methods rank featuresaccording to their discriminative capability and then find a subset of discriminative genes(usually top k genes). In particular; t-statistic criterion and its variants have been adoptedextensively. This kind of methods rely on the statistics principle of t-test; which requires thatthe data follows a normal distribution. However; according to our investigation; the normalitycondition often cannot be met in real data sets. To avoid the assumption of the normalitycondition; in this paper; we propose a rank sum test method for informative gene discovery.The method uses a rank-sum statistic as the ranking criterion. Moreover; we propose usingthe significance level threshold; instead of the number of informative genes; as the …,Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2004,68

Cosnet: Connecting heterogeneous social networks with local and global consistency,Yutao Zhang; Jie Tang; Zhilin Yang; Jian Pei; Philip S Yu,Abstract More often than not; people are active in more than one social network. Identifyingusers from multiple heterogeneous social networks and integrating the different networks isa fundamental issue in many applications. The existing methods tackle this problem byestimating pairwise similarity between users in two networks. However; those methods sufferfrom potential inconsistency of matchings between multiple networks. In this paper; wepropose COSNET (COnnecting heterogeneous Social NETworks with local and globalconsistency); a novel energy-based model; to address this problem by considering bothlocal and global consistency among multiple networks. An efficient subgradient algorithm isdeveloped to train the model by converting the original energy-based objective function intoits dual form.,Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2015,67
Efficiently indexing shortest paths by exploiting symmetry in graphs,Yanghua Xiao; Wentao Wu; Jian Pei; Wei Wang; Zhenying He,Abstract Shortest path queries (SPQ) are essential in many graph analysis and mining tasks.However; answering shortest path queries on-the-fly on large graphs is costly. To onlineanswer shortest path queries; we may materialize and index shortest paths. However; astraightforward index of all shortest paths in a graph of N vertices takes O (N 2) space. In thispaper; we tackle the problem of indexing shortest paths and online answering shortest pathqueries. As many large real graphs are shown richly symmetric; the central idea of ourapproach is to use graph symmetry to reduce the index size while retaining the correctnessand the efficiency of shortest path query answering. Technically; we develop a framework toindex a large graph at the orbit level instead of the vertex level so that the number of breadth-first search trees materialized is reduced from O (N) to O (| Δ|); where| Δ|≤ N is the …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,67

Weintroduce a novel concept of MPL (Minimum Prediction Length) and develop ECTS (EarlyClassification on Time Series); an effective 1-nearest neighbor classification method. ECTSmakes early predictions and at the same time retains the accuracy comparable to that of a1NN classifier using the full-length time series. Our empirical study using benchmark timeseries data sets shows that ECTS works well on the real data sets where 1NN classificationis effective.,IJCAI,2009,64

On privacy preservation against adversarial data mining,Charu C Aggarwal; Jian Pei; Bo Zhang,Abstract Privacy preserving data processing has become an important topic recentlybecause of advances in hardware technology which have lead to widespread proliferation ofdemographic and sensitive data. A rudimentary way to preserve privacy is to simply hide theinformation in some of the sensitive fields picked by a user. However; such a method is farfrom satisfactory in its ability to prevent adversarial data mining. Real data records are notrandomly distributed. As a result; some fields in the records may be correlated with oneanother. If the correlation is sufficiently high; it may be possible for an adversary to predictsome of the sensitive fields using other fields. In this paper; we study the problem of privacypreservation against adversarial data mining; which is to hide a minimal set of entries so thatthe privacy of the sensitive fields are satisfactorily preserved. In other words; even by data …,Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2006,64

Processingbig graph data introduces complex and multiple iterations that raise challenges such asparallel memory bottlenecks; deadlocks; and inefficiency. To tackle the challenges; wepropose a novel technique for effectively processing big graph data on Cloud. Specifically;the big data will be compressed with its spatiotemporal features on Cloud. By exploringspatial data correlation; we partition a graph data set into clusters. In a cluster; the workloadcan be shared by the inference based on time series similarity. By exploiting temporalcorrelation; in each time series or a single graph edge; temporal data compression isconducted. A novel data driven scheduling is also developed for data processingoptimisation.

Pattern-growth methods for frequent pattern mining,Jian Pei,Abstract Mining frequent patterns from large databases plays an essential role in many datamining tasks and has broad applications. Most of the previously proposed methods adoptapriorilike candidate-generation-and-test approaches. However; those methods mayencounter serious challenges when mining datasets with prolific patterns and/or longpatterns. In this work; we develop a class of novel and efficient pattern-growth methods formining various frequent patterns from large databases. Pattern-growth methods adopt adivideand-conquer approach to decompose both the mining tasks and the databases. Then;they use a pattern fragment growth method to avoid the costly candidate-generation-and-testprocessing completely. Moreover; effective data structures are proposed to compress crucialinformation about frequent patterns and avoid expensive; repeated database scans. A …,*,2002,62
H-Mine: Fast and space-preserving frequent pattern mining in large databases,Jian Pei; Jiawei Han; Hongjun Lu; Shojiro Nishio; Shiwei Tang; Dongqing Yang,In this study; we propose a simple and novel data structure using hyper-links; H-struct; and anew mining algorithm; H-mine; which takes advantage of this data structure and dynamicallyadjusts links in the mining process. A distinct feature of this method is that it has a verylimited and precisely predictable main memory cost and runs very quickly in memory-basedsettings. Moreover; it can be scaled up to very large databases using database partitioning.When the data set becomes dense;(conditional) FP-trees can be constructed dynamically aspart of the mining process. Our study shows that H-mine has an excellent performance forvarious kinds of data; outperforms currently available algorithms in different settings; and ishighly scalable to mining large databases.

A practical method for estimating performance degradation on multicore processors; and its application to hpc workloads,Tyler Dwyer; Alexandra Fedorova; Sergey Blagodurov; Mark Roth; Fabien Gaud; Jian Pei,Abstract When multiple threads or processes run on a multi-core CPU they compete forshared resources; such as caches and memory controllers; and can suffer performancedegradation as high as 200%. We design and evaluate a new machine learning model thatestimates this degradation online; on previously unseen workloads; and without perturbingthe execution. Our motivation is to help data center and HPC cluster operators effectivelyuse workload consolidation. Data center consolidation is about placing many applicationson the same server to maximize hardware utilization. In HPC clusters; processes of the samedistributed applications run on the same machine. Consolidation improves hardwareutilization; but may sacrifice performance as processes compete for resources. Our modelhelps determine when consolidation is overly harmful to performance.

GenBlastA: enabling BLAST to identify homologous gene sequences,Rong She; Jeffrey S-C Chu; Ke Wang; Jian Pei; Nansheng Chen,Abstract BLAST is an extensively used local similarity search tool for identifying homologoussequences. When a gene sequence (either protein sequence or nucleotide sequence) isused as a query to search for homologous sequences in a genome; the search results;represented as a list of high-scoring pairs (HSPs); are fragments of candidate genes ratherthan full-length candidate genes. Relevant HSPs (“signals”); which represent candidategenes in the target genome sequences; are buried within a report that contains alsohundreds to thousands of random HSPs (“noises”). Consequently; BLAST results are oftenoverwhelming and confusing even to experienced users. For effective use of BLAST; aprogram is needed for extracting relevant HSPs that represent candidate homologous genesfrom the entire HSP report. To achieve this goal; we have designed a graph-based …,Genome research,2009,60

Publishing sensitive transactions for itemset utility,Yabo Xu; Benjamin CM Fung; Ke Wang; Ada WC Fu; Jian Pei,We consider the problem of publishing sensitive transaction data with privacy preservation.High dimensionality of transaction data poses unique challenges on data privacy and datautility. On one hand; re-identification attacks tend to use a subset of items that infrequentlyoccur in transactions; called moles. On the other hand; data mining applications typicallydepend on subsets of items that frequently occur in transactions; called nuggets. Thus theproblem is how to eliminate all moles while retaining nuggets as much as possible. Achallenge is that moles and nuggets are multi-dimensional with exponential growth and aretangled together by shared items. We present a novel and scalable solution to this problem.The novelty lies in a compact border data structure that eliminates the need of generating allmoles and nuggets.,Data Mining; 2008. ICDM'08.

Anonymization by local recoding in data with attribute hierarchical taxonomies,Jiuyong Li; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jian Pei,Individual privacy will be at risk if a published data set is not properly deidentified. k-anonymity is a major technique to de-identify a data set. Among a number of k-anonymization schemes; local recoding methods are promising for minimizing the distortionof a k-anonymity view. This paper addresses two major issues in local recoding k-anonymization in attribute hierarchical taxonomies. First; we define a proper distance metricto achieve local recoding generalization with small distortion. Second; we propose a meansto control the inconsistency of attribute domains in a generalized view by local recoding.

Superseding nearest neighbor search on uncertain spatial databases,Sze Man Yuen; Yufei Tao; Xiaokui Xiao; Jian Pei; Donghui Zhang,This paper proposes a new problem; called superseding nearest neighbor search; onuncertain spatial databases; where each object is described by a multidimensionalprobability density function. Given a query point q; an object is a nearest neighbor (NN)candidate if it has a nonzero probability to be the NN of q. Given two NN-candidates o 1 ando 2; o 1 supersedes o 2 if o 1 is more likely to be closer to q. An object is a supersedingnearest neighbor (SNN) of q; if it supersedes all the other NN-candidates. Sometimes noobject is able to supersede every other NN-candidate. In this case; we return the SNN-core-the minimum set of NN-candidates each of which supersedes all the NN-candidates outsidethe SNN-core. Intuitively; the SNN-core contains the best objects; because any objectoutside the SNN-core is worse than all the objects in the SNN-core.

Mining sequence classifiers for early prediction,Zhengzheng Xing; Jian Pei; Guozhu Dong; Philip S Yu,Abstract Supervised learning on sequence data; also known as sequence classification; hasbeen well recognized as an important data mining task with many significant applications.Since temporal order is important in sequence data; in many critical applications ofsequence classification such as medical diagnosis and disaster prediction; early predictionis a highly desirable feature of sequence classifiers. In early prediction; a sequenceclassifier should use a prefix of a sequence as short as possible to make a reasonablyaccurate prediction.

Utility-based anonymization for privacy preservation with less information loss,Jian Xu; Wei Wang; Jian Pei; Xiaoyuan Wang; Baile Shi; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Abstract Privacy becomes a more and more serious concern in applications involvingmicrodata. Recently; efficient anonymization has attracted much research work. Most of theprevious methods use global recoding; which maps the domains of the quasi-identifierattributes to generalized or changed values. However; global recoding may not alwaysachieve effective anonymization in terms of discernability and query answering accuracyusing the anonymized data. Moreover; anonymized data is often used for analysis. As wellaccepted in many analytical applications; different attributes in a data set may have differentutility in the analysis. The utility of attributes has not been considered in the previousmethods. In this paper; we study the problem of utility-based anonymization.

Mining query subtopics from search log data,Yunhua Hu; Yanan Qian; Hang Li; Daxin Jiang; Jian Pei; Qinghua Zheng,Abstract Most queries in web search are ambiguous and multifaceted. Identifying the majorsenses and facets of queries from search log data; referred to as query subtopic mining inthis paper; is a very important issue in web search. Through search log analysis; we showthat there are two interesting phenomena of user behavior that can be leveraged to identifyquery subtopics; referred to asone subtopic per search'andsubtopic clarification by keyword'.One subtopic per search means that if a user clicks multiple URLs in one query; then theclicked URLs tend to represent the same sense or facet. Subtopic clarification by keywordmeans that users often add an additional keyword or keywords to expand the query in orderto clarify their search intent. Thus; the keywords tend to be indicative of the sense or facet.We propose a clustering algorithm that can effectively leverage the two phenomena to …,Proceedings of the 35th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2012,55
Online interval skyline queries on time series,Bin Jiang; Jian Pei,In many applications; we need to analyze a large number of time series. Segments of timeseries demonstrating dominating advantages over others are often of particular interest. Inthis paper; we advocate interval skyline queries; a novel type of time series analysis queries.For a set of time series and a given time interval [i: j]; an interval skyline query returns thetime series which are not dominated by any other time series in the interval. We illustrate theusefulness of interval skyline queries in applications. Moreover; we develop an on-the-flymethod and a view-materialization method to online answer interval skyline queries on timeseries. The on-the-fly method keeps the minimum and the maximum values of the timeseries using radix priority search trees and sketches; and computes the skyline at the querytime.

Regression cubes with lossless compression and aggregation,Yixin Chen; Guozhu Dong; Jiawei Han; Jian Pei; Benjamin W Wah; Jianyong Wang,As OLAP engines are widely used to support multidimensional data analysis; it is desirableto support in data cubes advanced statistical measures; such as regression and filtering; inaddition to the traditional simple measures such as count and average. Such new measuresallow users to model; smooth; and predict the trends and patterns of data. Existingalgorithms for simple distributive and algebraic measures are inadequate for efficientcomputation of statistical measures in a multidimensional space. In this paper; we propose afundamentally new class of measures; compressible measures; in order to support efficientcomputation of the statistical models. For compressible measures; we compress each cellinto an auxiliary matrix with a size independent of the number of tuples. We can thencompute the statistical measures for any data cell from the compressed data of the lower …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2006,55
Asymmetric transitivity preserving graph embedding,Mingdong Ou; Peng Cui; Jian Pei; Ziwei Zhang; Wenwu Zhu,Abstract Graph embedding algorithms embed a graph into a vector space where thestructure and the inherent properties of the graph are preserved. The existing graphembedding methods cannot preserve the asymmetric transitivity well; which is a criticalproperty of directed graphs. Asymmetric transitivity depicts the correlation among directededges; that is; if there is a directed path from u to v; then there is likely a directed edge from uto v. Asymmetric transitivity can help in capturing structures of graphs and recovering frompartially observed graphs. To tackle this challenge; we propose the idea of preservingasymmetric transitivity by approximating high-order proximity which are based onasymmetric transitivity. In particular; we develop a novel graph embedding algorithm; High-Order Proximity preserved Embedding (HOPE for short); which is scalable to preserve …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2016,54
Improving grouped-entity resolution using quasi-cliques,Byung-Won On; Ergin Elmacioglu; Dongwon Lee; Jaewoo Kang; Jian Pei,The entity resolution (ER) problem; which identifies duplicate entities that refer to the samereal world entity; is essential in many applications. In this paper; in particular; we focus onresolving entities that contain a group of related elements in them (eg; an author entity with alist of citations; a singer entity with song list; or an intermediate result by GROUP BY SQLquery). Such entities; named as grouped-entities; frequently occur in many applications. Theprevious approaches toward grouped-entity resolution often rely on textual similarity; andproduce a large number of false positives. As a complementing technique; in this paper; wepresent our experience of applying a recently proposed graph mining technique; Quasi-Clique; atop conventional ER solutions.

A dynamic clustering and scheduling approach to energy saving in data collection from wireless sensor networks,Chong Liu; Kui Wu; Jian Pei,Abstract—Energy consumption is one of the major con-straints in wireless sensor networks.A highly feasible strategy is to aggressively reduce the spatial sampling rate of sensors (ie;the density of the measure points in a field). By properly scheduling; we want to retain thehigh quality of data collection. In this paper; we propose a novel dynamic clustering andscheduling approach. Orthogonal to most ex-isting methods which mainly utilize theoverlaps of sensing ranges of sensors to reduce the spatial sampling rate; our method isbased on a careful analysis of the surveillance data reported by the sensors. Wedynamically partition the sensors into groups so that the sensors in the same group havesimilar surveillance time series.

Mining constrained gradients in large databases,Guozhu Dong; Jiawei Han; JWM Lam; Jian Pei; K Wangm; Wei Zou,Many data analysis tasks can be viewed as search or mining in a multidimensional space(MDS). In such MDSs; dimensions capture potentially important factors for givenapplications; and cells represent combinations of values for the factors. To systematicallyanalyze data in MDS; an interesting notion; called" cubegrade" was recently introduced byImielinski et al.[2002]; which focuses on the notable changes in measures in MDS bycomparing a cell (which we refer to as probe cell) with its gradient cells; namely; itsancestors; descendants; and siblings. We call such queries gradient analysis queries (GQs).Since an MDS can contain billions of cells; it is important to answer GQs efficiently. We focuson developing efficient methods for mining GQs constrained by certain (weakly)antimonotone constraints. Instead of conducting an independent gradient-cell search …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2004,54

A spamicity approach to web spam detection,Bin Zhou; Jian Pei; Zhaohui Tang,Abstract Web spam; which refers to any deliberate actions bringing to selected web pagesan unjustifiable favorable relevance or importance; is one of the major obstacles for highquality information retrieval on the web. Most of the existing web spam detection methodsare supervised that require a large and representative training set of web pages. Moreover;they often assume some global information such as a large web graph and snapshots of alarge collection of web pages. However; in many situations such assumptions may not hold.In this paper; we study the problem of unsupervised web spam detection. We introduce thenotion of spamicity to measure how likely a page is spam. Spamicity is a more flexible anduser-controllable measure than the traditional supervised classification methods. Wepropose efficient online link spam and term spam detection methods using spamicity. Our …,*,2008,51
Can the utility of anonymized data be used for privacy breaches?,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang; Philip S Yu; Jian Pei,Abstract Group based anonymization is the most widely studied approach for privacy-preserving data publishing. Privacy models/definitions using group based anonymizationincludes k-anonymity; l-diversity; and t-closeness; to name a few. The goal of this article is toraise a fundamental issue regarding the privacy exposure of the approaches using groupbased anonymization. This has been overlooked in the past. The group basedanonymization approach by bucketization basically hides each individual record behind agroup to preserve data privacy. If not properly anonymized; patterns can actually be derivedfrom the published data and be used by an adversary to breach individual privacy. Forexample; from the medical records released; if patterns such as that people from certaincountries rarely suffer from some disease can be derived; then the information can be …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2011,50
Hierarchical distributed data classification in wireless sensor networks,Xu Cheng; Ji Xu; Jian Pei; Jiangchuan Liu,Abstract Wireless sensor networks promise an unprecedented opportunity to monitorphysical environments via inexpensive wireless embedded devices. Given the sheeramount of sensed data; efficient classification of them becomes a critical task in many sensornetwork applications. The large scale and the stringent energy constraints of such networkshowever challenge the conventional classification techniques that demand enormousstorage space and centralized computation. In this paper; we propose a novel decision-tree-based hierarchical distributed classification approach; in which local classifiers are built byindividual sensors and merged along the routing path forming a spanning tree. Theclassifiers are iteratively enhanced by combining strategically generated pseudo data andnew local data; eventually converging to a global classifier for the whole network. We also …,Computer Communications,2010,49
Computing closed skycubes,Chedy Raïssi; Jian Pei; Thomas Kister,Abstract In this paper; we tackle the problem of efficient skycube computation. We introducea novel approach significantly reducing domination tests for a given subspace and thenumber of subspaces searched. Technically; we identify two types of skyline points that canbe directly derived without using any domination tests. Moreover; based on formal conceptanalysis; we introduce two closure operators that enable a concise representation of skylinecubes. We show that this concise representation is easy to compute and develop an efficientalgorithm; which only needs to search a small portion of the huge search space. We showwith empirical results the merits of our approach.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,48
Graphminer: a structural pattern-mining system for large disk-based graph databases and its applications,Wei Wang; Chen Wang; Yongtai Zhu; Baile Shi; Jian Pei; Xifeng Yan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Mining frequent structural patterns from graph databases is an important researchproblem with broad applications. Recently; we developed an effective index structure; ADI;and efficient algorithms for mining frequent patterns from large; disk-based graph databases[5]; as well as constraint-based mining techniques. The techniques have been integratedinto a research prototype system---GraphMiner. In this paper; we describe a demo ofGraphMiner which showcases the technical details of the index structure and the miningalgorithms including their efficient implementation; the mining performance and thecomparison with some state-of-the-art methods; the constraint-based graph-pattern miningtechniques and the procedure of constrained graph mining; as well as mining real data setsin novel applications.,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,48
Threshold-based probabilistic top-k dominating queries,Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang; Jian Pei; Wei Wang,Abstract Recently; due to intrinsic characteristics in many underlying data sets; a number ofprobabilistic queries on uncertain data have been investigated. Top-k dominating queriesare very important in many applications including decision making in a multidimensionalspace. In this paper; we study the problem of efficiently computing top-k dominating querieson uncertain data. We first formally define the problem. Then; we develop an efficient;threshold-based algorithm to compute the exact solution. To overcome some inherentcomputational deficiency in an exact computation; we develop an efficient randomizedalgorithm with an accuracy guarantee. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that bothalgorithms are quite efficient; while the randomized algorithm is quite scalable against dataset sizes; object areas; k values; etc. The randomized algorithm is also highly accurate in …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2010,47
Parallel field alignment for cross media retrieval,Xiangbo Mao; Binbin Lin; Deng Cai; Xiaofei He; Jian Pei,Abstract Cross media retrieval systems have received increasing interest in recent years.Due to the semantic gap between low-level features and high-level semantic concepts ofmultimedia data; many researchers have explored joint-model techniques in cross mediaretrieval systems. Previous joint-model approaches usually focus on two traditional ways todesign cross media retrieval systems:(a) fusing features from different media data;(b)learning different models for different media data and fusing their outputs. However; theprocess of fusing features or outputs will lose both low-and high-level abstractioninformation of media data. Hence; both ways do not really reveal the semantic correlationsamong the heterogeneous multimedia data. In this paper; we introduce a novel method forthe cross media retrieval task; named Parallel Field Alignment Retrieval (PFAR); which …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Multimedia,2013,46
A binary decision diagram based approach for mining frequent subsequences,Elsa Loekito; James Bailey; Jian Pei,Abstract Sequential pattern mining is an important problem in data mining. State of the arttechniques for mining sequential patterns; such as frequent subsequences; are often basedon the pattern-growth approach; which recursively projects conditional databases. Explicitlycreating database projections is thought to be a major computational bottleneck; but we willshow in this paper that it can be beneficial when the appropriate data structure is used. Ourtechnique uses a canonical directed acyclic graph as the sequence databaserepresentation; which can be represented as a binary decision diagram (BDD). In this paper;we introduce a new type of BDD; namely a sequence BDD (SeqBDD); and show how it canbe used for efficiently mining frequent subsequences. A novel feature of the SeqBDD is itsability to share results between similar intermediate computations and avoid redundant …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2010,46
Data mining for intrusion detection: techniques; applications and systems,Jian Pei; Shambhu J Upadhyaya; Faisal Farooq; Venugopal Govindaraju,An intrusion is defined as any set of actions that compromise the integrity; confidentiality oravailability of a resource. Intrusion detection is an important task for informationinfrastructure security. One major challenge in intrusion detection is that we have to identifythe camouflaged intrusions from a huge amount of normal communication activities. Datamining is to identify valid; novel; potentially useful; and ultimately understandable patterns inmassive data. It is demanding to apply data mining techniques to detect various intrusions.In the last several years; some exciting and important advances have been made inintrusion detection using data mining techniques. Research results have been publishedand some prototype systems have been established.

More is simpler: Effectively and efficiently assessing node-pair similarities based on hyperlinks,Weiren Yu; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang; Lijun Chang; Jian Pei,Abstract Similarity assessment is one of the core tasks in hyperlink analysis. Recently; withthe proliferation of applications; eg; web search and collaborative filtering; SimRank hasbeen a well-studied measure of similarity between two nodes in a graph. It recursivelyfollows the philosophy that" two nodes are similar if they are referenced (have incomingedges) from similar nodes"; which can be viewed as an aggregation of similarities based onincoming paths. Despite its popularity; SimRank has an undesirable property; ie;" zero-similarity": It only accommodates paths with equal length from a common" center" node.Thus; a large portion of other paths are fully ignored. This paper attempts to remedy thisissue.(1) We propose and rigorously justify SimRank*; a revised version of SimRank; whichresolves such counter-intuitive" zero-similarity" issues while inheriting merits of the basic …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,44
Can we learn a template-independent wrapper for news article extraction from a single training site?,Junfeng Wang; Chun Chen; Can Wang; Jian Pei; Jiajun Bu; Ziyu Guan; Wei Vivian Zhang,Abstract Automatic news extraction from news pages is important in many Web applicationssuch as news aggregation. However; the existing news extraction methods based ontemplate-level wrapper induction have three serious limitations. First; the existing methodscannot correctly extract pages belonging to an unseen template. Second; it is costly tomaintain up-to-date wrappers for a large amount of news websites; because any change ofa template may invalidate the corresponding wrapper. Last; the existing methods can merelyextract unformatted plain texts; and thus are not user friendly. In this paper; we tackle theproblem of template-independent Web news extraction in a user-friendly way. We formalizeWeb news extraction as a machine learning problem and learn a template-independentwrapper using a very small number of labeled news pages from a single site.

Email mining: tasks; common techniques; and tools,Guanting Tang; Jian Pei; Wo-Shun Luk,Abstract Email is one of the most popular forms of communication nowadays; mainly due toits efficiency; low cost; and compatibility of diversified types of information. In order tofacilitate better usage of emails and explore business potentials in emailing; various datamining techniques have been applied on email data. In this paper; we present a brief surveyof the major research efforts on email mining. To emphasize the differences between emailmining and general text mining; we organize our survey on five major email mining tasks;namely spam detection; email categorization; contact analysis; email network propertyanalysis and email visualization. Those tasks are inherently incorporated into varioususages of emails. We systematically review the commonly used techniques and also discussthe related software tools available.,*,2014,43
A fast algorithm for subspace clustering by pattern similarity,Haixun Wang; Fang Chu; Wei Fan; Philip S Yu; Jian Pei,Unlike traditional clustering methods that focus on grouping objects with similar values on aset of dimensions; clustering by pattern similarity finds objects that exhibit a coherent patternof rise and fall in subspaces. Pattern-based clustering extends the concept of traditionalclustering and benefits a wide range of applications; including large scale scientific dataanalysis; target marketing; Web usage analysis; etc. However; state-of-the-art pattern-basedclustering methods (eg; the pCluster algorithm) can only handle data sets of thousands ofrecords; which makes them inappropriate for many real-life applications. Furthermore;besides the huge data volume; many data sets are also characterized by their sequentiality;for instance; customer purchase records and network event logs are usually modeled asdata sequences. Hence; it becomes important to enable pattern-based clustering …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2004. Proceedings. 16th International Conference on,2004,43
Interactive exploration of coherent patterns in time-series gene expression data,Daxin Jiang; Jian Pei; Aidong Zhang,Abstract Discovering coherent gene expression patterns in time-series gene expressiondata is an important task in bioinformatics research and biomedical applications. In thispaper; we propose an interactive exploration framework for mining coherent expressionpatterns in time-series gene expression data. We develop a novel tool; coherent patternindex graph; to give users highly confident indications of the existences of coherent patterns.To derive a coherent pattern index graph; we devise an attraction tree structure to record thegenes in the data set and summarize the information needed for the interactive exploration.We present fast and scalable algorithms to construct attraction trees and coherent patternindex graphs from gene expression data sets. We conduct an extensive performance studyon some real data sets to verify our design.

Mining condensed frequent-pattern bases,Jian Pei; Guozhu Dong; Wei Zou; Jiawei Han,Abstract Frequent-pattern mining has been studied extensively and has many usefulapplications. However; frequent-pattern mining often generates too many patterns to be trulyefficient or effective. In many applications; it is sufficient to generate and examine frequentpatterns with a sufficiently good approximation of the support frequency instead of in fullprecision. Such a compact but “close-enough” frequent-pattern base is called a condensedfrequent-pattern base. In this paper; we propose and examine several alternatives for thedesign; representation; and implementation of such condensed frequent-pattern bases.Several algorithms for computing such pattern bases are proposed. Their effectiveness atpattern compression and methods for efficiently computing them are investigated. Asystematic performance study is conducted on different kinds of databases; and …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2004,42
Mining phenotypes and informative genes from gene expression data,Chun Tang; Aidong Zhang; Jian Pei,Abstract Mining microarray gene expression data is an important research topic inbioinformatics with broad applications. While most of the previous studies focus onclustering either genes or samples; it is interesting to ask whether we can partition thecomplete set of samples into exclusive groups (called phenotypes) and find a set ofinformative genes that can manifest the phenotype structure. In this paper; we propose anew problem of simultaneously mining phenotypes and informative genes from geneexpression data. Some statistics-based metrics are proposed to measure the quality of themining results. Two interesting algorithms are developed: the heuristic search and themutual reinforcing adjustment method. We present an extensive performance study on bothreal-world data sets and synthetic data sets.

On k-skip shortest paths,Yufei Tao; Cheng Sheng; Jian Pei,Abstract Given two vertices s; t in a graph; let P be the shortest path (SP) from s to t; and P* asubset of the vertices in P. P* is a k-skip shortest path from s to t; if it includes at least a vertexout of every k consecutive vertices in P. In general; P* succinctly describes P by samplingthe vertices in P with a rate of at least 1/k. This makes P* a natural substitute in scenarioswhere reporting every single vertex of P is unnecessary or even undesired. This paperstudies k-skip SP computation in the context of spatial network databases (SNDB). Ourtechnique has two properties crucial for real-time query processing in SNDB. First; oursolution is able to answer k-skip queries significantly faster than finding the original SPs intheir entirety. Second; the previous objective is achieved with a structure that occupies lessspace than storing the underlying road network.

Efficiently answering top-k typicality queries on large databases,Ming Hua; Jian Pei; Ada WC Fu; Xuemin Lin; Ho-Fung Leung,Abstract Finding typical instances is an effective approach to understand and analyze largedata sets. In this paper; we apply the idea of typicality analysis from psychology andcognition science to database query answering; and study the novel problem of answeringtop-k typicality queries. We model typicality in large data sets systematically. To answerquestions like" Who are the top-k most typical NBA players?"; the measure of simpletypicality is developed. To answer questions like" Who are the top-k most typical guardsdistinguishing guards from other players?"; the notion of discriminative typicality is proposed.Computing the exact answer to a top-k typicality query requires quadratic time which is oftentoo costly for online query answering on large databases. We develop a series ofapproximation methods for various situations.(1) The randomized tournament algorithm …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,40
Mining search and browse logs for web search: A survey,Daxin Jiang; Jian Pei; Hang Li,Abstract Huge amounts of search log data have been accumulated at Web search engines.Currently; a popular Web search engine may receive billions of queries and collect terabytesof records about user search behavior daily. Beside search log data; huge amounts ofbrowse log data have also been collected through client-side browser plugins. Suchmassive amounts of search and browse log data provide great opportunities for mining thewisdom of crowds and improving Web search. At the same time; designing effective andefficient methods to clean; process; and model log data also presents great challenges. Inthis survey; we focus on mining search and browse log data for Web search.

Mining concept sequences from large-scale search logs for context-aware query suggestion,Zhen Liao; Daxin Jiang; Enhong Chen; Jian Pei; Huanhuan Cao; Hang Li,Abstract Query suggestion plays an important role in improving usability of search engines.Although some recently proposed methods provide query suggestions by mining querypatterns from search logs; none of them models the immediately preceding queries ascontext systematically; and uses context information effectively in query suggestions.Context-aware query suggestion is challenging in both modeling context and scaling upquery suggestion using context. In this article; we propose a novel context-aware querysuggestion approach. To tackle the challenges; our approach consists of two stages. In thefirst; offline model-learning stage; to address data sparseness; queries are summarized intoconcepts by clustering a click-through bipartite. A concept sequence suffix tree is thenconstructed from session data as a context-aware query suggestion model. In the second …,ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST),2011,38
Mining cross-graph quasi-cliques in gene expression and protein interaction data,Jian Pei; Daxin Jiang; Aidong Zhang,A protein is the product of a gene. From the gene expression data; we can find co-expressedgenes; which are groups of genes that demonstrate coherent patterns on samples. On theother hand; from the protein interaction data; we can find groups of proteins that frequentlyinteract with each other. If we can conduct a joint mining of both gene expression data andprotein interaction data; then we may find the clusters of genes that are co-expressed andalso their proteins interact. Such clusters found from the joint mining are interesting andmeaningful for at least two reasons. First; both the gene expression data and the proteindata are very noisy. The clusters confirmed by both data sets will strongly indicate thecorrelation/connection among the genes in a cluster. In other words; the clusters found fromthe joint mining are more reliable. We may thus have the high confidence that the genes …,Data Engineering; 2005. ICDE 2005. Proceedings. 21st International Conference on,2005,37
Proximity-aware local-recoding anonymization with mapreduce for scalable big data privacy preservation in cloud,Xuyun Zhang; Wanchun Dou; Jian Pei; Surya Nepal; Chi Yang; Chang Liu; Jinjun Chen,Cloud computing provides promising scalable IT infrastructure to support various processingof a variety of big data applications in sectors such as healthcare and business. Data setslike electronic health records in such applications often contain privacy-sensitiveinformation; which brings about privacy concerns potentially if the information is released orshared to third-parties in cloud. A practical and widely-adopted technique for data privacypreservation is to anonymize data via generalization to satisfy a given privacy model.However; most existing privacy preserving approaches tailored to small-scale data setsoften fall short when encountering big data; due to their insufficiency or poor scalability.

Link spam target detection using page farms,Bin Zhou; Jian Pei,Abstract Currently; most popular Web search engines adopt some link-based rankingmethods such as PageRank. Driven by the huge potential benefit of improving rankings ofWeb pages; many tricks have been attempted to boost page rankings. The most commonway; which is known as link spam; is to make up some artificially designed link structures.Detecting link spam effectively is a big challenge. In this article; we develop novel andeffective detection methods for link spam target pages using page farms. The essential ideais intuitive: whether a page is the beneficiary of link spam is reflected by how it collects itsPageRank score. Technically; how a target page collects its PageRank score is modeled bya page farm; which consists of pages contributing a major portion of the PageRank score ofthe target page. We propose two spamicity measures based on page farms. They can be …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2009,36
OrthoCluster: a new tool for mining synteny blocks and applications in comparative genomics,Xinghuo Zeng; Matthew J Nesbitt; Jian Pei; Ke Wang; Ismael A Vergara; Nansheng Chen,Abstract By comparing genomes among both closely and distally related species;comparative genomics analysis characterizes structures and functions of different genomesin both conserved and divergent regions. Synteny blocks; which are conserved blocks ofgenes on chromosomes of related species; play important roles in comparative genomicsanalysis. Although a few tools have been designed to identify synteny blocks; most of themcannot handle some challenging application requirements; particularly the strandedness ofgenes; gene inversions; gene duplications; and comparison of more than two genomes. Wedeveloped a data mining tool; Ortho-Cluster; which can handle all those challenges. It ispublicly available at http://genome. sfu. ca/projects/orthocluster.

Understanding importance of collaborations in co-authorship networks: A supportiveness analysis approach,Yi Han; Bin Zhou; Jian Pei; Yan Jia,Abstract Co-authorship networks; an important type of social networks; have been studiedextensively from various angles such as degree distribution analysis; social communityextraction and social entity ranking. Most of the previous studies consider the co-authorshiprelation between two authors as a collaboration. In this paper; we introduce a novel andinteresting “supportiveness” measure on co-authorship relation. The fact that two authors co-author one paper can be regarded as one author supports the other's scientific work. Wepropose several supportiveness measures; and exploit a supportiveness-based authorranking scheme. Several efficient algorithms are developed to compute the top-n mostsupportive authors.

Rank sum method for related gene selection and its application to tumor diagnosis,Lin Deng; Jinwen Ma; Jian Pei,Abstract Tumor diagnosis by analyzing gene expression profiles becomes an interestingtopic in bioinformatics and the main problem is to identify the genes related to a tumor. Thispaper proposes a rank sum method to identify the related genes based on the rank sum testtheory in statistics. The tumor diagnosis system is constructed by the support vector machine(SVM) trained on the set of the related gene expression profiles. The experimentsdemonstrate that the constructed tumor diagnosis system with the rank sum method andSVM can reach an accuracy level of 96.2% on the colon data and 100% on the leukemiadata.,Chinese Science Bulletin,2004,35
Cleaning disguised missing data: a heuristic approach,Ming Hua; Jian Pei,Abstract In some applications such as filling in a customer information form on the web;some missing values may not be explicitly represented as such; but instead appear aspotentially valid data values. Such missing values are known as disguised missing data;which may impair the quality of data analysis severely; such as causing significant biasesand misleading results in hypothesis tests; correlation analysis and regressions. The verylimited previous studies on cleaning disguised missing data use outlier mining anddistribution anomaly detection. They highly rely on domain background knowledge inspecific applications and may not work well for the cases where the disguise values areinliers. To tackle the problem of cleaning disguised missing data; in this paper; we firstmodel the distribution of disguised missing data; and propose the embedded unbiased …,Proceedings of the 13th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2007,34
Community Preserving Network Embedding.,Xiao Wang; Peng Cui; Jing Wang; Jian Pei; Wenwu Zhu; Shiqiang Yang,Abstract Network embedding; aiming to learn the low-dimensional representations of nodesin networks; is of paramount importance in many real applications. One basic requirement ofnetwork embedding is to preserve the structure and inherent properties of the networks.While previous network embedding methods primarily preserve the microscopic structure;such as the first-and second-order proximities of nodes; the mesoscopic communitystructure; which is one of the most prominent feature of networks; is largely ignored. In thispaper; we propose a novel Modularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (M-NMF) model toincorporate the community structure into network embedding. We exploit the consensusrelationship between the representations of nodes and community structure; and then jointlyoptimize NMF based representation learning model and modularity based community …,AAAI,2017,32
Ranking uncertain sky: The probabilistic top-k skyline operator,Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Bin Jiang; Jian Pei,Abstract Many recent applications involve processing and analyzing uncertain data. In thispaper; we combine the feature of top-k objects with that of skyline to model the problem oftop-k skyline objects against uncertain data. The problem of efficiently computing top-kskyline objects on large uncertain datasets is challenging in both discrete and continuouscases. In this paper; firstly an efficient exact algorithm for computing the top-k skyline objectsis developed for discrete cases. To address applications where each object may have amassive set of instances or a continuous probability density function; we also develop anefficient randomized algorithm with an ϵ‐approximation guarantee. Moreover; ouralgorithms can be immediately extended to efficiently compute p-skyline; that is; retrievingthe uncertain objects with skyline probabilities above a given threshold.

OLAP queries have been well studied in the relationaldatabase systems. However; the evaluation of OLAP queries over XML data is not a trivialextension of the relational solutions; especially when a schema is not available. In thispaper; we introduce the IX-cube (Iceberg XML cube) over XML data to tackle the problem.We extend OLAP operations to XML data. We also develop efficient approaches to IX-Cubecomputation and OLAP query evaluation using IX-cubes.,Proceedings of the sixteenth ACM conference on Conference on information and knowledge management,2007,32
Mining probabilistic frequent spatio-temporal sequential patterns with gap constraints from uncertain databases,Yuxuan Li; James Bailey; Lars Kulik; Jian Pei,Uncertainty is common in real-world applications; for example; in sensor networks andmoving object tracking; resulting in much interest in item set mining for uncertain transactiondatabases. In this paper; we focus on pattern mining for uncertain sequences and introduceprobabilistic frequent spatial-temporal sequential patterns with gap constraints. Suchpatterns are important for the discovery of knowledge given uncertain trajectory data. Wepropose a dynamic programming approach for computing the frequentness probability ofthese patterns; which has linear time complexity; and we explore its embedding into patternenumeration algorithms using both breadth-first search and depth-first search strategies.

Online skyline analysis with dynamic preferences on nominal attributes,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Jian Pei; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang,The importance of skyline analysis has been well recognized in multi-criteria decisionmaking applications. All of the previous studies assume a fixed order on the attributes inquestion. However; in some applications; users may be interested in skylines with respect tovarious total or partial orders on nominal attributes. In this paper; we identify and tackle theproblem of online skyline analysis with dynamic preferences on nominal attributes. Weinvestigate how changes of orders in attributes lead to changes of skylines. We address twonovel types of interesting queries: a viewpoint query returns with respect to which orders apoint is (or is not) in the skylines and an order-based skyline query retrieves the skyline withrespect to a specific order.

In this paper; we identify an interesting data mining problem; finding favorablefacets; which has not been studied before. Given a set of points in a multidimensional space;for a specific target point p we want to discover with respect to which combinations of orders(eg; customer preferences) on the nominal attributes p is not dominated by any other points.Such combinations are called the favorable facets of p.

Answering aggregate keyword queries on relational databases using minimal group-bys,Bin Zhou; Jian Pei,Abstract Keyword search has been recently extended to relational databases to retrieveinformation from text-rich attributes. However; all the existing methods focus on findingindividual tuples matching a set of query keywords from one table or the join of multipletables. In this paper; we motivate a novel problem of aggregate keyword search: findingminimal group-bys covering a set of query keywords well; which is useful in manyapplications. We develop two interesting approaches to tackle the problem; and furtherextend our methods to allow partial matches. An extensive empirical evaluation using bothreal data sets and synthetic data sets is reported to verify the effectiveness of aggregatekeyword search and the efficiency of our methods.,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,28
Ranking queries on uncertain data,Ming Hua; Jian Pei; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Uncertain data is inherent in a few important applications. It is far from trivial toextend ranking queries (also known as top-k queries); a popular type of queries on certaindata; to uncertain data. In this paper; we cast ranking queries on uncertain data using threeparameters: rank threshold k; probability threshold p; and answer set size threshold l.Systematically; we identify four types of ranking queries on uncertain data. First; a probabilitythreshold top-k query computes the uncertain records taking a probability of at least p to bein the top-k list.

Ranking queries on uncertain data,Ming Hua; Jian Pei; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Uncertain data is inherent in a few important applications. It is far from trivial toextend ranking queries (also known as top-k queries); a popular type of queries on certaindata; to uncertain data. In this paper; we cast ranking queries on uncertain data using threeparameters: rank threshold k; probability threshold p; and answer set size threshold l.Systematically; we identify four types of ranking queries on uncertain data. First; a probabilitythreshold top-k query computes the uncertain records taking a probability of at least p to bein the top-k list. Second; a top-(k; l) query returns the top-l uncertain records whoseprobabilities of being ranked among top-k are the largest. Third; the p-rank of an uncertainrecord is the smallest number k such that the record takes a probability of at least p to beranked in the top-k list. A rank threshold top-k query retrieves the records whose p-ranks …,The VLDB Journal,2011,27
Continuous K-means monitoring with low reporting cost in sensor networks,Ming Hua; Man Ki Lau; Jian Pei; Kui Wu,In this paper; we study an interesting problem: continuously monitoring k-means clusteringof sensor readings in a large sensor network. Given a set of sensors whose readings evolveover time; we want to maintain the k-means of the readings continuously. The optimizationgoal is to reduce the reporting cost in the network; that is; let as few sensors as possiblereport their current readings to the data center in the course of maintenance. To tackle theproblem; we propose the reading reporting tree; a hierarchical data collection; and analysisframework. Moreover; we develop several reporting cost-effective methods using readingreporting trees in continuous k-means monitoring. First; a uniform sampling method using areading reporting tree can achieve good quality approximation of k-means. Second; wepropose a reporting threshold method which can guarantee the approximation quality …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2009,27
Mining succinct systems of minimal generators of formal concepts,Guozhu Dong; Chunyu Jiang; Jian Pei; Jinyan Li; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Formal concept analysis has become an active field of study for data analysis andknowledge discovery. A formal concept C is determined by its extent (the set of objects thatfall under C) and its intent (the set of properties or attributes covered by C). The intent for C;also called a closed itemset; is the maximum set of attributes that characterize C. Theminimal generators for C are the minimal subsets of C's intent which can similarlycharacterize C. This paper introduces the s uccinct s ystem of m inimal g enerators (SSMG)as a minimal representation of the minimal generators of all concepts; and gives an efficientalgorithm for mining SSMGs. The SSMGs are useful for revealing the equivalencerelationship among the minimal generators; which may be important for medical and otherscientific discovery; and for revealing the extent-based semantic equivalence among …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2005,27

Towards scalable and accurate online feature selection for big data,Kui Yu; Xindong Wu; Wei Ding; Jian Pei,Feature selection is important in many big data applications. There are at least two criticalchallenges. Firstly; in many applications; the dimensionality is extremely high; in millions;and keeps growing. Secondly; feature selection has to be highly scalable; preferably in anonline manner such that each feature can be processed in a sequential scan. In this paper;we develop SAOLA; a Scalable and Accurate On Line Approach for feature selection. With atheoretical analysis on a low bound on the pair wise correlations between features in thecurrently selected feature subset; SAOLA employs novel online pair wise comparisontechniques to address the two challenges and maintain a parsimonious model over time inan online manner. An empirical study using a series of benchmark real data sets shows thatSAOLA is scalable on data sets of extremely high dimensionality; and has superior …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2014 IEEE International Conference on,2014,26
Probabilistic skylines on uncertain data: model and bounding-pruning-refining methods,Bin Jiang; Jian Pei; Xuemin Lin; Yidong Yuan,Abstract Uncertain data are inherent in some important applications. Although aconsiderable amount of research has been dedicated to modeling uncertain data andanswering some types of queries on uncertain data; how to conduct advanced analysis onuncertain data remains an open problem at large. In this paper; we tackle the problem ofskyline analysis on uncertain data. We propose a novel probabilistic skyline model where anuncertain object may take a probability to be in the skyline; and ap-skyline contains allobjects whose skyline probabilities are at least p (0< p≤ 1). Computing probabilisticskylines on large uncertain data sets is challenging. We develop a bounding-pruning-refining framework and three algorithms systematically.

OrthoClusterDB: an online platform for synteny blocks,Man-Ping Ng; Ismael A Vergara; Christian Frech; Qingkang Chen; Xinghuo Zeng; Jian Pei; Nansheng Chen,The recent availability of an expanding collection of genome sequences driven bytechnological advances has facilitated comparative genomics and in particular theidentification of synteny among multiple genomes. However; the development of effectiveand easy-to-use methods for identifying such conserved gene clusters among multiplegenomes–synteny blocks–as well as databases; which host synteny blocks from variousgroups of species (especially eukaryotes) and also allow users to run synteny-identificationprograms; lags behind. OrthoClusterDB is a new online platform for the identification andvisualization of synteny blocks. OrthoClusterDB consists of two key web pages: RunOrthoCluster and View Synteny. The Run OrthoCluster page serves as web front-end toOrthoCluster; a recently developed program for synteny block detection. Run …,BMC bioinformatics,2009,26
Fast and quality-guaranteed data streaming in resource-constrained sensor networks,Emad Soroush; Kui Wu; Jian Pei,Abstract In many emerging applications; data streams are monitored in a networkenvironment. Due to limited communication bandwidth and other resource constraints; acritical and practical demand is to online compress data streams continuously with qualityguarantee. Although many data compression and digital signal processing methods havebeen developed to reduce data volume; their super-linear time and more-than-constantspace complexity prevents them from being applied directly on data streams; particularlyover resource-constrained sensor networks. In this paper; we tackle the problem of onlinequality guaranteed compression of data streams using fast linear approximation (ie; usingline segments to approximate a time series). Technically; we address two versions of theproblem which explore quality guarantees in different forms. We develop online …,Proceedings of the 9th ACM international symposium on Mobile ad hoc networking and computing,2008,26
An effective approach to entity resolution problem using quasi-clique and its application to digital libraries,Byung-Won On; Ergin Elmacioglu; Dongwon Lee; Jaewoo Kang; Jian Pei,Abstract We study how to resolve entities that contain a group of related elements in them(eg; an author entity with a list of citations or an intermediate result by GROUP BY SQLquery). Such entities; named as grouped-entities; frequently occur in many applications. Byexploiting contextual information mined from the group of elements per entity in addition tosyntactic similarity; we show that our approach; Quasi-Clique; improves precision and recallunto 91% when used together with a variety of existing entity resolution solutions; but neverworsens them.,Proceedings of the 6th ACM/IEEE-CS joint conference on Digital libraries,2006,26

On compressing weighted time-evolving graphs,Wei Liu; Andrey Kan; Jeffrey Chan; James Bailey; Christopher Leckie; Jian Pei; Ramamohanarao Kotagiri,Abstract Existing graph compression techniquesmostly focus on static graphs. However formany practical graphs such as social networks the edge weights frequently change overtime. This phenomenon raises the question of how to compress dynamic graphs whilemaintaining most of their intrinsic structural patterns at each time snapshot. In this paper weshow that the encoding cost of a dynamic graph is proportional to the heterogeneity of athree dimensional tensor that represents the dynamic graph. We propose an effectivealgorithm that compresses a dynamic graph by reducing the heterogeneity of its tensorrepresentation; and at the same time also maintains a maximum lossy compression error atany time stamp of the dynamic graph. The bounded compression error benefits compressedgraphs in that they retain good approximations of the original edge weights; and hence …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,25
Outlier detection on uncertain data: Objects; instances; and inferences,Bin Jiang; Jian Pei,This paper studies the problem of outlier detection on uncertain data. We start with acomprehensive model considering both uncertain objects and their instances. An uncertainobject has some inherent attributes and consists of a set of instances which are modeled bya probability density distribution. We detect outliers at both the instance level and the objectlevel. To detect outlier instances; it is a prerequisite to know normal instances. By assumingthat uncertain objects with similar properties tend to have similar instances; we learn thenormal instances for each uncertain object using the instances of objects with similarproperties. Consequently; outlier instances can be detected by comparing against normalones. Furthermore; we can detect outlier objects most of whose instances are outliers.Technically; we use a Bayesian inference algorithm to solve the problem; and develop an …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,25
An interactive approach to mining gene expression data,Daxin Jiang; Jian Pei; Aidong Zhang,Effective identification of coexpressed genes and coherent patterns in gene expression datais an important task in bioinformatics research and biomedical applications. Severalclustering methods have recently been proposed to identify coexpressed genes that sharesimilar coherent patterns. However; there is no objective standard for groups of coexpressedgenes. The interpretation of co-expression heavily depends on domain knowledge.Furthermore; groups of coexpressed genes in gene expression data are often highlyconnected through a large number of" intermediate" genes. There may be no clearboundaries to separate clusters. Clustering gene expression data also faces the challengesof satisfying biological domain requirements and addressing the high connectivity of thedata sets. In this paper; we propose an interactive framework for exploring coherent …,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and Data Engineering,2005,25
PADS: a simple yet effective pattern-aware dynamic search method for fast maximal frequent pattern mining,Xinghuo Zeng; Jian Pei; Ke Wang; Jinyan Li,Abstract While frequent pattern mining is fundamental for many data mining tasks; miningmaximal frequent patterns efficiently is important in both theory and applications of frequentpattern mining. The fundamental challenge is how to search a large space of itemcombinations. Most of the existing methods search an enumeration tree of itemcombinations in a depth-first manner. In this paper; we develop a new technique for moreefficient max-pattern mining. Our method is pattern-aware: it uses the patterns already foundto schedule its future search so that many search subspaces can be pruned. We presentefficient techniques to implement the new approach. As indicated by a systematic empiricalstudy using the benchmark data sets; our new approach outperforms the currently fastestmax-pattern mining algorithms FPMax* and LCM2 clearly.

Anonymization-based attacks in privacy-preserving data publishing,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang; Jian Pei,Abstract Data publishing generates much concern over the protection of individual privacy.Recent studies consider cases where the adversary may possess different kinds ofknowledge about the data. In this article; we show that knowledge of the mechanism oralgorithm of anonymization for data publication can also lead to extra information that assiststhe adversary and jeopardizes individual privacy. In particular; all known mechanisms try tominimize information loss and such an attempt provides a loophole for attacks. We call suchan attack a minimality attack. In this article; we introduce a model called m-confidentialitywhich deals with minimality attacks; and propose a feasible solution. Our experiments showthat minimality attacks are practical concerns on real datasets and that our algorithm canprevent such attacks with very little overhead and information loss.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2009,24
Top-k typicality queries and efficient query answering methods on large databases,Ming Hua; Jian Pei; Ada WC Fu; Xuemin Lin; Ho-Fung Leung,Abstract Finding typical instances is an effective approach to understand and analyze largedata sets. In this paper; we apply the idea of typicality analysis from psychology andcognitive science to database query answering; and study the novel problem of answeringtop-k typicality queries. We model typicality in large data sets systematically. Three types oftop-k typicality queries are formulated. To answer questions like “Who are the top-k mosttypical NBA players?”; the measure of simple typicality is developed. To answer questionslike “Who are the top-k most typical guards distinguishing guards from other players?”; thenotion of discriminative typicality is proposed. Moreover; to answer questions like “Who arethe best k typical guards in whole representing different types of guards?”; the notion ofrepresentative typicality is used.

On pruning for top-k ranking in uncertain databases,Chonghai Wang; Li Yan Yuan; Jia-Huai You; Osmar R Zaiane; Jian Pei,Abstract Top-k ranking for an uncertain database is to rank tuples in it so that the best k ofthem can be determined. The problem has been formalized under the unified approachbased on parameterized ranking functions (PRFs) and the possible world semantics. Givena PRF; one can always compute the ranking function values of all the tuples to determine thetop-k tuples; which is a formidable task for large databases. In this paper; we present ageneral approach to pruning for the framework based on PRFs. We show a mathematicalmanipulation of possible worlds which reveals key insights in the part of computation thatmay be pruned and how to achieve it in a systematic fashion. This leads to concrete pruningmethods for a wide range of ranking functions. We show experimentally the effectiveness ofour approach.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,23
Debt detection in social security by sequence classification using both positive and negative patterns,Yanchang Zhao; Huaifeng Zhang; Shanshan Wu; Jian Pei; Longbing Cao; Chengqi Zhang; Hans Bohlscheid,Abstract Debt detection is important for improving payment accuracy in social security. Sincedebt detection from customer transactional data can be generally modelled as a frauddetection problem; a straightforward solution is to extract features from transactionsequences and build a sequence classifier for debts. The existing sequence classificationmethods based on sequential patterns consider only positive patterns. However; accordingto our experience in a large social security application; negative patterns are very useful inaccurate debt detection. In this paper; we present a successful case study of debt detectionin a large social security application.

Towards interactive exploration of gene expression patterns,Daxin Jiang; Jian Pei; Aidong Zhang,Abstract Analyzing coherent gene expression patterns is an important task in bioinformaticsresearch and biomedical applications. Recently; various clustering methods have beenadapted or proposed to identify clusters of co-expressed genes and recognize coherentexpression patterns as the centroids of the clusters. However; the interpretation of co-expressed genes and coherent patterns mainly depends on the domain knowledge; whichpresents several challenges for coherent pattern mining and cannot be solved by mostexisting clustering approaches. In this paper; we introduce an interactive exploration systemGeneX (Gene eXplorer) for mining coherent expression patterns.

Finding email correspondents in online social networks,Yi Cui; Jian Pei; Guanting Tang; Wo-Shun Luk; Daxin Jiang; Ming Hua,Abstract Email correspondents play an important role in many people's social networks.Finding email correspondents in social networks accurately; though may seem to bestraightforward at a first glance; is challenging. Most of the existing online social networkingsites recommend possible matches by comparing the information of email accounts andsocial network profiles; such as display names and email addresses. However; as shownempirically in this paper; such methods may not be effective in practice. To the best of ourknowledge; this problem has not been carefully and thoroughly addressed in research. Inthis paper; we systematically investigate the problem and develop a practical data miningapproach. We find that using only the profiles or the graph structures is far from effective.

For enterprises; the main challenge is to satisfy twocompeting goals: releasing network data for useful data analysis and also preserving theidentities or sensitive relationships of the individuals participating in the network.

News article extraction with template-independent wrapper,Junfeng Wang; Xiaofei He; Can Wang; Jian Pei; Jiajun Bu; Chun Chen; Ziyu Guan; Gang Lu,Abstract We consider the problem of template-independent news extraction. The state-of-the-art news extraction method is based on template-level wrapper induction; which has twoserious limitations. 1) It cannot correctly extract pages belonging to an unseen template untilthe wrapper for that template has been generated. 2) It is costly to maintain up-to-datewrappers for hundreds of websites; because any change of a template may lead to theinvalidation of the corresponding wrapper. In this paper we formalize news extraction as amachine learning problem and learn a template-independent wrapper using a very smallnumber of labeled news pages from a single site. Novel features dedicated to news titlesand bodies are developed respectively. Correlations between the news title and the newsbody are exploited. Our template-independent wrapper can extract news pages from …,Proceedings of the 18th international conference on World wide web,2009,21
Online analytical processing stream data: Is it feasible?,Yixin Chen; Guozhu Dong; Jiawei Han; Jian Pei; Benjamin W Wah; Jianyong Wang,ABSTRACT Real-time surveillance systems and other dynamic environments often generatetremendous (potentially infinite) volume of stream data: the volume is too huge to bescanned multiple times. However; much of such data resides at rather low level ofabstraction; whereas most analysts are interested in dynamic changes (such as trends andoutliers) at relatively high levels of abstraction. To discover such high level characteristics;one may need to perform on-line multi-level analysis of stream data; similar to OLAP (on-lineanalytical processing) of relational or data warehouse data. With limited storage space andthe demand for fast response; is it realistic to promote on-line; multi-dimensional analysisand mining of stream data to alert people about dramatic changes of situations at multiple-levels of abstraction? In this paper; we present an architecture; called stream cube; which …,DMKD,2002,21
Finding pareto optimal groups: group-based skyline,Jinfei Liu; Li Xiong; Jian Pei; Jun Luo; Haoyu Zhang,Abstract Skyline computation; aiming at identifying a set of skyline points that are notdominated by any other point; is particularly useful for multi-criteria data analysis anddecision making. Traditional skyline computation; however; is inadequate to answer queriesthat need to analyze not only individual points but also groups of points. To address this gap;we generalize the original skyline definition to the novel group-based skyline (G-Skyline);which represents Pareto optimal groups that are not dominated by other groups. In order tocompute G-Skyline groups consisting of k points efficiently; we present a novel structure thatrepresents the points in a directed skyline graph and captures the dominance relationshipsamong the points based on the first k skyline layers. We propose efficient algorithms tocompute the first k skyline layers. We then present two heuristic algorithms to efficiently …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,20

We introduce a rigorous and efficientapproach to mine statistically significant; unexpected patterns in sequences of item sets. Theproposed methodology is based on a null model for sequences and on a multiple testingprocedure to extract patterns of interest.

Answering ad hoc aggregate queries from data streams using prefix aggregate trees,Moonjung Cho; Jian Pei; Ke Wang,Abstract In some business applications such as trading management in financial institutions;it is required to accurately answer ad hoc aggregate queries over data streams.Materializing and incrementally maintaining a full data cube or even its compression orapproximation over a data stream is often computationally prohibitive. On the other hand;although previous studies proposed approximate methods for continuous aggregatequeries; they cannot provide accurate answers. In this paper; we develop a novel prefixaggregate tree (PAT) structure for online warehousing data streams and answering ad hocaggregate queries. Often; a data stream can be partitioned into the historical segment; whichis stored in a traditional data warehouse; and the transient segment; which can be stored ina PAT to answer ad hoc aggregate queries.

Mining most frequently changing component in evolving graphs,Yajun Yang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hong Gao; Jian Pei; Jianzhong Li,Abstract Many applications see huge demands of finding important changing areas inevolving graphs. In this paper; given a series of snapshots of an evolving graph; we modeland develop algorithms to capture the most frequently changing component (MFCC).Motivated by the intuition that the MFCC should capture the densest area of changes in anevolving graph; we propose a simple yet effective model. Using only one parameter; userscan control tradeoffs between the “density” of the changes and the size of the detected area.We verify the effectiveness and the efficiency of our approach on real data setssystematically.,World Wide Web,2014,19

Malicious URL detection by dynamically mining patterns without pre-defined elements,Da Huang; Kai Xu; Jian Pei,Abstract Detecting malicious URLs is an essential task in network security intelligence. Inthis paper; we make two new contributions beyond the state-of-the-art methods on maliciousURL detection. First; instead of using any pre-defined features or fixed delimiters for featureselection; we propose to dynamically extract lexical patterns from URLs. Our novel model ofURL patterns provides new flexibility and capability on capturing malicious URLsalgorithmically generated by malicious programs. Second; we develop a new method tomine our novel URL patterns; which are not assembled using any pre-defined items andthus cannot be mined using any existing frequent pattern mining methods.

On shortest unique substring queries,Jian Pei; Wush Chi-Hsuan Wu; Mi-Yen Yeh,In this paper; we tackle a novel type of interesting queries-shortest unique substring queries.Given a (long) string S and a query point q in the string; can we find a shortest substringcontaining q that is unique in S? We illustrate that shortest unique substring queries havemany potential applications; such as information retrieval; bioinformatics; and event contextanalysis. We develop efficient algorithms for online query answering. First; we present analgorithm to answer a shortest unique substring query in O (n) time using a suffix tree index;where n is the length of string S. Second; we show that; using O (n· h) time and O (n) space;we can compute a shortest unique substring for every position in a given string; where h isvariable theoretically in O (n) but on real data sets often much smaller than n and can betreated as a constant.

There are three general tasks. Two of those tasks concern wholesequences and will be presented here. The third topic; namely sequence motifs(site/position-based identification and characterization of sequence families); will bepresented in Chapter 4. The existence of a third task is due to the facts that (a) positionsinside sequences are important; a factor which is not present for non-sequence data; and (b)succinct characterizations of sequence families are desired for identifying future members ofthe families.• Section 3.2 discusses sequence features; concerning various feature typesand general feature selection criteria.

A data-adaptive and dynamic segmentation index for whole matching on time series,Yang Wang; Peng Wang; Jian Pei; Wei Wang; Sheng Huang,Abstract Similarity search on time series is an essential operation in many applications. Inthe state-of-the-art methods; such as the R-tree based methods; SAX and iSAX; time seriesare by default divided into equi-length segments globally; that is; all time series aresegmented in the same way. Those methods then focus on how to approximate or symbolizethe segments and construct indexes. In this paper; we make an important observation:global segmentation of all time series may incur unnecessary cost in space and time forindexing time series. We develop DSTree; a data adaptive and dynamic segmentation indexon time series. In addition to savings in space and time; our new index can provide tightupper and lower bounds on distances between time series.

Publishing anonymous survey rating data,Xiaoxun Sun; Hua Wang; Jiuyong Li; Jian Pei,Abstract We study the challenges of protecting privacy of individuals in the large publicsurvey rating data in this paper. Recent study shows that personal information in supposedlyanonymous movie rating records are de-identified. The survey rating data usually containsboth ratings of sensitive and non-sensitive issues. The ratings of sensitive issues involvepersonal privacy. Even though the survey participants do not reveal any of their ratings; theirsurvey records are potentially identifiable by using information from other public sources.None of the existing anonymisation principles (eg; k-anonymity; l-diversity; etc.) caneffectively prevent such breaches in large survey rating data sets. We tackle the problem bydefining a principle called (k; ϵ)-anonymity model to protect privacy.

Online visual analytics of text streams,Shixia Liu; Jialun Yin; Xiting Wang; Weiwei Cui; Kelei Cao; Jian Pei,We present an online visual analytics approach to helping users explore and understandhierarchical topic evolution in high-volume text streams. The key idea behind this approachis to identify representative topics in incoming documents and align them with the existingrepresentative topics that they immediately follow (in time). To this end; we learn a set ofstreaming tree cuts from topic trees based on user-selected focus nodes. A dynamicBayesian network model has been developed to derive the tree cuts in the incoming topictrees to balance the fitness of each tree cut and the smoothness between adjacent tree cuts.By connecting the corresponding topics at different times; we are able to provide anoverview of the evolving hierarchical topics.

In other words; similar objects must have closevalues in at least a set of dimensions. In this paper; we explore a more general type ofsimilarity. Under the pCluster model we proposed; two objects are similar if they exhibit acoherent pattern on a subset of dimensions. The new similarity concept models a widerange of applications. For instance; in DNA microarray analysis; the expression levels of twogenes may rise and fall synchronously in response to a set of environmental stimuli.Although the magnitude of their expression levels may not be close; the patterns they …,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2008,16
Using high dimensional indexes to support relevance feedback based interactive images retrieval,Junqi Zhang; Xiangdong Zhou; Wei Wang; Baile Shi; Jian Pei,Abstract Image retrieval has found more and more applications. Due to the well recognizedsemantic gap problem; the accuracy and the recall of image similarity search are often stilllow. As an effective method to improve the quality of image retrieval; the relevance feedbackapproach actively applies users' feedback to refine the search. As searching a large imagedatabase is often costly; to improve the efficiency; high dimensional indexes may help.However; many existing database indexes are not adaptive to updates of distance measurescaused by users' feedback. In this paper; we propose a demo to illustrate the relevancefeedback based interactive images retrieval procedure; and examine the effectiveness andthe efficiency of various indexes. Particularly; audience can interactively investigate theeffect of updated distance measures on the data space where the images are supposed …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,16
Reliable early classification on multivariate time series with numerical and categorical attributes,Yu-Feng Lin; Hsuan-Hsu Chen; Vincent S Tseng; Jian Pei,Abstract Early classification on multivariate time series has recently emerged as a novel andimportant topic in data mining fields with wide applications such as early detection ofdiseases in healthcare domains. Most of the existing studies on this topic focused only onunivariate time series; while some very recent works exploring multivariate time seriesconsidered only numerical attributes and are not applicable to multivariate time seriescontaining both of numerical and categorical attributes. In this paper; we present a novelmethodology named REACT (Reliable EArly ClassificaTion); which is the first workaddressing the issue of constructing an effective classifier on multivariate time series withnumerical and categorical attributes in serial manner so as to guarantee stability of accuracycompared to the classifiers using full-length time series. Furthermore; we also employ the …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2015,15
Mining multidimensional contextual outliers from categorical relational data,Guanting Tang; Jian Pei; James Bailey; Guozhu Dong,Abstract A wide range of methods have been proposed for detecting different types ofoutliers in both the full attribute space and its subspaces.

Continuously monitoring top-k uncertain data streams: a probabilistic threshold method,Ming Hua; Jian Pei,Abstract Recently; uncertain data processing has become more and more important.Although a significant amount of previous research explores various continuous queries ondata streams; continuous queries on uncertain data streams have seldom been investigated.In this paper; we formulate a novel and challenging problem of continuously monitoring top-k uncertain data streams; and propose a probabilistic threshold method. We develop fouralgorithms systematically: a deterministic exact algorithm; a randomized method; and theirspace-efficient versions using quantile summaries. An extensive empirical study using realdata sets and synthetic data sets is reported to verify the effectiveness and the efficiency ofour methods.,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2009,15

However; very few data miningresearchers have a chance to see a working data mining system on real mobilecommunication data. In this demo; we showcase our new system MobileMiner on a realmobile communication data set; which presents a case study of business solutions usingstate-of-the-art data mining techniques. MobileMiner adaptively profiles users' behavior fromtheir calling and moving record streams. Customer segmentation and social communityanalysis can be conducted based on user profiles. We show how data mining techniquescan help in mobile communication data analysis.

Closed constrained gradient mining in retail databases,Jianyong Wang; Jiawei Han; Jian Pei,Incorporating constraints into frequent itemset mining not only improves data miningefficiency; but also leads to concise and meaningful results. In this paper; a framework forclosed constrained gradient itemset mining in retail databases is proposed by introducingthe concept of gradient constraint into closed itemset mining. A tailored version of CLOSET+;LCLOSET; is first briefly introduced; which is designed for efficient closed itemset miningfrom sparse databases. Then; a newly proposed weaker but antimonotone measure; top-Xaverage measure; is proposed and can be adopted to prune search space effectively.Experiments show that a combination of LCLOSET and the top-X average pruning providesan efficient approach to mining frequent closed gradient itemsets,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2006,15

Mining outlying aspects on numeric data,Lei Duan; Guanting Tang; Jian Pei; James Bailey; Akiko Campbell; Changjie Tang,Abstract When we are investigating an object in a data set; which itself may or may not be anoutlier; can we identify unusual (ie; outlying) aspects of the object? In this paper; we identifythe novel problem of mining outlying aspects on numeric data. Given a query object oo in amultidimensional numeric data set OO; in which subspace is oo most outlying? Technically;we use the rank of the probability density of an object in a subspace to measure theoutlyingness of the object in the subspace. A minimal subspace where the query object isranked the best is an outlying aspect. Computing the outlying aspects of a query object is farfrom trivial. A naïve method has to calculate the probability densities of all objects and rankthem in every subspace; which is very costly when the dimensionality is high.

Consensus-based ranking of multivalued objects: A generalized borda count approach,Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Jian Pei; Xuemin Lin; Qianlu Lin; Aiping Li,In this paper; we tackle a novel problem of ranking multivalued objects; where an object hasmultiple instances in a multidimensional space; and the number of instances per object isnot fixed. Given an ad hoc scoring function that assigns a score to a multidimensionalinstance; we want to rank a set of multivalued objects. Different from the existing models ofranking uncertain and probabilistic data; which model an object as a random variable andthe instances of an object are assumed exclusive; we have to capture the coexistence ofinstances here. To tackle the problem; we advocate the semantics of favoring widelypreferred objects instead of majority votes; which is widely used in many elections andcompetitions. Technically; we borrow the idea from Borda Count (BC); a well-recognizedmethod in consensus-based voting systems. However; Borda Count cannot handle …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,14
Correlation hiding by independence masking,Yufei Tao; Jian Pei; Jiexing Li; Xiaokui Xiao; Ke Yi; Zhengzheng Xing,Extracting useful correlation from a dataset has been extensively studied. In this paper; wedeal with the opposite; namely; a problem we call correlation hiding (CH); which isfundamental in numerous applications that need to disseminate data containing sensitiveinformation. In this problem; we are given a relational table T whose attributes can beclassified into three disjoint sets A; B; and C. The objective is to distort some values in T sothat A becomes independent from B; and yet; their correlation with C is preserved as muchas possible. CH is different from all the problems studied previously in the area of dataprivacy; in that CH demands complete elimination of the correlation between two sets ofattributes; whereas the previous research focuses on partial elimination up to a certain level.A new operator called independence masking is proposed to solve the CH problem …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,14
Olap on search logs: an infrastructure supporting data-driven applications in search engines,Bin Zhou; Daxin Jiang; Jian Pei; Hang Li,Abstract Search logs; which contain rich and up-to-date information about users' needs andpreferences; have become a critical data source for search engines. Recently; more andmore data-driven applications are being developed in search engines based on searchlogs; such as query suggestion; keyword bidding; and dissatisfactory query analysis. In thispaper; by observing that many data-driven applications in search engines highly rely ononline mining of search logs; we develop an OLAP system on search logs which serves asan infrastructure supporting various data-driven applications.

A survey of utility-based privacy-preserving data transformation methods,Ming Hua; Jian Pei,As a serious concern in data publishing and analysis; privacy preserving data processinghas received a lot of attention. Privacy preservation often leads to information loss.Consequently; we want to minimize utility loss as long as the privacy is preserved. In thischapter; we survey the utility-based privacy preservation methods systematically. We firstbriefly discuss the privacy models and utility measures; and then review four recentlyproposed methods for utilitybased privacy preservation. We first introduce the utility-basedanonymization method for maximizing the quality of the anonymized data in queryanswering and discernability. Then we introduce the top-down specialization (TDS) methodand the progressive disclosure algorithm (PDA) for privacy preservation in classificationproblems.

-Efficacious Data Cube Exploration by Semantic Summarization and Compression,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Jian Pei; Yan Zhao,This chapter discusses the efficacious data cube exploration by semantic summarizationand compression. Data cube is the core operator in data warehousing and online analyticalprocessing (OLAP). Its efficient computation; maintenance; and utilization for queryanswering and advanced analysis have been the subjects of numerous studies. Datawarehouses form the essential infrastructure for many data analysis tasks. A datawarehouse is a subject-oriented; integrated; time-variant; and non-volatile collection of datain support of managemental decision-making processes.

Cleaning structured event logs: A graph repair approach,Jianmin Wang; Shaoxu Song; Xuemin Lin; Xiaochen Zhu; Jian Pei,Event data are often dirty owing to various recording conventions or simply system errors.These errors may cause many serious damages to real applications; such as inaccurateprovenance answers; poor profiling results or concealing interesting patterns from eventdata. Cleaning dirty event data is strongly demanded. While existing event data cleaningtechniques view event logs as sequences; structural information do exist among events. Weargue that such structural information enhances not only the accuracy of repairinginconsistent events but also the computation efficiency. It is notable that both the structureand the names (labeling) of events could be inconsistent. In real applications; whileunsound structure is not repaired automatically (which needs manual effort from businessactors to handle the structure error); it is highly desirable to repair the inconsistent event …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,13
An iterative fusion approach to graph-based semi-supervised learning from multiple views,Yang Wang; Jian Pei; Xuemin Lin; Qing Zhang; Wenjie Zhang,Abstract Often; a data object described by many features can be naturally decomposed intomultiple “views”; where each view consists of a subset of features. For example; a video clipmay have a video view and an audio view. Given a set of training data objects with multipleviews; where some objects are labeled and the others are not; semi-supervised learningwith graphs from multi-views tries to learn a classifier by treating each view as a similaritygraph on all objects; where edges are defined by the similarity on object pairs based on theview attributes. Labels and label relevance ranking scores of labeled objects can bepropagated from labeled objects to unlabeled objects on the similarity graphs so that similarobjects receive similar labels.

A random method for quantifying changing distributions in data streams,Haixun Wang; Jian Pei,Abstract In applications such as fraud and intrusion detection; it is of great interest tomeasure the evolving trends in the data. We consider the problem of quantifying changesbetween two datasets with class labels. Traditionally; changes are often measured by firstestimating the probability distributions of the given data; and then computing the distance;for instance; the KL divergence; between the estimated distributions. However; thisapproach is computationally infeasible for large; high dimensional datasets. The problembecomes more challenging in the streaming data environment; as the high speed makes itdifficult for the learning process to keep up with the concept drifts in the data. To tackle thisproblem; we propose a method to quantify concept drifts using a universal model that incursminimal learning cost. In addition; our model also provides the ability of performing …,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2005,13

Shortest unique queries on strings,Xiaocheng Hu; Jian Pei; Yufei Tao,Abstract Let D be a long input string of n characters (from an alphabet of size up to 2 w;where w is the number of bits in a machine word). Given a substring q of D; a shortestunique query returns a shortest unique substring of D that contains q. We present an optimalstructure that consumes O (n) space; can be built in O (n) time; and answers a query in O (1)time. We also extend our techniques to solve several variants of the problem optimally.,International Symposium on String Processing and Information Retrieval,2014,12
Towards bounding sequential patterns,Chedy Raïssi; Jian Pei,Abstract Given a sequence database; can we have a non-trivial upper bound on the numberof sequential patterns? The problem of bounding sequential patterns is very challenging intheory due to the combinatorial complexity of sequences; even given some inspiring resultson bounding itemsets in frequent itemset mining. Moreover; the problem is highlymeaningful in practice; since the upper bound can be used in many applications such asspace allocation in building sequence data warehouses. In this paper; we tackle theproblem of bounding sequential patterns by presenting; for the first time in the field ofsequential pattern mining; strong combinatorial results on computing the number of possiblesequential patterns that can be generated at a given length k. We introduce; as a case study;two novel techniques to estimate the number of candidate sequences.

Multidimensional mining of large-scale search logs: a topic-concept cube approach,Dongyeop Kang; Daxin Jiang; Jian Pei; Zhen Liao; Xiaohui Sun; Ho-Jin Choi,Abstract In addition to search queries and the corresponding clickthrough information;search engine logs record multidimensional information about user search activities; suchas search time; location; vertical; and search device. Multidimensional mining of search logscan provide novel insights and useful knowledge for both search engine users anddevelopers. In this paper; we describe our topic-concept cube project; which addresses thebusiness need of supporting multidimensional mining of search logs effectively andefficiently. We answer two challenges. First; search queries and click-through data are wellrecognized sparse; and thus have to be aggregated properly for effective analysis. Second;there is often a gap between the topic hierarchies in multidimensional aggregate analysisand queries in search logs. To address those challenges; we develop a novel topic …,Proceedings of the fourth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2011,12
Mining gene–sample–time microarray data: a coherent gene cluster discovery approach,Daxin Jiang; Jian Pei; Murali Ramanathan; Chuan Lin; Chun Tang; Aidong Zhang,Abstract Extensive studies have shown that mining microarray data sets is important inbioinformatics research and biomedical applications. In this paper; we explore a novel typeof gene–sample–time microarray data sets that records the expression levels of variousgenes under a set of samples during a series of time points. In particular; we propose themining of coherent gene clusters from such data sets. Each cluster contains a subset ofgenes and a subset of samples such that the genes are coherent on the samples along thetime series. The coherent gene clusters may identify the samples corresponding to somephenotypes (eg; diseases); and suggest the candidate genes correlated to the phenotypes.We present two efficient algorithms; namely the Sample-Gene Search and the Gene–Sample Search; to mine the complete set of coherent gene clusters.

Mining changing regions from access-constrained snapshots: a cluster-embedded decision tree approach,Irene Pekerskaya; Jian Pei; Ke Wang,Abstract Change detection on spatial data is important in many applications; such asenvironmental monitoring. Given a set of snapshots of spatial objects at various temporalinstants; a user may want to derive the changing regions between any two snapshots. Mostof the existing methods have to use at least one of the original data sets to detect changingregions. However; in some important applications; due to data access constraints such asprivacy concerns and limited data online availability; original data may not be available forchange analysis. In this paper; we tackle the problem by proposing a simple yet effectivemodel-based approach. In the model construction phase; data snapshots are summarizedusing the novel cluster-embedded decision trees as concise models. Once the models arebuilt; the original data snapshots will not be accessed anymore. In the change detection …,Journal of Intelligent Information Systems,2006,12
Alid: scalable dominant cluster detection,Lingyang Chu; Shuhui Wang; Siyuan Liu; Qingming Huang; Jian Pei,Abstract Detecting dominant clusters is important in many analytic applications. The state-of-the-art methods find dense subgraphs on the affinity graph as dominant clusters. However;the time and space complexities of those methods are dominated by the construction ofaffinity graph; which is quadratic with respect to the number of data points; and thus areimpractical on large data sets. To tackle the challenge; in this paper; we apply EvolutionaryGame Theory (EGT) and develop a scalable algorithm; Approximate Localized InfectionImmunization Dynamics (ALID). The major idea is to perform Localized InfectionImmunization Dynamics (LID) to find dense subgraphs within local ranges of the affinitygraph. LID is further scaled up with guaranteed high efficiency and detection quality by anestimated Region of Interest (ROI) and a Candidate Infective Vertex Search method (CIVS …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,11
Distance metric learning using dropout: a structured regularization approach,Qi Qian; Juhua Hu; Rong Jin; Jian Pei; Shenghuo Zhu,Abstract Distance metric learning (DML) aims to learn a distance metric better thanEuclidean distance. It has been successfully applied to various tasks; eg; classification;clustering and information retrieval. Many DML algorithms suffer from the over-fittingproblem because of a large number of parameters to be determined in DML. In this paper;we exploit the dropout technique; which has been successfully applied in deep learning toalleviate the over-fitting problem; for DML. Different from the previous studies that only applydropout to training data; we apply dropout to both the learned metrics and the training data.We illustrate that application of dropout to DML is essentially equivalent to matrix normbased regularization. Compared with the standard regularization scheme in DML; dropout isadvantageous in simulating the structured regularizers which have shown consistently …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2014,11
Clustering in applications with multiple data sources—a mutual subspace clustering approach,Ming Hua; Jian Pei,Abstract In many applications; such as bioinformatics and cross-market customerrelationship management; there are data from multiple sources jointly describing the sameset of objects. An important data mining task is to find interesting groups of objects that formclusters in subspaces of the data sources jointly supported by those data sources. In thispaper; we study a novel problem of mining mutual subspace clusters from multiple sources.We develop two interesting models and the corresponding methods for mutual subspaceclustering. The density-based model identifies dense regions in subspaces as clusters. Thebottom-up method searches for density-based mutual subspace clusters systematically fromlow-dimensional subspaces to high-dimensional ones.

In this paper; we motivate a novel problem of aggregate keyword search: findingminimal group-bys covering a set of query keywords well; which is useful in manyapplications. We develop two interesting approaches to tackle the problem. We furtherextend our methods to allow partial matches and matches using a keyword ontology. Anextensive empirical evaluation using both real data sets and synthetic data sets is reportedto verify the effectiveness of aggregate keyword search and the efficiency of our methods.,Knowledge and information systems,2012,11

Exploring disease association from the NHANES data: Data mining; pattern summarization; and visual analytics,Zhengzheng Xing; Jian Pei,Abstract Finding associations among different diseases is an important task in medical datamining. The NHANES data is a valuable source in exploring disease associations. However;existing studies analyzing the NHANES data focus on using statistical techniques to test asmall number of hypotheses. This NHANES data has not been systematically explored formining disease association patterns. In this regard; this paper proposes a direct diseasepattern mining method and an interactive disease pattern mining method to explore theNHANES data. The results on the latest NHANES data demonstrate that these methods canmine meaningful disease associations consistent with the existing knowledge andliteratures.

Although there are many in-depth studies on efficient frequent pattern miningalgorithms and constraint pushing techniques; the effectiveness of frequent pattern miningremains a serious concern: It is non-trivial and often tricky to specify appropriate supportthresholds and proper constraints.

We identify the problem of preference-based frequentpattern mining and formulate the preferences for mining. We develop an efficient frameworkto mine frequent patterns with preferences.

In this paper; we propose a new classification method for streaming networks;namely streaming network node classification (SNOC). For streaming networks; theessential challenge is to properly capture the dynamic changes of the node content andnode interactions to support node classification. While streaming networks are dynamicallyevolving; for a short temporal period; a subset of salient features are essentially tied to thenetwork content and structures; and therefore can be used to characterize the network forclassification. To achieve this goal; we propose to carry out streaming network feature …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2014 IEEE International Conference on,2014,8
Towards Cohesive Anomaly Mining.,Yun Xiong; Yangyong Zhu; S Yu Philip; Jian Pei,Abstract In some applications; such as bioinformatics; social network analysis; andcomputational criminology; it is desirable to find compact clusters formed by a (very) smallportion of objects in a large data set. Since such clusters are comprised of a small number ofobjects; they are extraordinary and anomalous with respect to the entire data set. Thisspecific type of clustering task cannot be solved well by the conventional clustering methodssince generally those methods try to assign most of the data objects into clusters. In thispaper; we model this novel and application-inspired task as the problem of mining cohesiveanomalies. We propose a general framework and a principled approach to tackle theproblem. The experimental results on both synthetic and real data sets verify theeffectiveness and efficiency of our approach.,AAAI,2013,8
Community preserving lossy compression of social networks,Hossein Maserrat; Jian Pei,Compression plays an important role in social network analysis from both practical andtheoretical points of view. Although there are a few pioneering studies on social networkcompression; they mainly focus on lossless approaches. In this paper; we tackle the novelproblem of community preserving lossy compression of social networks. The trade-offbetween space and information preserved in a lossy compression presents an interestingangle for social network analysis; and; at the same time; makes the problem verychallenging. We propose a sequence graph compression approach; discuss the design ofobjective functions towards community preservation; and present an interesting andpractically effective greedy algorithm. Our experimental results on both real data sets andsynthetic data sets demonstrate the promise of our method.,Data Mining (ICDM); 2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on,2012,8

Towards progressive and load balancing distributed computation: a case study on Skyline analysis,Jin Huang; Feng Zhao; Jian Chen; Jian Pei; Jian Yin,Abstract Many latest high performance distributed computational environments come withhigh bandwidth in communication. Such high bandwidth distributed systems provideunprecedented opportunities for analyzing huge datasets; but simultaneously posts newtechnical challenges. For users; progressive query answering is important. For utility ofsystems; load balancing is critical. How we can achieve progressive and load balancingdistributed computation is an interesting and promising research direction. As skylineanalysis has been shown very useful in many multi-criteria decision making applications; inthis paper; we study the problem of progressive and load balancing distributed skylineanalysis. We propose a simple yet scalable approach which comes with several niceproperties for progressive and load balancing query answering.

Sketching landscapes of page farms,Bin Zhou; Jian Pei,Abstract The Web is a very large social network. It is important and interesting to understandthe “ecology” of the Web: the general relations of Web pages to their environment. Theunderstanding of such relations has a few important applications; including Web communityidentification and analysis; and Web spam detection. In this paper; we propose the notion ofpage farm; which is the set of pages contributing to (a major portion of) the PageRank scoreof a target page. We try to understand the “landscapes” of page farms in general: how arefarms of Web pages similar to or different from each other? In order to sketch the landscapesof page farms; we need to extract page farms extensively. We show that computing pagefarms is NP-hard; and develop a simple greedy algorithm. Then; we analyze the farms of alarge number of (over 3 million) pages randomly sampled from the Web; and report some …,*,2007,8
Cross table cubing: Mining iceberg cubes from data warehouses,Moonjung Cho; Jian Pei; David W Cheung,Abstract All of the existing (iceberg) cube computation algorithms assume that the data isstored in a single base table; however; in practice; a data warehouse is often organized in aschema of multiple tables; such as star schema and snowflake schema. In terms of bothcomputation time and space; materializing a universal base table by joining multiple tablesis often very expensive or even unaffordable in real data warehouses. In this paper; weinvestigate the problem of computing iceberg cubes from data warehouses. Surprisingly; ourstudy shows that computing iceberg cube from multiple tables directly can be even moreefficient in both space and runtime than computing from a materialized universal base table.We develop an efficient algorithm; CTC (for C ross T able C ubing) to tackle the problem.

A general model for online analytical processing of complex data,Jian Pei,Abstract It has been well recognized that online analytical processing (OLAP) can provideimportant insights into huge archives of data. While the conventional OLAP model is capableof analyzing relational business data; it often cannot fit many kinds of complex data inemerging applications; such as bio-medical data; time series and semi-structured data. Inthis paper; we propose GOLAP; a general OLAP model. We show that GOLAP is consistentwith the conventional OLAP model on multi-dimensional databases. Moreover; we show thatthe model can be applied to complex data as well. As an example; we illustrate a researchprototype system; GeneXplorer; which enables OLAP over gene expression data.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2003,8
SOCQET: semantic OLAP with compressed cube and summarization,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Jian Pei; Yan Zhao,Data warehouses form the essential infrastructure for many data analysis tasks. A coreoperation in a data warehouse is the construction of a data cube; which can be viewed as amulti-level; multi-dimensional database with aggregate data at multiple granularity. In a datacube; two basic semantic relations among cells are roll up and drill down. A cell c1 can berolled up from cell c2; and c2 can be drilled down from cell c1; if c1 generalizes c2 in somedimensions; that is; in all dimensions where c1 and c2 have different values; c1 has values“all”. A data cube facilitates the online analytical processing (OLAP) substantially. However;there are some inherent problems that the current techniques cannot handle well. First;while the essential rolling up/drilling down semantics are usually kept in a data cube; manykinds of critical semantics are not highlighted. Second; there is no support of semantic …,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2003,8

Discovering outlying aspects in large datasets,Nguyen Xuan Vinh; Jeffrey Chan; Simone Romano; James Bailey; Christopher Leckie; Kotagiri Ramamohanarao; Jian Pei,Abstract We address the problem of outlying aspects mining: given a query object and areference multidimensional data set; how can we discover what aspects (ie; subsets offeatures or subspaces) make the query object most outlying? Outlying aspects mining canbe used to explain any data point of interest; which itself might be an inlier or outlier. In thispaper; we investigate several open challenges faced by existing outlying aspects miningtechniques and propose novel solutions; including (a) how to design effective scoringfunctions that are unbiased with respect to dimensionality and yet being computationallyefficient; and (b) how to efficiently search through the exponentially large search space of allpossible subspaces. We formalize the concept of dimensionality unbiasedness; a desirableproperty of outlyingness measures. We then characterize existing scoring measures as …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2016,7

Existing works on seed selection in social networks donot take into account the effect of product recommendations in e-commerce stores. In thispaper; we investigate the seed selection problem for viral marketing that considers botheffects of social influence and item inference (for product recommendation). We develop anew model; Social Item Graph (SIG); that captures both effects in the form of hyperedges.Accordingly; we formulate a seed selection problem; called Social Item MaximizationProblem (SIMP); and prove the hardness of SIMP.

Finding the minimum spatial keyword cover,Dong-Wan Choi; Jian Pei; Xuemin Lin,The existing works on spatial keyword search focus on finding a group of spatial objectscovering all the query keywords and minimizing the diameter of the group. However; weobserve that such a formulation may not address what users need in some applicationscenarios. In this paper; we introduce a novel spatial keyword cover problem (SK-COVERfor short); which aims to identify the group of spatio-textual objects covering all keywords in aquery and minimizing a distance cost function that leads to fewer proximate objects in theanswer set. We prove that SK-COVER is not only NP-hard but also does not allow anapproximation better than O (log m) in polynomial time; where m is the number of querykeywords. We establish an O (log m)-approximation algorithm; which is asymptoticallyoptimal in terms of the approximability of SK-COVER.

Within-network classification using radius-constrained neighborhood patterns,Jialong Han; Ji-Rong Wen; Jian Pei,Abstract Within-Network Classification (WNC) techniques are designed for applicationswhere objects to be classified and those with known labels are interlinked. For WNC taskslike web page classification; the homophily principle succeeds by assuming that linkedobjects; represented as adjacent vertices in a network; are likely to have the same labels.However; in other tasks like chemical structure completion; recent works suggest that thelabel of a vertex should be related to the local structure it resides in; rather than equated withthose of its neighbors. These works also propose structure-aware vertex features or methodsto deal with such an issue. In this paper; we demonstrate that frequent neighborhoodpatterns; originally studied in the pattern mining literature; serve as a strong class ofstructure-aware features and provide satisfactory effectiveness in WNC.

A context-aware approach to document reranking; URL recommendation; and query suggestion maysubstantially improve users' search experience. In this article; we propose a generalapproach to context-aware search by learning a variable length hidden Markov model(vlHMM) from search sessions extracted from log data. While the mathematical model ispowerful; the huge amounts of log data present great challenges. We develop severaldistributed learning techniques to learn a very large vlHMM under the map-reduceframework. Moreover; we construct feature vectors for each state of the vlHMM model tohandle users' novel queries not covered by the training data.

Skyline distance: a measure of multidimensional competence,Jin Huang; Bin Jiang; Jian Pei; Jian Chen; Yong Tang,Abstract Skyline has been widely recognized as being useful for multi-criteria decision-making applications. While most of the existing work computes skylines in various contexts;in this paper; we consider a novel problem: how far away a point is from the skyline? Wepropose a novel notion of skyline distance that measures the minimum cost of upgrading apoint to the skyline given a cost function. Skyline distance can be regarded as a measure ofmultidimensional competence and can be used to rank possible choices in recommendationsystems. Computing skyline distances efficiently is far from trivial and cannot be handled byany straightforward extension of the existing skyline computation methods. To tackle thisproblem; we systematically explore several directions. We first present a dynamicprogramming method.

Classification spanning correlated data streams,Yabo Xu; Ke Wang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Rong She; Jian Pei,Abstract In many applications; classifiers need to be built based on multiple related datastreams. For example; stock streams and news streams are related; where the classificationpatterns may involve features from both streams. Thus instead of mining on a single isolatedstream; we need to examine multiple related data streams in order to find such patterns andbuild an accurate classifier. Other examples of related streams include traffic reports and caraccidents; sensor readings of different types or at different locations; etc. In this paper; weconsider the classification problem defined over sliding-window join of several input datastreams. As the data streams arrive in fast pace and the many-to-many join relationshipblows up the data arrival rate even more; it is impractical to compute the join and then buildthe classifier each time the window slides forward.

Pattern-based similarity search for microarray data,Haixun Wang; Jian Pei; Philip S Yu,Abstract One fundamental task in near-neighbor search as well as other similarity matchingefforts is to find a distance function that can efficiently quantify the similarity between twoobjects in a meaningful way. In DNA microarray analysis; the expression levels of twoclosely related genes may rise and fall synchronously in response to a set of experimentalstimuli. Although the magnitude of their expression levels may not be close; the patterns theyexhibit can be very similar. Unfortunately; none of the conventional distance metrics such asthe L p norm can model this similarity effectively. In this paper; we study the near-neighborsearch problem based on this new type of similarity. We propose to measure the distancebetween two genes by subspace pattern similarity; ie; whether they exhibit a synchronouspattern of rise and fall on a subset of dimensions.

Classification with streaming features: An emerging-pattern mining approach,Kui Yu; Wei Ding; Dan A Simovici; Hao Wang; Jian Pei; Xindong Wu,Abstract Many datasets from real-world applications have very high-dimensional orincreasing feature space. It is a new research problem to learn and maintain a classifier todeal with very high dimensionality or streaming features. In this article; we adapt the well-known emerging-pattern--based classification models and propose a semi-streamingapproach. For streaming features; it is computationally expensive or even prohibitive to minelong-emerging patterns; and it is nontrivial to integrate emerging-pattern mining with featureselection.

Efficient matching of substrings in uncertain sequences,Yuxuan Li; James Bailey; Lars Kulik; Jian Pei,Abstract Substring matching is fundamental to data mining methods for sequential data. Itinvolves checking the existence of a short subsequence within a longer sequence; ensuringno gaps within a match. Whilst a large amount of existing work has focused on substringmatching and mining techniques for certain sequences; there are only a few results foruncertain sequences.

Mining Most General Multidimensional Summarization of Probably Groups in Data Warehouses.,Hui Yu; Jian Pei; Shiwei Tang; Dongqing Yang,Abstract Data summarization is an important data analysis task in data warehousing andonline analytic processing. In this paper; we consider a novel type of summarization queries;probable group queries; such as “What are the groups of patients that have a 50% or moreopportunity to get lung cancer than the average?” An aggregate cell satisfying therequirement is called a probable group. To make the answer succinct and effective; wepropose that only the most general probable groups should be mined. For example; if bothgroups (smoking; drinking) and (smoking;*) are probable; then the former groups should notbe returned. The problem of mining the most general probable groups is challenging sincethe probable groups can be widely scattered in the cube lattice; and do not present anymonotonicity in group containment order.

This paper addresses two fundamental questionsin multi-clustering: How to model quality of clusterings and how to find multiple stableclusterings (MSC). We introduce to multi-clustering the notion of clustering stability based onLaplacian eigengap; which was originally used by the regularized spectral learning methodfor similarity matrix learning. We mathematically prove that the larger the eigengap; the morestable the clustering. Furthermore; we propose a novel multi-clustering method MSC.

Each k-OCG is a group of ksubgraphs such that (1) the edges within each subgraph are dense and cohesive; and (2)the edges crossing different subgraphs are dense and oppositive. Finding k-OCGs ischallenging since the subgraphs are often small; there are multiple k-OCGs in a largesigned network; and many existing dense subgraph extraction methods cannot handleedges of two signs. We model k-OCG finding task as a quadratic optimization problem.However; the classical Proximal Gradient method is very costly since it has to use the entireadjacency matrix; which is huge on large networks.

Mining frequent co-occurrence patterns across multiple data streams.,Ziqiang Yu; Xiaohui Yu; Yang Liu; Wenzhu Li; Jian Pei,ABSTRACT This paper studies the problem of mining frequent co-occurrence patternsacross multiple data streams; which has not been addressed by existing works. Co-occurrence pattern in this context refers to the case that the same group of objects appearconsecutively in multiple streams over a short time span; signaling tight correlationsbetween these objects. The need for mining such patterns in real-time arises in a variety ofapplications ranging from crime prevention to location-based services to event discovery insocial media. Since the data streams are usually fast; continuous; and unbounded; existingmethods on mining frequent patterns requiring more than one pass over the data cannot bedirectly applied. Therefore; we propose DIMine and CooMine; two algorithms to discoverfrequent co-occurrence patterns across multiple data streams. DIMine is an Apriori-style …,EDBT,2015,5

We model the competent choices of each partyusing skylines. In order to make recommendations in various scenarios; we propose a seriesof skyline view queries. To make recommendations; we often need to answer skyline viewqueries for many entries in one or two parties in batch; such as for many applicants versusmany jobs. However; the existing skyline computation algorithms focus on answering asingle skyline query at a time and do not consider sharing computation when answeringskyline view queries for many members in one party or both parties. To tackle the batchrecommendation problem; we develop several efficient algorithms to process skyline viewqueries in batch.

Random error reduction in similarity search on time series: a statistical approach,Wush Chi-Hsuan Wu; Mi-Yen Yeh; Jian Pei,Errors in measurement can be categorized into two types: systematic errors that arepredictable; and random errors that are inherently unpredictable and have null expectedvalue. Random error is always present in a measurement. More often than not; readings intime series may contain inherent random errors due to causes like dynamic error; drift; noise;hysteresis; digitalization error and limited sampling frequency. Random errors may affect thequality of time series analysis substantially. Unfortunately; most of the existing time seriesmining and analysis methods; such as similarity search; clustering; and classification tasks;do not address random errors; possibly because random error in a time series; which can bemodeled as a random variable of unknown distribution; is hard to handle.

Logging every footstep: Quantile summaries for the entire history,Yufei Tao; Ke Yi; Cheng Sheng; Jian Pei; Feifei Li,Abstract Quantiles are a crucial type of order statistics in databases. Extensive research hasbeen focused on maintaining a space-efficient structure for approximate quantilecomputation as the underlying dataset is updated. The existing solutions; however; aredesigned to support only the current; most-updated; snapshot of the dataset. Queries on thepast versions of the data cannot be answered. This paper studies the problem of historicalquantile search. The objective is to enable ε-approximate quantile retrieval on any snapshotof the dataset in history. The problem is very important in analyzing the evolution of adistribution; monitoring the quality of services; query optimization in temporal databases;and so on. We present the first formal results in the literature. First; we prove a noveltheoretical lower bound on the space cost of supporting ε-approximate historical quantile …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,5

(α; k)-anonymity based privacy preservation by lossy join,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Yubao Liu; Jian Yin; Zhilan Huang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jian Pei,Abstract Privacy-preserving data publication for data mining is to protect sensitiveinformation of individuals in published data while the distortion to the data is minimized.Recently; it is shown that (α; k)-anonymity is a feasible technique when we are given somesensitive attribute (s) and quasi-identifier attributes. In previous work; generalization of thegiven data table has been used for the anonymization. In this paper; we show that we canproject the data onto two tables for publishing in such a way that the privacy protection for (α;k)-anonymity can be achieved with less distortion. In the two tables; one table contains theundisturbed non-sensitive values and the other table contains the undisturbed sensitivevalues. Privacy preservation is guaranteed by the lossy join property of the two tables. Weshow by experiments that the results are better than previous approaches.,*,2007,5

Vasodilation effect of puerarin on abdominal aortic artery in the rat and the underlying mechanism,Ma Jiajia; Ma Heng; Wang Yuemin; Li Hongmei; Pei Jianming,Abstract Puerarin at 10~(-8)-10~(-2) mol· L~(-1) relaxed rat aorta in a dose-dependentmanner. The relaxative effect of puerarin reached the highest level [(48.0±6.5)%] in thepresence of the single-concentration of puerarin (5× 10~(-3) mol· L~(-1); EC_ (50)) at min18; and the effect was significantly attenuated by (58.0±3.8)% in the L-NAMEgroup;(48.0±5.4)% in glybenclamide group; and (68.0±6.5)% in the endothelium groups;higher than that of the control group (P< 0.05). But that was not changed in the group ofatropin; propranolol and indomethacin (P> 0.05). These results indicate that puerarinrelaxes the aortic artery in an endothelium dependent manner; and the vasodilation ofpuerarin is via NO system and KATP channel.,Journal of the Fourth Military Medical University,2003,5
Olaping stream data: Is it feasible,Yixin Chen; Guozhu Dong; Jiawei Han; Jian Pei; Benjamin W Wah; Jianyong Wang,ABSTRACT Real-time surveillance systems and other dynamic environments often generatetremendous (potentially infinite) volume of stream data: the volume is too huge to bescanned multiple times. However; much of such data resides at rather low level ofabstraction; whereas most analysts are interested in dynamic changes (such as trends andoutliers) at relatively high levels of abstraction. To discover such high level characteristics;one may need to perform on-line multi-level analysis of stream data; similar to OLAP (on-lineanalytical processing) of relational or data warehouse data. With limited storage space andthe demand for fast response; is it realistic to promote on-line; multi-dimensional analysisand mining of stream data to alert people about dramatic changes of situations at multiple-levels of abstraction?

In this paper; we report a novel and interesting case study ofurban traffic prediction in Central; Hong Kong; one of the densest urban areas in the world.The novelty of our study is that we make good second use of inexpensive big data collectedfrom the Hong Kong International Commerce Centre (ICC); a 118-story building in HongKong where more than 10;000 people work. As building environment data are muchcheaper to obtain than traffic data; we demonstrate that it is highly effective to estimatebuilding occupancy information using building environment data; and then to further use theinformation on occupancy to provide traffic predictions in the proximate area.

An appliance-driven approach to detection of corrupted load curve data,Guoming Tang; Kui Wu; Jian Pei; Jiuyang Tang; Jingsheng Lei,Abstract Load curve data in power systems refers to users' electrical energy consumptiondata periodically collected with meters. It has become one of the most important assets formodern power systems. Many operational decisions are made based on the informationdiscovered in the data. Load curve data; however; usually suffers from corruptions causedby various factors; such as data transmission errors or malfunctioning meters. To solve theproblem; tremendous research efforts have been made on load curve data cleansing. Mostexisting approaches apply outlier detection methods from the supply side (ie; electricityservice providers); which may only have aggregated load data. In this paper; we propose toseek aid from the demand side (ie; electricity service users).

The tasks covered by 10 case studies range from thedetection of anomalies such as cancer; fraud; and system failures to the optimization oforganizational operations; and include the automated extraction of information fromunstructured sources. From the 10 cases we find that supervised methods prevail whileunsupervised techniques play a supporting role. Further; significant domain knowledge isgenerally required to achieve a completed solution.

Probabilistic inference protection on anonymized data,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang; Yabo Xu; Jian Pei; S Yu Philip,Background knowledge is an important factor in privacy preserving data publishing.Probabilistic distribution-based background knowledge is a powerful kind of backgroundknowledge which is easily accessible to adversaries. However; to the best of our knowledge;there is no existing work that can provide a privacy guarantee under adversary attack withsuch background knowledge. The difficulty of the problem lies in the high complexity of theprobability computation and the non-monotone nature of the privacy condition. The onlysolution known to us relies on approximate algorithms with no known error bound. In thispaper; we propose a new bounding condition that overcomes the difficulties of the problemand gives a privacy guarantee. This condition is based on probability deviations in theanonymized data groups; which is much easier to compute and which is a monotone …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2010 IEEE 10th International Conference on,2010,4

Multi-dimensional analysis of data streams using stream cubes,Jiawei Han; Y Dora Cai; Yixin Chen; Guozhu Dong; Jian Pei; Benjamin W Wah; Jianyong Wang,Abstract Large volumes of dynamic stream data pose great challenges to its analysis.Besides its dynamic and transient behavior; stream data has another importantcharacteristic: multi-dimensionality. Much of stream data resides at a multidimensionalspace and at rather low level of abstraction; whereas most analysts are interested inrelatively high-level dynamic changes in some combination of dimensions. To discover high-level dynamic and evolving characteristics; one may need to perform multi-level; multi-dimensional on-line analytical processing (OLAP) of stream data. Such necessity calls forthe investigation of new architectures that may facilitate on-line analytical processing of multi-dimensional stream data.

This study develops a conceptual framework tounderstand how market competition affects what a firm advertises in its search ads. Searchadvertisements from two industries (ie; hotel and car industries) are used to test hypothesesdeveloped from the conceptual framework. The findings indicate that in a highly competitivemarket (1) firms engage in more price advertising in their search ads and (2) intermediariesare more likely to increase price advertising in their search ads than brand suppliers. Moreinterestingly; competition from intermediaries and brand suppliers has different effects on thecontent of search advertising by intermediaries and brand suppliers.

Efficiently computing top-k shortest path join,Lijun Chang; Xuemin Lin; Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Jian Pei,ABSTRACT Driven by many applications; in this paper we study the problem of computingthe top-k shortest paths from one set of target nodes to another set of target nodes in agraph; namely the top-k shortest path join (KPJ) between two sets of target nodes. While KPJis an extension of the problem of computing the top-k shortest paths (KSP) between twotarget nodes; the existing technique by converting KPJ to KSP has several deficiencies inconducting the computation. To resolve these; we propose to use the best-first paradigm torecursively divide search subspaces into smaller subspaces; and to compute the shortestpath in each of the subspaces in a prioritized order based on their lower bounds.Consequently; we only compute shortest paths in subspaces whose lower bounds are largerthan the length of the current k-th shortest path.

Aggregate queries on probabilistic record linkages,Ming Hua; Jian Pei,Abstract Record linkage analysis; which matches records referring to the same real worldentities from different data sets; is an important task in data integration. Uncertainty oftenexists in record linkages due to incompleteness or ambiguity in data. Fortunately; the state-of-the-art probabilistic record linkage methods are capable of computing the probability thattwo records referring to the same entity. In this paper; we study the novel aggregate querieson probabilistic record linkages; such as counting the number of matched records. Weaddress several fundamental issues. First; we advocate that the answer to an aggregatequery on probabilistic record linkages is a probability distribution of possible answersderived from possible worlds. Second; we identify the category of compatible linkages onlyon which the answers to aggregate queries can be determined properly when the …,Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2012,3

A stratification-based approach to accurate and fast image annotation,Jianye Ye; Xiangdong Zhou; Jian Pei; Lian Chen; Liang Zhang,Abstract Image annotation is an important research problem in content-based imageretrieval (CBIR) and computer vision with broad applications. A major challenge is the so-called “semantic gap” between the low-level visual features and the high-level semanticconcepts. It is difficult to effectively annotate and extract semantic concepts from an image. Inan image with multiple semantic concepts; different objects corresponding to differentconcepts may often appear in different parts of the image. If we can properly partition theimage into regions; it is likely that the semantic concepts are better represented in theregions and thus the annotation of the image as a whole can be more accurate. Motivated bythis observation; in this paper we develop a novel stratification-based approach to imageannotation. First; an image is segmented into some likely meaningful regions.

However; in many situations suchassumptions may not hold. Recently; we studied the problem of online web spam detection;and proposed the notion of spamicity to measure how likely a page is a spam web page [9;7].

In this chapter;we first motivate the task of sequential pattern mining. Then; we discuss two kinds of majormethods: the Apriori-like; breadth-first search methods and the pattern-growth; depth-firstsearch methods. More often than not; a user may want some specific subset of sequentialpatterns instead of all patterns. This application requirement can be addressed by theconstrained sequential pattern mining techniques. When mining a large database; there canbe many sequential patterns. Redundancy may exist among sequential patterns. We discussmining closed sequential patterns which can remove some redundancy.,*,2007,2

In thispaper; we study the problem of k-anonymization of numeric data. We propose a simple yeteffective approach to this problem. We transform a data set with a multidimensional numericquasi-identifier into a data set with a one-dimensional numeric quasi-identi er using space-filling curves. Effecacious algorithms are proposed to compute the k-anonymization on thetransformed data set. The k-anonymized data set is then transformed back to the originalmultidimensional space with the k-anonymity preserved. Our empirical studies on both realdata sets and synthetic data sets show that; compared to the state-of-the-art methods; ourmethod achieves a smaller distortion and is more efficient and scalable.,Simon Fraser University School of Computing Science Technical Report,2006,2
A general approach to mining quality pattern-based clusters from gene expression data,Daxin Jiang; Jian Pei; Aidong Zhang,Abstract. Pattern-based clustering has broad applications in microarray data analysis;customer segmentation; e-business data analysis; etc. However; pattern-based clusteringoften returns a large number of highlyoverlapping clusters; which makes it hard for users toidentify interesting patterns from the mining results. Moreover; there lacks of a general modelfor pattern-based clustering. Different kinds of patterns or different measures on the patterncoherence may require different algorithms. In this paper; we address the above twoproblems by proposing a general quality-driven approach to mining top-k quality pattern-based clusters. We examine our quality-driven approach using real world microarray datasets. The experimental results show that our method is general; effective and efficient. 1,In DASFAA 2005. To Appear.[15,2005,2
A Framework for Adversarial Privacy Preserving Data Mining,Charu C Aggarwal; Jian Pei,Abstract In recent years; privacy preserving data mining has become an important topicbecause of the widespread proliferation of demographic and sensitive data. A rudimentaryway to perform privacy preserving data mining is to simply hide the information in some ofthe sensitive fields picked by a user. However; such a method is far from satisfactory in itsability to perform privacy preserving data mining. Real data records are not randomlydistributed. As a result; some fields in the records may be correlated with one another. If thecorrelation is sufficiently high; it may be possible to guess some of the sensitive fields usingother fields. In this paper; we study the problem of adversarial privacy preserving datamining; which is to hide a minimal set of entries so that the privacy of the sensitive fields aresatisfactorily preserved. We model the problem concisely and show that finding an …,TR 2005–08,2005,2

Measuring in-network node similarity based on neighborhoods: a unified parametric approach,Yu Yang; Jian Pei; Abdullah Al-Barakati,Abstract In many applications; we need to measure similarity between nodes in a largenetwork based on features of their neighborhoods. Although in-network node similaritybased on proximity has been well investigated; surprisingly; measuring in-network nodesimilarity based on neighborhoods remains a largely untouched problem in literature. Onechallenge is that in different applications we may need different measurements that manifestdifferent meanings of similarity.

Efficient mining of regional movement patterns in semantic trajectories,Dong-Wan Choi; Jian Pei; Thomas Heinis,Abstract Semantic trajectory pattern mining is becoming more and more important with therapidly growing volumes of semantically rich trajectory data. Extracting sequential patterns insemantic trajectories plays a key role in understanding semantic behaviour of humanmovement; which can widely be used in many applications such as location-basedadvertising; road capacity optimisation; and urban planning. However; most of existingworks on semantic trajectory pattern mining focus on the entire spatial area; leading tomissing some locally significant patterns within a region. Based on this motivation; this paperstudies a regional semantic trajectory pattern mining problem; aiming at identifying all theregional sequential patterns in semantic trajectories. Specifically; we propose a new densityscheme to quantify the frequency of a particular pattern in space; and thereby formulate a …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,1
Schemaless Join for Result Set Preferences,Chuancong Gao; Jian Pei; Jiannan Wang; Yi Chang,In many applications; such as data integration and big data analytics; one has to integratedata from multiple sources without detailed and accurate schema information. The state ofthe art focuses on matching attributes among sources based on the information derived fromthe data in those sources. However; a best join result according to a method's own pre-determined criteria may not fit a user's best interest. In this paper; we tackle the challengefrom a novel angle and investigate how to join schemaless tables to meet a user preferencethe best. We identify a set of essential preferences that are useful in various scenarios; suchas minimizing the number of tuples in outer join results and maximizing the entropy of thejoining key's distribution. We also develop a systematic method to compute the best joinpredicate optimizing an objective function representing a user preference.

Preference-driven similarity join,Chuancong Gao; Jiannan Wang; Jian Pei; Rui Li; Yi Chang,Abstract: Similarity join; which can find similar objects (eg; products; names; addresses)across different sources; is powerful in dealing with variety in big data; especially web data.Threshold-driven similarity join; which has been extensively studied in the past; assumesthat a user is able to specify a similarity threshold; and then focuses on how to efficientlyreturn the object pairs whose similarities pass the threshold. We argue that the assumptionabout a well set similarity threshold may not be valid for two reasons. The optimal thresholdsfor different similarity join tasks may vary a lot. Moreover; the end-to-end time spent onsimilarity join is likely to be dominated by a back-and-forth threshold-tuning process. Inresponse; we propose preference-driven similarity join. The key idea is to provide severalresult-set preferences; rather than a range of thresholds; for a user to choose from …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1706.04266,2017,1

Tradeoffs between density and size in extracting dense subgraphs: A unified framework,Zhefeng Wang; Lingyang Chu; Jian Pei; Abdullah Al-Barakati; Enhong Chen,Extracting dense subgraphs is an important step in many graph related applications. Thereis a challenging struggle in exploring the tradeoffs between density and size in subgraphsextracted. More often than not; different methods aim at different specific tradeoffs betweenthe two factors. To the best of our knowledge; no existing method can allow a user to explorethe full spectrum of the tradeoffs using a single parameter. In this paper; we investigate thisproblem systematically. First; since the existing studies cannot find highly compact densesubgraphs; we formulate the problem of finding very dense but relatively small subgraphs.Second; we connect our problem with the existing methods and propose a unifiedframework that can explore the tradeoffs between density and size of dense subgraphsextracted using a hyper-parameter.

In-network neighborhood-based node similarity measure: A unified parametric model,Yu Yang; Jian Pei,Abstract: In many applications; we need to measure similarity between nodes in a largenetwork based on features of their neighborhoods. Although in-network node similaritybased on proximity has been well investigated; surprisingly; measuring in-network nodesimilarity based on neighborhoods remains a largely untouched problem in literature. Onegrand challenge is that in different applications we may need different measurements thatmanifest different meanings of similarity. In this paper; we investigate the problem in aprincipled and systematic manner. We develop a unified parametric model and a series offour instance measures. Those instance similarity measures not only address a spectrum ofvarious meanings of similarity; but also present a series of tradeoffs between computationalcost and strictness of matching between neighborhoods of nodes being compared.

Structure-aware distance measures for comparing clusterings in graphs,Jeffrey Chan; Nguyen Xuan Vinh; Wei Liu; James Bailey; Christopher A Leckie; Kotagiri Ramamohanarao; Jian Pei,Abstract Clustering in graphs aims to group vertices with similar patterns of connections.Applications include discovering communities and latent structures in graphs. Manyalgorithms have been proposed to find graph clusterings; but an open problem is the needfor suitable comparison measures to quantitatively validate these algorithms; performingconsensus clustering and to track evolving (graph) clusters across time. To date; mostcomparison measures have focused on comparing the vertex groupings; and completelyignore the difference in the structural approximations in the clusterings; which can lead tocounter-intuitive comparisons. In this paper; we propose new measures that account fordifferences in the approximations.

On mining maximal pattern-based clusters,Jian Pei; Xiaoling Zhang; Moonjung Cho; Haixun Wang; S Yu Philip,Pattern-based clustering is important in many applications; such as DNA micro-array dataanalysis in bio-informatics; as well as automatic recommendation systems and targetmarketing systems in e-business. However; pattern-based clustering in large databases isstill challenging. On the one hand; there can be a huge number of clusters and many of themcan be redundant and thus make the pattern-based clustering ineffective. On the other hand;the previous proposed methods may not be efficient or scalable in mining large databases.In this paper; we study the problem of maximal pattern-based clustering. The major idea isthat the redundant clusters are avoided completely by mining only the maximal pattern-based clusters. We show that maximal pattern-based clusters are skylines of all pattern-based clusters. Two efficient algorithms; MaPle and MaPle+ (MaPle is for Maximal Pattern …,*,2009,1
Association rules,Jian Pei,1. Software non-determinism: A software system is non-deterministic if; when re-executed; itresults in a different execution path than a prior execution. Non-determinism can arise when;for example; paths are determined by relative processor speed or the sequence of externalevents. Such software bugs have been called ''Heisenbugs''(hard failures being ''Bohrbugs'').2. Soft hardware failures: Hardware can also suffer from ''Heisenbugs.''For example; atransient hardware failure may be triggered by an environmental cause; such as a cosmicray changing a memory bit; etc. 3. Operator failures: Systems occasionally require operatorintervention. Operators; being human; make mistakes. An operator is unlikely to make thesame mistake at the same point in a subsequent execution.,*,2009,1
DiMaC: a disguised missing data cleaning tool,Ming Hua; Jian Pei,Abstract In some applications such as filling in a customer information form on the web;some missing values may not be explicitly represented as such; but instead appear aspotentially valid data values. Such missing values are known as disguised missing data;which may impair the quality of data analysis severely. The very limited previous studies oncleaning disguised missing data highly rely on domain background knowledge in specificapplications and may not work well for the cases where the disguise values are inliers.Recently; we have studied the problem of cleaning disguised missing data systematically;and proposed an effective heuristic approach [2]. In this paper; we present a demonstrationof DiMaC; a Disguised Missing Data Cleaning tool which can find the frequently useddisguise values in data sets without any domain background knowledge.

Mining Coherent Gene Clusters from Three-Dimensional Microarray Data,Daxin Jiang; Jian Pei; Murali Ramanathan; Chun Tang; Aidong Zhang,ABSTRACT Extensive studies have shown that mining microarray data sets is important inbioinformatics research and biomedical applications. In this paper; we explore a novel typeof 3-dimensional microarray data sets; which records the expression levels of various genesunder a set of samples during a series of time points. In particular; we propose the mining ofcoherent gene clusters from such data sets. Each cluster contains a subset of genes and asubset of samples such that the genes are coherent on the samples along the time series.The coherent gene clusters may identify the samples corresponding to some phenotypes(eg; diseases); and suggest the candidate genes correlated to the phenotypes. We presenttwo efficient algorithms; namely the Sample-Gene Search and the Gene-Sample Search; tomine the complete set of coherent gene clusters.

Tracking Top-K Influential Vertices in Dynamic Networks,Yu Yang; Zhefeng Wang; Tianyuan Jin; Jian Pei; Enhong Chen,Abstract: Influence propagation in networks has enjoyed fruitful applications and has beenextensively studied in literature. However; only very limited preliminary studies tackled thechallenges in handling highly dynamic changes in real networks. In this paper; we tackle theproblem of tracking top-$ k $ influential vertices in dynamic networks; where the dynamicchanges are modeled as a stream of edge weight updates. Under the popularly adoptedlinear threshold (LT) model and the independent cascade (IC) model; we address twoessential versions of the problem: tracking the top-$ k $ influential individuals and finding thebest $ k $-seed set to maximize the influence spread (Influence Maximization). We adopt thepolling-based method and maintain a sample of random RR sets so that we canapproximate the influence of vertices with provable quality guarantees.

Mining Density Contrast Subgraphs,Yu Yang; Lingyang Chu; Yanyan Zhang; Zhefeng Wang; Jian Pei; Enhong Chen,Abstract: Dense subgraph discovery is a key primitive in many graph mining applications;such as detecting communities in social networks and mining gene correlation frombiological data. Most studies on dense subgraph mining only deal with one graph. However;in many applications; we have more than one graph describing relations among a samegroup of entities. In this paper; given two graphs sharing the same set of vertices; weinvestigate the problem of detecting subgraphs that contrast the most with respect to density.We call such subgraphs Density Contrast Subgraphs; or DCS in short. Two widely usedgraph density measures; average degree and graph affinity; are considered. For bothdensity measures; mining DCS is equivalent to mining the densest subgraph from a"difference" graph; which may have both positive and negative edge weights.

Exact and Consistent Interpretation for Piecewise Linear Neural Networks: A Closed Form Solution,Lingyang Chu; Xia Hu; Juhua Hu; Lanjun Wang; Jian Pei,Abstract: Strong intelligent machines powered by deep neural networks are increasinglydeployed as black boxes to make decisions in risk-sensitive domains; such as finance andmedical. To reduce potential risk and build trust with users; it is critical to interpret how suchmachines make their decisions. Existing works interpret a pre-trained neural network byanalyzing hidden neurons; mimicking pre-trained models or approximating local predictions.However; these methods do not provide a guarantee on the exactness and consistency oftheir interpretation. In this paper; we propose an elegant closed form solution named $OpenBox $ to compute exact and consistent interpretations for the family of PiecewiseLinear Neural Networks (PLNN).

However; incremental SVD approaches suffer from serious error accumulationinevitably due to approximation on incremental updates.

Here; a theme community is acohesive subgraph such that a common pattern is frequent in all transaction databasesassociated with the vertices in the subgraph. Finding all theme communities from a databasenetwork enjoys many novel applications. However; it is challenging since even counting thenumber of all theme communities in a database network is# P-hard.

Principal Patern Mining on Graphs,Chun-Yen Kuo; Mi-Yen Yeh; Jian Pei,Abstract Given a graph; can we find a set of patterns; of which the cost of storing thesepatterns is economic (or satisfying specific user needs) but their coverage includes the entiregraph? We denote these patterns by principal patterns of the given graph since they can beregarded as its composition elements; which can be a signature for summarizing a graph ofvarious sizes. Note that different principal patterns can contribute different sizes of graphcoverage so they are not necessarily the frequent patterns. In this paper; we show that therecursive method can obtain the optimal solution while the greedy algorithms can findapproximations with lower time complexity. Furthermore; we propose an effective pruningmethod that can be combined with both algorithms such that the mining process is evenmore efficient and scalable.

Subspace multi-clustering: a review,Juhua Hu; Jian Pei,Abstract Clustering has been widely used to identify possible structures in data and helpusers to understand data in an unsupervised manner. Traditional clustering methods oftenprovide a single partitioning of the data that groups similar data objects in one group whileseparates dissimilar ones into different groups. However; it has been well recognized thatassuming only a single clustering for a data set can be too strict and cannot capture thediversity in applications. Multiple clustering structures can be hidden in the data; and eachrepresents a unique perspective of the data. Different multi-clustering methods; which aim todiscover multiple independent structures hidden in data; have been proposed in the recentdecade.

It has become one of the most important assets formodern power systems. Many operational decisions are made based on the informationdiscovered in the data. Load curve data; however; usually suffers from corruptions causedby various factors; such as data transmission errors or malfunctioning meters. To solve theproblem; tremendous research efforts have been made on load curve data cleansing. Mostexisting approaches apply outlier detection methods from the supply side (ie; electricityservice providers); which may only have aggregated load data. In this paper; we propose toseek aid from the demand side (ie; electricity service users). With the help of readilyavailable knowledge on consumers' appliances; we present a new appliance-driven …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1307.7757,2013,*

Continuous Ranking Queries on Uncertain Streams,Ming Hua; Jian Pei,Abstract The uncertain data stream model developed in Section 2.3. 1 characterizes thedynamic nature of uncertain data. Conceptually; an uncertain data stream contains a set of(potentially) infinite instances. To keep our discussion simple; we assume a synchronousmodel in this chapter. That is; at each time instant t (t> 0); an instance is collected for anuncertain data stream. A sliding window W_w^ t selects the set of instances collectedbetween time instants t− w and t. The instances of each uncertain data stream in the slidingwindow can be considered as an uncertain object. We assume that the membershipprobabilities of all instances are identical. Some of our developed methods can also handlethe case of different membership probabilities; which will be discussed in Section 6.5.,*,2011,*

Top-k Typicality Queries on Uncertain Data,Ming Hua; Jian Pei,Abstract An uncertain object O can be modeled as a set of instances generated by anunderlying random variable X. If there are a large number of instances in an uncertainobject; how can we understand and analyze this object? An effective way is to find the mosttypical instances among all instances of the uncertain object. In Section 2.2. 1; we appliedthe idea of typicality analysis from psychology and cognitive science to ranking uncertaindata; and modeled typicality for instances in uncertain objects systematically.,*,2011,*
Ranking Queries on Probabilistic Linkages,Ming Hua; Jian Pei,Abstract In Chapters 4; 5 and 6; we adopt an independent uncertain object model. That is;we assume that any two uncertain objects in a data set are independent. In manyapplications; various types of dependencies may exist among real world uncertain objects;such as the case shown in Example 2.12. In this chapter; we study how to answerprobabilistic ranking queries on the probabilistic linkage model.,*,2011,*

Towards web search engine scale data mining,Jian Pei,Abstract Data mining is one of the most critical driving technologies behind Web searchengines. Web search engine scale data mining posts many grand challenges; ranging fromefficiency and scalability to diversity and adaptability. In this talk; I will review our recent efforton mining a very large amount of data accumulated in one of the major commercial searchengines. Particularly; we tackle the problem of context--aware search and query suggestionby employing statistical models. Moreover; we construct a very large statistical model(millions of states) from a very large amount of data (billions of sessions) by distributed datamining. I will also introduce some of our recent initiatives in Web mining.,Proceedings of the Eighth Australasian Data Mining Conference-Volume 101,2009,*

Distribution-based background knowledge is one of the well studied backgroundknowledge. However; to the best of our knowledge; there is no existing work considering thedistribution-based background knowledge in the worst case scenario; by which we meanthat the adversary has accurate knowledge about the distribution of sensitive valuesaccording to some tuple attributes. Considering this worst case scenario is essentialbecause we cannot overlook any breaching possibility. In this paper; we propose analgorithm to anonymize dataset in order to protect individual privacy by considering thisbackground knowledge. We prove that the anonymized datasets generated by our proposedalgorithm protects individual privacy. Our empirical studies show that our method …,arXiv preprint arXiv:0909.1127,2009,*

Most of the existing studies focus on only the situations where the data in questionis published using one quasi-identifier. However; in a few important applications; a practicaldemand is to publish a data set on multiple quasi-identifiers for multiple userssimultaneously; which poses several challenges. How can we generate one anonymizedversion of the data so that the privacy preservation requirement like k-anonymity is satisfiedfor all users? Moreover; how can we reduce the information loss as much as possible whilethe privacy preservation requirements are met?

Classifying Noisy and Incomplete Medical Data by a Differential Latent Semantic Indexing Approach,Liang Chen; Jia Zeng; Jian Pei,Abstract It is well-recognized that medical datasets are often noisy and incomplete due to thedifficulties in data collection and integration. Noise and incompleteness in medical data postsubstantial challenges for accurate classification. A differential latent semantic indexing(DLSI) approach which is an improvement of the standard LSI method has been proposedfor information retrieval and demonstrated improved performance over standard LSIapproach. The key idea is that DLSI adapts to the unique characteristics of individualrecord/document. By experimental results on real datasets; we show that DLSI outperformsthe standard LSI method on noisy and incomplete medical datasets. The results stronglyindicate that the DLSI approach is also capable of medical numerical data analysis.,*,2007,*
Distinguishing Sequence Patterns,Guozhu Dong; Jian Pei,A distinguishing sequence pattern is a sequence pattern that (i) characterizes a family ofsequences and distinguishes the family from other sequences;(ii) characterizes a specialsite of sequences and distinguishes the site from other parts of sequences; or (iii) signalssomething unusual about certain sequences. This chapter first discusses four types ofdistinguishing sequence patterns; and then gives some methods/algorithms for the mining oftwo of those types.(The other two types were discussed in Chapter 4.) Distinguishingsequence patterns are also useful as candidates for sequence features. Three of the types ofdistinguishing sequence patterns are similar to classification models in the sense that theyall discriminate one family of things/sites against some others. There are also differences;since distinguishing sequence patterns are frequently local models (which can match and …,*,2007,*
Sequence Motifs: Identifying and Characterizing Sequence Families,Guozhu Dong; Jian Pei,This chapter is concerned about sequence motifs. It discusses finding motifs and usingmotifs in sequence analysis. A motif is essentially a short distinctive sequence patternshared by a number of related sequences. The distinctiveness of a motif is mainly reflectedin the over representation of the motif pattern at certain locations in the related sequencesand the under representation elsewhere (at other locations in the related sequences and atall locations in other sequences). Motifs have been mostly studied in biological sequenceanalysis applications. In such applications; motifs are believed to be the result ofconservation during evolution; the conservation is witnessed by the sharing of the motif bymultiple sequences in different individuals; perhaps from different species. Based on thatbelief; motifs can have important biological functions/structures. This reasoning has been …,*,2007,*
Active rules termination analysis through conditional formula containing updatable variable,Zhongmin Xiong; Wei Wang; Jian Pei,Abstract While active rules have been applied in many areas including active databases;XML documentation and Semantic Web; current methods remain largely uncertain of how toterminate active behaviors. Some existing methods have been provided in the form of alogical formula for a rule set; but they suffer two problems;(i) Only those variables; which arenon-updatable or finitely updatable; can be contained by a formula.(ii) They cannot concludetermination if a rule set only contains some cycles that can be executed in a finite number oftimes. Many active rule systems; which only contain updatable variables; can still beterminated. This paper presents an algorithm to construct a formula; which can containupdatable variable. Also; a method is proposed to detect if a cycle can only be executed in afinite number of times. Theoretical analysis shows more termination cases; which is …,*,2007,*

On the one hand;there can be a huge number of clusters and many of them can be redundant and thus makethe pattern-based clustering ineffective. On the other hand; the previous proposed methodsmay not be efficient or scalable in mining large databases. In this paper; we study theproblem of maximal pattern-based clustering. Redundant clusters are avoided completely bymining only the maximal pattern-based clusters. MaPle; an efficient and scalable miningalgorithm is developed. It conducts a depth-first; divide-and-conquer search and prunesunnecessary branches smartly.

However; much of such data resides at rather low level ofabstraction; whereas most analysts are interested in dynamic changes (such as trends andoutliers) at relatively high levels of abstraction. To discover such high level characteristics;one may need to perform on-line multi-level analysis of stream data; similar to OLAP (on-lineanalytical processing) of relational or data warehouse data.,*,2002,*

Firstly; in themodel testing stage; given a test dataset with noisy labels; and a classification model; TARScan use the test data to estimate how well the model will perform wrt true labels. Secondly; inthe model training stage; given a training dataset with noisy labels; and a supervised-learning algorithm; TARS can determine which label should be sent to an oracle to clean …,*,*,*
AQP++: Connecting Approximate Query Processing With Aggregate Precomputation for Interactive Analytics,Jinglin Peng; Dongxiang Zhang; Jiannan Wang; Jian Pei,ABSTRACT Interactive analytics requires database systems to be able to answeraggregation queries within interactive response times. As the amount of data is continuouslygrowing at an unprecedented rate; this is becoming increasingly challenging. In the past; thedatabase community has proposed two separate ideas; sampling-based approximate queryprocessing (AQP) and aggregate precomputation (AggPre) such as data cubes; to addressthis challenge. In this paper; we argue for the need to connect these two separate ideas forinteractive analytics. We propose AQP++; a novel framework to enable the connection. Theframework can leverage both a sample as well as a precomputed aggregate to answer userqueries. We discuss the advantages of having such a unified framework and identify newchallenges to fulfill this vision. We conduct an in-depth study of these challenges for …,*,*,*

Constructing a Multidimensional Topic-Concept Cube for OLAP on Large-Scale Search Logs,Zhen Liao; Daxin Jiang; Jian Pei; Dongyeop Kang; Xiaohui Sun; Ho-Jin Choi; Hang Li,Abstract In addition to search queries and the corresponding click-through information;search engine logs record multidimensional information about user search activities; suchas search time; location; vertical; and search device. Multidimensional mining of search logscan provide novel insights and useful knowledge for both search engine users anddevelopers. In this paper; we describe our topic-concept cube project; which addresses thebusiness need of supporting multidimensional mining of search logs effectively andefficiently. We answer two challenges. First; search queries and click-through data are wellrecognized sparse; and thus have to be aggregated properly for effective analysis. Second;there is often a gap between the topic hierarchies in multidimensional aggregate analysisand queries in search logs. To address those challenges; we develop a novel topic …,*,*,*

Privacy-Preserving Classification for Data Streams,Yabo Xu; Ke Wang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Rong She; Jian Pei,ABSTRACT In a wide range of applications; multiple data streams need to be examinedtogether in order to discover trends or patterns existing across several data streams. Onecommon practice is to redirect all data streams into a central place for joint analysis. This“centralized” practice is challenged by the fact that data streams often are private in that theycome from different owners. In this paper; we focus on the problem of building a classifier inthis context and assume that classification evolves as the current window of streams slidesforward. This problem faces two major challenges. First; the many-to-many join relationshipof streams will blow up the already fast arrival rate of data streams. Second; the privacyrequirement implies that data exchange among owners should be minimal. Theseconsiderations rule out all classification methods that require producing the join in the …,*,*,*

Running Title: Exploring Disease Association from the NHANES Data,Zhengzheng Xing; Jian Pei,Abstract Finding associations among different diseases is an important task in medical datamining. The NHANES data is a valuable source to explore disease associations. However;the existing studies on analyzing the NHANES data focus on using statistical techniques totest a small number of hypotheses. To the best of our knowledge; the NHANES data has notbeen systematically explored for mining disease association patterns. In this paper; wepropose a direct disease pattern mining method and an interactive disease pattern miningmethod to explore the NHANES data. The results on the latest NHANES data demonstratethat our methods can mine meaningful disease associations consistent with the existingknowledge and literatures. Furthermore; our methods provide interesting summarization ofthe data set via a disease influence graph and a disease hierarchical tree.,*,*,*
Minimality Attack in Privacy Preserving Data Publishing Technical Report TR 2006-28,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang; Jian Pei,Abstract Data publishing generates much concern over the protection of individual privacy.In the well-known kanonymity model and the related models such as l-diversity and (α; k)-anonymity; the adversary is assumed to possess knowledge about an external table withinformation of the quasi-identifiers of individuals. In this paper; we show that knowledge ofthe mechanism or algorithm of anonymization for data publication can also lead to extrainformation that assists the adversary and jeopardizes individual privacy. In particular; allknown mechanisms try to minimize information loss and such an attempt provides for aloophole for attacks. We call such an attack a minimality attack. In this paper; we propose amodel called mconfidentiality which deals with the individual privacy issue with theconsideration of minimality attacks. Though the problem of optimal m-confidentiality …,*,*,*
Document Clustering of Scientific Texts Using Citation Contexts,Bader Aljaber Nicola Stokes James Bailey; Jian Pei,Abstract Document clustering has many important applications in the area of data miningand information retrieval. Many existing document clustering techniques use the “bag-of-words” model to represent the content of a document. However; this representation is onlyeffective for grouping related documents when these documents share a large proportion oflexically equivalent terms. In other words; instances of synonymy between relateddocuments are ignored; which can reduce the effectiveness of applications using a standardfull-text document representation. To address this problem; we present a new approach forclustering scientific documents; based on the utilization of citation contexts. A citation contextis essentially the text surrounding the reference markers used to refer to other scientificworks. We hypothesize that citation contexts will provide relevant synonymous and …,*,*,*
