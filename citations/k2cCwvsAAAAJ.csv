Holistic processing predicts face recognition,Jennifer J Richler; Olivia S Cheung; Isabel Gauthier,The concept of holistic processing is a cornerstone of face-recognition research. In the studyreported here; we demonstrated that holistic processing predicts face-recognition abilities onthe Cambridge Face Memory Test and on a perceptual face-identification task. Our findingsvalidate a large body of work that relies on the assumption that holistic processing is relatedto face recognition. These findings also reconcile the study of face recognition with theperceptual-expertise work it inspired; such work links holistic processing of objects withpeople's ability to individuate them. Our results differ from those of a recent study showing nolink between holistic processing and face recognition. This discrepancy can be attributed tothe use in prior research of a popular but flawed measure of holistic processing. Our findingssalvage the central role of holistic processing in face recognition and cast doubt on a …,Psychological science,2011,207
Revisiting the role of spatial frequencies in the holistic processing of faces.,Olivia S Cheung; Jennifer J Richler; Thomas J Palmeri; Isabel Gauthier,Abstract V. Goffaux and B. Rossion (2006) argued that holistic processing of faces is largelysupported by low spatial frequencies (LSFs) but less so by high spatial frequencies (HSFs).We addressed this claim using a sequential matching task with face composites. Observersjudged whether the top halves of aligned or misaligned composites were identical. Wereplicated the V. Goffaux and B. Rossion (2006) results; finding a greater alignment effect inaccuracy for LSF compared with HSF faces on same trials. However; there was also agreater bias for responding “same” for HSF compared with LSF faces; indicating that thealignment effects arose from differential response biases. Crucially; comparable congruencyeffects found for LSF and HSF suggest that LSF and HSF faces are processed equallyholistically. These results demonstrate that it is necessary to use measures that take …,Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance,2008,107
Predictive feedback and conscious visual experience,Matthew F Panichello; Olivia S Cheung; Moshe Bar,The human brain continuously generates predictions about the environment based onlearned regularities in the world. These predictions actively and efficiently facilitate theinterpretation of incoming sensory information. We review evidence that; as a result of thisfacilitation; predictions directly influence conscious experience. Specifically; we propose thatpredictions enable rapid generation of conscious percepts and bias the contents ofawareness in situations of uncertainty. The possible neural mechanisms underlying thisfacilitation are discussed.,Frontiers in Perception Science,2013,68
Font tuning associated with expertise in letter perception,Isabel Gauthier; Alan CN Wong; William G Hayward; Olivia S Cheung,Font tuning (FT) occurs when observers recognize a sequence of letters presented in thesame font faster than in different fonts (Sanocki 1987; 1988 Journal of ExperimentalPsychology: Human Perception and Performance 13 267–278; 14 472–480). Here; we testthe hypothesis that FT is associated with expertise with a specific writing system. Wedeveloped a systematic search task allowing the measurement of FT over a large number ofletters and generalized the finding of FT from English readers viewing Roman letters toChinese readers viewing Chinese characters. Non-Chinese readers did not show evidenceof FT for Chinese characters in this search task. We also used a simpler 3-letter identificationtask to directly compare novice and expert readers; and to explore FT for different aspects offont such as fill; slant; and aspect ratio. We found that experts tune to aspect ratio but not …,Perception,2006,51
Beliefs alter holistic face processing… if response bias is not taken into account,Jennifer J Richler; Olivia S Cheung; Isabel Gauthier,Abstract The composite paradigm is widely used to quantify holistic processing (HP) offaces; but there is debate regarding the appropriate design (partial vs. complete) andmeasures in this task. Here; we argue that some operational definitions of HP areproblematic because they are sensitive to top-down influences; even though the underlyingconcept is assumed to be cognitively impenetrable. In Experiment 1; we told one group ofparticipants that the target face half would remain the same on 75% of trials and anothergroup that it would change on 75% of trials. The true proportion of same/different trials was50%—groups only differed in their beliefs about the target halves. In Experiment 2; wemanipulated the actual proportion of same/different trials in the experiment (75% of trialswere the same for one group; 75% of trials were different for another group) but did not …,Journal of vision,2011,40
Increased experience amplifies the activation of task-irrelevant category representations,Rachel Wu; Zoe Pruitt; Benjamin D Zinszer; Olivia S Cheung,Abstract Prior research has demonstrated the benefits (ie; task-relevant attentional selection)and costs (ie; task-irrelevant attentional capture) of prior knowledge on search for anindividual target or multiple targets from a category. This study investigated whether the levelof experience with particular categories predicts the degree of task-relevant and task-irrelevant activation of item and category representations. Adults with varying levels ofdieting experience (measured via 3 subscales of Disinhibition; Restraint; Hunger; Stunkard& Messick; Journal of Psychosomatic Research; 29 (1); 71–83; 1985) searched for targetsdefined as either a specific food item (eg; carrots); or a category (ie; any healthy or unhealthyfood item). Apart from the target-present trials; in the target-absent “foil” trials; whensearching for a specific item (eg; carrots); irrelevant items from the target's category (eg …,Attention; Perception; & Psychophysics,2017,32
Does response interference contribute to face composite effects?,Jennifer J Richler; Olivia S Cheung; Alan CN Wong; Isabel Gauthier,Abstract Holistic processing of faces can be measured as a failure of selective attention toone face-half under instructions to ignore the other face-half in a naming or same/differentmatching task. But is interference from the irrelevant half due to response interference ratherthan to holistic processing? Here; participants learned to name two faces “Fred” and two“Bob.” At test; composites were created from top and bottom halves of different learned facesor of a novel face; and composites were either aligned or misaligned. Naming was slowerwhen the irrelevant half was from a different face as opposed to the same face; regardless ofwhether it was associated with the same name; a different name; or no name; suggestingholistic processing. Interference was eliminated when composite halves were misaligned.These results suggest that; unlike Stroop effects; composite effects are not due to …,Psychonomic Bulletin & Review,2009,27
Visual prediction and perceptual expertise,Olivia S Cheung; Moshe Bar,Abstract Making accurate predictions about what may happen in the environment requiresanalogies between perceptual input and associations in memory. These elements ofpredictions are based on cortical representations; but little is known about how theseprocesses can be enhanced by experience and training. On the other hand; studies onperceptual expertise have revealed that the acquisition of expertise leads to strengthenedassociative processing among features or objects; suggesting that predictions and expertisemay be tightly connected. Here we review the behavioral and neural findings regarding themechanisms involving prediction and expert processing; and highlight important possibleoverlaps between them. Future investigation should examine the relations amongperception; memory and prediction skills as a function of expertise. The knowledge …,International Journal of Psychophysiology,2012,26
Selective interference on the holistic processing of faces in working memory.,Olivia S Cheung; Isabel Gauthier,Abstract Faces and objects of expertise compete for early perceptual processes and holisticprocessing resources (Gauthier; Curran; Curby; & Collins; 2003). Here; we examined thenature of interference on holistic face processing in working memory by comparing howvarious types of loads affect selective attention to parts of face composites. In dual tasks; allloads impaired overall performance on face judgment compared with no load. However; aface load reduced holistic face processing (Experiment 1) whereas an object load did not;regardless of expertise (Experiments 2 and 3). Also; 2 types of faces produced asymmetricalinterference on each other (Experiment 4); refuting the hypothesis that any faces wouldproduce equal interference. Thus; the interference on holistic face processing in workingmemory does not depend on overlap in expertise or face processing; but may be …,Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance,2010,22
Dissociating the effects of angular disparity and image similarity in mental rotation and object recognition,Olivia S Cheung; William G Hayward; Isabel Gauthier,Abstract Performance is often impaired linearly with increasing angular disparity betweentwo objects in tasks that measure mental rotation or object recognition. But increasedangular disparity is often accompanied by changes in the similarity between views of anobject; confounding the impact of the two factors in these tasks. We examined separately theeffects of angular disparity and image similarity on handedness (to test mental rotation) andidentity (to test object recognition) judgments with 3-D novel objects. When similarity wasapproximately equated; an effect of angular disparity was only found for handedness but notidentity judgments. With a fixed angular disparity; performance was better for similar thandissimilar image pairs in both tasks; with a larger effect for identity than handednessjudgments. Our results suggest that mental rotation involves mental transformation …,Cognition,2009,11
Does temporal integration of face parts reflect holistic processing?,Olivia S Cheung; Jennifer J Richler; W Stewart Phillips; Isabel Gauthier,Abstract We examined whether temporal integration of face parts reflects holistic processingor response interference. Participants learned to name two faces “Fred” and two “Bob.” Attest; the top and bottom halves of different faces formed composites and were presentedbriefly separated in time. Replicating prior findings (Singer & Sheinberg; Vision Research;46; 1838–1847; 2006); naming of the target half for aligned composites was slowed whenthe irrelevant half was from a face with a different name rather than from the original face.However; no interference was observed when the irrelevant half had a name identical to thename of the target half but came from a different learned face; arguing against a true holisticeffect. Instead; response interference was obtained when the target half briefly preceded theirrelevant half. Experiment 2 confirmed a double dissociation of holistic processing versus …,Psychonomic bulletin & review,2011,9
Visual appearance interacts with conceptual knowledge in object recognition,Olivia S Cheung; Isabel Gauthier,Objects contain rich visual and conceptual information; but do these two types of informationinteract? Here; we examine whether visual and conceptual information interact whenobservers see novel objects for the first time. We then address how this interactioninfluences the acquisition of perceptual expertise. We used two types of novel objects(Greebles); designed to resemble either animals or tools; and two lists of words; whichdescribed non-visual attributes of people or man-made objects. Participants first judged if aword was more suitable for describing people or objects while ignoring a task-irrelevantimage; and showed faster responses if the words and the unfamiliar objects were congruentin terms of animacy (eg; animal-like objects with words that described human). Participantsthen learned to associate objects and words that were either congruent or not in animacy …,Frontiers in Psychology,2014,5
The resilience of object predictions: Early recognition across viewpoints and exemplars,Olivia S Cheung; Moshe Bar,Abstract Recognition of everyday objects can be facilitated by top-down predictions. Wehave proposed that these predictions are derived from rudimentary image information; orgist; extracted rapidly from the low spatial frequencies (LSFs)(Bar Journal of CognitiveNeuroscience 15: 600–609; 2003). Because of the coarse nature of LSF representations; wehypothesized here that such predictions can accommodate changes in viewpoint as well asfacilitate the recognition of visually similar objects. In a repetition-priming task; we indeedobserved significant facilitation of target recognition that was primed by LSF objects acrossmoderate viewpoint changes; as well as across visually similar exemplars. These resultssuggest that the LSF representations are specific enough to activate accurate predictions;yet flexible enough to overcome small changes in visual appearance. Such gist …,Psychonomic bulletin & review,2014,4
Beliefs alone alter holistic face processing… if response bias is not taken into account,Isabel Gauthier; Jennifer Richler; Olivia Cheung,Abstract Faces are processed holistically and the composite paradigm is widely used toquantify holistic processing (HP) but there is debate regarding the appropriate design andmeasures in this task. Important theoretical conclusions hinge on which measure of HP isadopted because different approaches yield qualitatively different results. We argue thatsome operational definitions of HP are problematic because they are sensitive to top-downinfluences; even though the underlying concept is assumed to be cognitively impenetrable.Participants matched one half of two sequentially presented face composites while trying toignore the irrelevant half. In the often-used partial design the irrelevant halves are alwaysdifferent; and HP is indexed by higher hit rates or d'for misaligned vs. aligned composites.Here; we used the complete design; which also includes trials where irrelevant halves are …,Journal of Vision,2010,2

Dissociating the effects of viewpoint disparity and image similarity in mental rotation and object recognition,Olivia Cheung; William Hayward; Isabel Gauthier,Abstract Mental rotation (MR) is often measured in a task where participants judge thehandedness of rotated objects; and is revealed by a viewpoint cost-a linear reduction inperformance with an increase of viewpoint disparity for the objects. Similar viewpoint costsare also often found for object recognition (OR); in tasks where participants match theidentity of rotated objects. These findings led to speculations that MR might be themechanism underlying OR. However; recent studies dissociate the two tasks (Gauthier et al.;2002; Hayward et al.; 2006). If viewpoint costs are dissociable in MR and OR; we may askwhether they arise because of the same or different factors. Specifically; viewpoint disparityis usually confounded by image similarity in these tasks-images become dissimilar with anincrease in viewpoint difference. Here; we investigated the effects of viewpoint disparity …,Journal of Vision,2008,1
How holistic processing is affected by working memory load,Isabel Gauthier; Olivia S-C Cheung,Abstract Holistic processing (HP) for faces (and objects of expertise) can be measured intasks where subjects selectively attend to and compare a part (eg; the mouth) of two faceswhile trying to ignore other parts that may vary. HP is evidenced by a congruency effectbetween the correct responses on the target and irrelevant parts. Last year we argued thatencoding is not the locus of this effect because changing the configuration at encoding didnot reduce HP (Gauthier et al.; VSS 2003). Working memory load (WML) can increaseprocessing of irrelevant distractors when the relevant and irrelevant information are differentobjects (eg; de Fockert; 2001; Yi et al.; 2004). Here we ask if WML would reduce selectiveattention to a face part (increase HP); especially for a WML during the matching judgment. AWML of three items was added to a sequential matching task with face composites during …,Journal of Vision,2005,1

Does temporal integration of face parts reflect holistic processing?,Olivia Cheung; Jennifer Richler; Stewart Phillips; Isabel Gauthier,Abstract Holistic processing of faces can be revealed in the composite task by failures ofselective attention to a face half under instructions to ignore the other half. In the normalversion of this task with both parts presented simultaneously; interference from the irrelevanthalf is due to holistic processing and not response interference (Richler et al.; in press).However; failures of selective attention are also found when parts are separated briefly intime (Singer & Sheinberg; 2006; Anaki et al.; 2007). Here we ask whether such temporalintegration may reflect response interference; especially when irrelevant information ispresented first. Participants learned to name faces; two “Fred” and two “Bob”. At test;composites were formed by top and bottom halves of different learned faces. The halves ofeach composite were presented either 50ms or 200ms apart.

Dissociating contributions of configural and component information to the own-race advantage in face recognition,William Hayward; Mintao Zhao; Olivia Cheung; Gillian Rhodes; Isabel Gauthier,Abstract Across many different races; people are better at recognizing own-race faces thanfaces from other races. Recently; we (Hayward; et al.; 2008) reported that; following study ofwhole faces; performance in an old-new memory task for scrambled (to isolate componentprocessing) and blurred (to isolate configural processing) faces showed an own-raceadvantage (ORA) in both conditions. In addition; memory for blurred faces was better thanfor scrambled faces; supporting the importance of configural processing in judgments offacial identity. Here; we present further investigation of these effects. In Experiment 1 wereplicated our earlier experiment but inverted the stimuli; participants saw inverted normalfaces at study and inverted blurred or scrambled faces at test; this manipulation eliminatedthe difference between blurred and scrambled faces; consistent with the assumption that …,Journal of Vision,2009,*
Contextually evoked interference on the holistic processing of faces,Olivia S Cheung; Isabel Gauthier,Abstract Previously; we reported that holistic processing (HP) of faces is reduced by aconcurrent face; but not object; working memory load (WML; Gauthier & Cheung; VSS2005).Here; we ask if face discrimination is necessary for such interference. A recent study foundthat contextual processing of blobs atop bodies engages the fusiform 'face'area (FFA) asmuch as faces themselves; while bodies or blobs alone do not (Cox et al.; 2004). HP wasmeasured in a sequential matching task with two face composites; as participants attemptedto selectively attend and compare one part of the composites (eg; the top). HP was definedas a congruency effect; indicating that the to-be-ignored part influences judgments on theattended part. Three types of WML were imposed on this task; always consisting of 3 stimuli:faces on bodies; bodies alone or blurred blobs atop bodies. On face WML trials; different …,Journal of Vision,2006,*
How holistic processing is affected by perceptual load,Olivia SC Cheung; Isabel Gauthier,Abstract Holistic processing (HP) for faces (and objects of expertise) can be measured in asequential matching task with two composite images (S1 and S2); when subjects try toselectively attend to one part of the composites (eg; the top) and ignore the other part. HP isevidenced by a congruency effect between the correct responses on the attended andirrelevant parts. Last year; we reported that misaligning parts of a face composite atencoding did not substantially reduce HP; suggesting that the locus of this effect is not atencoding (Gauthier et al.; VSS 2003). Here we investigate the possibility that selectiveattention during the perceptual judgment is the locus of HP. High perceptual load canfacilitate selective attention and reduce the processing of irrelevant distractors (eg; Lavie;1995; Yi et al.; 2004). We ask if a high perceptual load would increase selective attention …,Journal of Vision,2005,*
