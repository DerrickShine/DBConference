Performance prediction for concurrent database workloads,Jennie Duggan; Ugur Cetintemel; Olga Papaemmanouil; Eli Upfal,Abstract Current trends in data management systems; such as cloud and multi-tenantdatabases; are leading to data processing environments that concurrently executeheterogeneous query workloads. At the same time; these systems need to satisfy diverseperformance expectations. In these newly-emerging settings; avoiding potential Quality-of-Service (QoS) violations heavily relies on performance predictability; ie; the ability toestimate the impact of concurrent query execution on the performance of individual queriesin a continuously evolving workload. This paper presents a modeling approach to estimatethe impact of concurrency on query performance for analytical workloads. Our solution relieson the analysis of query behavior in isolation; pairwise query interactions and samplingtechniques to predict resource contention under various query mixes and concurrency …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,114
Semcast: Semantic multicast for content-based data dissemination,Olga Papaemmanouil; Ugur Cetintemel,We address the problem of content-based dissemination of highly-distributed; high-volumedata streams for stream-based monitoring applications and large-scale data delivery.Existing content-based dissemination approaches commonly rely on distributed filteringtrees that require filtering at all brokers on the tree. We present a new semantic multicastapproach that eliminates the need for content-based filtering at interior brokers andfacilitates fine-grained control over the construction of efficient dissemination trees. Thecentral idea is to split the incoming data streams (based on their contents; rates; anddestinations) and then spread the pieces across multiple channels; each of which isimplemented as an independent dissemination tree. We present the basic design andevaluation of SemCast; an overlay-network based system that implements this semantic …,Data Engineering; 2005. ICDE 2005.

Explore-by-example: An automatic query steering framework for interactive data exploration,Kyriaki Dimitriadou; Olga Papaemmanouil; Yanlei Diao,Abstract Interactive Data Exploration (IDE) is a key ingredient of a diverse set of discovery-oriented applications; including ones from scientific computing and evidence-basedmedicine. In these applications; data discovery is a highly ad hoc interactive process whereusers execute numerous exploration queries using varying predicates aiming to balance thetrade-off between collecting all relevant information and reducing the size of returned data.Therefore; there is a strong need to support these human-in-the-loop applications byassisting their navigation in the data to find interesting objects.

Skew-aware join optimization for array databases,Jennie Duggan; Olga Papaemmanouil; Leilani Battle; Michael Stonebraker,Abstract Science applications are accumulating an ever-increasing amount ofmultidimensional data. Although some of it can be processed in a relational database; muchof it is better suited to array-based engines. As such; it is important to optimize the queryprocessing of these systems. This paper focuses on efficient query processing of joinoperations within an array database. These engines invariably``chunk''their data intomultidimensional tiles that they use to efficiently process spatial queries. As such; traditionalrelational algorithms need to be substantially modified to take advantage of array tiles.Moreover; most n-dimensional science data is unevenly distributed in array space becauseits underlying observations rarely follow a uniform pattern. It is crucial that the optimization ofarray joins be skew-aware.

In this paper; we study the problem in the context of shared processingenvironments; where query operators could be used by multiple applications. In theseenvironments; run-time modifications on the query deployment add new challenges.Applications with strict and potentially conflicting QoS requirements may share operators.Hence; operator placement decisions must be fast; adaptive to network conditions; and well-coordinated in order to guarantee the QoS expectations.

Optmark: A toolkit for benchmarking query optimizers,Zhan Li; Olga Papaemmanouil; Mitch Cherniack,Abstract Query optimizers have long been considered as among the most complexcomponents of a database engine; while the assessment of an optimizer's quality remains achallenging task. Indeed; existing performance benchmarks for database engines (like TPCbenchmarks) produce a performance assessment of the query runtime system rather than itsquery optimizer. To address this challenge; this paper introduces OptMark; a toolkit forevaluating the quality of a query optimizer. OptMark is designed to offer a number ofdesirable properties. First; it decouples the quality of an optimizer from the quality of itsunderlying execution engine. Second it evaluates independently both the effectiveness of anoptimizer (ie; quality of the chosen plans) and its efficiency (ie; optimization time).

Deep Reinforcement Learning for Join Order Enumeration,Ryan Marcus; Olga Papaemmanouil,Abstract: Join order selection plays a significant role in query performance. Many moderndatabase engine query optimizers use join order enumerators; cost models; and cardinalityestimators to choose join orderings; each of which is based on painstakingly hand-tunedheuristics and formulae. Additionally; these systems typically employ static algorithms thatignore the end result (they do not" learn from their mistakes"). In this paper; we argue thatexisting deep reinforcement learning techniques can be applied to query planning. Thesetechniques can automatically tune themselves; alleviating a massive human effort. Further;deep reinforcement learning techniques naturally take advantage of feedback; learning fromtheir successes and failures.

Therefore;IDE can easily become an extremely labor and resource intensive process. To support theseapplications; we introduce a framework that assists users by automatically navigating themthrough the data set and allows them to identify relevant objects without formulating dataretrieval queries. Our approach relies on user relevance feedback on data samples to modeluser interests and strategically collects more samples to refine the model while minimizingthe user effort. The system leverages decision tree classifiers to generate an effective usermodel that balances the trade-off between identifying all relevant objects and reducing thesize of final returned (relevant and irrelevant) objects.

Devel-op: An optimizer development environment,Zhibo Peng; Mitch Cherniack; Olga Papaemmanouil,Recent advances in the underlying architectures of database management systems (DBMS)have motivated the redesign of key DBMS components such as the query optimizer.Optimizers are inherently difficult to build and maintain; and yet there exists no softwareengineering tools to facilitate their development. In this paper; we introduce a [Devel]opment Environment for Query [Op] timizers (Devel-Op) designed to facilitate the rapidprototyping; profiling and benchmarking of optimizers. Our current version of the tool permitsdeclarative specification and generation of two key optimizer components (the logical planenumerator and physical plan generator) as well as debugging and visualization tools forprofiling generated components.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,*
A development environment for query optimizers.,Olga Papaemmanouil; Nga Tran; Mitch Cherniack,ABSTRACT New research has emerged that revisits the design of various components of adata management system to determine how their designs can exploit the targetedapplications and underlying architecture of that system. To support this effort; we introduce adevelopment environment that supports the rapid prototyping; evaluation and refinement ofquery optimizer components for targeted data management systems. The key features of thisdevelopment environment are component generator tools that process declarativespecifications of the components; component-specific benchmarks and profiling tools. Wedescribe some initial results specific to one optimizer component (the join plan enumerator)and we present some preliminary thoughts about the remaining environment design.,DBTest,2010,*
XFlow: Internet-Scale Extensible Stream Processing,Olga Papaemmanouil; Ugur Cetintemel; John Jannotti,Abstract Existing stream processing systems are designed for clustered deployments; andcannot adequately meet the scalability and adaptivity requirements of Internet-scalemonitoring applications. Furthermore; these systems are optimized for a specific metric;which may limit their applicability to diverse applications and environments. This paperpresents XFlow; a generic distributed data collection; processing; and dissemination systemthat addresses these limitations. XFlow can express and optimize a variety of globaloptimization metrics and constraints. It uses decentralized algorithms that work on localized;aggregated views of the system; while avoiding local optima. The system progressivelyrefines the query deployment; the structure of the underlying overlay network; as well as thestatistics collection process; based on the desired objectives.

Adaptive Overlays for Shared Stream Processing Environments,Olga Papaemmanouil; Sujoy Basu; Sujata Banerjee,ABSTRACT Large-scale overlays has become a powerful paradigm for deploying streamprocessing applications in wide-area environments. The dynamic nature of these systemsmakes it difficult to guarantee the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of each application.In this work we present a framework for distributing stream processing applications; whereprocessing components and stream flows could be shared across multiple applications. Inour approach; nodes coordinate to precompute alternative network deployments for eachapplication that respect both node constraints and the applications' QoS requirements.Given this set of alternative deployments; nodes can react fast to changes on the networkconditions; workload or application expectation.,*,2008,*

Meanwhile; with advances inpervasive technology; mobile devices; such as mobile phones; tablets; and PDA; havebecome extremely popular. These mobile devices can work as sensors to collect varioustypes of data; such as pictures; videos; audios and texts. Therefore; in crowdsourcing; arequester can unitize power of mobile devices and their location information to ask for datarelated a specific location; subsequently; the mobile users who would like to perform the taskwill travel to the target location and collect the data (videos; audios; or pictures); which isthen sent to the requester. This type of crowdsourcing is called spatial crowdsourcing …,*,*,*

Efficiently managing this deluge of data has become key tounderstand the phenomena they are studying. Scientists in the simulation sciences; forexample; build increasingly big and detailed models; as detailed as the hardware allows;but they lack the efficient technology to update and analyze them. In this paper we discusshow innovative data management techniques we have developed; enable scientists to buildand analyze bigger and more detailed spatial models and how these techniques ultimatelyaccelerate discovery in the simulation sciences. These include spatial join methods (inmemory and on disk); techniques for the efficient navigation in detailed meshes; an index …,*,*,*
