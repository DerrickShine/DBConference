Context interchange: New features and formalisms for the intelligent integration of information,Cheng Hian Goh; Stéphane Bressan; Stuart Madnick; Michael Siegel,Abstract The Context Interchange strategy presents a novel perspective for mediated dataaccess in which semantic conflicts among heterogeneous systems are not identified a priori;but are detected and reconciled by a context mediator through comparison of contextsaxioms corresponding to the systems engaged in data exchange. In this article; we showthat queries formulated on shared views; export schema; and shared “ontologies” can bemediated in the same way using the Context Interchange framework. The proposedframework provides a logic-based object-oriented formalsim for representing and reasoningabout data semantics in disparate systems; and has been validated in a prototypeimplementation providing mediated data access to both traditional and web-basedinformation sources.,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),1999,392
Indexing the edges—a simple and yet efficient approach to high-dimensional indexing,Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Cui Yu; Stephane Bressan,Abstract In this paper; we propose a new tunable index scheme; called iMinMax (&Ogr;); thatmaps points in high dimensional spaces to single dimension values determined by theirmaximum or minimum values among all dimensions. By varying the tuning “knob” &Ogr;; wecan obtain different family of iMinMax structures that are optimized for different distributionsof data sets. For a d-dimensional space; a range query need to be transformed into dsubqueries. However; some of these subqueries can be pruned away without evaluation;further enhancing the efficiency of the scheme. Experimental results show that iMinMax(&Ogr;) can outperform the more complex Pyramid technique by a wide margin.,Proceedings of the nineteenth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2000,102

Context knowledge representation and reasoning in the context interchange system,Stephane Bressan; Cheng Goh; Natalia Levina; Stuart Madnick; Ahmed Shah; Michael Siegel,Abstract The Context Interchange Project presents a unique approach to the problem ofsemantic conflict resolution among multiple heterogeneous data sources. The systempresents a semantically meaningful view of the data to the receivers (eg user applications)for all the available data sources. The semantic conflicts are automatically detected andreconciled by a Context Mediator using the context knowledge associated with both the datasources and the data receivers. The results are collated and presented in the receivercontext. The current implementation of the system provides access to flat files; classicalrelational databases; on-line databases; and web services. An example application; usingactual financial information sources; is described along with a detailed description of theoperation of the system for an example query.,Applied Intelligence,2000,100
XOO7: Applying OO7 Benchmark to XML Query Processing Tools,Stéphane Bressan; Gillian Dobbie; Zoé Lacroix; Mong Li Lee; Ying Guang Li; Ullas Nambiar; Bimlesh Wadhwa,If XML is to play the critical role of the lingua franca for Internet data interchange that manypredict; it is necessary to start designing and adopting benchmarks allowing the comparativeperformance analysis of the tools being developed and proposed.

The XOO7 benchmark,Stéphane Bressan; Mong Li Lee; Ying Guang Li; Zoé Lacroix; Ullas Nambiar,Abstract As XML becomes the standard for electronic data interchange; benchmarks areneeded to provide a comparative performance analysis of XML Management Systems(XMLMS). Typically a benchmark should adhere to four criteria: relevance; portability;scalability and simplicity [1]. The data structure of a benchmark for XML must be complexenough to capture the characteristics of XML data representation. Data sets should be invarious sizes. Benchmark queries should only be defined with the primitives of thelanguage.,*,2003,59
Mining term association rules for automatic global query expansion: methodology and preliminary results,Jie Wei; Stéphane Bressan; Beng Chin Ooi,The authors are looking at the mining of association between terms for the automaticexpansion of queries. The technique used for the discovery of the associations isassociation rule mining (R. Agrawal et al.; 1996). The technique proposed is more flexiblethan previous techniques based on term co-occurrence since it takes into account not onlythe co-occurrence frequency but also the confidence and direction of the association rules.We have been able to consistently improve the effectiveness of the retrieval over the set of48 test queries on the Associated Press 1990 news wires corpus of the TREC4 benchmarkby query expansion using term association rules.,Web Information Systems Engineering; 2000.

Rule-assisted prefetching in web-server caching,Bin Lan; Stephane Bressan; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,ABSTRACT Web servers manage large number of documents of widely variable sizes.Moreover; the access patterns on the documents may also changeover time. While somedocuments are highly popular over a prolonged period of time; we expect newly addeddocuments to increase in popularity while demand for most older documents decreases. It istherefore important to design e ective caching strategy at the web server. In this paper; wepresent our approach to the problem. Our main contribution lies in the design of a novelprefetching strategy; called RAP. RAP identi es a set of association rules from the Webserver's access log. Unlike existing mining strategy; RAP's miner values recently added logrecords more than earlier log records. Based on the rules; RAP predicts and prefetchesdocuments from users initial requests. We conducted extensive study to evaluate RAP …,Proceedings of the ninth international conference on Information and knowledge management,2000,52
Making web servers pushier,Bin Lan; Stephane Bressan; Beng Chin Ooi; YC Tay,Abstract The success of the World Wide Web measured in terms of the number of its usersand of the resulting traffic increase is only commensurate to the patience required whensitting in front of one's computer; waiting for a document to be down-loaded. If one couldidentify the typical access patterns for a set of documents on a Web server; the server coulduse or extend the existing protocols to accordingly pre-fetch or push documents to thebrowsers and proxy servers. In this paper; we present and evaluate a strategy for makingWeb servers “pushier”. Which document is to be pushed is determined by a set ofassociation rules mined from a sample of the access log of the Web server. Once a rule ofthe form “Document A→ Document B” has been identified and selected; the Web serverdecides to push “Document2” if “Document1” is requested. The strategy is individual user …,International Workshop on Web Usage Analysis and User Profiling,1999,50
Fast random graph generation,Sadegh Nobari; Xuesong Lu; Panagiotis Karras; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract Today; several database applications call for the generation of random graphs. Afundamental; versatile random graph model adopted for that purpose is the Erdős-Rényi Γ v;p model. This model can be used for directed; undirected; and multipartite graphs; with andwithout self-loops; it induces algorithms for both graph generation and sampling; hence isuseful not only in applications necessitating the generation of random structures but also forsimulation; sampling and in randomized algorithms. However; the commonly advocatedalgorithm for random graph generation under this model performs poorly when generatinglarge graphs; and fails to make use of the parallel processing capabilities of modernhardware. In this paper; we propose PPreZER; an alternative; data parallel algorithm forrandom graph generation under the Erdős-Rényi model; designed and implemented in a …,Proceedings of the 14th international conference on extending database technology,2011,48
Current approaches to XML management,Ullas Nambiar; Zoé Lacroix; Stéphane Bressan; Mong Li Lee; Yingguang Li,The Extensible Markup Language has become the standard for information interchange onthe Web. We study the data-and document-centric uses of XML management systems(XMLMS). We want to provide XML data users with a guideline for choosing the datamanagement system that best meets their needs. Because the systems we test are first-generation approaches; we suggest a hypothetical design for a useful XML database thatcould use all the expressive power of XML and XML query languages.,IEEE Internet Computing,2002,48

Source Attribution for Querying Against Semi-structured Documents.,Thomas Lee; Stéphane Bressan; Stuart E Madnick,Abstract Mediation architectures like the Context Interchange research project; from whichthis work stems; integrate disparate information sources; hiding distribution and reconcilingheterogeneity. As a result of transparent access; the notion of distinct sources oftendisappears from queries and results. However; there are situations where users orapplications do need to know the sources from which a particular datum is drawn: forexample; enforcement of intellectual property; evaluation of data quality or measurement ofthe timeliness of data. In this paper; we define attribution as the association of a value in theresult of a query with the sources either from which the data was extracted or whichcontributed to the selection. Motivated by multisource querying; attribution has particularapplicability in the context of the World Wide Web.

Fast identity anonymization on graphs,Xuesong Lu; Yi Song; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract Liu and Terzi proposed the notion of k-degree anonymity to address the problem ofidentity anonymization in graphs. A graph is k-degree anonymous if and only if each of itsvertices has the same degree as that of; at least; k-1 other vertices. The anonymizationproblem is to transform a non-k-degree anonymous graph into ak-degree anonymous graphby adding or deleting a minimum number of edges. Liu and Terzi proposed an algorithm thatremains a reference for k-degree anonymization. The algorithm consists of two phases. Thefirst phase anonymizes the degree sequence of the original graph. The second phaseconstructs ak-degree anonymous graph with the anonymized degree sequence by addingedges to the original graph. In this work; we propose a greedy algorithm that anonymizes theoriginal graph by simultaneously adding edges to the original graph and anonymizing its …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2012,38
Scalable parallel minimum spanning forest computation,Sadegh Nobari; Thanh-Tung Cao; Panagiotis Karras; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract The proliferation of data in graph form calls for the development of scalable graphalgorithms that exploit parallel processing environments. One such problem is thecomputation of a graph's minimum spanning forest (MSF). Past research has proposedseveral parallel algorithms for this problem; yet none of them scales to large; high-densitygraphs. In this paper we propose a novel; scalable; parallel MSF algorithm for undirectedweighted graphs. Our algorithm leverages Prim's algorithm in a parallel fashion;concurrently expanding several subsets of the computed MSF. Our effort focuses onminimizing the communication among different processors without constraining the localgrowth of a processor's computed subtree.

TOUCH: in-memory spatial join by hierarchical data-oriented partitioning,Sadegh Nobari; Farhan Tauheed; Thomas Heinis; Panagiotis Karras; Stéphane Bressan; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Efficient spatial joins are pivotal for many applications and particularly important forgeographical information systems or for the simulation sciences where scientists work withspatial models. Past research has primarily focused on disk-based spatial joins; efficient in-memory approaches; however; are important for two reasons: a) main memory has grown solarge that many datasets fit in it and b) the in-memory join is a very time-consuming part of alldisk-based spatial joins. In this paper we develop TOUCH; a novel in-memory spatial joinalgorithm that uses hierarchical data-oriented space partitioning; thereby keeping both itsmemory footprint and the number of comparisons low. Our results show that TOUCHoutperforms known in-memory spatial-join algorithms as well as in-memory implementationsof disk-based join approaches.

Efficient distributed reputation scheme for peer-to-peer systems,Chu Yee Liau; Xuan Zhou; Stéphane Bressan; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Reputation systems for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks are relatively new. Most of theexisting systems are centrally controlled hence raising scalability issues and single points offailure. In this paper we present a completely decentralized reputation scheme for P2Pnetworks. The system is based on a certificate; RCert; which is a document that resides on aparticipating P2P node; which consists of information ratings collected from previoustransactions with other peers. Central to the scheme is the concept of Public KeyInfrastructure (PKI); upon on which much of the mechanism is based. In order to facilitateupdates of RCert certificates; we present two protocols; RCertP and RCertPX. RCertP doesnot prevent the node from using older copies of RCert. An extended version; RCertPX;solves this problem by keeping track of the latest timestamp.,International Conference Human Society@ Internet,2003,35
Answering queries in context,Stéphane Bressan; Cheng Hian Goh,Abstract The emergence of the Internet as the de facto Global Information Infrastructureenables the construction of decision support systems that leverage on the panoply of on-lineinformation sources. This highly dynamic environment presents a critical need for a flexibleand scalable strategy for integrating the disparate information sources while respecting theirautonomy. The Context Interchange strategy addresses above concerns with an emphasison resolving problems arising from semantic heterogeneity; ie inconsistencies arising fromdifferences in the representation and interpretation of data. This is accomplished using threeelements: a shared vocabulary for the underlying application domain (in the form of adomain model); a formal object-relational data model (coin); and an object-deductivelanguage (coinl).

Context interchange: Representing and reasoning about data semantics in heterogeneous systems,Cheng Hian Goh,Abstract The context iNterchange (coin) strategy [44; 48] presents a novel perspective formediated data access in which semantic conflicts among heterogeneous systems are notidentified a priori; but are detected and reconciled by a Context Mediator throughcomparison of con-texts associated with any two systems engaged in data exchajige. In thispaper; we present a formal characterization and reconstruction of this strategy in a COINframework; based on a deductive object-oriented data model and language called COIN.The COINframework provides a logical formalism for representing data semantics in distinctcontexts. We show that this presents a well-founded basis for reasoning about semanticdisparities in heterogeneous systems. In addition; it combines the best features of loose-andtight-coupling approaches in defining an integration strategy that is scalable; extensible …,*,1996,32
Sensitive label privacy protection on social network data,Yi Song; Panagiotis Karras; Qian Xiao; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract This paper is motivated by the recognition of the need for a finer grain and morepersonalized privacy in data publication of social networks. We propose a privacy protectionscheme that not only prevents the disclosure of identity of users but also the disclosure ofselected features in users' profiles. An individual user can select which features of her profileshe wishes to conceal. The social networks are modeled as graphs in which users arenodes and features are labels. Labels are denoted either as sensitive or as non-sensitive.We treat node labels both as background knowledge an adversary may possess; and assensitive information that has to be protected. We present privacy protection algorithms thatallow for graph data to be published in a form such that an adversary who possessesinformation about a node's neighborhood cannot safely infer its identity and its sensitive …,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2012,30
A random walk on the red carpet: rating movies with user reviews and pagerank,Derry Tanti Wijaya; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract Although PageRank has been designed to estimate the popularity of Web pages; itis a general algorithm that can be applied to the analysis of other graphs other than one ofhypertext documents. In this paper; we explore its application to sentiment analysis andopinion mining: ie the ranking of items based on user textual reviews. We first proposevarious techniques using collocation and pivot words to extract a weighted graph of termsfrom user reviews and to account for positive and negative opinions. We refer to this graphas the sentiment graph. Using PageRank and a very small set of adjectives (such as'good';'excellent'; etc.) we rank the different items. We illustrate and evaluate our approachusing reviews of box office movies by users of a popular movie review site. The results showthat our approach is very effective and that the ranking it computes is comparable to the …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2008,29
Accelerating queries by pruning XML documents,Stéphane Bressan; Barbara Catania; Zoé Lacroix; Ying Guang Li; Anna Maddalena,Abstract Some XML query processors operate on an internal representation of XMLdocuments and can leverage neither the XML storage structure nor the possible accessmethods dedicated to this storage structure. Such query processors are often used inorganizations that usually process transient XML documents received from otherorganizations. In this paper; we propose a different approach to accelerating queryexecution on XML source documents in such environments. The approach is based on thenotion of query equivalence of XML documents with respect to a query. Under thisequivalence; we propose two different document transformation strategies which prune partsof the documents irrelevant to the query; just before executing the query itself. The proposedtransformations are implemented and evaluated using a two-level index structure: a …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2005,29
Efficient XML data management: an analysis,Ullas Nambiar; Zoé Lacroix; Stéphane Bressan; Mong Li Lee; Ying Guang Li,Abstract With XML rapidly gaining popularity as the standard for data exchange on the WorldWide Web; a variety of XML management systems (XMLMS) are becoming available. Thechoice of an XMLMS is made difficult by the significant difference in the expressive power ofthe queries and the performance shown by these XMLMS. Most XMLMS are legacy systems(mostly relational) extended to load; query; and publish data in XML format. A few are nativeXMLMS and capture all the characteristics of XML data representation. This paper looks atexpressive power and efficiency of various XMLMS. The performance analysis relies on thetestbed provided by XOO7; a benchmark derived from OO7 to capture both data anddocument characteristics of XML.

Querying high-dimensional data in single-dimensional space,Cui Yu; Stéphane Bressan; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract In this paper; we propose a new tunable index scheme; called iMinMax ($\theta $);that maps points in high-dimensional spaces to single-dimensional values determined bytheir maximum or minimum values among all dimensions. By varying the tuning “knob”;$\theta $; we can obtain different families of iMinMax structures that are optimized fordifferent distributions of data sets. The transformed data can then be indexed using existingsingle-dimensional indexing structures such as the B+-trees. Queries in the high-dimensional space have to be transformed into queries in the single-dimensional space andevaluated there. We present efficient algorithms for evaluating window queries as rangequeries on the single-dimensional space. We conducted an extensive performance study toevaluate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

Not So Unique in the Crowd: a Simple and Effective Algorithm for Anonymizing Location Data.,Yi Song; Daniel Dahlmeier; Stephane Bressan,ABSTRACT We study the problem of privacy in human mobility data; ie; the re-identificationrisk of individuals in a trajectory dataset. We quantify the risk of being re-identified by themetric of uniqueness; the fraction of individuals in the dataset which are uniquely identifiableby a set of spatio-temporal points. We explore a human mobility dataset for more than half amillion individuals over a period of one week. The location of an individual is specified everyfifteen minutes. The results show that human mobility traces are highly identifiable with onlya few spatio-temporal points. We propose a modification-based anonymization approachthat is based on shorting the trajectories to reduce the risk of reidentification and informationdisclosure.

Sampling connected induced subgraphs uniformly at random,Xuesong Lu; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract A recurrent challenge for modern applications is the processing of large graphs.The ability to generate representative samples of smaller size is useful not only tocircumvent scalability issues but also; per se; for statistical analysis and other data miningtasks. For such purposes adequate sampling techniques must be devised. We areinterested; in this paper; in the uniform random sampling of a connected subgraph from agraph. We require that the sample contains a prescribed number of vertices. The sampledgraph is the corresponding induced graph.

Named entity recognition for the Indonesian language: combining contextual; morphological and part-of-speech features into a knowledge engineering approach,Indra Budi; Stéphane Bressan; Gatot Wahyudi; Zainal A Hasibuan; Bobby AA Nazief,Abstract We present a novel named entity recognition approach for the Indonesianlanguage. We call the new method InNER for Indonesian Named Entity Recognition. InNERis based on a set of rules capturing the contextual; morphological; and part of speechknowledge necessary in the process of recognizing named entities in Indonesian texts.

Publishing trajectories with differential privacy guarantees,Kaifeng Jiang; Dongxu Shao; Stéphane Bressan; Thomas Kister; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract The pervasiveness of location-acquisition technologies has made it possible tocollect the movement data of individuals or vehicles. However; it has to be carefullymanaged to ensure that there is no privacy breach. In this paper; we investigate the problemof publishing trajectory data under the differential privacy model. A straightforward solution isto add noise to a trajectory-this can be done either by adding noise to each coordinate of theposition; to each position of the trajectory; or to the whole trajectory. However; such naiveapproaches result in trajectories with zigzag shapes and many crossings; making thepublished trajectories of little practical use. We introduce a mechanism called SDD(Sampling Distance and Direction); which is ε-differentially private. SDD samples a suitabledirection and distance at each position to publish the next possible position.

Automatic learning of stemming rules for the indonesian language,Lily Suryana Indradjaja; Stephane Bressan,Abstract We present a method for the automatic learning of stemming rules for theIndonesian language. The learning process uses an unlabelled corpus. In the first phase thecandidate (word; stem) pairs are automatically extracted from a set of online documents.This phase uses a dictionary but is nevertheless not trivial because of morphing. In thesecond phase the rules are induced from the thus obtained list of pairs of words with theirrespective stems. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method for different sizes of thetraining set with different settings on the thresholds of the support and confidence of eachrule. We discuss how these variables affect the quantity and quality of the rules produced.,Proceedings of the 17th Pacific Asia Conference on Language; Information and Computation,2003,19
Efficient and adaptive processing of multiple continuous queries,Wee Hyong Tok; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract Continuous queries are queries executed on data streams within a potentially open-ended time interval specified by the user and are usually long running. The data streams arelikely to exhibit fluctuating characteristics such as varying inter-arrival times; as well asvarying data characteristics during the query execution. In the presence of suchunpredictable factors; continuous query systems must still be able to efficiently handle largenumber of queries; as well as to offer acceptable individual query performance. In this paper;we propose and discuss a novel framework; called AdaptiveCQ; for the efficient processingof multiple continuous queries. In our framework; multiple queries share intermediate resultsat a fine level of granularity. Unlike previous approaches to sharing or reusing that relied onmaterialization to disk; AdaptiveCQ allows on-the-fly sharing of results.

A SAT approach to query optimization in mediator systems,Steven Prestwich; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract Mediator systems integrate distributed; heterogeneous and autonomous datasources; but their effective use requires the solution of hard query optimization problems.This is usually done in two phases: the selection of a set of data sources is similar to a setcovering problem; and their ordering into a feasible and efficient query is a capabilityrestricted join order problem. However; a two-phase approach is unlikely to find optimumqueries. We describe a new single-phase approach that; under a simple cost model; can beencoded and solved as a SAT problem. Results on artificial benchmarks indicate that this isan interesting problem from the encoding and search viewpoints; and we use them toaddress three of the ten SAT challenges posed by Selman; Kautz and McAllester in 1997.,Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence,2005,18
Efficient range queries and fast lookup services for scalable p2p networks,Chu Yee Liau; Wee Siong Ng; Yanfeng Shu; Kian-Lee Tan; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract In this paper we propose a Peer-To-Peer (P2P) architecture using a tree basedindexing scheme which allows for efficient lookup and range query services on documentsin the network. We also present a basic load balancing technique by assigning a new nodethat joins the network to a heavily loaded area to take on some of load of its peers. Given aquery; we need to search only a small number of nodes to locate matching documentshence making the architecture scalable. We also take into account the fact that nodes in aP2P environment need not have the same capability. We implemented a simulator andperformed experiments to study to the performance of our proposed architecture. The resultsshow that our proposed architecture is scalable and highly efficient when handling rangequeries.,International Workshop on Databases; Information Systems; and Peer-to-Peer Computing,2004,17

The fixed incomeconceptual model included securities ranging in complexity from Treasury bills tocollateralized mortgage obligations; as well as standard and proprietary analyticmethodologies and calculations. All information; whether computed or retrieved fromdatabases; was offered to clients in the form of attributes of conceptual entities. Clientpreference entities and attributes were used to control selection among conceptually …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,1998,17
Global atlas: Calibrating and indexing documents from the internet in the cartographic paradigm,Fiona Lee; Stéphane Bressan; Beng Chin Ooi,Global Atlas is a geographical search engine. It indexes maps; satellite and aerial pictures;as well as HTML documents available on the World Wide Web. The Global Atlas leverageson the cartographic paradigm to provide a very natural support for indexing; searching andsharing information. It allows the design of intuitive user interfaces and the use of naturalvisual feedback. HTML documents are best indexed according to the geographical regionsto which they are topically associated; and maps in the form of GIF and JPEG images areindexed to create a huge patchwork of maps. However; maps come in a variety ofunspecified coordinate systems and projections. This entails calibrating different maps to asingle reference coordinate system. We discuss the design issues in building ageographical search engine; and focus on the calibration of maps.,Web Information Systems Engineering; 2000.

A Procedure for Mediation of Queries to Sources in Disparate Contexts.,Stephane Bressan; Cheng Hian Goh; Thomas Lee; Stuart E Madnick; Michael Siegel,Abstract This paper discusses the algorithm we are using for the mediation of queries todisparate information sources in a Context Interchange system; where information sourcesmay have different interpretations arising from their respective context. Queries are assumedto be formulated without regard for semantic heterogeneity; and are rewritten tocorresponding mediated queries by taking into account the semantics of data codified inaxioms associated with sources and receivers (the corresponding context theories). Ourapproach draws upon recent advances in abductive logic programming and presents anintegration of techniques for query rewriting and semantic query optimization. We alsodemonstrate how this can be efficiently implemented using the constraint logic programmingsystem ECLiPSe.,ILPS,1997,16
DBNet: A service-oriented database architecture,Wee Hyong Tok; Stephane Bressan,At the convergence of peer-to-peer (P2P) and service oriented architectures is the idea ofeffectively and efficiently managing distribution; heterogeneity and autonomy of informationsources and services. In this paper; we take the point of view that next generation databasemanagement systems (DBMS) should be a federation of distributed; heterogeneous andautonomous components. Such components constitute Web database services. Wechallenge the conventional notions of what constitute a DBMS; and presents the fullspectrum of possible DBMSs based on such service-oriented database architecture (SODA).We examine the issues and challenges of SODA. Finally; we propose one possible instanceof SODA that we call DBNet. In order to illustrate some of the research issues involved; wepresent query processing and optimization techniques that we have devised for DBNet,Database and Expert Systems Applications; 2006.

Interactive discovery and composition of complex web services,Sergey Stupnikov; Leonid Kalinichenko; Stephane Bressan,Abstract Among the most important expected benefits of a global service orientedarchitecture leveraging web service standards is an increased level of automation in thediscovery; composition; verification; monitoring and recovery of services for the realization ofcomplex processes. Most existing works addressing this issue are based on the OntologyWeb Language for Services (OWL-S) and founded on description logic. Because thediscovery and composition tasks are designed to be fully automatic; the solutions are limitedto the realization of rather simple processes. To overcome this deficiency; this paperproposes an approach in which service capability descriptions are based on full first orderpredicate logic and enable an interactive discovery and composition of services for therealization of complex processes. The proposed approach is well suited when automatic …,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2006,15

Anomaly detection and identification scheme for VM live migration in cloud infrastructure,Tian Huang; Yongxin Zhu; Yafei Wu; Stéphane Bressan; Gillian Dobbie,Abstract Virtual machines (VM) offer simple and practical mechanisms to address many ofthe manageability problems of leveraging heterogeneous computing resources. VM livemigration is an important feature of virtualization in cloud computing: it allows administratorsto transparently tune the performance of the computing infrastructure. However; VM livemigration may open the door to security threats. Classic anomaly detection schemes such asLocal Outlier Factors (LOF) fail in detecting anomalies in the process of VM live migration. Totackle such critical security issues; we propose an adaptive scheme that mines data from thecloud infrastructure in order to detect abnormal statistics when VMs are migrated to newhosts. In our scheme; we extend classic Local Outlier Factors (LOF) approach by definingnovel dimension reasoning (DR) rules as DR-LOF to figure out the possible sources of …,Future Generation Computer Systems,2016,14
On the privacy and utility of anonymized social networks,Yi Song; Sadegh Nobari; Xuesong Lu; Panagiotis Karras; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract You are on Facebook or you are out. Of course; this assessment is controversialand its rationale arguable. It is nevertheless not far; for many of us; from the reason behindour joining social media and publishing and sharing details of our professional and privatelives. Not only the personal details we may reveal but also the very structure of the networksthemselves are sources of invaluable information for any organization wanting tounderstand and learn about social groups; their dynamics and their members. Theseorganizations may or may not be benevolent. It is therefore important to devise; design andevaluate solutions that guarantee some privacy. One approach that attempts to reconcile thedifferent stakeholders' requirement is the publication of a modified graph.

Ricochet: A family of unconstrained algorithms for graph clustering,Derry Tanti Wijaya; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract Partitional graph clustering algorithms like K-means and Star necessitate a prioridecisions on the number of clusters and threshold for the weight of edges to be considered;respectively. These decisions are difficult to make and their impact on clusteringperformance is significant. We propose a family of algorithms for weighted graph clusteringthat neither requires a predefined number of clusters; unlike K-means; nor a threshold for theweight of edges; unlike Star. To do so; we use re-assignment of vertices as a haltingcriterion; as in K-means; and a metric for selecting clusters' seeds; as in Star. Pictorially; thealgorithms' strategy resembles the rippling of stones thrown in a pond; thus thename'Ricochet'. We evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms using standarddatasets and evaluate the impact of removing constraints by comparing the performance …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2009,14
RRPJ: Result-rate based progressive relational join,Wee Hyong Tok; Stéphane Bressan; Mong-Li Lee,Abstract Progressive join algorithms are join algorithms that produce results incrementallyas input data is available. Because they are non-blocking; they are particularly suitable foronline processing of data streams. Reference algorithms of this family are the symmetrichash join; the X-join and more recently; the rate-based progressive join (RPJ). While thesymmetric hash join introduces the idea of a symmetric processing of the input streams butassumes sufficient main memory; the X-Join suggests that the processing can scale to verylarge amounts of data if main memory is regularly flushed to disk; and a reactive/cleanupphase is triggered for disk-resident data. The X-join flushing strategy is based on a simplelargest-first strategy; where the largest partition is flushed to disk. The recently proposed RPJpredicts the main memory tuples or partitions that should be flushed to disk in order to …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,14
A framework for conditioning uncertain relational data,Ruiming Tang; Reynold Cheng; Huayu Wu; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract We propose a framework for representing conditioned probabilistic relational data.In this framework the existence of tuples in possible worlds is determined by Booleanexpressions composed from elementary events. The probability of a possible world iscomputed from the probabilities associated with these elementary events. In addition; a setof global constraints conditions the database. Conditioning is the formalization of theprocess of adding knowledge to a database. Some worlds may be impossible given theconstraints and the probabilities of possible worlds are accordingly re-defined. The newconstraints can come from the observation of the existence or non-existence of a tuple; fromthe knowledge of a specific rule; such as the existence of an exclusive set of tuples; or fromthe knowledge of a general rule; such as a functional dependency. We are therefore …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2012,12
Semantic XPath query transformation: opportunities and performance,Dung Xuan Thi Le; Stephane Bressan; David Taniar; Wenny Rahayu,Abstract In this paper we identify the opportunities for the semantic transformation of XPathqueries using the structural and explicit semantics defined in an XML schema. Ourclassification of transformation is the semantic path expression where a path can besemantically contracted; expanded or complemented. Among several applications of suchtransformations; an obvious one is the semantic optimization of XPath queries. Thetransformation is likely to result in an improved response time for a given system. Weempirically evaluate the gain or loss of performance of the identified transformations with tworepresentative off-the-shelf XML data management systems and XPath query processors.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,12

What you pay for is what you get,Ruiming Tang; Dongxu Shao; Stephane Bressan; Patrick Valduriez,Abstract In most data markets; prices are prescribed and accuracy is determined by the data.Instead; we consider a model in which accuracy can be traded for discounted prices:“whatyou pay for is what you get”. The data market model consists of data consumers; dataproviders and data market owners. The data market owners are brokers between the dataproviders and data consumers. A data consumer proposes a price for the data that sherequests. If the price is less than the price set by the data provider; then she gets anapproximate value. The data market owners negotiate the pricing schemes with the dataproviders. They implement these schemes for the computation of the discountedapproximate values. We propose a theoretical and practical pricing framework with itsalgorithms for the above mechanism. In this framework; the value published is randomly …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2013,11
Application of association rules mining to named entity recognition and co-reference resolution for the Indonesian language,Indra Budi; Stephane Bressan,In this paper; we propose a new method; association rules mining for Named EntityRecognition (NER) and co-reference resolution. The method uses several morphologicaland lexical features such as Pronoun Class (PC) and Name Class (NC); String Similarity(SP) and Position (P) in the text; into a vector of attributes. Applied to a corpus of newspaperin the Indonesian language; the method outperforms state-of-the-art maximum entropymethod in name entity recognition and is comparable with state-of-the-art machine learningmethods; decision tree; for co-reference resolution.,International Journal of Business Intelligence and Data Mining,2007,11
L-opacity: linkage-aware graph anonymization,Sadegh Nobari; Panagiotis Karras; Hwee Hwa PANG; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract The wealth of information contained in online social networks has created ademand for the publication of such data as graphs. Yet; publication; even after identitieshave been removed; poses a privacy threat. Past research has suggested ways to publishgraph data in a way that prevents the re-identification of nodes. However; even whenidentities are effectively hidden; an adversary may still be able to infer linkage betweenindividuals with sufficiently high confidence. In this paper; we focus on the privacy threatarising from such link disclosure. We suggest L-opacity; a sufficiently strong privacy modelthat aims to control an adversary's confidence on short multiedge linkages among nodes.We propose an algorithm with two variant heuristics; featuring a sophisticated look-aheadmechanism; which achieves the desired privacy guarantee after a few graph …,*,2014,10
The price is right,Ruiming Tang; Huayu Wu; Zhifeng Bao; Stéphane Bressan; Patrick Valduriez,Abstract Data is a modern commodity. Yet the pricing models in use on electronic datamarkets either focus on the usage of computing resources; or are proprietary; opaque; mostlikely ad hoc; and not conducive of a healthy commodity market dynamics. In this paper wepropose a generic data pricing model that is based on minimal provenance; ie minimal setsof tuples contributing to the result of a query. We show that the proposed model fulfillsdesirable properties such as contribution monotonicity; bounded-price and contributionarbitrage-freedom. We present a baseline algorithm to compute the exact price of a querybased on our pricing model. We show that the problem is NP-hard. We therefore devise;present and compare several heuristics. We conduct a comprehensive experimental study toshow their effectiveness and efficiency.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2013,10

Get a sample for a discount,Ruiming Tang; Antoine Amarilli; Pierre Senellart; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract While price and data quality should define the major trade-off for consumers in datamarkets; prices are usually prescribed by vendors and data quality is not negotiable. In thispaper we study a model where data quality can be traded for a discount. We focus on thecase of XML documents and consider completeness as the quality dimension. In our setting;the data provider offers an XML document; and sets both the price of the document and aweight to each node of the document; depending on its potential worth. The data consumerproposes a price. If the proposed price is lower than that of the entire document; then thedata consumer receives a sample; ie; a random rooted subtree of the document whoseselection depends on the discounted price and the weight of nodes. By requesting severalsamples; the data consumer can iteratively explore the data in the document. We show …,international conference on database and expert systems applications,2014,9
Financial Information Mediation: A case study of standards integration for Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment using the COIN mediation technology,Sajindra Jayasena; Stéphane Bressan; Stuart Madnick,Abstract By its very nature; financial information; like the money that it represents; changeshands. Each player in the financial industry; each bank; stock exchange; governmentagency; or insurance company operates its own financial information system or systems.Therefore the interoperation of financial information systems is the cornerstone of thefinancial services they support. E-services frameworks; such as web services; are anunprecedented opportunity for the flexible interoperation of financial systems. Naturally thecritical economic role and the complexity of financial information led to the development ofvarious standards. Yet standards alone are not the panacea: different groups of players usedifferent standards or different interpretations of the same standard.

The strategy is based on the adaptive routing Q-routing. The strategy usesreinforcement learning to estimate the cost of routing a request. Such a strategy is scalableonly if the routing indices are of reasonable size. We proposed and comparatively evaluatedthree methods for the pruning for the pruning of the routing indices.

Publishing trajectory with differential privacy: A priori vs. a posteriori sampling mechanisms,Dongxu Shao; Kaifeng Jiang; Thomas Kister; Stephane Bressan; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract It is now possible to collect and share trajectory data for any ship in the world byvarious means such as satellite and VHF systems. However; the publication of such dataalso creates new risks for privacy breach with consequences on the security and liability ofthe stakeholders. Thus; there is an urgent need to develop methods for preserving theprivacy of published trajectory data. In this paper; we propose and comparatively investigatetwo mechanisms for the publication of the trajectory of individual ships under differentialprivacy guarantees.

TheInternational Maritime Organisation (IMO) reports that over 90% of the world trade volume iscarried by merchant ships. The analysis of shipping networks therefore can createinvaluable insight into global trade. In this paper we study the appropriateness of variousgraph centrality measures to rate; compare and rank ports from various perspectives ofglobal shipping networks. In particular; we illustrate the potential of such analysis on theexample of shipping networks constructed from the schedules; readily available on theWorld Wide Web; of six shipping companies that transport 35–40% of the total volumetraded (in TEUs) worldwide.,International Journal of Business Intelligence and Data Mining,2012,8
A stratified approach to progressive approximate joins,Wee Hyong Tok; Stéphane Bressan; Mong-Li Lee,Abstract Users often do not require a complete answer to their query but rather only asample. They expect the sample to be either the largest possible or the most representative(or both) given the resources available. We call the query processing techniques that deliversuch results' approximate'. Processing of queries to streams of data is said tobe'progressive'when it can continuously produce results as data arrives.

Progressive spatial join,Wee Hyong Tok; Stephane Bressan; Mong Li Lee,In spatial data exploration and analysis; the system would present a user with initialpromising results and empower the user to modify runtime query parameters. The highdegree of interactivity would significantly reduce users' waiting time for results that are notuseful; and then having to re-issue a new query. To support this level of interaction duringquery processing; it necessitates the study of adaptive and progressive spatial queryprocessing techniques that can deliver initial results quickly and adapt to run-timefluctuations during the delivery of remote data. Our goal is to design a generic framework foradaptive and progressive spatial query processing.

Efficient certificate revocation: A p2p approach,Chu Yee Liau; Stéphane Bressan; Kian-Lee Tan; Chu Yee; L Stphane; BK lee Tan,Abstract—Certificate revocation is one of the many challenges faced by Public KeyInfrastructure (PKI). Certificate revocation is the action of declaring a certificate; which hasnot expired; is no longer valid due to various reasons ranging from change of relationshipbetween certificate issuer and the public key owner to compromised private keys of theassociated certificate to change of information contained in the certificate. All the revokedcertificates by the certificate issuer must be made available to all the end-entities; whichneed to verify a certificate. Many schemes have been proposed for certificate revocation;each with its own strenghts and weaknesses. Some of these schemes; althoughstraightforward and easy to implement; suffer when faced with the challenge of efficientdistribution of certificate revocation information.

Cost minimization and social fairness for spatial crowdsourcing tasks,Qing Liu; Talel Abdessalem; Huayu Wu; Zihong Yuan; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract Spatial crowdsourcing is an activity consisting in outsourcing spatial tasks to acommunity of online; yet on-ground and mobile; workers. A spatial task is characterized bythe requirement that workers must move from their current location to a specified location toaccomplish the task. We study the assignment of spatial tasks to workers. A sequence of setsof spatial tasks is assigned to workers as they arrive. We want to minimize the cost incurredby the movement of the workers to perform the tasks. In the meanwhile; we are seekingsolutions that are socially fair. We discuss the competitiveness in terms of competitive ratioand social fairness of the Work Function Algorithm; the Greedy Algorithm; and theRandomized versions of the Greedy Algorithm to solve this problem. These onlinealgorithms are memory-less and are either inefficient or unfair. In this paper; we devise …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2016,7
An efficient and truthful pricing mechanism for team formation in crowdsourcing markets,Qing Liu; Tie Luo; Ruiming Tang; Stéphane Bressan,In a crowdsourcing market; a requester is looking to form a team of workers to perform acomplex task that requires a variety of skills. Candidate workers advertise their certified skillsand bid prices for their participation. We design four incentive mechanisms for selectingworkers to form a valid team (that can complete the task) and determining each individualworker's payment. We examine profitability; individual rationality; computational efficiency;and truthfulness for each of the four mechanisms. Our analysis shows that TruTeam; one ofthe four mechanisms; is superior to the others; particularly due to its computational efficiencyand truthfulness.

Twig’n join: Progressive query processing of multiple XML streams,Wee Hyong Tok; Stéphane Bressan; Mong-Li Lee,Abstract We propose a practical approach to the progressive processing of (FWR) XQueryqueries on multiple XML streams; called Twig'n Join (or TnJ). The query is decomposed intoa query plan combining several twig queries on the individual streams; followed by a multi-way join and a final twig query. The processing is itself accordingly decomposed into threepipelined stages progressively producing streams of XML fragments. Twig'n Join combinesthe advantages of the recently proposed TwigM algorithm and our previous work onrelational result-rate based progressive joins. In addition; we introduce a novel dynamicprobing technique; called Result-Oriented Probing (ROP); which determines an optimalprobing sequence for the multi-way join.

Towards a society of peers: Expert and interest groups in peer-to-peer systems,Achmad Nizar Hidayanto; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract The social behavior of peers in peer-to-peer network can be inferred from theobservable factors of the system and its components as it is created; lives and evolves.Following a social metaphor; it should be possible to use the observation of these behaviorsto organize the network of peers for purposes as various as improving the retrievalperformance; efficiently managing storage; improving robustness and increasing security; forinstance. In order to concretely illustrate this idea and to precisely quantify its benefits in aconcrete scenario; we consider the important example of the improvement of retrievalperformance. We propose an unstructured peer-to-peer architecture in which the system;adaptively and in a decentralized manner; learns the expertise and interest of peers; anddynamically re-organizes itself by creating efficient communities (groups) of peers.,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2007,7
Clustering web documents using co-citation; coupling; incoming; and outgoing hyperlinks: a comparative performance analysis of algorithms,Derry Tanti Wijaya; Stéphane Bressan,Querying search engines with the keyword “jaguars” returns results as diverse as web sitesabout cars; computer games; attack planes; American football; and animals. More and moresearch engines offer options to organize query results by categories or; given a document; toreturn a list of links to topically related documents. While information retrieval traditionallydefines similarity of documents in terms of contents; it seems natural to expect that the verystructure of the Web carries important information about the topical similarity of documents.Here we study the role of a matrix constructed from weighted co-citations (documentsreferenced by the same document); weighted couplings (documents referencing the samedocument); incoming; and outgoing links for the clustering of documents on the Web. Wepresent and discuss three methods of clustering based on this matrix construction using …,International Journal of Web Information Systems,2006,7
Exploiting local popularity to prune routing indices in peer-to-peer systems,Stephane Bressan; Achmad Nizar Hidayanto; Zainal A Hasibuan,Routing in unstructured peer-to-peer systems relies either on broadcasting (also calledflooding) or on routing indices. An approach using routing indices is only scalable if therouting indices are of manageable size. In this paper; we present a strategy to prune routingindices based on popularity of resources. Routing indices maintain routing information forqueries to the most popular resources; leaving queries to other resources to be routedrandomly. The popularity of resources at each node of a network is learnt by each routingindex; by means of a replacement strategy. We compare the performance of the localpopularity method against that of the global popularity method in pruning routing indices inboth static and dynamic environments. We compare the effectiveness and the efficiency oftwo standard replacement strategies: least frequently used (LFU) and least recently used …,Database and Expert Systems Applications; 2005.

Integrity constraint checking in Chimera,Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract Integrity constraints are general properties that a given database is expected tosatisfy. Integrity constraints can be implicit in the schema of the database or explicitlyexpressed as; for instance; logical formulae. Since the database is expected to be consistentwith respect to these properties; one important issue is the verification of integrity constraintsupon updates. Such a operation is called constraints verification or constraints checking.Constraint verification is potentially an expensive operation for all types of database and inparticular for deductive databases [34]; and deductive and object-oriented Databases(DOOD); where the modification of a single data can have a substantial impact on other databecause of the presence of deductive rules and inheritance. Chimera is one instance of aDOOD data model and language. It has been developed in the context of the ESPRIT …,International Workshop on Constraint Database Systems,1997,7
An effective and efficient parallel approach for random graph generation over GPUs,Stéphane Bressan; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Panagiotis Karras; Xuesong Lu; Sadegh Heyrani Nobari,Abstract The widespread usage of random graphs has been highlighted in the context ofdatabase applications for several years. This because such data structures turn out to bevery useful in a large family of database applications ranging from simulation to sampling;from analysis of complex networks to study of randomized algorithms; and so forth. Amongstothers; Erdős–Rényi Γ v; p is the most popular model to obtain and manipulate randomgraphs. Unfortunately; it has been demonstrated that classical algorithms for generatingErdős–Rényi based random graphs do not scale well in large instances and; in addition tothis; fail to make use of the parallel processing capabilities of modern hardware. Inspired bythis main motivation; in this paper we propose and experimentally assess a novel parallelalgorithm for generating random graphs under the Erdős–Rényi model that is designed …,Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing,2013,6
The configuration of networked publics on the web: evidence from the Greek Indignados movement,Xuesong Lu; Giorgos Cheliotis; Xiyue Cao; Yi Song; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract The Internet; and social media in particular; are frequently credited in publicdiscourse with being instrumental for the development and coordination of variouscontemporary social movements. We examine the evolution of Facebook activity in relationto the movement of the Greek Indignados of 2011; by collecting the electronic traces of theirpublic communications on Facebook pages for a period of 8 months. We analyze theresulting bipartite graphs consisting of users posting to pages; using social network analysis.We reveal some of the dynamics of structural properties of the network over time and explainwhat these mean for the configuration of networked publics on social network sites. Weconclude that the very early stages of activity are essential in determining this configuration;because users converge quickly and exclusively on a small number of pages.

Fast community detection,Yi Song; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract We propose an algorithm for the detection of communities in networks. Thealgorithm exploits degree and clustering coefficient of vertices as these metrics characterizedense connections; which; we hypothesize; are indicative of communities. Each vertex;independently; seeks the community to which it belongs by visiting its neighbour verticesand choosing its peers on the basis of their degrees and clustering coefficients. Thealgorithm is intrinsically data parallel. We devise a version for Graphics Processing Unit(GPU). We empirically evaluate the performance of our method. We measure and compareits efficiency and effectiveness to several state of the art community detection algorithms.Effectiveness is quantified by five metrics; namely; modularity; conductance; internal density;cut ratio and weighted community clustering. Efficiency is measured by the running time …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2013,5
Discovering semantics from XML,Luochen Li; Thuy Ngoc Le; Tok Wang Ling; Huayu Wu; Stephane Bressan,In database applications in general; and in applications using XML in particular; theavailability of a conceptual schema or of elements of semantics constitute invaluableleverage for improving the effectiveness; and sometimes the efficiency; of many tasksincluding query processing; keyword search and schema and data integration. The Object-Relationship-Attribute model for Semi-Structured data (ORA-SS) model is a conceptualmodel designed to capture the semantics of the important constructs in a variety of datamodels in general and in semi-structured data models in particular. It is specifically intendedto capture the semantics of object classes; object identifiers; relationship types; objectattributes and relationship attributes underlying XML schemas and data. For a givenapplication; we refer to the set of instances of these semantic concepts as the ORA …,*,2012,5
Twig’n join: Progressive query processing of multiple XML streams,Wee Hyong Tok; Stéphane Bressan; Mong-Li Lee,Abstract We propose a practical approach to the progressive processing of (FWR) XQueryqueries on multiple XML streams; called Twig'n Join (or TnJ). The query is decomposed intoa query plan combining several twig queries on the individual streams; followed by a multi-way join and a final twig query. The processing is itself accordingly decomposed into threepipelined stages progressively producing streams of XML fragments. Twig'n Join combinesthe advantages of the recently proposed TwigM algorithm and our previous work onrelational result-rate based progressive joins. In addition; we introduce a novel dynamicprobing technique; called Result-Oriented Probing (ROP); which determines an optimalprobing sequence for the multi-way join. This significantly reduces the amount of redundantprobing for results. We comparatively evaluate the performance of Twig'n Join using both …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2008,5
Adaptive double routing indices: Combining effectiveness and efficiency in p2p systems,Stephane Bressan; Achmad Nizar Hidayanto; Chu Yee Liau; Zainal A Hasibuan,Abstract Unstructured peer-to-peer systems rely on strategies and data structures (RoutingIndices) for the routing of requests in the network. For those requests corresponding toinformation retrieval queries; the emphasis can be either put on the effectiveness of therouting by privileging the relevance of the documents retrieved; or on the efficiency of therouting by privileging the response time. We propose in this paper a novel routing strategybased on adaptive Routing Indices. The Routing Indices are adaptive to the environment; ienetwork traffic; location; as well as relevance of the documents indexed; thanks to areinforcement learning approach to their maintenance. The strategy can be used to tune thecompromise between efficient and effective routing. It combines the estimation of theresponse time of routes with the estimation of the relevance of routes to keywords. We …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2004,5
A framework for modeling buffer replacement strategies,Stephane Bressan; Chong Leng Goh; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,ABSTRACT An e ective bu er management system is crucial for any database managementsystem. While much work has been expended to provide extensible data t ypes; extensiblequery languages and even extensible optimizers; there is very limited research in providingextensibility at the bu er management level. Supporting extensibility at the bu ermanagement level is equally; if not more; important as no single strategy can perform well inall applications e ciently. In this paper; we present a uniform framework for modeling bu erreplacement policies. The framework allows the bu er manager to be easily extended toprovide support for and ne-tuning of di erent replacement policies. Our work is novel in twoaspects.

Mining term association rules for global query expansion: A case study with topic 202 from TREC4,Jie Wie; Zhenxing Qin; Stephane Bressan; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract The sudden growth of the World Wide Web and its unprecedented popularity as ade facto global digital library exemplified both the strengths and weaknesses of theInformation Retrieval techniques used by popular search engines. Most queries are shortand incomplete attempts to describe or characterize the possible documents relevant to thequery. It seems then natural to try and expand the queries with additional terms; which aresemantically and/or statistically associated with the original query terms. In this paper we arelooking at the mining of associations between terms for the exploration of the terminology ofa corpus as well as for the automatic expansion of queries. The technique we use for thediscovery of the associations is association rules mining [Agrawal 96]. The technique wepropose is more flexible than previous techniques based on term co-occurrence since it …,AMCIS 2000 Proceedings,2000,5

Magic checking: Constraint checking for database query optimisation,Mark Wallace; Stephane Bressan; Thierry Le Provost,Abstract Constraint satisfaction techniques; embedded in constraint programminglanguages such as CHIP; have proven their worth on a wide variety of practical applications.This paper describes a first step towards integrating these techniques into databasesystems. The main idea is to optimise complex queries by continually checking to see if thecurrent partial results are consistent with the remainder of the query. In this paper we presenta query language; based on Datalog; which enables the database user to control thechecking by annotating certain atomic goals. We show how queries expressed in thislanguage can be translated into queries expressed in standard Datalog. Each Datalog ruleis separately optimised by the database optimiser. The language and the translation aremotivated by various examples; in particular an application to crossword generation is …,ESPRIT WG CONTESSA Workshop on Constraint Databases and Applications,1995,5
Cost-model oblivious database tuning with reinforcement learning,Debabrota Basu; Qian Lin; Weidong Chen; Hoang Tam Vo; Zihong Yuan; Pierre Senellart; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract In this paper; we propose a learning approach to adaptive performance tuning ofdatabase applications. The objective is to validate the opportunity to devise a tuning strategythat does not need prior knowledge of a cost model. Instead; the cost model is learnedthrough reinforcement learning. We instantiate our approach to the use case of index tuning.We model the execution of queries and updates as a Markov decision process whose statesare database configurations; actions are configuration changes; and rewards are functionsof the cost of configuration change and query and update evaluation. During thereinforcement learning process; we face two important challenges: not only the unavailabilityof a cost model; but also the size of the state space. To address the latter; we devisestrategies to prune the state space; both in the general case and for the use case of index …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2015,4
Progressive and approximate join algorithms on data streams,Wee Hyong Tok; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract In this chapter; we discuss the design and implementation of join algorithms for datastreaming systems; wherememory is often limited relative to the data that needs to beprocessed. We first focus on progressive join algorithms for various data models. Weintroduce a framework for progressive join processing; called the Result Rate basedProgressive Join (RRPJ) framework which can be used for join processing for various datamodels; and discuss its various instantiations for processing relational; high-dimensional;spatial and XML data. We then consider progressive and approximate join algorithms. Theneed for approximate join algorithms is motivated by the observation that users often do notrequire complete set of answers. Some answers; which we refer to as an approximate result;are often sufficient. Users expect the approximate result to be either the largest possible …,*,2013,4
SVM-based framework for the robust extraction of objects from histopathological images using color; texture; scale and geometry,Antoine Veillard; Stéphane Bressan; Daniel Racoceanu,The extraction of nuclei from Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained biopsies present aparticularly steep challenge in part due to the irregularity of the high-grade (most malignant)tumors. To your best knowledge; although some existing solutions perform adequately withrelatively predictable low-grade cancers; solutions for the problematic high-grade cancershave yet to be proposed. In this paper; we propose a method for the extraction of cell nucleifrom H&E stained biopsies robust enough to deal with the full range of histological gradesobserved in daily clinical practice. The robustness is achieved by combining a wide range ofinformation including color; texture; scale and geometry in a multi-stage; Support VectorMachine (SVM) based framework to replace the original image with a new; probabilisticimage modality with stable characteristics.

PRBF kernels: A framework for the incorporation of task-specific properties into support vector methods,Antoine Veillard; Daniel Racoceanu; Stéphane Bressan,The incorporation of prior-knowledge into support vector machines (SVM) in order tocompensate for inadequate training data has been the focus of previous research works andmany found a kernel-based approach to be the most appropriate. However; they are moreadapted to deal with broad domain knowledge (eg``sets are invariant to permutations of theelements'') rather than task-specific properties (eg``the weight of a person is cubicallyrelated to her height''). In this paper; we present the partially RBF (pRBF) kernels; ouroriginal framework for the incorporation of prior-knowledge about correlation patternsbetween specific features and the output label. pRBF kernels are based upon the tensor-product combination of the standard radial basis function (RBF) kernel with more specializedkernels and provide a natural way for the incorporation of a commonly available type of …,Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA); 2012 11th International Conference on,2012,4
Discretionary social network data revelation with a user-centric utility guarantee,Yi Song; Panagiotis Karras; Sadegh Nobari; Giorgos Cheliotis; Mingqiang Xue; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract The proliferation of online social networks has created intense interest in studyingtheir nature and revealing information of interest to the end user. At the same time; suchrevelation raises privacy concerns. Existing research addresses this problem following anapproach popular in the database community: a model of data privacy is defined; and thedata is rendered in a form that satisfies the constraints of that model while aiming tomaximize some utility measure. Still; these is no consensus on a clear and quantifiable utilitymeasure over graph data. In this paper; we take a different approach: we define a utilityguarantee; in terms of certain graph properties being preserved; that should be respectedwhen releasing data; while otherwise distorting the graph to an extend desired for the sakeof confidentiality. We propose a form of data release which builds on current practice in …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,4
Incorporating prior-knowledge in support vector machines by kernel adaptation,Antoine Veillard; Daniel Racoceanu; Stéphane Bressan,SVMs with the general purpose RBF kernel are widely considered as state-of-the-artsupervised learning algorithms due to their effectiveness and versatility. However; inpractice; SVMs often require more training data than readily available. Prior-knowledge maybe available to compensate this shortcoming provided such knowledge can be effectivelypassed on to SVMs. In this paper; we propose a method for the incorporation of prior-knowledge via an adaptation of the standard RBF kernel. Our practical and computationallysimple approach allows prior-knowledge in a variety of forms ranging from regions of theinput space as crisp or fuzzy sets to pseudo-periodicity. We show that this method is effectiveand that the amount of required training data can be largely decreased; opening the way fornew usages of SVMs. We propose a validation of our approach for pattern recognition …,Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI); 2011 23rd IEEE International Conference on,2011,4
Edit Distance between XML and Probabilistic XML documents,Ruiming Tang; Huayu Wu; Sadegh Nobari; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract Probabilistic XML is a hierarchical data model capturing uncertainty of both valueand structure. The ability to compute the similarity between an XML document and aprobabilistic XML document is a building block of many applications involving querying;comparison; alignment and classification; for instance. The new challenge in efficientlycomputing such similarity is the multiplicity of the possible worlds represented by aprobabilistic XML document. We devise and discuss an algorithm for the efficientcomputation of the similarity between an XML document and a probabilistic XML document.We empirically and comparatively evaluate the performance of the algorithm and its variants.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2011,4

Wefocus on two main areas. The first is structural transformation for XPath query; which can besemantically contracted; expanded or complemented using structural constraints. Thesecond is semantic qualifier transformation where the predicates; specified by []; in an XPathquery can be eliminated or transformed. We design a set of algorithms and implement aprototype system for evaluation. We adopt two representative off-the-shelf XML datamanagement systems to validate the effectiveness of the semantic transformations.,International Journal of Web and Grid Services,2010,4

We empirically study the performance of off-line; standard andextended; and on-line versions of the Star algorithm adapted to the various metrics andshow that one of the proposed metrics outperforms all others in both effectiveness andefficiency of clustering.

It is an equijoin that can deliver results progressively. In this paper; we firstpresent a naive extension; called neRPJ; to the progressive computation of the similarity joinof high-dimensional data. We argue that this naive extension is not suitable. We thereforepropose an adequate solution in the form of a Result-Rate Progressive Join (RRPJ) for high-dimensional distance similarity joins. Using both synthetic and real-life datasets; weempirically show that RRPJ is effective and efficient; and outperforms the naive extension.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2007,4

Incremental algorithms for sampling dynamic graphs,Xuesong Lu; Tuan Quang Phan; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract Among the many reasons that justify the need for efficient and effective graphsampling algorithms is the ability to replace a graph too large to be processed by a tractableyet representative subgraph. For instance; some approximation algorithms start by lookingfor a solution on a sample subgraph and then extrapolate it. The sample graph should be ofmanageable size. The sample graph should preserve properties of interest. There existseveral efficient and effective algorithms for the sampling of graphs. However; the graphsencountered in modern applications are dynamic: edges and vertices are added orremoved. Existing graph sampling algorithms are not incremental. They were designed forstatic graphs. If the original graph changes; the sample must be entirely recomputed.

A hybrid approach for general XML query processing,Huayu Wu; Ruiming Tang; Tok Wang Ling; Yong Zeng; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract The state-of-the-art XML twig pattern query processing algorithms focus onmatching a single twig pattern to a document. However; many practical queries are modeledby multiple twig patterns with joins to link them. The output of twig pattern matching is tuplesof labels; while the joins between twig patterns are based on values. The inefficiency ofintegrating label-based structural joins in twig pattern matching and value-based joins to linkpatterns becomes an obstacle preventing those structural join algorithms in literatures frombeing adopted in practical XML query processors. In this paper; we propose a hybridapproach to bridge this gap. In particular; we introduce both relational tables and invertedlists to organize values and elements respectively. General XML queries involving severaltwig patterns are processed by the both data structures.

A utilization of schema constraints to transform predicates in XPath query,Dung Xuan Thi Le; Stéphane Bressan; Eric Pardede; David Taniar; Wenny Rahayu,Abstract A predicate in an XPath query expresses a condition to be fulfilled in addition to thestructural constraint imposed by the path itself. The condition is a Boolean expression. It mayinvolve comparisons between elements and values; path expressions denoting elements tobe compared as well as further path expressions. In this paper; we are concerned with thesemantic transformation of such predicates in the presence of a schema for the XML data.The goal of this semantic transformation is to eliminate the predicates from the XPath query ifpossible in order to avoid the early; unnecessary query processing. Otherwise; if predicatesare retained; we show how they can be semantically transformed to boost efficiency andreduce resource utilization. An algorithm is proposed to determine whether predicatesshould be eliminated or retained.

Clustering-based frequency l-diversity anonymization,Mohammad-Reza Zare-Mirakabad; Aman Jantan; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract Privacy preservation is realized by transforming data into k-anonymous (k-anonymization) and l-diverse (l-diversification) versions while minimizing information loss.Frequency l-diversity is possibly the most practical instance of the generic l-diversityprinciple for privacy preservation. In this paper; we propose an algorithm for frequency l-diversification. Our primary objective is to minimize information loss. Most studies in privacypreservation have focused on k-anonymization.

Inthis paper; we propose to challenge this strict dichotomy in the life cycle while addressingthe issue of labeling of data. We discuss a learning paradigm called Continuous Learning.After an initial training based on human-labeled data; a Continuously Learning algorithmiteratively trains itself with the result of its own previous application stage and without theprivilege of any external feedback. The intuitive motivation and idea of this paradigm areelucidated; followed by explanations on how it differs from other learning models.

Implementing index data structures using constraint logic programming,Stéphane Bressan; Alan Sexton; Mark Wallace,Geographic; spatial and multimedia database applications (eg [4]) require the use of efficientcomplex query capabilities. Constraint Query Languages (CQL) [16] are candidates for the implementationof these applications; but their effic- acy depends on the integration of the query processing andoptimisation tech- niques for CQL together with the existing database and information systemstechniques. Of particular importance; in the presence of huge quantities of in- formation; are theindexing mechanisms and the index data structures. We believe that Constraint Logic Programming(CLP) [15] offers a uniform framework for the implementation of such applications andsystems.

Materials informatics,Seeram Ramakrishna; Tong-Yi Zhang; Wen-Cong Lu; Quan Qian; Jonathan Sze Choong Low; Jeremy Heiarii Ronald Yune; Daren Zong Loong Tan; Stéphane Bressan; Stefano Sanvito; Surya R Kalidindi,Abstract Materials informatics employs techniques; tools; and theories drawn from theemerging fields of data science; internet; computer science and engineering; and digitaltechnologies to the materials science and engineering to accelerate materials; products andmanufacturing innovations. Manufacturing is transforming into shorter design cycles; masscustomization; on-demand production; and sustainable products. Additive manufacturing or3D printing is a popular example of such a trend. However; the success of thismanufacturing transformation is critically dependent on the availability of suitable materialsand of data on invertible processing–structure–property–performance life cycle linkages ofmaterials. Experience suggests that the material development cycle; ie the time to developand deploy new material; generally exceeds the product design and development cycle …,Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing,2017,2
Set of t-uples expansion by example,Ngurah Agus Sanjaya Er; Talel Abdessalem; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract Set expansion is the task of finding elements of a set given example members. Weare interested in the design of algorithms and techniques for a set expansion tool thatexpands a set by searching; finding and extracting candidates from the World Wide Web.Existing approaches mostly consider sets of atomic data. We extend this idea to theexpansion of sets of t-uples; that is relation instances or tables. We propose an approach forextracting relation instances from the World Wide Web given a handful set of t-uple seeds.For instance; when the user proposes the set of seeds< IDR; Indonesia; Jakarta>;< CYN;China; Beijing>;< CAD; Canada; Ottawa> the system returns a relation containing currencycodes with their corresponding country and capital city. We show how a random walk in aheterogeneous graph of Web pages; wrappers; seeds and candidates is able to rank the …,Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Information Integration and Web-based Applications and Services,2016,2
Detecting communities of commuters: graph based techniques versus generative models,Ashish Dandekar; Stéphane Bressan; Talel Abdessalem; Huayu Wu; Wee Siong Ng,Abstract The main stage for a new generation of cooperative information systems are smartcommunities such as smart cities and smart nations. In the smart city context in which weposition our work; urban planning; development and management authorities andstakeholders need to understand and take into account the mobility patterns of urbandwellers in order to manage the sociological; economic and environmental issues createdby the continuing growth of cities and urban population. In this paper; we address the issueof the detection of communities of commuters which is one of the crucial aspects of smartcommunity analysis. A community of commuters is a group of users of a public transportationnetwork who share similar mobility patterns.

Top-k queries over uncertain scores,Qing Liu; Debabrota Basu; Talel Abdessalem; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract Modern recommendation systems leverage some forms of collaborative user orcrowd sourced collection of information. For instance; services like TripAdvisor; Airbnb andHungyGoWhere rely on user-generated content to describe and classify hotels; vacationrentals and restaurants. By nature of such independent collection of information; themultiplicity; diversity and varying quality of the information collected result in uncertainty.Objects; such as the services offered by hotels; vacation rentals and restaurants; haveuncertain scores for their various features. In this context; ranking of uncertain data becomesa crucial issue. Several data models for uncertain data and several semantics forprobabilistic top-k queries have been proposed in the literature. We consider here a modelof objects with uncertain scores given as probability distributions and the semantics …,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2016,2
Fast disjoint and overlapping community detection,Yi Song; Stéphane Bressan; Gillian Dobbie,Abstract We propose algorithms for the detection of disjoint and overlapping communities innetworks. The algorithms exploit both the degree and clustering coefficient of vertices asthese metrics characterize dense connections; which we hypothesize as being indicative ofcommunities. Each vertex independently seeks the community to which it belongs; byvisiting its neighboring vertices and choosing its peers on the basis of their degrees andclustering coefficients. The algorithms are intrinsically data parallel. We devise a version forGraphics Processing Unit (GPU). We empirically evaluate the performance of our methods.We measure and compare their efficiency and effectiveness to several state-of-the-artcommunity detection algorithms. Effectiveness is quantified by metrics; namely; modularity;conductance; internal density; cut ratio; weighted community clustering and normalized …,*,2015,2
Force-directed layout community detection,Yi Song; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract We propose a graph-layout based method for detecting communities in networks.We first project the graph onto a Euclidean space using Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm; aforce-based graph drawing algorithm. We then cluster the vertices according to Euclideandistance. The idea is a form of dimension reduction. The graph drawing in two or moredimensions provides a heuristic decision as whether vertices are connected by a short pathapproximated by their Euclidean distance. We study community detection for both disjointand overlapping communities. For the case of disjoint communities; we use k-meansclustering. For the case of overlapping communities; we use fuzzy-c means algorithm. Weevaluate the performance of our different algorithms for varying parameters and number ofiterations. We compare the results to several state of the art community detection …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2013,2
PSOGD: A new method for graph drawing,Jianhua Qu; Yi Song; Stéphane Bressan,Force-directed graph drawing algorithms compute a layout as the equilibrium of a physicalsystem. This equilibrium is an optimum of the corresponding objective function. We proposea new method for drawing undirected graphs that uses particle swarm optimization (PSO).The graph is initialized with a swarm of random particles. The position vector of each particlecorresponds to one layout of the graph. The objective function maps the layout into a realnumber representing the energy of the layout which is obtained by calculating the attractiveand repulsive forces between the vertices. All particles automatically update their positionand velocity to find the optimal layout until the algorithm terminates. PSO makes theimplementation of the algorithm simple and easy. We empirically and comparativelyevaluate the performance of the algorithm.,Data Engineering Workshops (ICDEW); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,2
Measuring XML structured-ness with entropy,Ruiming Tang; Huayu Wu; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract XML is semi-structured. It can be used to annotate unstructured data; to representstructured data and almost anything in-between. Yet; it is unclear how to formallycharacterize; yet to quantify; structured-ness of XML. In this paper we propose and evaluateentropy-based metrics for XML structured-ness. The metrics measure the structuraluniformity of path and subtrees; respectively. We empirically study the correlation of thesemetrics with real and synthetic data sets.,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2011,2
Support vector methods for sentence level machine translation evaluation,Antoine Veillard; Elvina Melissa; Cassandra Theodora; Daniel Racoceanu; Stéphane Bressan,Recent work in the field of machine translation (MT) evaluation suggests that sentence levelevaluation based on machine learning (ML) can outperform the standard metrics such asBLEU; ROUGE and METEOR. We conducted a comprehensive empirical study on supportvector methods for ML-based MT evaluation involving multi-class support vector machines(SVM) and support vector regression (SVR) with different kernel functions. We empathize ona systematic comparison study of multiple feature models obtained with feature selectionand feature extraction techniques.

A simple; yet effective and efficient; sliding window sampling algorithm,Xuesong Lu; Wee Hyong Tok; Chedy Raissi; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract Sampling streams of continuous data with limited memory; or reservoir sampling; isa utility algorithm. Standard reservoir sampling maintains a random sample of the entirestream as it has arrived so far. This restriction does not meet the requirement of manyapplications that need to give preference to recent data. The simplest algorithm formaintaining a random sample of a sliding window reproduces periodically the same sampledesign. This is also undesirable for many applications. Other existing algorithms are usingvariable size memory; variable size samples or maintain biased samples and allow expireddata in the sample. We propose an effective algorithm; which is very simple and thereforeefficient; for maintaining a near random fixed size sample of a sliding window. Indeed ouralgorithm maintains a biased sample that may contain expired data. Yet it is a good …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,2

Fewer efforts have been made for devising techniques;tools and methodologies for investigation and evaluation of privacy risks. We are concernedabout privacy diagnosis before starting protection. Actually we show privacy leakagesthreaten data publication. We introduce a Privacy Diagnosis Centre for this purpose. In thispaper toward this diagnosis centre we focus on anonymity and; in particular; k-anonymity.Then we aim at k-anonymity diagnosis system.

Towards a privacy diagnosis centre: Measuring k-anonymity,Mohammad Reza Zare Mirakabad; Aman Jantan; Stéphane Bressan,Most of the recent efforts addressing the issue of privacy have focused on devisingalgorithms for the anonymization and diversification of data. Our objective is upstream ofthese works: we are concerned with privacy diagnosis. In this paper; we start byinvestigating the issue of k-anonymity. We propose algorithms to explore various questionsabout k-anonymity of data. Such questions are; for instance;" is my data sufficientlyanonymous?";" which information; if available from an outside source; threatens theanonymity of my data?" In this paper we focus on anonymity and; in particular; k-anonymity.The algorithms that we propose leverage two properties of k-anonymity that we express inthe form of two lemmas. The first lemma is a monotonicity property that enables us to adaptthe a-priori algorithm for k-anonymity. The second lemma is a determinism property that …,Computer Science and its Applications; 2008. CSA'08. International Symposium on,2008,2
Processing of Multiple Long-Running Queries in LargeScale Geo-Data Repositories,Wee Hyong Tok; Stéphane Bressan,One of the main challenges of large-scale information mediation and warehousing is theefficient and resource-effective processing of continuous queries. Continuous queriesmonitor streams of incoming data and produce results on-the-fly. They are usually long-running; yet need to be removed from the system when they become obsolete. We present aframework and the corresponding algorithms and data-structures for the efficient evaluationof multiple long-running spatial queries over unbounded streams of spatial data and themanagement of obsolete queries.

Prune XML before you search it: XML transformations for query optimization,Stéphane Bressan; Zoé Lacroix; Ying Guang Li; Anna Maddalena,Abstract In this paper; we present a query optimization approach for XML documentmanagement environments loosely-coupled with the storage system. Our technique isbased on two main steps: first; based on the query; input documents are transformed; bypruning parts that are irrelevant with respect to the query; then the query is executed on thepruned documents. An index structure is also provided to further optimize the pruningprocess. Experimental results show that; by using our pruning strategy; query execution timecan be significantly reduced.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2004,2
Equivalence-Preserving Transformations for XML Documents,Stephan Bressan; Barbara Catania; YG Li; Z Lacroix; Anna Maddalena,Abstract Efficient XML document management requires the usage of specific storage andindexing approaches. However; some organizations may not want to disrupt theirinformation management strategy and may not need or wish to store and manage nativeXML data but rather only process transient XML data received from other organizations.These organizations may benefit of the usage of query processors that are only loosely-coupled with the storage system. Such query processors operate on an internalrepresentation of XML documents and thus leverage neither the XML storage structure northe possible access methods dedicated to this storage structure supported by dedicatedXML management systems. Different solutions have therefore to be proposed for queryoptimization in these environments. In this paper; we present a query optimization …,*,2003,2

Predator-Minerallows a user to combine association rule mining queries with SQL queries. This approachtowards tight integration differs from existing techniques of using user-defined functions(UDFs); stored procedures; or re-expressing a mining query as several SQL queries in twoaspects. First; by encapsulating the task of association rule mining in a relational operator;we allow association rule mining to be considered as part of the query plan; on which queryoptimization can be performed on the mining query holistically. Second; by integrating it as arelational operator; we can leverage on the mature field of relational database technology.We extend Predator to support a variant of DMQL; and allow SQL and DMQL to be …,Data Engineering; 2002.

How to find the best rated items on a likert scale and how many ratings are enough,Qing Liu; Debabrota Basu; Shruti Goel; Talel Abdessalem; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract The collection and exploitation of ratings from users are modern pillars ofcollaborative filtering. Likert scale is a psychometric quantifier of ratings popular among theelectronic commerce sites. In this paper; we consider the tasks of collecting Likert scaleratings of items and of finding the nk best-rated items; ie; the n items that are most likely to bethe top-k in a ranking constructed from these ratings. We devise an algorithm; Pundit; thatcomputes the nk best-rated items. Pundit uses the probability-generating functionconstructed from the Likert scale responses to avoid the combinatorial exploration of thepossible outcomes and to compute the result efficiently. Selection of the best-rated itemsmeets; in practice; the major obstacle of the scarcity of ratings. We propose an approach thatlearns from the available data how many ratings are enough to meet a prescribed error …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2017,1

Inrecent decades; the topological properties of hypergraphs have been studied and variouskinds of (co) homologies have been constructed (cf.[3; 4; 12]). In this paper; generalising theusual homology of simplicial complexes; we define the embedded homology of hypergraphsas well as the persistent embedded homology of sequences of hypergraphs. As ageneralisation of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for the homology of simplicial complexes; wegive a Mayer-Vietoris sequence for the embedded homology of hypergraphs. Moreover; asapplications of the embedded homology; we study acyclic hypergraphs and construct someindices for the data analysis of hyper-networks.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1610.00890,2016,1
Regularized cost-model oblivious database tuning with reinforcement learning,Debabrota Basu; Qian Lin; Weidong Chen; Hoang Tam Vo; Zihong Yuan; Pierre Senellart; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract In this paper; we propose a learning approach to adaptive performance tuning ofdatabase applications. The objective is to validate the opportunity to devise a tuning strategythat does not need prior knowledge of a cost model. Instead; the cost model is learnedthrough reinforcement learning. We instantiate our approach to the use case of index tuning.We model the execution of queries and updates as a Markov decision process whose statesare database configurations; actions are configuration changes; and rewards are functionsof the cost of configuration change and query and update evaluation. During thereinforcement learning process; we face two important challenges: the unavailability of acost model and the size of the state space. To address the former; we iteratively learn thecost model; in a principled manner; using regularization to avoid overfitting. To address …,*,2016,1
A Framework for Sampling-Based XML Data Pricing,Ruiming Tang; Antoine Amarilli; Pierre Senellart; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract While price and data quality should define the major trade-off for consumers in datamarkets; prices are usually prescribed by vendors and data quality is not negotiable. In thispaper we study a model where data quality can be traded for a discount. We focus on thecase of XML documents and consider completeness as the quality dimension. In our setting;the data provider offers an XML document; and sets both the price of the document and aweight to each node of the document; depending on its potential worth. The data consumerproposes a price. If the proposed price is lower than that of the entire document; then thedata consumer receives a sample; ie; a random rooted subtree of the document whoseselection depends on the discounted price and the weight of nodes. By requesting severalsamples; the data consumer can iteratively explore the data in the document. We present …,*,2016,1
An AIS-based framework for real time monitoring of vessels efficiency,H Chi; G Pedrielli; Thomas Kister; SH Ng; Stéphane Bressan,Maritime transport is one of the most energy efficient and one of the lowest CO 2 emittingmodes of transport. Nonetheless; the industry's carbon footprint is significant. Stakeholdersrecognize the need for continuing efforts to curb CO 2 emissions. Such efforts require theability to measure individual vessels' energy efficiency. To this end; several energy efficiencymetrics/indices have been developed for tracking real time CO 2 emissions by marinevessels. We propose a new methodology to calculate and monitor individual vessel's energyefficiency and carbon emissions in real time through the Real-Time Energy EfficiencyOperating Index (RT-EEOI). We demonstrate the practicality of the proposed methodology bypresenting a software architecture implementing it.

Adaptive Routing Algorithms in Unstructured Peer-to-Peer(P 2 P) Systems,Achmad Nizar Hidayanto; Stephane Bressan,Abstract—There are a variety of peer-to-peer (P2P) systems for sharing documents currentlyavailable. According to their data organization; P2P systems are classified into twocategories: structured and unstructured P2P systems. In structured P2P systems; peers areorganized according to some mapping techniques; eg hashing function. Whereas inunstructured P2P system; peers are connected to each others randomly; resources are notmoved to other peers but hosted on site. Unstructured P2P systems offer a more flexible andautonomous environment; as they require less control for the placement of resources andpeers. This work focuses on experimenting on unstructured P2P systems. The challenge inunstructured P2P system is designing routing strategies that lead the user in finding thedocuments needed.

Semantic transformation approach with schema constraints for XPath query axes,Dung Xuan Thi Le; Stephane Bressan; Eric Pardede; Wenny Rahayu; David Taniar,Abstract XPath queries are essentially composed of a succession of axes defining thenavigation from a current context node. Among the XPath query axes family; child;descendant; parent can be optionally specified using the path notations {/;//;..} which havebeen commonly used. Axes such as following-sibling and preceding-sibling have uniquefunctionalities which provide different required information that cannot be achieved byothers. However; XPath query optimization using schema constraints does not yet considerthese axes family. The performance of queries denoting the same result by means ofdifferent axes may significantly differ. The difference in performance can be affected by someaxes; but this can be avoided.

Three Light-Weight Execution Engines in Java for Web Data-Intensive Applications,Ricardo Ambrose; Philippe Bonnet; Stephane Bressan; Jean-Robert Gruser,Everything is on the Web. Almost. Large amounts of data are available for potential use forscientific and business purposes. Applications range from the search and consolidation ofthe publicly available scientific data such as the human genome data; to; as in the examplebelow; investment research involving stock prices; economic indicators; and analystsrecommendations. Nevertheless; the question remains of how to use this wealth of data inapplications that require a structured access as opposed to the casual browsing supportedby the usual World Wide Web interfaces. It seems indeed oxymoronic to expect a structuredquery paradigm for accessing the Web when the original paradigm is the one of hypertextnavigation. Of course; the Web is a structured set (a graph) of" documents"; some of which;in their turn; are structured from the standpoint of their layout defined by the Hypertext …,*,1998,1
A Framework for Real-Time Monitoring of Energy Efficiency of Marine Vessels,Hongtao Chi; Giulia Pedrielli; Szu Hui Ng; Thomas Kister; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract Sea shipping is one of the most widespread transport modes. Therefore; theimprovement of energy efficiency and further curbing of Carbon Dioxide emissions bymarine vessels is important both economically and environmentally. During the sixty ninthMarine Environment Protection Committee session in April 2016; the International MaritimeOrganization approved mandatory requirements for ships to report their fuel consumption;which is the first of the three-phase approach to derive a standardized measure for energyefficiency tracking of marine vessels. Under the International Maritime Organization DataCollection System; emphasis has been placed on verification of the collected fuelconsumption data so that vessels' energy efficiency could be benchmarked and improved.To optimize the operational efficiency of marine vessels; this paper proposes the Real …,Energy,2017,*

Generating Fake but Realistic Headlines Using Deep Neural Networks,Ashish Dandekar; Remmy AM Zen; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook implement filters to detectfake news as they foresee their transition from social media platform to primary sources ofnews. The robustness of such filters lies in the variety and the quality of the data used to trainthem. There is; therefore; a need for a tool that automatically generates fake but realisticnews. In this paper; we propose a deep learning model that automatically generates newsheadlines. The model is trained with a corpus of existing headlines from different topics.Once trained; the model generates a fake but realistic headline given a seed and a topic. Forexample; given the seed “Kim Jong Un” and the topic “Business”; the model generates theheadline “kim jong un says climate change is already making money”.

Data driven generation of synthetic data with support vector data description,Fajrian Yunus; Ashish Dandekar; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract We propose a method to generate synthetic data by Support Vector DataDescription. Support Vector Data Description is a variant of Support Vector Machine for one-class classification problem. Our method assumes that an observed data is a sample of arandom variable which satisfies an unknown membership decision function. The unknownmembership decision function is to be learned by Support Vector Data Description based onthe training data. By using the learned membership decision function; we perform rejectionsampling. Firstly; we generate a random data point. Secondly; we test the data point againstthe membership decision function. Lastly; if the data point fails the test; we repeat from thefirst step. However; in some cases; the rejection sampling approach runs slowly. Therefore;we also propose another approach. The approach works by using a heuristic to find a …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2017,*
Protocol for preserving privacy in distributed system (PPDS),Ashref Aloui; Mounira Msahli; Talel Abdessalem; Stephane Bressan; Sihem Mesnager,Preserving privacy in Big data is one of the most debated topics of computer security. Thefast growing volume of data and the need of companies to extract value from that datacreates new complicated and serious security challenges. Despite its wide spread; thecommon use and the popularity of Big data paradigm; significant risks and challenges areinherent to this new concept; especially when we talk about externalized treatment ofsensitive data via insecure network. In this paper we tackle the privacy challenge in BigData. We focus in special case of data processing. Several Bank agencies want to sharedata processing while protecting the privacy. We propose a new protocol of communicationbetween agencies. This protocol is composed of three phases: authentication; node headselection and data linking.

Cost Minimization and Social Fairness for Spatial Crowdsourcing Tasks,Stéphane Bressan,Abstract. Spatial crowdsourcing is an activity consisting in outsourcing spatial tasks to acommunity of online; yet on-ground and mobile; workers. A spatial task is characterized bythe requirement that workers must move from their current location to a specified location toaccomplish the task. We study the assignment of spatial tasks to workers. A sequence of setsof spatial tasks is assigned to workers as they arrive. We want to minimize the cost incurredby the movement of the workers to perform the tasks. In the meanwhile; we are seekingsolutions that are socially fair. We discuss the competitiveness in terms of competitive ratioand social fairness of the Work Function Algorithm; the Greedy Algorithm; and theRandomized versions of the Greedy Algorithm to solve this problem. These onlinealgorithms are memory-less and are either inefficient or unfair.

In order for data to become a commodity readyfor consumption; transformation and exploitation by smart services; it must be madeavailable and tradable on data market places. For such data market places to be viablethere is a compelling need for a sound data pricing model that is conducive of thehealthiness of the market. In this paper; we discuss the definition of a pricing model in whichviews are priced and queries are valuated using views. We define the price of a query as thecheapest combination of the prices of a set of views that can answer the query. We discussthe devising of effective and efficient algorithms of the computation of the price of a query.We show that the problem of computing the price is similar but not identical to the problem …,Data Mining Workshop (ICDMW); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,*

Probabilisticdatabases address the problem of the management and of the representation of uncertaindata by means of probabilities. A good probabilistic database model offers a generallycompact and easily manageable representation of uncertain data. A probabilistic databaseinstance denotes a set of possible deterministic database instances called possible worlds;each of which has a probability (that is the confidence of this possible world being actual).Direct observations and general knowledge; in the form of constraints; can be injected intothe database during a data cleaning process or during an auditing phase by domainexperts; for instance.

Conditioning Probabilistic XML (Extended Version),Ruiming Tang; Dongxu Shao; M Lamine Ba; Pierre Senellart; Stéphane Bressan,A probabilistic database instance denotes a set of possible non-probabilistic databaseinstances called possible worlds; each of which has a probability. This is often a compactway to represent uncertain data. In addition; direct observations and general knowledge; inthe form of constraints; help refining the probabilities of the possible worlds; possibly rulingout some of them. Adding such constraints to the set of possible worlds with theirprobabilities is conditioning in the probabilistic sense of the term. The problem is to find anew probabilistic database instance that denotes the subset of possible worlds with theirnew probabilities corresponding to the conditional probabilities. Probabilistic XML allowscapturing uncertainty of both values and structure.

Discretionary Social Network Data Revelation with a User-Centric Utility Guarantee,Song YI; Panagiotis Karras; Sadegh Nobari; Giorgos Cheliotis; Mingqiang Xue; Stéphane Bressan,The proliferation of online social networks has created intense interest in studying the natureof such networks and revealing network information of interest to the end user. At the sametime; the revelation of such data raises privacy concerns. Existing research addresses thisproblem following an approach popular in the database community: a model of data privacyis defined; and the data is rendered in a form that satisfies the constraints of that model whileaiming to maximize some utility measure. Still; these is no consensus on what constitutes aclear and quantifiable utility measure over graph data. In this paper; we take a differentapproach: instead of starting out with a privacy objective; we define a utility guarantee; interms of certain graph connectivity properties being preserved; that should be respectedwhen releasing data; while otherwise distorting the graph to an extend desired for the …,*,2012,*

Kernel Methods for the Incorporation of Prior-Knowledge into Support Vector Machines–THESIS SYNOPSIS–,Antoine Veillard; Stéphane Bressan; Daniel Racoceanu,In this thesis; we present the Knowledge-Enhanced RBF (KE-RBF) framework; a family ofkernel methods for the incorporation of prior-knowledge into SVMs. The KE-RBF frameworkconsists in three different types of kernels (ξRBF; pRBF and gRBF) based on adaptations ofthe standard RBF kernel. KE-RBF kernels enable the incorporation of a wide range of prior-knowledge specific to the task including global properties such as monotonicity;pseudoperiodicity or characteristic correlation patterns; and semi-global propertiesrepresented by unlabelled and labelled regions of the feature space. The methods arenumerically evaluated on several real-world applications using publicly available data.

A Framework for Conditioning Uncertain,Ruiming Tang; Reynold Cheng; Huayu Wu; Stephane Bressan,We propose a framework for representing conditioned probabilistic relational data. In thisframework the existence of tuples in possible worlds is determined by Boolean expressionscomposed from elementary events. The probability of a possible world is computed from theprobabilities associated with these elementary events. In addition; a set of global constraintsconditions the database. Conditioning is the formalization of the process of addingknowledge to a database. Some worlds may be impossible given the constraints and theprobabilities of possible worlds are accordingly re-defined. The new constraints can comefrom the observation of the existence or non-existence of a tuple; from the knowledge of aspecific rule; such as the existence of an exclusive set of tuples; or from the knowledge of ageneral rule; such as a functional dependency. We are therefore interested in computing …,*,2012,*

Semijoin Program,Stéphane Bressan,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}.

For a nation composed ofseveral thousands islands and for its diasporas of students and professionals; the Internetand the applications it supports such as the World Wide Web; email; discussion groups; anddigital libraries are essential media for cultural; economical; and social development.

Spatial data on the move,Wee Hyong Tok; Stéphane Bresan; Panagiotis Kalnis; Baihua Zhengl,ABSTRACT The pervasiveness of mobile computing devices and wide-availability ofwireless networking infrastructure have empowered users with applications that provideslocation-based services as well as the ability to pose queries to remote servers. Thisnecessitates the need for adaptive; robust; and efficient techniques for processing thequeries. In this chapter; we identify the issues and challenges of processing spatial data onthe move. Next; we present insights on state-of-art spatial query processing techniques usedin these dynamic; mobile environments. We conclude with several potential open researchproblems in this exciting area.,*,2006,*

An Application of Constraint Programming to Mobile Data,Stephane BRESSAN; Wee Hyong TOK; Steven PRESTWICH,Given the current ubiquity of wireless networks and mobile devices; data must bedisseminated to a large number of these devices in an effective and efficient manner. Apromising technique for such applications is data broadcasting. We introduce a newoptimization problem derived from mobile data broadcasting applications. A singlebroadcaster transmits pages of data in sequence in response to requests from multipleclients; each asking for different subsets of a set of available pages. A transmitted page canbe read by any number of clients; and we aim to minimise the total time taken to transmit allpages. Users impose additional constraints on how long they are willing to wait betweenpages; because of limited power supply in mobile devices. This problem is closely related tothe multiple sequence alignment problem from bioinformatics. We present a first …,*,2005,*

Performance evaluation of a simple update model and a basic locking mechanism for broadcast disks,Stephane Bressan; Guo Yuzhi,Abstract Broadcasting architectures in general and broadcast disks in particular outperformtraditional client/server architectures when many clients read data from few servers. Yetseveral issues arise when the broadcasting model allows updates by the clients. Theseissues; most of which are related to the control of the concurrent access (isolation andconsistency); are rooted in the asynchronous nature of the broadcast model and in thereplication of data on the broadcast channel and in the caches of the clients. In this paper westudy the design and evaluate the performance of a simple update model controlled by abasic locking mechanism for broadcast disks architecture that involves replication on thebroadcast channel and client caches.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2004,*

G-snake double transformation (GDT) model for semi-automatic registration of internet maps,Fiona Lee; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract The vast amount of maps on the Internet can be bettersearched using thecartographic paradigm. Ageographical search engine which indexes these Webdocumentsand maps according to the geographicalregion they are representing would be a goodsolution. However; the raster maps; commonly available on theWeb in the form of GIF orJPEG images; come in avariety of unspecified coordinate systems and projections. Indexingthese maps entails calibrating them to a singlereference coordinate system. Performingmanualregistration for the maps is found to be tedious andautomatic registration is notpossible for the wide varietyof Internet maps.

dbRouter-A Scaleable and Distributed Query Optimization and Processing Framework,Wee Hyong Tok; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract In data integration systems; a central site often maintain a global catalog of allavailable data sources; and maintain statistics to allow the query optimizer to generate agood query plan. These statistics could be updated in a lazy manner during query executiontime. A user query is often broken into several query fragments; and a centralized taskscheduler schedules the execution of the respective query fragment; fetching data from thevarious data sources. This is then integrated at the central site and presented to the user. Asdata sources are introduced; there is a need to update the global catalog from time to time.However; due to the autonomous nature of the data sources; which are maintained by localadministrators; it is dificult to ensure accurate statistics as well as the availability of the datasources. In addition; since the data are integrated at the central site; the central site could …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2002,*
Informal Proceedings of The First VLDB Workshop on Efficiency and Effectiveness of XML Tools; and Techniques (EEXTT2002),Mong Li Lee; Stéphane Bressan; Akmal Chaudhri,With XML potentially becoming the standard for data exchange on the Internet; a variety ofXML management systems (XMLMS) differing widely in terms of expressive power andperformance are becoming available. The majority of the XML management systems arelegacy systems (mostly relational database systems) extended to load; query; and publishdata in XML format. A few are native XMLMS and capture almost all the characteristics ofXML data representation. Yet a large number of new techniques are being tuned or devisedfor the management of XML data. In this workshop we propose to focus on the evaluation ofthe performance; effectiveness and efficiency; of XMLMS systems; tools and techniques.

Sequential Vessel Speed Optimization under Dynamic Weather Conditions,Debabrota Basu; Giulia Pedrielli; Weidong Chen; Szu Hui Ng; Loo Hay Lee; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract—The International Maritime Organization (IMO) identifies speed optimization as akey operational measure for achieving energy efficiency through reduced emissions. OceanLiner services have fixed port rotations and schedules. While the speed can be optimized foremissions; the service level in terms of scheduled arrival and departure need to be carefullyconsidered not to loose market share. This already challenging problem is furthercomplicated when dynamic weather conditions along the service route are considered. Infact; few contributions can be found that address this issue. We study the operationalproblem of dynamically determining a vessel's speed; departure time and arrival time ateach port of call under dynamic weather conditions.

On Semantic Query Transformation for XML databases,Jeow Li Fook; Xavier Simon; Stephane Bressan; David Taniar,Abstract We investigate semantic transformations of XPath expressions; ie the rewriting ofXPath expressions into semantically equivalent XPath expressions; using schemaconstraints. Two XPath expressions are said to be equivalent if and only if they denote thesame set of XML data. Among other applications; such transformations can be the basis for asemantic query optimization (SQO) framework for XML query languages. After attempting aclassification of the possible transformations; we empirically evaluate and we analyse thepractical potential for semantic query optimization. We measure the comparativeperformance of a workload of XPath queries before and after transformation on threerepresentative systems: a native DOM-based XML management system; a native XMLmanagement system; and a relational database management system with XML support.,*,*,*

2nd International Workshop on High Availability of Distributed Systems,Stéphane Bressan,High availability (HA) of mission-critical IT services is becoming indispensable. HA isreceiving rapidly increasing attention; since many services need to be reachable andreliable at any place and any time. Increasingly many mission-critical governmental;institutional; and commercial services are in demand of HA; for improving theirdependability. System downtimes resulting in a lack of availability are undesirable or evenintolerable; due to ergonomic; economical; and security reasons. HA has established itselfas a benchmark for user acceptance; market viability; system dependability; andtrustworthiness of distributed systems. In general; HA refers to the continuous availabilityand seamless recovery of resources in a computer system; particularly in the wake ofcomponent failures. HA is concerned with avoiding single points of failure in a system …,*,*,*

Root Questions for Large Classes,Stephane Bressan; Jeffrey D Ullman,Discussion—sharing and articulating ideas—is an important part of the learning process;especially in tertiary education. Through discussion; learners can discover theirmisconceptions which they may not realise otherwise and thus enhance their understandingof the subject. Discussion in class also helps the teacher understand problems students facein their learning. Since it is common for students have a different perspective from theteacher; students can learn better if they have to explain or clarify certain concepts to oneanother. Thus; discussion facilitates peer learning.,*,*,*
