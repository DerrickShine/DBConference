Graphene as a counter electrode material for dye-sensitized solar cells,Hui Wang; Yun Hang Hu,The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) plays a leading role in third generation photovoltaicdevices. Platinum-loaded conducting glass has been widely exploited as the standardcounter electrode (CE) for DSSCs. However; the high cost and the rarity of platinum limits itspractical application in DSSCs. This has promoted large interest in exploring Pt-free CEs forDSSCs. Very recently; graphene; which is an atomic planar sheet of hexagonally arrayedsp2 carbon atoms; has been demonstrated to be a promising CE material for DSSCs due toits excellent conductivity and high electrocatalytic activity. This article provides a mini reviewof graphene-based CEs for DSSCs. Firstly; the fabrication and performance of graphene filmCE in DSSCs are discussed.

Effect of oxygen content on structures of graphite oxides,Hui Wang; Yun Hang Hu,Graphite oxide was synthesized by the oxidation of graphite via a modified Hummersapproach. The oxygen content of graphite oxide was tuned by changing the oxidation time.The saturated ratio of oxygen to carbon is 0.47. Furthermore; the effect of oxygen content onthe structures of graphite oxide was evaluated by using SEM; TEM; XRD; Raman; FTIR; TG;TPD-MS; and nitrogen adsorption. It was found that the types of functional groups in graphiteoxides; which are epoxy; hydroxyl; and carboxyl groups; were independent of oxygencontent. However; the interplanar space and BET surface area of graphite oxide linearlyincreased with increasing O/C ratio. Furthermore; the structure of graphite can be easily andremarkably disordered even by partial oxidation.,Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research,2011,94
Promoting effect of graphene on dye-sensitized solar cells,Hui Wang; Samantha L Leonard; Yun Hang Hu,In this paper; a simple approach without a prereduction of graphene oxide was exploited toprepare a graphene-doped TiO2 film for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Theperformance measurement of the DSSCs showed that the incorporation of graphene couldincrease the short-circuit current density and power conversion efficiency by 52.4 and55.3%; respectively. Furthermore; it was demonstrated that the performance enhancementwas due to the promoting effect of graphene on electron transfer instead of the increase ofdye loading in TiO2/graphene composite films. However; graphene can also absorb solarlight; which could lead to the decrease of light harvest of dye molecules and thus a negativeeffect on the power conversion efficiency of DSSCs. Furthermore; graphene might decreasethe actual dye loading on TiO2 in a TiO2/graphene film; which can also make a negative …,Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research,2012,74
A review on PEDOT‐based counter electrodes for dye‐sensitized solar cells,Wei Wei; Hui Wang; Yun Hang Hu,SUMMARY The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is a promising alternative for the Si solarcell due to its low-cost and easy fabrication.

Unusual particle-size-induced promoter-to-poison transition of ZrN in counter electrodes for dye-sensitized solar cells,Wei Wei; Hui Wang; Yun Hang Hu,It is well-known that promoter and poison are two contradictory properties of materials.However; in this work; an unusual particle-size-induced promoter-to-poison transition of ZrNhas been observed for the counter electrode of poly (3; 4-ethylene-dioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT: PSS) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). If the primarycrystal particle size of ZrN is 37 nm; it plays a promoting role for PEDOT: PSS counterelectrodes; leading to a remarkable increase in DSSC power conversion efficiency. Incontrast; when its primary crystal particle size is decreased to 21 nm; ZrN becomes a seriouspoison for PEDOT: PSS counter electrodes. This finding would be important for thedevelopment of highly efficient DSSC counter electrodes.,Journal of Materials Chemistry A,2013,51
Efficient ZnO-based counter electrodes for dye-sensitized solar cells,Hui Wang; Wei Wei; Yun Hang Hu,ZnO is usually exploited as a photoelectrode for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs); but ithas not been applied as a DSSC counter electrode. Herein; it is reported that ZnO with poly(3; 4-ethylenedioxythiophene): polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT: PSS) could be an efficientDSSC counter electrode with a maximum power conversion efficiency of 8.17%.Furthermore; it was found that the conversion efficiency of DSSCs with the ZnO/PEDOT: PSScounter electrode strongly depends on the ZnO content. Density functional theory (DFT)calculations; electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS); and cyclic voltammetry (CV)measurements revealed that the variation of the conversion efficiency with ZnO content isdetermined by the fill factor (FF); which is dependent on the combination of the catalyticactivity of ZnO and the conductivity of PEDOT: PSS.,Journal of Materials Chemistry A,2013,51
NiO as an efficient counter electrode catalyst for dye-sensitized solar cells,Hui Wang; Wei Wei; Yun Hang Hu,Abstract NiO is an important heterogeneous catalyst employed in chemical processes.However; it is a new topic to explore NiO as a counter electrode catalyst for dye-sensitizedsolar cells (DSSCs). In this paper; NiO with poly (3; 4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT: PSS) was demonstrated an efficient DSSC counter electrodewith a maximum power conversion efficiency of 7.58%. Furthermore; electrochemicalimpedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry measurements revealed that the excellentphotovoltaic performance is due to the combination between the high catalytic activity of NiOand the superior electrical conductivity of PEDOT: PSS. The optimum weight ratio of NiO toPEDOT: PSS is 48.,Topics in Catalysis,2014,40
Electrolyte-induced precipitation of graphene oxide in its aqueous solution,Hui Wang; Yun Hang Hu,Abstract Graphene oxide (GO) can easily dissolve in water to form a stable homogeneoussolution due to its hydrophilic property and ionization of functional groups. However; in thispaper; it is reported that a strong electrolyte (HCl; LiOH; LiCl; LiBr; KCl; or KBr) candestabilize the GO solution; causing GO precipitation. This indicates that the electrostaticrepulsion plays a critical role in stabilizing aqueous GO solution. The electrolyte-inducedprecipitates were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM); Ramanspectroscopy; and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The oxygen-containingfunctional groups of GO sheets; which are carboxyl; epoxy; and hydroxyl groups; remainedunchanged during acid (HCl)-and salt (LiCl)-induced precipitations. In contrast; during theGO precipitation induced by a base (LiOH); the carboxyl group of GO sheets disappeared …,Journal of colloid and interface science,2013,28

Hood; Gayatri Sahu; Amaresh Samuthira Pandian;Jong Kahk Keum; Ke An,Abstract All-solid-state sodium batteries; using solid electrolyte and abundant sodiumresources; show great promise for safe; low-cost; and large-scale energy storageapplications. The exploration of novel solid electrolytes is critical for the room temperatureoperation of all-solid-state Na batteries. An ideal solid electrolyte must have high ionicconductivity; hold outstanding chemical and electrochemical stability; and employ low-costsynthetic methods.

Titania Composites with 2 D Transition Metal Carbides as Photocatalysts for Hydrogen Production under Visible‐Light Irradiation,Hui Wang; Rui Peng; Zachary D Hood; Michael Naguib; Shiba P Adhikari; Zili Wu,Abstract MXenes; a family of two-dimensional transition-metal carbides; were successfullydemonstrated as co-catalysts with rutile TiO 2 for visible-light-induced solar hydrogenproduction from water splitting. The physicochemical properties of Ti 3 C 2 T x MXenecoupled with TiO 2 were investigated by a variety of characterization techniques. The effectof the Ti 3 C 2 T x loading on the photocatalytic performance of the TiO 2/Ti 3 C 2 T xcomposites was elucidated. With an optimized Ti 3 C 2 T x content of 5 wt%; the TiO 2/Ti 3 C2 T x composite shows a 400% enhancement in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolutionreaction compared with that of pure rutile TiO 2. We also expanded our exploration to otherMXenes (Nb 2 CT x and Ti 2 CT x) as co-catalysts coupled with TiO 2; and these materialsalso exhibited enhanced hydrogen production.

These functionalheterojunctions are formed among the different phases of chemically exfoliated MoS2monolayers: semiconducting 2H; metallic 1T; and quasi-metallic 1T′ phases. Theproportion of the three MoS2 phases can be systematically controlled via thermal annealingof the nanosheets. Interestingly; a volcano relationship is observed between thephotocatalytic HER activity and the annealing temperature with an optimum activity obtainedafter annealing at 60° C.

Fabrication of ultrathin solid electrolyte membranes of β-Li 3 PS 4 nanoflakes by evaporation-induced self-assembly for all-solid-state batteries,Hui Wang; Zachary D Hood; Younan Xia; Chengdu Liang,All-solid-state lithium batteries are attractive candidates for next-generation energy storagedevices because of their anticipated high energy density and intrinsic safety. Owing to theirexcellent ionic conductivity and stability with metallic lithium anodes; nanostructured lithiumthiophosphate solid electrolytes such as β-Li3PS4 have found use in the fabrication of all-solid lithium batteries for large-scale energy storage systems. However; current methods forpreparing air-sensitive solid electrolyte membranes of lithium thiophosphates can onlygenerate thick membranes that compromise the battery's gravimetric/volumetric energydensity and thus its rate performance. To overcome this limitation; the solid electrolyte'sthickness needs to be effectively decreased to achieve ideal energy density and enhancedrate performance.

Effect of heating rate on structure of HA coating prepared by sol–gel,H Wang; CZ Chen; DG Wang,Abstract HA coatings were deposited on Ti–6Al–4V alloy substrate using the sol–geltechnique. Various heat treatments were carried out and the subsequent effect of heatingrate on the resulting coatings was also investigated. The sol–gel derived coatings werestudied by X-ray diffraction; electronic probe microanalysis and scratch tester. The resultsshow that the heating rate greatly influences the morphologies; the composition and theadhesion strength of resulting coatings. Under the slow heating rate; the coatings arecharacterised by high phase purity; compact lamellar structure and less cracks on thesurface. Moreover; the scratch test results indicate that the adhesion strength of coatingswith slow heating rate is higher than that of coatings with rapid heating rate.,Surface Engineering,2009,11
Metal-catalyst-free Carbohydrazide Fuel Cells with Three-Dimensional Graphene Anodes,Ji Qi; N Benipal; Hui Wang; David Chadderdon; Ying Jiang; Wenzhen Wei Wei; Hu; Yunhang; Li,Abstract As a potential solution to concerns on sustainable energy; the wide spreadcommercialization of fuel cell has long been hindered by limited reserves and relatively highcosts of metal catalysts. 3D graphene; a carbon-only catalyst prepared by reduction ofcarbon monoxide with lithium oxide; is found to electrochemically catalyze carbohydrazideoxidation reaction efficiently. A prototype of a completely metal-catalyst-free anion exchangemembrane fuel cell (AEMFC) with a 3D graphene anode catalyst and an N-doped CNT (N-CNT) cathode catalyst generate a peak power density of 24.9 mW cm− 2. The averagenumber of electrons electrochemically extracted from one carbohydrazide molecule is 4.9;indicating the existence of C [BOND] N bond activation; which is a key factor contributing tohigh fuel utilization efficiency.,Chemsuschem,2015,8
The “filler effect”: A study of solid oxide fillers with β-Li 3 PS 4 for lithium conducting electrolytes,Zachary D Hood; Hui Wang; Yunchao Li; Amaresh Samuthira Pandian; M Parans Paranthaman; Chengdu Liang,Abstract Solid electrolytes are the subject of intense study partly because of their use insafer; high energy density; all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries. The addition of solid oxidefillers has been previously explored as a way to increase the ionic conductivity in compositeelectrolytes; however; no comparative study of the effect of both ion-conducting and non-conducting oxides on solid lithium superionic conductor electrolyte is reported. Nano-crystalline β-Li 3 PS 4 (LPS) was recently shown to have anomalous high ionic conductivity;but it was found that this property can be further enhanced.

Tuning shape of three dimensional graphene sheets,Hui Wang; Wei Wei; Yunhang Hu,Abstract 3D graphene has been explored as an important material and catalyst for manyapplications. However; it is still a challenge to tune the shape of 3D graphene sheets.Herein; it is demonstrated that the shapes of 3D graphene sheets; which were synthesizedfrom the reaction between Li 2 O and CO; are strongly dependent on the particle size of Li 2O. When Li 2 O particle size was very small (about 400 nm); the formed graphene sheetspossessed a granulated shape. However; as Li 2 O particle size increased; the shape of thesynthesized graphene sheets changed to flower-structure and then to honeycomb-structure.Furthermore; the shape change of graphene from the granulated to the honeycomb-structured can increase its electro-catalytic efficiency as a counter electrode catalyst for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).,Catalysis Today,2016,3
High‐Performance Lithium Solid‐State Batteries Operating at Elevated Temperature,Hui Wang; Cheng Ma; Miaofang Chi; Chengdu Liang,Although room temperature is the most comfortable zone for battery cycling; there are manydemanding situations in which batteries are required to operate at high temperatures (> 100C); for example; in space exploration applications and oil drilling equipment. It is difficult forLi-ion batteries to fulfill these needs because of their serious safety issues; but solid-statebatteries represent a promising solution. Therefore; it is necessary and important toinvestigate the tolerance of solid-state batteries for elevated temperatures. Actually; warm-temperature operation offers a few advantages for solid-state batteries:(1) chemicalreactions happen faster at elevated temperatures; therefore; a high temperature favors high-rate battery cycling;(2) battery operation generates heat; so a cell that tolerates hightemperatures could eliminate the complex temperature control system required for a …,Advanced Materials Interfaces,2015,3

Highly dispersed buckybowls as model carbocatalysts for C–H bond activation,Ilgaz Soykal; Hui Wang; Jewook Park; An-Ping Li; Chengdu Liang; and Schwartz Viviane,Fullerene-derived buckybowl fractions dispersed on mesoporous silica constitute an idealmodel for studying the catalysis of graphitic forms of carbon since the dispersed carbonnanostructures contain a high ratio of edge defects and curvature induced by non-six-membered rings. Dispersion of the active centers on an easily accessible high surface areamaterial allowed for high density of surface active sites associated with oxygenatedstructures.
