Geo-indistinguishability: Differential privacy for location-based systems,Miguel E Andrés; Nicolás E Bordenabe; Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Catuscia Palamidessi,Abstract The growing popularity of location-based systems; allowing unknown/untrustedservers to easily collect huge amounts of information regarding users' location; has recentlystarted raising serious privacy concerns. In this paper we introduce geoind; a formal notionof privacy for location-based systems that protects the user's exact location; while allowingapproximate information--typically needed to obtain a certain desired service--to bereleased. This privacy definition formalizes the intuitive notion of protecting the user'slocation within a radius $ r $ with a level of privacy that depends on r; and corresponds to ageneralized version of the well-known concept of differential privacy. Furthermore; wepresent a mechanism for achieving geoind by adding controlled random noise to the user'slocation.,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGSAC conference on Computer & communications security,2013,277
Anonymity protocols as noisy channels,Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Catuscia Palamidessi; Prakash Panangaden,Abstract We consider a framework in which anonymity protocols are interpreted as noisychannels in the information-theoretic sense; and we explore the idea of using the notion ofcapacity as a measure of the loss of anonymity. Such idea was already suggested byMoskowitz; Newman and Syverson; in their analysis of the covert channel that can becreated as a result of non-perfect anonymity. We consider the case in which some leak ofinformation is intended by design; and we introduce the notion of conditional capacity to ruleout this factor; thus retrieving a natural correspondence with the notion of anonymity.Furthermore; we show how to compute the capacity and the conditional capacity when theanonymity protocol satisfies certain symmetries. We also investigate how the adversary cantest the system to try to infer the user's identity; and we study how his probability of …,Information and Computation,2008,207
Measuring Information Leakage using Generalized Gain Functions,S Alvim M'rio; Kostas Chatzikokolakis; Catuscia Palamidessi; Geoffrey Smith,This paper introduces g-leakage; a rich generalization of the min-entropy model ofquantitative information flow. In g-leakage; the benefit that an adversary derives from acertain guess about a secret is specified using a gain function g. Gain functions allow a widevariety of operational scenarios to be modeled; including those where the adversary benefitsfrom guessing a value close to the secret; guessing a part of the secret; guessing a propertyof the secret; or guessing the secret within some number of tries. We prove importantproperties of g-leakage; including bounds between min-capacity; g-capacity; and Shannoncapacity. We also show a deep connection between a strong leakage ordering on twochannels; C 1 and C 2; and the possibility of factoring C 1 into C 2 C 3; for some C 3. Basedon this connection; we propose a generalization of the Lattice of Information from …,2012 IEEE 25th Computer Security Foundations Symposium,2012,132
Quantitative notions of leakage for one-try attacks,Christelle Braun; Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Catuscia Palamidessi,Abstract Recent research in quantitative theories for information-hiding topics; such asAnonymity and Secure Information Flow; tend to converge towards the idea of modeling thesystem as a noisy channel in the information-theoretic sense. The notion of informationleakage; or vulnerability of the system; has been related in some approaches to the conceptof mutual information of the channel. A recent work of Smith has shown; however; that if theattack consists in one single try; then the mutual information and other concepts based onShannon entropy are not suitable; and he has proposed to use Rényi's min-entropy instead.In this paper; we consider and compare two different possibilities of defining the leakage;based on the Bayes risk; a concept related to Rényi min-entropy.,Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science,2009,105
Broadening the scope of differential privacy using metrics,Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Miguel E Andrés; Nicolás Emilio Bordenabe; Catuscia Palamidessi,Abstract Differential Privacy is one of the most prominent frameworks used to deal withdisclosure prevention in statistical databases. It provides a formal privacy guarantee;ensuring that sensitive information relative to individuals cannot be easily inferred bydisclosing answers to aggregate queries. If two databases are adjacent; ie differ only for anindividual; then the query should not allow to tell them apart by more than a certain factor.This induces a bound also on the distinguishability of two generic databases; which isdetermined by their distance on the Hamming graph of the adjacency relation. In this paperwe explore the implications of differential privacy when the indistinguishability requirementdepends on an arbitrary notion of distance. We show that we can naturally express; in thisway;(protection against) privacy threats that cannot be represented with the standard …,International Symposium on Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium,2013,94
Statistical measurement of information leakage,Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Tom Chothia; Apratim Guha,Abstract Information theory provides a range of useful methods to analyse probabilitydistributions and these techniques have been successfully applied to measure informationflow and the loss of anonymity in secure systems. However; previous work has tended toassume that the exact probabilities of every action are known; or that the system is non-deterministic. In this paper; we show that measures of information leakage based on mutualinformation and capacity can be calculated; automatically; from trial runs of a system alone.We find a confidence interval for this estimate based on the number of possible inputs;observations and samples. We have developed a tool to automatically perform this analysisand we demonstrate our method by analysing a Mixminon anonymous remailer node.,International Conference on Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,2010,84
Optimal geo-indistinguishable mechanisms for location privacy,Nicolás E Bordenabe; Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Catuscia Palamidessi,Abstract We consider the geo-indistinguishability approach to location privacy; and the trade-off with respect to utility. We show that; given a desired degree ofgeo-indistinguishability; it ispossible to construct a mechanism that minimizes the service quality loss; using linearprogramming techniques. In addition we show that; under certain conditions; suchmechanism also provides optimal privacy in the sense of Shokri et al. Furthermore; wepropose a method to reduce the number of constraints of the linear program from cubic toquadratic; maintaining the privacy guarantees and without affecting significantly the utility ofthe generated mechanism. This reduces considerably the time required to solve the linearprogram; thus enlarging significantly the location sets for which the optimal mechanisms canbe computed.,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2014,75
On the Bayes risk in information-hiding protocols,Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Catuscia Palamidessi; Prakash Panangaden,Abstract Randomized protocols for hiding private information can be regarded as noisychannels in the information-theoretic sense; and the inference of the concealed informationcan be regarded as a hypothesis-testing problem. We consider the Bayesian approach tothe problem; and investigate the probability of error associated to the MAP (maximum aposteriori probability) inference rule. Our main result is a constructive characterization of aconvex base of the probability of error; which allows us to compute its maximum value (overall possible input distributions); and to identify upper bounds for it in terms of simplefunctions. As a side result; we are able to improve the Hellman–Raviv and the Santhi–Vardybounds expressed in terms of conditional entropy. We then discuss an application of ourmethodology to the Crowds protocol; and in particular we show how to compute the …,Journal of Computer Security,2008,74
Formal verification of privacy for RFID systems,Mayla Brusó; Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Jerry Den Hartog,RFID tags are being widely employed in a variety of applications; ranging from barcodereplacement to electronic passports. Their extensive use; however; in combination with theirwireless nature; introduces privacy concerns as a tag could leak information about theowner's behaviour. In this paper we define two privacy notions; unlinkability and forwardprivacy; using a formal model based on the applied pi calculus; and we show therelationship between them. Then we focus on a generic class of simple privacy protocols;giving sufficient and necessary conditions for unlinkability and forward privacy for this class.These conditions are based on the concept of frame independence that we develop in thispaper. Finally; we apply our techniques to two identification protocols; formally proving theirprivacy guarantees.,Computer Security Foundations Symposium (CSF); 2010 23rd IEEE,2010,66
A survey of anonymous peer-to-peer file-sharing,Tom Chothia; Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis,Abstract This paper provides a survey of searchable; peer-to-peer file-sharing systems thatoffer the user some form of anonymity. We start this survey by giving a brief description of themost popular methods of providing anonymous communication. These include the Antsprotocol; Onion routing; Multicasting; MIXes and UDP address spoofing. We then describe anumber of implemented systems based on one; or a combination of; these methods. Finally;we discuss possible attacks on the anonymity of these systems and give examples ofparticular attacks and defences used by the systems we describe.,International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing,2005,62
Differential privacy: on the trade-off between utility and information leakage,Mário S Alvim; Miguel E Andrés; Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Pierpaolo Degano; Catuscia Palamidessi,Abstract Differential privacy is a notion of privacy that has become very popular in thedatabase community. Roughly; the idea is that a randomized query mechanism providessufficient privacy protection if the ratio between the probabilities that two adjacent datasetsgive the same answer is bound by e ε. In the field of information flow there is a similarconcern for controlling information leakage; ie limiting the possibility of inferring the secretinformation from the observables. In recent years; researchers have proposed to quantify theleakage in terms of min-entropy leakage; a concept strictly related to the Bayes risk. In thispaper; we show how to model the query system in terms of an information-theoretic channel;and we compare the notion of differential privacy with that of min-entropy leakage. We showthat differential privacy implies a bound on the min-entropy leakage; but not vice-versa …,International Workshop on Formal Aspects in Security and Trust,2011,59
A predictive differentially-private mechanism for mobility traces,Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Catuscia Palamidessi; Marco Stronati,Abstract With the increasing popularity of GPS-enabled handheld devices; location basedapplications and services have access to accurate and real-time location information; raisingserious privacy concerns for their millions of users. Trying to address these issues; thenotion of geo-indistinguishability was recently introduced; adapting the well-known conceptof Differential Privacy to the area of location-based systems. A Laplace-based obfuscationmechanism satisfying this privacy notion works well in the case of a sporadic use; Underrepeated use; however; independently applying noise leads to a quick loss of privacy due tothe correlation between the location in the trace. In this paper we show that correlations inthe trace can be in fact exploited in terms of a prediction function that tries to guess the newlocation based on the previously reported locations. The proposed mechanism tests the …,International Symposium on Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium,2014,50
On the relation between differential privacy and quantitative information flow,Mário Alvim; Miguel Andrés; Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Catuscia Palamidessi,Abstract Differential privacy is a notion that has emerged in the community of statisticaldatabases; as a response to the problem of protecting the privacy of the database'sparticipants when performing statistical queries. The idea is that a randomized querysatisfies differential privacy if the likelihood of obtaining a certain answer for a database x isnot too different from the likelihood of obtaining the same answer on adjacent databases; iedatabases which differ from x for only one individual. Information flow is an area of Securityconcerned with the problem of controlling the leakage of confidential information inprograms and protocols. Nowadays; one of the most established approaches to quantify andto reason about leakage is based on the Rényi min entropy version of information theory. Inthis paper; we analyze critically the notion of differential privacy in light of the conceptual …,Automata; Languages and Programming,2011,45
Making random choices invisible to the scheduler,Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Catuscia Palamidessi,Abstract When dealing with process calculi and automata which express bothnondeterministic and probabilistic behavior; it is customary to introduce the notion ofscheduler to resolve the nondeterminism. It has been observed that for certain applications;notably those in security; the scheduler needs to be restricted so not to reveal the outcome ofthe protocol's random choices; or otherwise the model of adversary would be too strongeven for “obviously correct” protocols. We propose a process-algebraic framework in whichthe control on the scheduler can be specified in syntactic terms; and we show how to apply itto solve the problem mentioned above. We also consider the definition of (probabilistic) mayand must preorders; and we show that they are precongruences with respect to the restrictedschedulers.

Probability of error in information-hiding protocols,Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Catuscia Palamidessi; Prakash Panangaden,Randomized protocols for hiding private information can fruitfully be regarded as noisychannels in the information-theoretic sense; and the inference of the concealed informationcan be regarded as a hypothesis-testing problem. We consider the Bayesian approach tothe problem; and investigate the probability of error associated to the inference when theMAP (maximum aposteriori probability) decision rule is adopted. Our main result is aconstructive characterization of a convex base of the probability of error; which allows us tocompute its maximum value (over all possible input distributions); and to identify upperbounds for it in terms of simple functions. As a side result; we are able to improvesubstantially the Hellman-Raviv and the Santhi-Vardy bounds expressed in terms ofconditional entropy.

Additive and multiplicative notions of leakage; and their capacities,Mário S Alvim; Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Annabelle McIver; Carroll Morgan; Catuscia Palamidessi; Geoffrey Smith,Protecting sensitive information from improper disclosure is a fundamental security goal. It iscomplicated; and difficult to achieve; often because of unavoidable or even unpredictableoperating conditions that can lead to breaches in planned security defences. An attractiveapproach is to frame the goal as a quantitative problem; and then to design methods thatmeasure system vulnerabilities in terms of the amount of information they leak. Aconsequence is that the precise operating conditions; and assumptions about priorknowledge; can play a crucial role in assessing the severity of any measured vunerability.We develop this theme by concentrating on vulnerability measures that are robust in thesense of allowing general leakage bounds to be placed on a program; bounds that applywhatever its operating conditions and whatever the prior knowledge might be.

A framework for analyzing probabilistic protocols and its application to the partial secrets exchange,Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Catuscia Palamidessi,Abstract We propose a probabilistic variant of the pi-calculus as a framework to specifyrandomized security protocols and their intended properties. In order to express and verifythe correctness of the protocols; we develop a probabilistic version of the testing semantics.We then illustrate these concepts on an extended example: the Partial Secret Exchange; aprotocol which uses a randomized primitive; the Oblivious Transfer; to achieve fairness ofinformation exchange between two parties.,Theoretical Computer Science,2007,35
Probable innocence revisited,Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Catuscia Palamidessi,Abstract In this paper we propose a formalization of probable innocence; a notion ofprobabilistic anonymity that is associated to “realistic” protocols such as Crowds. Weanalyze critically two different definitions of probable innocence from the literature. The firstone; corresponding to the property that Reiter and Rubin have proved for Crowds; aims atlimiting the probability of detection. The second one; by Halpern and O'Neill; aims atconstraining the attacker's confidence. Our proposal combines the spirit of both thesedefinitions while generalizing them. In particular; our definition does not need symmetryassumptions; and it does not depend on the probabilities of the users to perform the action ofinterest. We show that; in case of a symmetric system; our definition corresponds exactly tothe one of Reiter and Rubin. Furthermore; in the case of users with uniform probabilities; it …,Theoretical Computer Science,2006,34
Compositional methods for information-hiding,Christelle Braun; Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Catuscia Palamidessi,Abstract Protocols for information-hiding often use randomized primitives to obfuscate thelink between the observables and the information to be protected. The degree of protectionprovided by a protocol can be expressed in terms of the probability of error associated to theinference of the secret information. We consider a probabilistic process calculus approach tothe specification of such protocols; and we study how the operators affect the probability oferror. In particular; we characterize constructs that have the property of not decreasing thedegree of protection; and that can therefore be considered safe in the modular constructionof protocols. As a case study; we apply these techniques to the Dining Cryptographers; andwe are able to derive a generalization of Chaum's strong anonymity result.,International Conference on Foundations of Software Science and Computational Structures,2008,33

Bisimulation for demonic schedulers,Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Gethin Norman; David Parker,Abstract Bisimulation between processes has been proven a successful method forformalizing security properties. We argue that in certain cases; a scheduler that has fullinformation on the process and collaborates with the attacker can allow him to distinguishtwo processes even though they are bisimilar. This phenomenon is related to the issue thatbisimilarity is not preserved by refinement. As a solution; we introduce a finer variant ofbisimulation in which processes are required to simulate each other under the “same”scheduler. We formalize this notion in a variant of CCS with explicit schedulers and showthat this new bisimilarity can be characterized by a refinement-preserving traditionalbisimilarity. Using a third characterization of this equivalence; we show how to verify it forfinite systems. We then apply the new equivalence to anonymity and show that it implies …,International Conference on Foundations of Software Science and Computational Structures,2009,23
Constructing elastic distinguishability metrics for location privacy,Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Catuscia Palamidessi; Marco Stronati,Abstract With the increasing popularity of hand-held devices; location-based applicationsand services have access to accurate and real-time location information; raising seriousprivacy concerns for their users. The recently introduced notion of geo-indistinguishabilitytries to address this problem by adapting the well-known concept of differential privacy to thearea of location-based systems. Although geo-indistinguishability presents variousappealing aspects; it has the problem of treating space in a uniform way; imposing theaddition of the same amount of noise everywhere on the map. In this paper we propose anovel elastic distinguishability metric that warps the geometrical distance; capturing thedifferent degrees of density of each area. As a consequence; the obtained mechanismadapts the level of noise while achieving the same degree of privacy everywhere. We …,Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,2015,22

Generalized bisimulation metrics,Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Daniel Gebler; Catuscia Palamidessi; Lili Xu,Abstract The bisimilarity pseudometric based on the Kantorovich lifting is one of the mostpopular metrics for probabilistic processes proposed in the literature. However; itsapplication in verification is limited to linear properties. We propose a generalization of thismetric which allows to deal with a wider class of properties; such as those used in securityand privacy. More precisely; we propose a family of metrics; parametrized on a notion ofdistance which depends on the property we want to verify. Furthermore; we show that themembers of this family still characterize bisimilarity in terms of their kernel; and provide abound on the corresponding metrics on traces. Finally; we study the case of a metriccorresponding to differential privacy. We show that in this case it is possible to have a dualform; easier to compute; and we prove that the typical constructs of process algebra are …,International Conference on Concurrency Theory,2014,18
Quantitative information flow and applications to differential privacy,Mário S Alvim; Miguel E Andrés; Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Catuscia Palamidessi,Abstract Secure information flow is the problem of ensuring that the information madepublicly available by a computational system does not leak information that should be keptsecret. Since it is practically impossible to avoid leakage entirely; in recent years there hasbeen a growing interest in considering the quantitative aspects of information flow; in orderto measure and compare the amount of leakage. Information theory is widely regarded as anatural framework to provide firm foundations to quantitive information flow. In this notes wereview the two main information-theoretic approaches that have been investigated: the onebased on Shannon entropy; and the one based on Rényi min-entropy. Furthermore; wediscuss some applications in the area of privacy. In particular; we consider statisticaldatabases and the recently-proposed notion of differential privacy.

Axioms for Information Leakage,Mário S Alvim; Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Annabelle McIver; Carroll Morgan; Catuscia Palamidessi; Geoffrey Smith,Quantitative information flow aims to assess and control the leakage of sensitive informationby computer systems. A key insight in this area is that no single leakage measure isappropriate in all operational scenarios; as a result; many leakage measures have beenproposed; with many different properties. To clarify this complex situation; this paper studiesinformation leakage axiomatically; showing important dependencies among differentaxioms. It also establishes a completeness result about the g-leakage family; showing thatany leakage measure satisfying certain intuitively-reasonable properties can be expressedas a g-leakage.,Computer Security Foundations Symposium (CSF); 2016 IEEE 29th,2016,14
Compositionality results for quantitative information flow,Yusuke Kawamoto; Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Catuscia Palamidessi,Abstract In the min-entropy approach to quantitative information flow; the leakage is definedin terms of a minimization problem; which; in case of large systems; can be computationallyrather heavy. The same happens for the recently proposed generalization called g-vulnerability. In this paper we study the case in which the channel associated to the systemcan be decomposed into simpler channels; which typically happens when the observablesconsist of several components. Our main contribution is the derivation of bounds on the g-leakage of the whole system in terms of the g-leakages of its components.,International Conference on Quantitative Evaluation of Systems,2014,14
A monotonicity principle for information theory,Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Keye Martin,Abstract We establish a monotonicity principle for convex functions that enables high-levelreasoning about capacity in information theory. Despite its simplicity; this single idea isremarkably applicable. It leads to a significant extension of algebraic information theory; asolution of the capacity reduction problem; intuitive graphical methods for comparingchannels; new inequalities that provide useful estimates on the information transmittingcapability of a channel operating in an unknown environment; further explication of thefascinating relationship between capacity and Euclidean distance; and the solution of anopen problem in quantum steganography.,Electronic Notes in Theoretical computer science,2008,14
Differential privacy versus quantitative information flow,Mário S Alvim; Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Pierpaolo Degano; Catuscia Palamidessi,Abstract: Differential privacy is a notion of privacy that has become very popular in thedatabase community. Roughly; the idea is that a randomized query mechanism providessufficient privacy protection if the ratio between the probabilities of two different entries tooriginate a certain answer is bound by e^\epsilon. In the fields of anonymity and informationflow there is a similar concern for controlling information leakage; ie limiting the possibility ofinferring the secret information from the observables. In recent years; researchers haveproposed to quantify the leakage in terms of the information-theoretic notion of mutualinformation. There are two main approaches that fall in this category: One based onShannon entropy; and one based on R\'enyi's min entropy. The latter has connection withthe so-called Bayes risk; which expresses the probability of guessing the secret. In this …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1012.4250,2010,12
Linking unlinkability,Mayla Brusó; Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Sandro Etalle; Jerry Den Hartog,Abstract Unlinkability is a privacy property of crucial importance for several systems (such asRFID or voting systems). Informally; unlinkability states that; given two events/items in asystem; an attacker is not able to infer whether they are related to each other. However; inthe literature we find several definitions for this notion; which are apparently unrelated andshows a potentially problematic lack of agreement. This paper sheds new light onunlinkability by comparing different ways of defining it and showing that in many practicalsituations the various definitions coincide. It does so by (a) expressing in a unifyingframework four definitions of unlinkability from the literature (b) demonstrating how thesedefinitions are different yet related to each other and to their dual notion of “inseparability”and (c) by identifying conditions under which all these definitions become equivalent.

Metrics for differential privacy in concurrent systems,Lili Xu; Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Huimin Lin,Abstract Originally proposed for privacy protection in the context of statistical databases;differential privacy is now widely adopted in various models of computation. In this paper weinvestigate techniques for proving differential privacy in the context of concurrent systems.Our motivation stems from the work of Tschantz et al.; who proposed a verification methodbased on proving the existence of a stratified family between states; that can track theprivacy leakage; ensuring that it does not exceed a given leakage budget. We improve thistechnique by investigating a state property which is more permissive and still impliesdifferential privacy. We consider two pseudometrics on probabilistic automata: The first oneis essentially a reformulation of the notion proposed by Tschantz et al. The second one is amore liberal variant; relaxing the relation between them by integrating the notion of …,International Conference on Formal Techniques for Distributed Objects; Components; and Systems,2014,9

Construction and repair: A hybrid approach to search in csps,Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; George Boukeas; Panagiotis Stamatopoulos,Abstract In order to obtain a solution to a constraint satisfaction problem; constructivemethods iteratively extend a consistent partial assignment until all problem variables areinstantiated. If the current partial assignment is proved to be inconsistent; it is then necessaryto backtrack and perform alternative instantiations. On the other hand; reparative methodsiteratively repair an inconsistent complete assignment until it becomes consistent. In thisresearch; we investigate an approach which allows for the combination of constructive andreparative methods; in the hope of exploiting their intrinsic advantages and circumventingtheir shortcomings. Initially; we discuss a general hybrid method called cr and then proceedto specify its parameters in order to provide a fully operational search method called cnr.

We focus on the problem of formalizing the notion of information hiding; andverifying that a given protocol achieves the intended degree of protection.

Generalized differential privacy: Regions of priors that admit robust optimal mechanisms,Ehab ElSalamouny; Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Catuscia Palamidessi,Abstract Differential privacy is a notion of privacy that was initially designed for statisticaldatabases; and has been recently extended to a more general class of domains. Bothdifferential privacy and its generalized version can be achieved by adding random noise tothe reported data. Thus; privacy is obtained at the cost of reducing the data's accuracy; andtherefore their utility. In this paper we consider the problem of identifying optimalmechanisms for generalized differential privacy; ie mechanisms that maximize the utility for agiven level of privacy. The utility usually depends on a prior distribution of the data; andnaturally it would be desirable to design mechanisms that are universally optimal; ie; optimalfor all priors. However it is already known that such mechanisms do not exist in general. Wethen characterize maximal classes of priors for which a mechanism which is optimal for all …,*,2014,5
Information leakage games,Mário S Alvim; Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Yusuke Kawamoto; Catuscia Palamidessi,Abstract We consider a game-theoretic setting to model the interplay between attacker anddefender in the context of information flow; and to reason about their optimal strategies. Incontrast with standard game theory; in our games the utility of a mixed strategy is a convexfunction of the distribution on the defender's pure actions; rather than the expected value oftheir utilities. Nevertheless; the important properties of game theory; notably the existence ofa Nash equilibrium; still hold for our (zero-sum) leakage games; and we provide algorithmsto compute the corresponding optimal strategies. As typical in (simultaneous) game theory;the optimal strategy is usually mixed; ie; probabilistic; for both the attacker and the defender.From the point of view of information flow; this was to be expected in the case of thedefender; since it is well known that randomization at the level of the system design may …,International Conference on Decision and Game Theory for Security,2017,4
On the compositionality of quantitative information flow,Yusuke Kawamoto; Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Catuscia Palamidessi,Abstract: In the min-entropy approach to quantitative information flow; the leakage is definedin terms of a minimization problem; which; in the case of large systems; can becomputationally rather heavy. The same happens for the recently proposed generalizationcalled g-vulnerability. In this paper we study the case in which the channel associated to thesystem can be decomposed into simpler channels; which typically happens when theobservables consist of multiple components. Our main contribution is the derivation ofbounds on the g-leakage of the whole system in terms of the g-leakages of its components.We also consider the particular cases of min-entropy leakage and of parallel channels;generalizing and systematizing results from the literature. We demonstrate the effectivenessof our method and evaluate the precision of our bounds using examples.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.00455,2016,4
On the information leakage of differentially-private mechanisms,Mário S Alvim; Miguel E Andrés; Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Pierpaolo Degano; Catuscia Palamidessi,Abstract Differential privacy aims at protecting the privacy of participants in statisticaldatabases. Roughly; a mechanism satisfies differential privacy if the presence or value of asingle individual in the database does not significantly change the likelihood of obtaining acertain answer to any statistical query posed by a data analyst. Differentially-privatemechanisms are often oblivious: first the query is processed on the database to produce atrue answer; and then this answer is adequately randomized before being reported to thedata analyst. Ideally; a mechanism should minimize leakage–ie; obfuscate as much aspossible the link between reported answers and individuals' data–while maximizing utility–ie; report answers as similar as possible to the true ones. These two goals; however; are inconflict with each other; thus imposing a trade-off between privacy and utility.,Journal of Computer Security,2015,4
Efficient Utility Improvement for Location Privacy,Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Ehab Elsalamouny; Catuscia Palamidessi,Abstract The continuously increasing use of location-based services poses an importantthreat to the privacy of users. A natural defense is to employ an obfuscation mechanism;such as those providing geo-indistinguishability; a framework for obtaining formal privacyguarantees that has become popular in recent years.,Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,2017,3
A differentially private mechanism of optimal utility for a region of priors,Ehab Elsalamouny; Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Catuscia Palamidessi,Abstract The notion of differential privacy has emerged in the area of statistical databases asa measure of protection of the participants' sensitive information; which can be compromisedby selected queries. Differential privacy is usually achieved by using mechanisms that addrandom noise to the query answer. Thus; privacy is obtained at the cost of reducing theaccuracy; and therefore the utility; of the answer. Since the utility depends on the user's sideinformation; commonly modelled as a prior distribution; a natural goal is to designmechanisms that are optimal for every prior. However; it has been shown that suchmechanisms do not exist for any query other than (essentially) counting queries ([1]). Giventhe above negative result; in this paper we consider the problem of identifying a restrictedclass of priors for which an optimal mechanism does exist. Given an arbitrary query and a …,International Conference on Principles of Security and Trust,2013,2
D-spaces: Implementing declarative semantics for spatially structured information,Stefan Haar; Salim Perchy; Frank Valencia,We introduce in this paper D-SPACES; an implementation of constraint systems with spaceand extrusion operators. Constraint systems are algebraic models that allow for a semanticlanguage-like representation of information in systems where the concept of space is aprimary structural feature. We give this information mainly an epistemic interpretation andconsider various agents as entities acting upon it. D-SPACES is coded as a c++ 11 libraryproviding implementations for constraint systems; space functions and extrusion functions.The interfaces to access each implementation are minimal and thoroughly documented. D-SPACES also provides property-checking methods as well as an implementation of aspecific type of constraint systems (a boolean algebra). This last implementation serves asan entry point for quick access and proof of concept when using these models …,Semantic Computing (ICSC); 2017 IEEE 11th International Conference on,2017,1
Compositional methods for information-hiding,Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Catuscia Palamidessi; Christelle Braun,Abstract Systems concerned with information hiding often use randomization to obfuscatethe link between the observables and the information to be protected. The degree ofprotection provided by a system can be expressed in terms of the probability of errorassociated with the inference of the secret information. We consider a probabilistic processcalculus to specify such systems; and we study how the operators affect the probability oferror. In particular; we characterize constructs that have the property of not decreasing thedegree of protection; and that can therefore be considered safe in the modular constructionof these systems. As a case study; we apply these techniques to the dining cryptographers;and we derive a generalization of Chaum's strong anonymity result.,Mathematical Structures in Computer Science,2016,1

Leakage and Protocol Composition in a Game-Theoretic Perspective,Mário S Alvim; Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Yusuke Kawamoto; Catuscia Palamidessi,Abstract: In the inference attacks studied in Quantitative Information Flow (QIF); theadversary typically tries to interfere with the system in the attempt to increase its leakage ofsecret information. The defender; on the other hand; typically tries to decrease leakage byintroducing some controlled noise. This noise introduction can be modeled as a type ofprotocol composition; ie; a probabilistic choice among different protocols; and its effect onthe amount of leakage depends heavily on whether or not this choice is visible to theadversary. In this work we consider operators for modeling visible and invisible choice inprotocol composition; and we study their algebraic properties. We then formalize theinterplay between defender and adversary in a game-theoretic framework adapted to thespecific issues of QIF; where the payoff is information leakage. We consider various kinds …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.10465,2018,*
Knowledge extraction from maritime spatiotemporal data: An evaluation of clustering algorithms on Big Data,Giannis Spiliopoulos; Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Dimitrios Zissis; Evmorfia Biliri; Dimitrios Papaspyros; Giannis Tsapelas; Spyros Mouzakitis,In this paper we attempt to define the major trade routes which vessels of trade follow whentravelling across the globe in a scalable; data-driven unsupervised way. For this; we exploita large volume of historical AIS data; so as to estimate the location and connections of themajor trade routes; with minimal reliance on other sources of information. We address thechallenges posed due to the volume of data by leveraging distributed computing techniquesand present a novel MapReduce based algorithmic approach; capable of handling skewedand nonuniform geospatial data. In the direction; we calculate and compare the performance(execution time and compression ratio) and accuracy of several mature clustering algorithmsand present preliminary results.,Big Data (Big Data); 2017 IEEE International Conference on,2017,*
Trading Optimality for Performance in Location Privacy,Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Serge Haddad; Ali Kassem; Catuscia Palamidessi,Abstract: Location-Based Services (LBSs) provide invaluable aid in the everyday activities ofmany individuals; however they also pose serious threats to the user'privacy. There is;therefore; a growing interest in the development of mechanisms to protect location privacyduring the use of LBSs. Nowadays; the most popular methods are probabilistic; and the so-called optimal method achieves an optimal trade-off between privacy and utility by usinglinear optimization techniques. Unfortunately; due to the complexity of linear programming;the method is unfeasible for a large number n of locations; because the constraints are $ O(n^ 3) $. In this paper; we propose a technique to reduce the number of constraints to $ O (n^2) $; at the price of renouncing to perfect optimality. We show however that on practicalsituations the utility loss is quite acceptable; while the gain in performance is significant …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.05524,2017,*
A Big Data Driven Approach to Extracting Global Trade Patterns,Giannis Spiliopoulos; Dimitrios Zissis; Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis,Abstract Unlike roads; shipping lanes are not carved in stone. Their size; boundaries andcontent vary over space and time; under the influence of trade and carrier patterns; but alsoinfrastructure investments; climate change; political developments and other complexevents. Today we only have a vague understanding of the specific routes vessels followwhen travelling between ports; which is an essential metric for calculating any valid maritimestatistics and indicators (eg trade indicators; emissions and others). Whilst in the pastthough; maritime surveillance had suffered from a lack of data; current tracking technologyhas transformed the problem into one of an overabundance of information; as huge amountsof vessel tracking data are slowly becoming available; mostly due to the AutomaticIdentification System (AIS). Due to the volume of this data; traditional data mining and …,International Workshop on Mobility Analytics for Spatio-temporal and Social Data,2017,*
On the Compositionality of Quantitative Information Flow,Catuscia Palamidessi; Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Yusuke Kawamoto,Information flow is the branch of security that studies the leakage of information due tocorrelation between secrets and observables. Since in general such correlation cannot beavoided completely; it is important to quantify the leakage. The most followed approaches todefining appropriate measures are those based on information theory. In particular; one ofthe most successful approaches is the recently proposed $ g $-leakage framework; whichencompasses most of the information-theoretic ones. A problem with $ g $-leakage;however; is that it is defined in terms of a minimization problem; which; in the case of largesystems; can be computationally rather heavy. In this paper we study the case in which thechannel associated to the system can be decomposed into simpler channels; which typicallyhappens when the observables consist of multiple components.

Maritime data technology landscape and value chain exploiting oceans of data for maritime applications,Jose Ferreira; Carlos Agostinho; Rui Lopes; Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Dimitris Zissis; Maria-Esther Vidal; Spyros Mouzakitis,Maritime areas covers a large percentage of our world; being most of this area unexplored.Despite this; the sea has one of the most valuable and mostly exploited “economicplatforms” of mankind; with applications in different sectors (as fishing industry;transportation cargo; etc.). Although this situation and the great evolution in technology cancontribute to better know of the sea; this has not been happening. Given that a systematiccollection of maritime data has already been carried out; yet is still dispersed and not used inits entirety. This is one of the objectives of the H2020 BigDataOcean project (http://www.bigdataocean. eu/site/); collecting the various data sources and thus being able to treat themtogether in order to obtain better results.

Up-to techniques for generalized bisimulation metrics,Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis; Catuscia Palamidessi; Valeria Vignudelli,Bisimulation metrics allow us to compute distances between the behaviors of probabilisticsystems. In this paper we present enhancements of the proof method based on bisimulationmetrics; by extending the theory of up-to techniques to (pre) metrics on discrete probabilisticconcurrent processes. Up-to techniques have proved to be a powerful proof method forshowing that two systems are bisimilar; since they make it possible to build (and therebycheck) smaller relations in bisimulation proofs. We define soundness conditions for up-totechniques on metrics; and study compatibility properties that allow us to safely compose up-to techniques with each other. As an example; we derive the soundness of the up-to-bisimilarity-metric-and-context technique. The study is carried out for a generalized versionof the bisimulation metrics; in which the Kantorovich lifting is parametrized with respect to …,27th International Conference on Concurrency Theory (CONCUR 2016),2016,*
