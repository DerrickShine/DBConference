The reconstruction uses cellular and synaptic organizing principles toalgorithmically reconstruct detailed anatomy and physiology from sparse experimental data.An objective anatomical method defines a neocortical volume of 0.29±0.01 mm 3containing∼ 31;000 neurons; and patch-clamp studies identify 55 layer-specificmorphological and 207 morpho-electrical neuron subtypes. When digitally reconstructedneurons are positioned in the volume and synapse formation is restricted to biologicalbouton densities and numbers of synapses per connection; their overlapping arbors form∼8 million connections with∼ 37 million synapses. Simulations reproduce an array of in vitroand in vivo experiments without parameter tuning. Additionally; we find a spectrum of …,Cell,2015,296
TOUCH: in-memory spatial join by hierarchical data-oriented partitioning,Sadegh Nobari; Farhan Tauheed; Thomas Heinis; Panagiotis Karras; Stéphane Bressan; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Efficient spatial joins are pivotal for many applications and particularly important forgeographical information systems or for the simulation sciences where scientists work withspatial models. Past research has primarily focused on disk-based spatial joins; efficient in-memory approaches; however; are important for two reasons: a) main memory has grown solarge that many datasets fit in it and b) the in-memory join is a very time-consuming part of alldisk-based spatial joins. In this paper we develop TOUCH; a novel in-memory spatial joinalgorithm that uses hierarchical data-oriented space partitioning; thereby keeping both itsmemory footprint and the number of comparisons low. Our results show that TOUCHoutperforms known in-memory spatial-join algorithms as well as in-memory implementationsof disk-based join approaches. In particular; it has a one order of magnitude advantage …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,35
Accelerating range queries for brain simulations,Farhan Tauheed; Laurynas Biveinis; Thomas Heinis; Felix Schurmann; Henry Markram; Anastasia Ailamaki,Neuroscientists increasingly use computational tools in building and simulating models ofthe brain. The amounts of data involved in these simulations are immense and efficientlymanaging this data is key. One particular problem in analyzing this data is the scalableexecution of range queries on spatial models of the brain. Known indexing approaches donot perform well even on today's small models which represent a small fraction of the brain;containing only few millions of densely packed spatial elements. The problem of currentapproaches is that with the increasing level of detail in the models; also the overlap in thetree structure increases; ultimately slowing down query execution. The neuroscientists' needto work with bigger and more detailed (denser) models thus motivates us to develop a newindexing approach. To this end we develop FLAT; a scalable indexing approach for …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,25
SCOUT: prefetching for latent structure following queries,Farhan Tauheed; Thomas Heinis; Felix Schürmann; Henry Markram; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Today's scientists are quickly moving from in vitro to in silico experimentation: theyno longer analyze natural phenomena in a petri dish; but instead they build models andsimulate them. Managing and analyzing the massive amounts of data involved insimulations is a major task. Yet; they lack the tools to efficiently work with data of this size.One problem many scientists share is the analysis of the massive spatial models they build.For several types of analysis they need to interactively follow the structures in the spatialmodel; eg; the arterial tree; neuron fibers; etc.; and issue range queries along the way. Eachquery takes long to execute; and the total time for executing a sequence of queriessignificantly delays data analysis. Prefetching the spatial data reduces the response timeconsiderably; but known approaches do not prefetch with high accuracy.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,14
THERMAL-JOIN: A scalable spatial join for dynamic workloads,Farhan Tauheed; Thomas Heinis; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Simulations have become ubiquitous in many domains of science. Today scientistsstudy natural phenomena by first building massive three-dimensional spatial models andthen by simulating the models at discrete intervals of time to mimic the behavior of naturalphenomena. One frequently occurring challenge during simulations is the repeatedcomputation of spatial self-joins of the model at each simulation time step. The join isperformed to access a group of neighboring spatial objects (groups of particles; moleculesor cosmological objects) so that scientists can calculate the cumulative effect (likegravitational force) on an object. Computing a self-join even in memory; soon becomes aperformance bottleneck in simulation applications. The problem becomes even worse asscientists continue to improve the precision of simulations by increasing the number as …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,8
Challenges and opportunities in self-managing scientific databases,Thomas Heinis; Miguel Branco; Ioannis Alagiannis; Renata Borovica; Farhan Tauheed; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Advances in observation instruments and abundance of computational power forsimulations encourage scientists to gather and produce unprecedented amounts ofincreasingly complex data. Organizing data automatically to enable efficient andunobstructed access is pivotal for the scientists. Organizing these vast amounts of complexdata; however; is particularly difficult for scientists who have little experience in datamanagement; hence they spend considerable amounts of time dealing with data analysisand computing problems rather than answering scientific questions or developing newhypotheses. Therefore scientific experiments are in many ways ideal targets for research inself-managing database systems. In this paper; we describe challenges and opportunitiesfor research in automating scientific data management. We first discuss the problems …,Data Engineering Bulletin,2011,7
OCTOPUS: Efficient query execution on dynamic mesh datasets,Farhan Tauheed; Thomas Heinis; Felix Schurmann; Henry Markram; Anastasia Ailamaki,Scientists in many disciplines use spatial mesh models to study physical phenomena.Simulating natural phenomena by changing meshes over time helps to better understandthe phenomena. The higher the precision of the mesh models; the more insight do thescientists gain and they thus continuously increase the detail of the meshes and build themas detailed as their instruments and the simulation hardware allow. In the process; the datavolume also increases; slowing down the execution of spatial range queries needed tomonitor the simulation considerably. Indexing speeds up range query execution; but theoverhead to maintain the indexes is considerable because almost the entire mesh changesunpredictably at every simulation step. Using a simple linear scan; on the other hand;requires accessing the entire mesh and the performance deteriorates as the size of the …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,5
BLOCK: Efficient Execution of Spatial Range Queries in Main-Memory,Matthaios Alexandros Olma; Farhan Tauheed; Thomas Heinis; Anastasia Ailamaki,ABSTRACT The execution of spatial range queries is at the core of many applications;particularly in the simulation sciences but also in many other domains. Although mainmemory in desktop and supercomputers alike has grown considerably in recent years; mostspatial indexes supporting the efficient execution of range queries are still only optimized fordisk access (minimizing disk page reads). Recent research has primarily focused on theoptimization of known disk-based approaches for memory (through cache alignment etc.)but has not fundamentally revisited index structures for memory. In this paper we developBLOCK; a novel approach to execute range queries on spatial data featuring volumetricobjects in main memory. Our approach is built on the key insight that in-memory approachesneed to be optimized to reduce the number of intersection tests (between objects and …,*,2017,4
GIPSY: joining spatial datasets with contrasting density,Mirjana Pavlovic; Farhan Tauheed; Thomas Heinis; Anastasia Ailamakit,Abstract Many scientific and geographical applications rely on the efficient execution ofspatial joins. Past research has produced several efficient spatial join approaches and whileeach of them can join two datasets; the problem of efficiently joining two datasets withcontrasting density; ie; with the same spatial extent but with a wildly different number ofspatial elements; has so far been overlooked. State-of-the-art data-oriented spatial joinapproaches (eg; based on the R-Tree) suffer from degraded performance due to overlap;whereas space-oriented approaches excessively read data from disk. In this paper wedevelop GIPSY; a novel approach for the spatial join of two datasets with contrasting density.GIPSY uses fine-grained data-oriented partitioning and thus only retrieves the data neededfor the join. At the same time it avoids the overlap related problems associated with data …,Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2013,4
Data-driven neuroscience: enabling breakthroughs via innovative data management,Alexandros Stougiannis; Mirjana Pavlovic; Farhan Tauheed; Thomas Heinis; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Scientists in all disciplines increasingly rely on simulations to develop a betterunderstanding of the subject they are studying. For example the neuroscientists wecollaborate with in the Blue Brain project have started to simulate the brain on asupercomputer. The level of detail of their models is unprecedented as they model details onthe subcellular level (eg; the neurotransmitter). This level of detail; however; also leads to atrue data deluge and the neuroscientists have only few tools to efficiently analyze the data.This demonstration showcases three innovative spatial management techniques that havesubstantial impact on computational neuroscience and other disciplines in that they allow tobuild; analyze and simulate bigger and more detailed models. More particularly; wedemonstrate a tool that integrates three spatial data management techniques that have …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,4
Spatial data management challenges in the simulation sciences,Thomas Heinis; Farhan Tauheed; Anastasia Ailamaki,ABSTRACT Scientists in many disciplines have progressively been using simulations tobetter understand the natural systems they study. Faster hardware; as well as increasinglyprecise instruments; allow the construction and simulation of progressively advancedmodels of various systems. Governed by algorithms and equations; the spatial models at thecore of simulations are changed and updated at every simulation step through spatialqueries; implementing massive updates. Therefore; the efficient execution of thesenumerous spatial queries is essential. Two reasons render current spatial indexesinadequate for simulation applications. First; to ensure quick access to data; most of thespatial models in simulations are stored in memory. Most spatial access methods; however;have been optimized for use on disk and are not efficient in memory. Second; in every …,Proceedings of the International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2014,3
Computational neuroscience breakthroughs through innovative data management,Farhan Tauheed; Sadegh Nobari; Laurynas Biveinis; Thomas Heinis; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Simulations have become key in many scientific disciplines to better understandnatural phenomena. Neuroscientists; for example; build and simulate increasingly fine-grained models (including subcellular details; eg; neurotransmitter) of the neocortex tounderstand the mechanisms causing brain diseases and to test new treatments in-silico. Thesheer size and; more importantly; the level of detail of their models challenges today'sspatial data management techniques. In collaboration with the Blue Brain project (BBP) wedevelop new approaches that efficiently enable analysis; navigation and discovery in spatialmodels of the brain.

TRANSFORMERS: Robust spatial joins on non-uniform data distributions,Mirjana Pavlovic; Thomas Heinis; Farhan Tauheed; Panagiotis Karras; Anastasia Ailamaki,Spatial joins are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in many applications; particularly in thescientific domain. While several approaches have been proposed for joining spatialdatasets; each of them has a strength for a particular type of density ratio among the joineddatasets. More generally; no single proposed method can efficiently join two spatial datasetsin a robust manner with respect to their data distributions. Some approaches do well fordatasets with contrasting densities while others do better with similar densities. None ofthem does well when the datasets have locally divergent data distributions. In this paper wedevelop TRANSFORMERS; an efficient and robust spatial join approach that is indifferent tosuch variations of distribution among the joined data. TRANSFORMERS achieves this featby departing from the state-of-the-art through adapting the join strategy and data layout to …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,2
Configuring Spatial Grids for Efficient Main Memory Joins,Farhan Tauheed; Thomas Heinis; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract The performance of spatial joins is becoming increasingly important in manyapplications; particularly in the scientific domain. Several approaches have been proposedfor joining spatial datasets on disk and few in main memory. Recent results show that inmain memory; grids are more efficient than the traditional tree based methods primarilydeveloped for disk. The question how to configure the grid; however; has so far not beendiscussed. In this paper we study how to configure a spatial grid for joining spatial data inmain memory. We discuss the trade-offs involved; develop an analytical model predictingthe performance of a configuration and finally validate the model with experiments.,British International Conference on Databases,2015,2
An Efficient Parallel Load-Balancing Framework for Orthogonal Decomposition of Geometrical Data,Bruno RC Magalhães; Farhan Tauheed; Thomas Heinis; Anastasia Ailamaki; Felix Schürmann,Abstract The accurate subdivision of spatially organized datasets is a complex problem incomputer science but specifically important for load balancing in parallel environments. Theproblem is to (a) find a partitioning where each partition has the same number of elementsand (b) the communication between partitions (duplicate members) is minimized. Wepresent a novel parallel load-balancing framework—Sort Balance Split (SBS)—the first toour knowledge to perform accurate parallel partitioning of multidimensional data; whilerequiring a fixed number of communication steps independent of network size or input datadistribution. When compared to the state of the art sampling and parallel partitioningmethods adopted by HPC problems; it delivers better load balancing on a shorter time tosolution. We analyse four partitioning schemes that SBS can be applied to; and evaluated …,International Conference on High Performance Computing,2016,1

Accelerating spatial range queries,Alexandros Stougiannis; Farhan Tauheed; Thomas Heinis; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract It is increasingly common for domain scientists to use computational tools to buildand simulate spatial models of the phenomena they are studying. The spatial models theybuild are more and more detailed as well as dense and are consequently difficult to managewith today's tools. A crucial problem when analyzing spatial models of increasing detail isthe scalable execution of range queries. State-of-the-art approaches like the R-Tree performsuboptimally on today's models and do not scale for more dense; future models. Theproblem is that the amount of overlap in the tree structure increases as a function of the levelof detail/density in the model. In this demonstration we showcase ZOOM; a new tool toefficiently execute spatial range queries on increasingly detailed (denser) models.
