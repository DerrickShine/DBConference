XMark: A benchmark for XML data management,Albrecht Schmidt; Florian Waas; Martin Kersten; Michael J Carey; Ioana Manolescu; Ralph Busse,This chapter presents the benchmark specifications developed for XMark; a set of queriesand lessons learned while executing the workload specification on a number of platforms.The benchmark was designed top–down; taking the standardization issues around XML asa starting point. The data exchange format XML has been penetrating virtually all areas ofInternet application programming. Thus; electronic commerce sites and content providerswho rely heavily on the new technology are increasingly interested in deploying advanceddata management systems for sites whose data volume exceeds toy sizes. The complexity ofthe challenge has also attracted the attention of the database research community. Earlyefforts mainly concentrated on schema issues and the theory of organizing data without afixed schema; which first seemed incompatible with existing technology. However; as …,*,2002,994
A graph-oriented model for articulation of ontology interdependencies,Prasenjit Mitra; Gio Wiederhold; Martin Kersten,Abstract Ontologies explicate the contents; essential properties; and relationships betweenterms in a knowledge base. Many sources are now accessible with associated ontologies.Most prior work on the use of ontologies relies on the construction of a single globalontology covering all sources. Such an approach is not scalable and maintainableespecially when the sources change frequently. We propose a scalable and easilymaintainable approach based on the interoperation of ontologies. To handle user queriescrossing the boundaries of the underlying information systems; the interoperation betweenthe ontologies should be precisely defined. Our approach is to use rules that cross thesemantic gap by creating an articulation or linkage between the systems. The rules aregenerated using a semi-automatic articulation tool with the help of a domain expert. To …,Advances in Database Technology—EDBT 2000,2000,531
Database architecture optimized for the new bottleneck: Memory access,Peter Boncz; Stefan Manegold; Martin Kersten,Abstract In the past decade; advances in speed of commodity CPUs have far out-pacedadvances in memory latency. Main-memory access is therefore increasingly a performancebottleneck for many computer applications; including database systems. In this article; weuse a simple scan test to show the severe impact of this bottleneck. The insights gained aretranslated into guidelines for database architecture; in terms of both data structures andalgorithms. We discuss how vertically fragmented data structures optimize cacheperformance on sequential data access. We then focus on equi-join; typically a random-access operation; and introduce radix algorithms for partitioned hash-join. The performanceof these algorithms is quantified using a detailed analytical model that incorporates memoryaccess cost.

Efficient relational storage and retrieval of XML documents,Albrecht Schmidt; Martin Kersten; Menzo Windhouwer; Florian Waas,Abstract In this paper; we present a data and an execution model that allow for efficientstorage and retrieval of XML documents in a relational database. The data model is strictlybased on the notion of binary associations: by decomposing XML documents into small;flexible and semantically homogeneous units we are able to exploit the performancepotential of vertical fragmentation. Moreover; our approach provides clear and intuitivesemantics; which facilitates the definition of a declarative query algebra. Our experimentalresults with large collections of XML documents demonstrate the effectiveness of thetechniques proposed.,The World Wide Web and Databases,2001,350

Database cracking,Stratos Idreos; Martin L Kersten; Stefan Manegold,ABSTRACT Database indices provide a non-discriminative navigational infrastructure tolocalize tuples of interest. Their maintenance cost is taken during database updates. In thispaper; we study the complementary approach; addressing index maintenance as part ofquery processing using continuous physical reorganization; ie; cracking the database intomanageable pieces. The motivation is that by automatically organizing data the way usersrequest it; we can achieve fast access and the much desired self-organized behavior. Wepresent the first mature cracking architecture and report on our implementation of cracking inthe context of a full fledged relational system. It led to a minor enhancement to its relationalalgebra kernel; such that cracking could be piggy-backed without incurring too muchprocessing overhead. Furthermore; we illustrate the ripple effect of dynamic …,Proceedings of CIDR,2007,243

Optimizing main-memory join on modern hardware,Stefan Manegold; Peter Boncz; Martin Kersten,In the past decade; the exponential growth in commodity CPU's speed has far outpacedadvances in memory latency. A second trend is that CPU performance advances are notonly brought by increased clock rates; but also by increasing parallelism inside the CPU.Current database systems have not yet adapted to these trends and show poor utilization ofboth CPU and memory resources on current hardware. In this paper; we show how theseresources can be optimized for large joins and translate these insights into guidelines forfuture database architectures; encompassing data structures; algorithms; cost modeling andimplementation. In particular; we discuss how vertically fragmented data structures optimizecache performance on sequential data access.

MIL primitives for querying a fragmented world,Peter A Boncz; Martin L Kersten,Abstract. In query-intensive database application areas; like decision support and datamining; systems that use vertical fragmentation have a significant performance advantage. Inorder to support relational or object oriented applications on top of such a fragmented datamodel; a flexible yet powerful intermediate language is needed. This problem has beensuccessfully tackled in Monet; a modern extensible database kernel developed by ourgroup. We focus on the design choices made in the Monet interpreter language (MIL); itsalgebraic query language; and outline how its concept of tactical optimization enhances andsimplifies the optimization of complex queries. Finally; we summarize the experience gainedin Monet by creating a highly efficient implementation of MIL.,The VLDB Journal,1999,167
Querying XML documents made easy: Nearest concept queries,Albrecht Schmidt; Martin Kersten; Menzo Windhouwer,Due to the ubiquity and popularity of XML; users often are in the following situation: theywant to query XML documents which contain potentially interesting information but they areunaware of the mark-up structure that is used. For example; it is easy to guess the contentsof an XML bibliography file whereas the mark-up depends on the methodological; culturaland personal background of the author (s). None the less; it is this hierarchical structure thatforms the basis of XML query languages. We exploit the tree structure of XML documents toequip users with a powerful tool; the meet operator that lets them query databases withwhose content they are familiar; but without requiring knowledge of tags and hierarchies.Our approach is based on computing the lowest common ancestor of nodes in the XMLsyntax tree: eg; given two strings; we are looking for nodes whose offspring contains …,Data Engineering; 2001.

Self-organizing tuple reconstruction in column-stores,Stratos Idreos; Martin L Kersten; Stefan Manegold,Abstract Column-stores gained popularity as a promising physical design alternative. Eachattribute of a relation is physically stored as a separate column allowing queries to load onlythe required attributes. The overhead incurred is on-the-fly tuple reconstruction for multi-attribute queries. Each tuple reconstruction is a join of two columns based on tuple IDs;making it a significant cost component. The ultimate physical design is to have multiplepresorted copies of each base table such that tuples are already appropriately organized inmultiple different orders across the various columns. This requires the ability to predict theworkload; idle time to prepare; and infrequent updates. In this paper; we propose a noveldesign; partial sideways cracking; that minimizes the tuple reconstruction cost in a self-organizing way. It achieves performance similar to using presorted data; but without …,SIGMOD Conference,2009,152

Generic database cost models for hierarchical memory systems,Stefan Manegold; Peter Boncz; Martin L Kersten,This chapter proposes a generic technique to create accurate cost functions for databaseoperations. Accurate prediction of operator execution time is a prerequisite for databasequery optimization. Although extensively studied for conventional disk-based DBMSs; costmodeling in main memory DBMSs is still an open issue. Recent database research hasdemonstrated that memory access is more and more becoming a significant—if not themajor—cost component of database operations. If used properly; fast but small cachememories—usually organized in cascading hierarchy between CPU and main memory—can help to reduce memory access costs. However; they make the cost estimation problemmore complex. Database cost models provide the foundation for query optimizers to derivean efficient execution plan. Such models consist of two parts; a logical and a physical …,*,2002,140

An architecture for recycling intermediates in a column-store,Milena G Ivanova; Martin L Kersten; Niels J Nes; Romulo AP Gonçalves,Abstract Automatic recycling of intermediate results to improve both query response timeand throughput is a grand challenge for state-of-the-art databases. Tuples are loaded andstreamed through a tuple-at-a-time processing pipeline; avoiding materialization ofintermediates as much as possible. This limits the opportunities for reuse of overlappingcomputations to DBA-defined materialized views and function/result cache tuning. Incontrast; the operator-at-a-time execution paradigm produces fully materialized results ineach step of the query plan. To avoid resource contention; these intermediates are evictedas soon as possible. In this article we study an architecture that harvests the byproducts ofthe operator-at-a-time paradigm in a column-store system using a lightweight mechanism;the recycler. The key challenge then becomes the selection of the policies to admit …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2010,114

Flattening an object algebra to provide performance,Peter Boncz; AN Wilshut; Martin L Kersten,Algebraic transformation and optimization techniques have been the method of choice inrelational query execution; but applying them in object-oriented (OO) DBMSs is difficult dueto the complexity of OO query languages. This paper demonstrates that the problem can besimplified by mapping an OO data model to the binary relational model implemented byMonet; a state-of-the-art database kernel. We present a generic mapping scheme to flattendata models and study the case of straightforward OO model. We show how flatteningenabled us to implement a query algebra; using only a very limited set of simple operations.The required primitives and query execution strategies are discussed; and their performanceis evaluated on the 1-GByte TPC-D (Transaction-processing Performance Council'sBenchmark D); showing that our divide-and-conquer approach yields excellent results.,Data Engineering; 1998.

Fast; randomized join-order selection-Why use transformations?,Cesar Galindo-Legaria; Arjan Pellenkoft; Martin Kersten,Abstract We study the e ectiveness of probabilistic selection of join-query evaluation planswithout reliance on tree transformation rules. Instead; each candidate plan is chosenuniformly at random from the space of valid evaluation orders. This leads to a transformation-free strategy where a sequence of random plans is generated and the plans are comparedon their estimated costs. The success of this strategy depends on the ratio of\good"evaluation plans in the space of alternatives; the e cient generation of random candidates;and an accurate estimation of their cost. To avoid a biased exploration of the space; wesolved the open problem of e ciently generating random; uniformly-distributed evaluationorders; for queries with acyclic graphs.

Unfortunately; current data management technology is not well-suited for such overwhelming demands. In light of these challenges; we should rethink someof the strict requirements database systems adopted in the past. We envision that nextgeneration database systems should interpret queries by their intent; rather than as acontract carved in stone for complete and correct answers.

Updating a cracked database,Stratos Idreos; Martin L Kersten; Stefan Manegold,Abstract A cracked database is a datastore continuously reorganized based on operationsbeing executed. For each query; the data of interest is physically reclustered to speed-upfuture access to the same; overlapping or even disjoint data. This way; a cracking DBMS self-organizes and adapts itself to the workload. So far; cracking has been considered for staticdatabases only. In this paper; we introduce several novel algorithms for high-volumeinsertions; deletions and updates against a cracked database. We show that the niceperformance properties of a cracked database can be maintained in a dynamic environmentwhere updates interleave with queries. Our algorithms comply with the cracking philosophy;ie; a table is informed on pending insertions and deletions; but only when the relevant datais needed for query processing just enough pending update actions are applied.,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,79

The complexity of transformation-based join enumeration,Arjan Pellenkoft; César A Galindo Legaria; Martin Kersten,Abstract Query optimizers that explore a search space exhaustively using transformationrules usually apply all possible rules on each alternative; and stop when no new informationis produced. A memoizing structure was proposed in [McK93] to improve the re-use ofcommon subexpression; thus improving the efficiency of the search considerably. However;a question that remained open is; what is the complexity of the transformation-basedenumeration process? In particular; with n the number of relations; does it achieve the O (3n)lower bound established by [OL90]? In this paper we examine the problem of duplicates; intransformation-based enumeration. In general; different sequences of transformation rulesmay end up deriving the same element; and the optimizer must detect and discard theseduplicate elements generated by multiple paths.

Architectural support for data mining,Marcel Holsheimer; Martin L Kersten; Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica,Abstract One of the main obstacles in applying data mining techniques to large; real-worlddatabases is the lack of efficient data management.

The mining tool organizes and controlsthe search process; while the DBMS provides optimal response times for the few query typesbeing used by the tool. Key elements of our architecture are its use of fast and simpledatabase operations; its re-use of results obtained by previous queries; its maximal use ofmain-memory to keep the database hot-set resident; and its parallel computation of queries.Apart from a clear separation of responsibilities; we show that this architecture leads tocompetitive performance on large data sets.

Cache-conscious radix-decluster projections,Stefan Manegold; Peter Boncz; Niels Nes; Martin Kersten,Abstract As CPUs become more powerful with Moore's law and memory latencies stayconstant; the impact of the memory access performance bottleneck continues to grow onrelational operators like join; which can exhibit random access on a memory region largerthan the hardware caches. While cache-conscious variants for various relational algorithmshave been described; previous work has mostly ignored (the cost of) projection columns.However; real-life joins almost always come with projections; such that proper projectioncolumn manipulation should be an integral part of any generic join algorithm. In this paper;we analyze cache-conscious hash-join algorithms including projections on two storageschemes: N-ary Storage Model (NSM) and Decomposition Storage Model (DSM). It turnsout; that the strategy of first executing the join and only afterwards dealing with the …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,47

Monet and its Geographical Extensions: A novel approach to high performance GIS processing,Peter Boncz; Wilko Quak; Martin Kersten,Abstract We describe Monet; a novel database system; designed to get maximumperformance out of today's workstations and symmetric multiprocessors. Monet is a type-andalgebra-extensible database system using the Decomposed Storage Model (DSM) andemploying shared memory parallelism. It applies purely main-memory algorithms forprocessing and uses OS virtual memory primitives for handling large data. Monet providesmany options in memory management and virtual-memory clustering strategies to optimizeaccess to its tables. We discuss how these unusual features impacted the design;implementation and performance of a set of GIS extension modules; that can be loaded atruntime in Monet; to obtain a functional complete GIS server.

Accelerating Foreign-Key Joins using Asymmetric Memory Channels,Holger Pirk; Stefan Manegold; Martin Kersten,ABSTRACT Indexed Foreign-Key Joins expose a very asymmetric access pattern: theForeign-Key Index is sequentially scanned whilst the Primary-Key table is target of manyquasi-random lookups which is the dominant cost factor. To reduce the costs of the randomlookups the fact-table can be (re-) partitioned at runtime to increase access locality on thedimension table; and thus limit the random memory access to inside the CPU's cache.However; this is very hard to optimize and the performance impact on recent architectures islimited because the partitioning costs consume most of the achievable join improvement [3].GPGPUs on the other hand have an architecture that is well suited for this operation: arelatively slow connection to the large system memory and a very fast connection to thesmaller internal device memory. We show how to accelerate Foreign-Key Joins by …,*,2011,42
Meet Charles; big data query advisor.,Thibault Sellam; Martin L Kersten,ABSTRACT In scientific data management and business analytics; the most informativequeries are a holy grail. Data collection becomes increasingly simpler; yet data explorationgets significantly harder. Exploratory querying is likely to return an empty or anoverwhelming result set. On the other hand; data mining algorithms require extensivepreparation; ample time and do not scale well. In this paper; we address this challenge at itscore; ie; how to query the query space associated with a given database. The spaceconsidered is formed by conjunctive predicates. To express them; we introduce theSegmentation Description Language (SDL). The user provides a query. Charles; our queryadvisory system; breaks its extent into meaningful segments and returns the subsequentSDL descriptions. This provides insight into the set described and offers the user …,CIDR,2013,41
Acoi: A system for indexing multimedia objects,MA Windhouwer; AR Schmidt; ML Kersten,Abstract In this paper; we present a system that combines independent feature detectorprograms with multimedia database technology to provide a semantic rich index tomultimedia data items on the World Wide Web. First; we introduce a grammatical framework;called feature grammars; which forms the indexing schema. Feature grammars are anextension of context-free grammars with active symbols (eg multimedia feature detectors)that may invoke feature detector programs. The Acoi system reads in the grammar; compilesit and executes it against a data source; eg a multimedia object. The derived parse tree isused as an index to this data source. Its structure closely resembles that of semi-structured(XML) documents. Then; we present the architecture of our implementation on top of Monet;our extensible main memory database system. In this implementation; feature grammars …,International Workshop on Information Integration and Web-based Applications & Services; Yogyakarta; Indonesia,1999,41
Understanding sources of ineffciency in general-purpose chips,Rehan Hameed; Wajahat Qadeer; Megan Wachs; Omid Azizi; Alex Solomatnikov; Benjamin C Lee; Stephen Richardson; Christos Kozyrakis; Mark Horowitz,Abstract Scaling the performance of a power limited processor requires decreasing theenergy expended per instruction executed; since energy/op* op/second is power. To betterunderstand what improvement in processor efficiency is possible; and what must be done tocapture it; we quantify the sources of the performance and energy overheads of a 720p HDH. 264 encoder running on a general-purpose four-processor CMP system. The initialoverheads are large: the CMP was 500 x less energy efficient than an Application SpecificIntegrated Circuit (ASIC) doing the same job. We explore methods to eliminate theseoverheads by transforming the CPU into a specialized system for H. 264 encoding. Broadlyapplicable optimizations like single instruction; multiple data (SIMD) units improve CMPperformance by 14 x and energy by 10x; which is still 50x worse than an ASIC.

Who should test whom?,Sharon McDonald; Helen M Edwards,Who Should Test Whom? he construction of software engineering teams; the interactionbetween members; and how individual personalities influence these; has been a concernfrom the 1960s to the present day [5]. Nevertheless; despite claims from leading figures inthe field that it is fundamentally people that make the difference between software successand failure; a corpus of knowledge and good practice has failed to emerge. While there havebeen some attempts to investigate these issues through the application of psychometrictests; the issue of what personality analysis can or cannot offer software engineering is stillopen for debate [6; 9]. In this article we argue that the lack of progress in this field is due inpart to the inappropriate use of psychological tests;,Communications of the ACM,2007,39
Image databases and multi-media search,Arnoldus Wilhelmus Maria Smeulders; Ramesh Jain,The World Wide Web and the Internet are signs things will be very different in the future.

Distribution rules for array database queries,Alex van Ballegooij; Roberto Cornacchia; Arjen de Vries; Martin Kersten,Abstract Non-trivial retrieval applications involve complex computations on large multi-dimensional datasets. These should; in principle; benefit from the use of relational databasetechnology. However; expressing such problems in terms of relational queries is difficult andtime-consuming. Even more discouraging is the efficiency issue: query optimizationstrategies successful in classical relational domains may not suffice when applied to themulti-dimensional array domain. The RAM (Relational Array Mapping) system hides thesedifficulties by providing a transparent mapping between the scientific problem specificationand the underlying database system. In addition; its optimizer is specifically tuned to exploitthe characteristics of the array paradigm and to allow for automatic balanced work-loaddistribution. Using an example taken from the multimedia domain; this paper shows how …,Database and Expert Systems Applications,2005,34

Complex andsophisticated mechanisms to avoid network traffic can be replaced by a scheme that takesadvantage of the bandwidth and low latency offered by such interconnects. We illustrate thisphenomenon with cyclo-join; an efficient join algorithm based on continuously pumping datathrough a ring-structured network. Our approach is capable of exploiting the resources of allCPUs and distributed main-memory available in the network for processing queries ofarbitrary shape and datasets of arbitrary size.,Proceedings of the Fifth International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware,2009,33

Column imprints: a secondary index structure,Lefteris Sidirourgos; Martin Kersten,Abstract Large scale data warehouses rely heavily on secondary indexes; such as bitmapsand b-trees; to limit access to slow IO devices. However; with the advent of large mainmemory systems; cache conscious secondary indexes are needed to improve also thetransfer bandwidth between memory and cpu. In this paper; we introduce column imprint; asimple but efficient cache conscious secondary index. A column imprint is a collection ofmany small bit vectors; each indexing the data points of a single cacheline. An imprint isused during query evaluation to limit data access and thus minimize memory traffic. Thecompression for imprints is cpu friendly and exploits the empirical observation that data oftenexhibits local clustering or partial ordering as a side-effect of the construction process. Mostimportantly; column imprint compression remains effective and robust even in the case of …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,31

CPU and cache efficient management of memory-resident databases,Holger Pirk; Florian Funke; Martin Grund; Thomas Neumann; Ulf Leser; Stefan Manegold; Alfons Kemper; Martin Kersten,Memory-Resident Database Management Systems (MRDBMS) have to be optimized for tworesources: CPU cycles and memory bandwidth. To optimize for bandwidth in mixedOLTP/OLAP scenarios; the hybrid or Partially Decomposed Storage Model (PDSM) hasbeen proposed. However; in current implementations; bandwidth savings achieved bypartial decomposition come at increased CPU costs. To achieve the aspired bandwidthsavings without sacrificing CPU efficiency; we combine partially decomposed storage withJust-in-Time (JiT) compilation of queries; thus eliminating CPU inefficient function calls.Since existing cost based optimization components are not designed for JiT-compiled queryexecution; we also develop a novel approach to cost modeling and subsequent storagelayout optimization.

Waste not… Efficient co-processing of relational data,Holger Pirk; Stefan Manegold; Martin Kersten,The variety of memory devices in modern computer systems holds opportunities as well aschallenges for data management systems. In particular; the exploitation of GraphicsProcessing Units (GPUs) and their fast memory has been studied quite intensively.However; current approaches treat GPUs as systems in their own right and fail to provide ageneric strategy for efficient CPU/GPU cooperation. We propose such a strategy forrelational query processing: calculating an approximate result based on lossily compressed;GPU-resident data and refine the result using residuals; ie; the lost data; on the CPU. Wedeveloped the required algorithms; implemented the strategy in an existing DBMS andfound up to 8 times performance improvement; even for datasets larger than the availableGPU memory.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,27
Self-organizing strategies for a column-store database,Milena Ivanova; Martin L Kersten; Niels Nes,Abstract Column-store database systems open new vistas for improved maintenancethrough self-organization. Individual columns are the focal point; which simplify balancingconflicting requirements. This work presents two workload-driven self-organizing techniquesin a column-store; ie adaptive segmentation and adaptive replication. Adaptivesegmentation splits a column into non-overlapping segments based on the actual queryload. Likewise; adaptive replication creates segment replicas. The strategies can supportdifferent application requirements by trading off the reorganization overhead for storagecost. Both techniques can significantly improve system performance as demonstrated in anevaluation of different scenarios.,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,27

Database cracking: fancy scan; not poor man's sort!,Holger Pirk; Eleni Petraki; Stratos Idreos; Stefan Manegold; Martin Kersten,Abstract Database Cracking is an appealing approach to adaptive indexing: on every range-selection query; the data is partitioned using the supplied predicates as pivots. The core ofdatabase cracking is; thus; pivoted partitioning. While pivoted partitioning; like scanning;requires a single pass through the data it tends to have much higher costs due to lower CPUefficiency. In this paper; we conduct an in-depth study of the reasons for the low CPUefficiency of pivoted partitioning. Based on the findings; we develop an optimized versionwith significantly higher (single-threaded) CPU efficiency. We also develop a number ofmulti-threaded implementations that are effectively bound by memory bandwidth. Combiningall of these optimizations we achieve an implementation that has costs close to or better thanan ordinary scan on a variety of systems ranging from low-end (cheaper than $300) …,Proceedings of the Tenth International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware,2014,25
SciQL: array data processing inside an RDBMS,Ying Zhang; Martin Kersten; Stefan Manegold,Abstract Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on the ability to efficiently grind massiveamounts of experimental data using database technologies. To bridge the gap between theneeds of the Data-Intensive Research fields and the current DBMS technologies; we haveintroduced SciQL (pronounced as' cycle'). SciQL is the first SQL-based declarative querylanguage for scientific applications with both tables and arrays as first class citizens. Itprovides a seamless symbiosis of array-; set-and sequence-interpretations. A key innovationis the extension of value-based grouping of SQL: 2003 with structural grouping; ie; grouparray elements based on their positions. This leads to a generalisation of window-basedquery processing with wide applicability in science domains.

The intermediateresults of the counting procedure then serve to generate random; uniformly distributedoperator trees in O (n 2) time per tree.

The data cyclotron query processing scheme,ROMULO Goncalves; MARTIN Kersten,Abstract A grand challenge of distributed query processing is to devise a self-organizingarchitecture which exploits all hardware resources optimally to manage the database hotset; minimize query response time; and maximize throughput without single point globalcoordination. The Data Cyclotron architecture [Goncalves and Kersten 2010] addresses thischallenge using turbulent data movement through a storage ring built from distributed mainmemory and capitalizing on the functionality offered by modern remote-DMA networkfacilities. Queries assigned to individual nodes interact with the storage ring by picking updata fragments; which are continuously flowing around; that is; the hot set. The storage ringis steered by the Level Of Interest (LOI) attached to each data fragment; which represents thecumulative query interest as it passes around the ring multiple times.

High-level programming features for improving the efficiency of a relational database system,Reind P Van de Riet; Martin L Kersten; Wiebren de Jonge; Anthony I Wasserman,Abstract This paper discusses some high-level language programming constructs that canbe used to manipulate the relations of a relational database system efficiently. Threedifferent constructs are described:(1) tuple identifiers that directly reference tuples of arelation;(2) cursors that may iterate over the tuples of a relation; and (3) markings; a form oftemporary relation consisting of a set of tuple identifiers. In each case; attention is given tosyntactic; semantic; and implementation considerations. The use of these features is firstpresented within the context of the programming language PLAIN; and it is then shown howthese features could be used more generally to provide database manipulation capabilitiesin a high-level programming language.

As long as data sources are independent; devices are never replaced; nordo new devices enter the realm of existence; it will survive easily in the digital jungle.However; life runs a different course. Each time one meets a new person; one may have tosynchronize several databases with his address information.

A multi-query optimizer for monet,Stefan Manegold; Arjan Pellenkoft; Martin Kersten,Abstract Database systems allow for concurrent use of several applications (and queryinterfaces). Each application generates an “optimal” plan—a sequence of low-leveldatabase operators—for accessing the database. The queries posed by users through thesame application can be optimized together using traditional multi-query optimizationtechniques. However; the commonalities among queries of different applications are notexploited. In this paper we present an efficient inter-application multi-query optimizer that re-uses previously computed (intermediate) results and eliminates redundant work.Experimental results on a single CPU system and a parallel system show that the inter-application multi-query optimizer improves the query evaluation performance significantly.,Advances in Databases,2000,21

High performance OO traversals in Monet,Peter Boncz; Fred Kwakkel; Martin Kersten,Abstract In this paper we discuss how Monet; a novel multimodel database system; can beused to efficiently support OODB applications. We show how Monet's offbeat view on keyissues in database architecture provided both challenges and opportunities in building ahigh-performance ODMG-93 compliant Runtime System on top of it. We describe how an OOdata-model can be mapped onto Monet's decomposed storage scheme while maintainingphysical data independence; and how OO queries are translated into an algebraiclanguage. A generic model for specifying OO class-attribute traversals is presented; thatpermits the OODB to algebraicly optimize and parallelize their execution.

Towards an object-centered database language,Martin L Kersten; Frans H Schippers,Abstract In this report we discuss ongoing research in the area of object-oriented databasesystems at the CWI. The central theme of this paper is the friction encountered when usingan object-oriented (OO) language; such as Smalltalk; in the database arena. A series of(open) database issues is given for which the object-oriented paradigm does not provide anelegant solution. A refinement of the OO concepts is given which emphasizes the dynamicclassification of objects through its characteristic properties. Our approach is illustrated by adescription of the object-centered database language Godel and its use. A central languageconcept is the guardian; which is a high-level declarative description of a process whichalgorithmically reacts to states and to state changes of an object base. A prototypeimplementation of Godel has been implemented in C-Prolog.,Proceedings on the 1986 international workshop on Object-oriented database systems,1986,20

Moreover; the query languageframework is largely borrowed from SQL; such that manipulation of a Goblin database withfiat objects appears as dealing with a traditional relational database. The language design isstrongly influenced by several envisioned application domains; such as an officeautomation; robotic applications; cartographic applications; and astronomy.

Implementing PRISMA/DB in an OOPL,Annita Wilschut; Paul Grefen; Peter Apers; Martin Kersten,Abstract PRISMA/DB is implemented in a parallel object-oriented language to gain insight inthe usage of parallelism. This environment allows us to experiment with parallelism bysimply changing the allocation of objects to the processors of the PRISMA machine. Theseobjects are obtained by a strictly modular design of PRISMA/DB. Communication betweenthe objects is required to cooperatively handle the various tasks; but it limits the potential forparallelism. From this approach; we hope to gain a better understanding of parallelism;which can be used to enhance the performance of PRISMA/DB.,Database Machines,1989,16
Enhanced stream processing in a DBMS kernel,Erietta Liarou; Stratos Idreos; Stefan Manegold; Martin Kersten,Abstract Continuous query processing has emerged as a promising query processingparadigm with numerous applications. A recent development is the need to handle bothstreaming queries and typical one-time queries in the same application. For example; datawarehousing can greatly benefit from the integration of stream semantics; ie; online analysisof incoming data and combination with existing data. This is especially useful to provide lowlatency in data-intensive analysis in big data warehouses that are augmented with new dataon a daily basis. However; state-of-the-art database technology cannot handle streamsefficiently due to their" continuous" nature. At the same time; state-of-the-art streamtechnology is purely focused on stream applications.

A framework for multi-query optimization,Sunil Choenni; Martin Kersten; Amani Saad; Johan van den Akker,ABSTRACT In some key database applications; a sequence of interdependent queries maybe posed simultaneously to the DBMS. The optimization of such sequences is called multi-query optimization; and it attempts to exploit these dependencies in the derivation of a queryevaluation plan (qep). Although it has been observed and demonstrated by severalresearchers that exploitation of dependencies speed up the query processing; limitedresearch has been reported how to benefit from multi-query optimization; taking thecapabilities of existing query optimizers into account. This is exactly the topic of this paper.Since existing optimizers are able to optimize queries in which a restricted number of basicoperations appears; eg; number of joins is limited to ten; and the optimization of a query isrelatively expensive; we attempt to profit from multi query optimization under the condition …,*,1998,15
Design and implementation of a DBMS performance assessment tool,Martin L Kersten; Fred Kwakkel,Abstract The increasing number of advanced database management systems offered on themarket requires tools to quickly assess their performance and to assure their quality.Performance measurement involves running a set of representative workloads; such asbenchmarks; and quality assurance; which involves extensive testing. The Software Testpilotdescribed in this paper greatly simplifies both jobs by enabling a compact specification ofthe workload search space; a flexible mechanism to interact with a system under study; anda fast algorithm to expose the performance bottlenecks or software instabilities.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,1993,15
Benchmarking and improving point cloud data management in monetdb,Oscar Martinez-Rubi; Peter van Oosterom; Romulo Gonçalves; Theo Tijssen; Milena Ivanova; Martin L Kersten; Foteini Alvanaki,Abstract The popularity; availability and sizes of point cloud data sets are increasing; thusraising interesting data management and processing challenges. Various software solutionsare available for the management of point cloud data. A benchmark for point cloud datamanagement systems was defined and it was executed for several solutions. In this paperwe focus on the solutions based on the column-store MonetDB; the generic out-of-the-boxapproach is compared with two alternative approaches that exploit the spatial coherence ofthe data to improve the data access and to minimize the storage requirements.,SIGSPATIAL Special,2015,14
The database architecture jigsaw puzzle,Martin L Kersten,Each DBMS represents a solution in a design space covering hundreds of parameters. Thesheer size of this space leaves large parts unexplored; but also requires courage. The open-source MonetDB system is used to exemplify the pitfalls and opportunities of such anexploration into the realm of column-stores. We illustrate the vistas of high-risk projectsbased on radical changes in the design parameters; eg; database cracking for self-organization; informative query summaries and database storage rings where the databaseis on the move. The missing jigsaw pieces identified are important for real innovations andprovide an inspiration for changing the legacy architecture embodied in (relational)database products.,Data Engineering; 2008.

RAM: Array processing over a relational DBMS,Alex R vanBallegooij; Arjen P deVries; Martin Leopold Kersten,textabstractDeveloping multimedia applications in relational databases is hindered by amismatch in computational frameworks. Efficient manipulation of multimedia data calls forarray-based processing; which at best is available as a database add-on; not supported bythe query optimizer. As a result; array-based processing ends up in dedicated programsoutside the DBMS: non-reusable black boxes. The goal of our research is to reduce this gapbetween user-needs and system functionality by developing a seemless integration of arrayprocessing in a relational algebra engine. The paper introduces a declarative language forarray-expressions based on the array comprehension; and its mapping to a relational kernelin a prototype implementation. The layered architecture of the resulting array databasemanagement system allows the use of structural knowledge available in the array data …,Information Systems [INS],2003,14

X-device query processing by bitwise distribution,Holger Pirk; Thibault Sellam; Stefan Manegold; Martin Kersten,Abstract The diversity of hardware components within a single system calls for strategies forefficient cross-device data processing. For example; existing approaches to CPU/GPU co-processing distribute individual relational operators to the" most appropriate" device. Whilepleasantly simple; this strategy has a number of problems: it may leave the" inappropriate"devices idle while overloading the" appropriate" device and putting a high pressure on thePCI bus. To address these issues we distribute data among the devices by partiallydecomposing relations at the granularity of individual bits. Each of the resulting bit-partitionsis stored and processed on one of the available devices. Using this strategy; weimplemented a processor for spatial range queries that makes efficient use of all availabledevices. The performance gains achieved indicate that bitwise distribution makes a good …,Proceedings of the Eighth International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware,2012,13

Cooperative scans,Marcin Zukowski; Peter A Boncz; Martin L Kersten,textabstractData mining; information retrieval and other application areas exhibit a queryload with multiple concurrent queries touching a large fraction of a relation. This leads toindividual query plans based on a table scan or large index scan. The implementation of thisaccess path in most database systems is straightforward. The Scan operator issues nextpage requests to the buffer manager without concern for the system state. Conversely; thebuffer manager is not aware of the work ahead and it focuses on keeping the most-recently-used pages in the buffer pool. This paper introduces cooperative scans--a new algorithm;based on a better sharing of knowledge and responsibility between the Scan operator andthe buffer manager; which significantly improves performance of concurrent scan queries. Inthis approach; queries share the buffer content; and progress of the scans is optimized by …,Information Systems [INS],2004,12
Feature grammars,Albrecht Schmidt; Menzo Windhouwer; ML Kersten,ABSTRACT We propose a grammatical view of the problem of integrating di erent data itemsunder a database perspective. We introduce a variant of context-free grammars; calledfeature grammars; whose parsers may rewrite their input stream. This allows us to provide asimple mechanism for describing and maintaining indexes to Internet multimediadocuments. Integration of parser instances as mediators into a database system provides aremarkably transparent framework for indexing external sources and also facilitates the useof plug-in modules provided by third parties. Rewriting the input stream allows to (1) interpretinput data and replace them by their interpretations; and (2) integrate data from di erentsources by linking them into the input stream in the spirit of a structuring schema. Thetechniques described are used in the Dutch Acoi project.,Proceedings of the International Conference on Systems Analysis and Synthesis,1999,12

Towards a design theory for database triggers,Arno Siebes; MH van der Voort; Martin L Kersten; Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica,Abstract Advances in the area of active database management systems require thedevelopment of a trigger design theory; which guides the user in the definition off well-behaving trigger based applications. The development of such a theory requires a formaldefinition of trigger semantics. This paper describes a framework for such a formalisation oftriggers. That is; the parameters of trigger execution and the options for setting them areidentified and discussed. Furthermore; the development of a trigger design theory is initiatedwith the formulation of a sufficient condition for trigger independence.,*,1992,12

Genome sequence analysis with MonetDB,Robin Cijvat; Stefan Manegold; Martin Kersten; Gunnar W Klau; Alexander Schönhuth; Tobias Marschall; Ying Zhang,Abstract Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has led the life sciences into the bigdata era. Today; sequencing genomes takes little time and cost; but yields terabytes of datato be stored and analyzed. Biologists are often exposed to excessively time consuming anderror-prone data management and analysis hurdles. In this paper; we propose a databasemanagement system (DBMS) based approach to accelerate and substantially simplifygenome sequence analysis. We have extended MonetDB; an open-source column-basedDBMS; with a BAM module; which enables easy; flexible; and rapid management andanalysis of sequence alignment data stored as Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM/BAM) files.We describe the main features of MonetDB/BAM using a case study on Ebola virusgenomes.,Datenbank-Spektrum,2015,11
Instant-On Scientific Data Warehouses,Yağız Kargın; Holger Pirk; Milena Ivanova; Stefan Manegold; Martin Kersten,Abstract In the dawn of the data intensive research era; scientific discovery deploys dataanalysis techniques similar to those that drive business intelligence. Similar to classicalExtract; Transform and Load (ETL) processes; data is loaded entirely from external datasources (repositories) into a scientific data warehouse before it can be analyzed. Thisprocess is both; time and resource intensive and may not be entirely necessary if only asubset of the data is of interest to a particular user. To overcome this problem; we propose anovel technique to lower the costs for data loading: Lazy ETL. Data is extracted and loadedtransparently on-the-fly only for the required data items. Extensive experiments demonstratethe significant reduction of the time from source data availability to query answer comparedto state-of-the-art solutions.

Exact matching in image databases,HGP Bosch; Alex Van Ballegooij; Arjen P De Vries; ML Kersten,ABSTRACT We believe there is a niche for exact sub-image searching in image databases.When only a sub-image is searched for; traditional image searching approaches failbecause the sub-image features usually represent only a small fraction of the global imagefeatures. Said differently: it is difficult to find the sub-image in the global features. We presenta new technique to find sub-images in a (possibly large) image database. The usersarticulate their interest in a sub-image; ie an object within an image; in a so-called precisemulti-spot query. We search our spatially oriented color-based image database image-by-image for matches with this multi-spot query.,Proceedings of the 2001 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME2001),2001,11

Inthis demo we present the combined effort of the AMIS and DMW research projects; eachcovering significant parts of this problem. The contribution of this demo is twofold. Firstly; wedemonstrate how feature grammars offer a flexible solution for extraction and querying ofmeta-data from multimedia documents in general. Scalability and efficiency support areillustrated for full text indexing and retrieval. Secondly; we show how for a more limiteddomain; like an Intranet; conceptual modeling can offer additional and more powerful queryfacilities. The limited domain case; also allows the extraction and querying of high-levelconcepts from raw video data.,PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON VERY LARGE DATA BASES,2001,10
The Acoi algebra: A query algebra for image retrieval systems,Niels Nes; Martin Kersten,Abstract Content-based image retrieval systems rely on a query-by-example technique oftenusing a limited set of global image features. This leads to a rather coarse-grain approach tolocate images. The next step is to concentrate on queries over spatial relations amongstobjects within the images. This calls for a small collection of image retrieval primitives to formthe basis of an image retrieval system. The Acoi algebra is such an extensible frameworkbuilt on the relational algebra. New primitives can be added readily; including user-definedmetric functions for searching. We illustrate the expressive power of the query scheme usinga concise functional benchmark for querying image databases.,Advances in Databases,1998,10

Peak performance: Remote memory revisited,Hannes Mühleisen; Romulo Gonçalves; Martin Kersten,Abstract Many database systems share a need for large amounts of fast storage. However;economies of scale limit the utility of extending a single machine with an arbitrary amount ofmemory. The recent broad availability of the zero-copy data transfer protocol RDMA over low-latency and high-throughput network connections such as InfiniBand prompts us to revisitthe long-proposed usage of memory provided by remote machines. In this paper; we presenta solution to make use of remote memory without manipulation of the operating system; andinvestigate the impact on database performance.,Proceedings of the Ninth International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware,2013,9
Duplicate-free generation of alternatives in transformation-based optimizers,Arjan Pellenkoft; Cesar A.  Galindo-Legaria; Martin L.  Kersten,Abstract Transformation-based optimizers that explore a search space exhaustively usuallyapply all possible transformation rules on each alternative; and stop when no newinformation is produced. In general; different sequences of transformation rules may end upderiving the same element. The optimizer must detect and discard these duplicate elementsgenerated by multiple paths. In this paper we consider two questions: How bad is theoverhead of duplicate generation? And then; how can it be avoided? We use a restrictedclass of join reordering to illustrate the problem. For the first question; our analysis showsthat as queries get larger; the number of duplicates is several times that of the new elements.And even for small queries; duplicates are generated more often than new elements. For thesecond question; we describe a technique to avoid generating duplicates; based on …,Proceedings of the International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications (DASFAA),1997,9
An active component for a parallel database kernel,Martin L Kersten,Abstract The Monet parallel database server is an experimentation platform for a variety ofdatamodels and novel applications. In this paper we describe its active behavior based onthe notion of trigger abstractions and an event notification scheme. Trigger abstractions canbe used to construct intricate trigger instance networks. The events notified in the DBMSkernel threads flow into a shared event pool. The triggerevent-monitor watches this pool forevent combinations to enable trigger firing. We illustrate how these concepts can be used bya rule compiler and describe a performance metric to guide the search for an efficientarchitectural solution.,International Workshop on Rules in Database Systems,1995,9
Analysis of a dynamic query optimization technique for multijoin queries,Carel A van den Berg; Martin L Kersten,Abstract Query processing in parallel data base systems is commonly based on theassumption that reliable estimates can be made for the sizes of intermediate results and theload distribution in the system. However; these estimates are difficult to make fornonstandard applications. A solution is to use a dynamic query-processing scheme; which isadaptive to the data and load distribution in a shared-nothing architecture. We propose anovel run-time optimization technique; called task elimination; aimed at reducing the totalamount of work for queries over large partitioned data bases. The level of reduction obtainedand the total processing cost is determined with a probabilistic model. Finally; we introducethe parallel bottom-up query evaluation strategy; which maximizes the effect of the taskelimination optimization technique.,Journal of Systems and Software,1994,9
Query optimization strategies for browsing sessions,Martin L Kersten; MFN De Boer,This paper describes techniques and experimental results to obtain response timeimprovement for a browsing session; ie a sequence of interrelated queries to locate a subsetof interest. The optimization technique exploits symbolic analysis of the queryinterdependencies and retention of (partial) query answers. A prototype browsing sessionoptimizer (BSO) has been constructed that runs as a front-end to the Ingres relationalsystem. Based on the experiments reported; we propose to extend (existing) DBMSs with amechanism to keep and reuse small answers by default. Such investments quickly pay off insessions with interrelated queries.,Data Engineering; 1994. Proceedings. 10th International Conference,1994,9

Compared totraditional approaches; our technique allows users to search image databases for localcharacteristics rather than global features. When a user query is presented to our searchengine; the engine does not impose any policy of its own on the answer set; it performs anexact match based on the query terms against the database.

/spl Omega/-storage: a self organizing multi-attribute storage technique for very large main memories,Jonas S Karlsson; Martin L Kersten,Main memory storage is continuously improving; both in its price and its capacity. With thiscomes new storage problems and new directions of possible usage. Several main-memorydatabase systems are now becoming commercially available. The hot areas for theirdeployment include boosting the performance of Web-enabled systems; such as searchengines; and electronic auctioning systems. We present a novel data storage structure-the/spl Omega/-storage structure; a high-performance data structure; to index very largeamounts of multi-attribute data. The experiments show excellent performance for pointretrieval and highly efficient pruning for pattern searches. It provides the balanced storagepreviously achieved by random kd-trees; but avoids their increased pattern-match searchtimes by an effective assignment of attribute bits to the index. Moreover; it avoids the …,Database Conference; 2000. ADC 2000. Proceedings. 11th Australasian,2000,7
On multi-query optimization,RS Choenni; Martin L Kersten; Johan FP Akker; Amani Saad,Abstract In some key database applications; such as data mining; a sequence ofinterdependent queries may be posed simultaneously to the DBMS. The optimization ofsuch sequences is called multi-query optimization; and it attempts to exploit thesedependencies in the derivation of a query evaluation plan (qep). Although it has beenobserved and demonstrated by several researchers that exploitation of dependencies speedup the query processing; limited research has been reported how to benefit from multi-queryoptimization; taking the capabilities of existing query optimizers into account. This is exactlythe topic of this paper. Since existing optimizers are able to optimize queries in which arestricted number of basic operations appears; eg; number of joins is limited to 10; and theoptimization of a query is relatively expensive; we attempt to profit from multi query …,*,1996,7
Calibration of a DBMS cost model with the software testpilot,Frederic Andres; Fred Kwakkel; Martin L Kersten,Abstract Relational database systems come with a query optimizer to plan the executionorder of individual operators using a cost model of the underlying system. Despite the largebody of research on optimization rules and cost approximation; little effort has been investedin the design of effective techniques for their validation. In this paper we discuss a method tocalibrate cost models using the Software Testpilot; a performance assessment tool. Theapproach is based on taking an initial cost model and to refine it using the capabilities of theunderlying DBMS kernel using automatically generated experiments. Apart from simplifyinga time consuming task; it improves the effectiveness of the query optimizer by being tunedtowards its hardware platform. The technique is illustrated for a novel parallel DBMS; calledDBS3.,*,1995,7

Using logarithmic code-expansion to speedup index access and maintenance,Martin Kersten,Abstract In this paper we have studied the performance of alternative representations ofbinary search-trees for indexing a relation kept in main-memory. It was shown thatspace/time performance of the common techniques; such as sorted heaps; and morecomplex data structures; such as avl-trees; can be improved considerably. In particular;when an upperbound is determined during program construction on the maximal size of theindices; an efficient mapping; called the virtual tree; from binary search tree to array exists.The resulting search structure ensures an upperbound on the number of comparisons forsearching and maintenance will only start to deteriorate when the area set aside for holdingthe index is nearly full. In addition; we showed that limiting the maximal size of the indexstructure permits judicious use of code-expansion; ie logarithmic code expansion; to …,Foundations of Data Organization and Algorithms,1989,6

The DBMS-your big data sommelier,Yağız Kargın; Martin Kersten; Stefan Manegold; Holger Pirk,When addressing the problem of “big” data volume; preparation costs are one of the keychallenges: the high costs for loading; aggregating and indexing data leads to a long data-to-insight time. In addition to being a nuisance to the end-user; this latency prevents real-timeanalytics on “big” data. Fortunately; data often comes in semantic chunks such as files thatcontain data items that share some characteristics such as acquisition time or location. Adata management system that exploits this trait can significantly lower the data preparationcosts and the associated data-to-insight time by only investing in the preparation of therelevant chunks. In this paper; we develop such a system as an extension of an existingrelational DBMS (MonetDB). To this end; we develop a query processing paradigm and datastorage model that are partial-loading aware. The result is a system that can make a 1.2 …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,5
Tomograph: Highlighting query parallelism in a multi-core system,Mrunal Gawade; Martin Kersten,Abstract Query parallelism improves serial query execution performance by orders ofmagnitude. Getting optimal performance from an already parallelized query plan is howeverdifficult due to its dependency on run time factors such as correct operator scheduling;memory pressure; disk io performance; and operating system noise. Identifying the exactproblems in a parallel query execution is difficult due to inter-dependence of these factors. Inthis paper we present Tomograph; a tool to visualize the parallel query executionperformance bottlenecks.

Optimizing main-memory join on modern hardware,Stefan Manegold; Peter A Boncz; Martin L Kersten,Abstract In the past decade; the exponential growth in commodity CPUs speed has faroutpaced advances in memory latency. A second trend is that CPU performance advancesare not only brought by increased clock rate; but also by increasing parallelism inside theCPU. Current database systems have not yet adapted to these trends; and show poorutilization of both CPU and memory resources on current hardware. In this article; we showhow these resources can be optimized for large joins and translate these insights intoguidelines for future database architectures; encompassing data structures; algorithms; costmodeling; and implementation. In particular; we discuss how vertically fragmented datastructures optimize cache performance on sequential data access.

Lazy ETL in action: ETL technology dates scientific data,Yağíz Kargín; Milena Ivanova; Ying Zhang; Stefan Manegold; Martin Kersten,Abstract Both scientific data and business data have analytical needs. Analysis takes placeafter a scientific data warehouse is eagerly filled with all data from external data sources(repositories). This is similar to the initial loading stage of Extract; Transform; and Load (ETL)processes that drive business intelligence. ETL can also help scientific data analysis.However; the initial loading is a time and resource consuming operation. It might not beentirely necessary; eg if the user is interested in only a subset of the data. We propose todemonstrate Lazy ETL; a technique to lower costs for initial loading. With it; ETL is integratedinto the query processing of the scientific data warehouse. For a query; only the requireddata items are extracted; transformed; and loaded transparently on-the-fly.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,4

On the symbiosis of a data mining environment and a DBMS,Martin L Kersten; Marcel Holsheimer; Marcel Holsheimer,Abstract One of the main obstacles in applying data mining techniques to large; real-worlddatabases is the lack of efficient data management. In this paper; we outline a two-levelarchitecture; consisting of a mining tool and a database server. Key elements in its successare a clear separation of concerns: the mining tool organizes and controls the searchprocess; while all data-handling is performed by the parallel main memory DBMS. Data isstored as a set of binary tables. The interaction consists of queries for statistical information.Properties of the DBMS and the search algorithm are exploited for optimization of the datahandling. In particular; results of previous computations are re-used; and I/O activity isreduced by keeping a small hot-set of binary tables in main-memory. As test results show;this system handles large datasets at a competitive performance. CR Subject …,*,1995,4
Dynamic parallel query processing,CA van den Berg; Martin L Kersten; S Shair-Ali; Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica,1 INTRODUCTION Query processing in current database machines is generally based onthe com—bination of two ideas: operation pipelining and static scheduling. Operationpipelining is the process of mapping the operations of the operator tree for a query ontovirtual processors. In this model the data ﬂows from the leaf pro—cessors to the processorassociated with the top of the operator tree. Before query execution starts; the virtualprocessors are allocated to physical proces—sors using a (heuristic) scheduling algorithm.This algorithm uses assumptions based on the data distribution; communication delays; andthe selectivity of the operations to come up with an optimal allocation; where optimal meanswith a minimal response time. This approach is widely used in database machinearchitectures like Bubba [1]; Gamma [2]; and PRISMA Although operation pipelined query …,*,1991,4

Adaptive query parallelization in multi-core column stores.,Mrunal Gawade; Martin L Kersten,ABSTRACT With the rise of multi-core CPU platforms; their optimal utilization for in-memoryOLAP workloads using column store databases has become one of the biggest challenges.Some of the inherent limitations in the achievable query parallelism are due to the degree ofparallelism dependency on the data skew; the overheads incurred by thread coordination;and the hardware resource limits. Finding the right balance between the degree ofparallelism and the multi-core utilization is even more trickier. It makes parallel plangeneration using traditional query optimizers a complex task. In this paper we introduceadaptive parallelization; which exploits execution feedback to gradually increase the level ofparallelism until we reach a sweet-spot. After each query has been executed; we replace anexpensive operator (or a sequence) by a faster parallel version; ie the query plan is …,EDBT,2016,3
Semi-automated exploration of data warehouses,Thibault Sellam; Emmanuel Müller; Martin Kersten,Abstract Exploratory data analysis tries to discover novel dependencies and unexpectedpatterns in large databases. Traditionally; this process is manual and hypothesis-driven.However; analysts can come short of patience and imagination. In this paper; we introduceClaude; a hypothesis generator for data warehouses. Claude follows a 2-step approach:(1)It detects interesting views; by exploiting non-linear statistical dependencies between thedimensions and the measure.(2) To explain its findings; it detects local patterns in theseviews and describes them with SQL queries. Technically; we derive a model ofinterestingness from fundamental information theory. To exploit this model; we presentaggressive approximations and heuristics; allowing Claude to be fast and more accuratethan state-of-art view selection algorithms.,Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2015,3
NUMA obliviousness through memory mapping,Mrunal Gawade; Martin Kersten,Abstract With the rise of multi-socket multi-core CPUs a lot of effort is being put into how tobest exploit their abundant CPU power. In a shared memory setting the multi-socket CPUsare equipped with their own memory module; and access memory modules across socketsin a non-uniform access pattern (NUMA). Memory access across socket is relativelyexpensive compared to memory access within a socket. One of the common solutions tominimize across socket memory access is to partition the data; such that the data affinity ismaintained per socket. In this paper we explore the role of memory mapped storage toprovide transparent data access in a NUMA environment; without the need of explicit datapartitioning. We compare the performance of a database engine in a distributed setting in amulti-socket environment; with a database engine in a NUMA oblivious setting.

Just-in-time data distribution for analytical query processing,Milena Ivanova; Martin Kersten; Fabian Groffen,Abstract Distributed processing commonly requires data spread across machines using apriori static or hash-based data allocation. In this paper; we explore an alternative approachthat starts from a master node in control of the complete database; and a variable number ofworker nodes for delegated query processing. Data is shipped just-in-time to the workernodes using a need to know policy; and is being reused; if possible; in subsequent queries.A bidding mechanism among the workers yields a scheduling with the most efficient reuse ofpreviously shipped data; minimizing the data transfer costs. Just-in-time data shipmentallows our system to benefit from locally available idle resources to boost overallperformance. The system is maintenance-free and allocation is fully transparent to users.Our experiments show that the proposed adaptive distributed architecture is a viable and …,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2012,3

We show how ourframework; called feature grammars; can be used to (1) exploit third-party interpretationmodules for real-world unstructured components; and (2) use context-free grammars toconvert such poorly or unstructured input to semistructured output. The basic idea is toenrich context-free grammars with special symbols called detectors; which provide for thenecessary structure just-in-time to satisfy a parser look-ahead. A prototype implementationhas been constructed in the Acoi project to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach forindexing both images and audio documents.,*,1999,3
A data cube algebra engine for data mining,ML Kersten; APJM Siebes; M Holsheimer; F Kwakkel,Abstract On line data mining products; such as Data Surveyor; illustrate that an extensiblearchitecture to accommodate a variety of mining algorithms and database interconnectivity istechnically feasible. In this paper we describe the interaction between Data Surveyor and itsDBMS backends using an extended relational algebra; the Data Cube Algebra; to encodethe mining requests. Subsequently; a drill engine produces optimized code for severaldatabase back-ends. Amongst others; the optimizer exploits commonalities amongstmultiple query batches and target platform speci c optimizations rules. The e ectiveness ofseveral strategies is illustrated using the Monet database engine.,*,1998,3

On optimal pipeline processing in parallel query execution,Stefan Manegold; Florian Waas; Martin Leopold Kersten; Stefan Manegold; Florian Waas; Martin L Kersten,Abstract A key assumption underlying query optimization schemes for parallel processing isthat their cost models can deal with the multitude of effects encountered during the executionphase. Unfortunately; this is rarely the case and the optimal processing is only achieved in afew situations. In this paper we address the problem to achieve optimal processing under apipelined execution strategy. The approach taken is based on a novel analytical framework---which establishes a formal treatment of both dataflow and processing environment---tovalidate execution strategies. The framework is based on the notion of-optimality whichreflects an execution strategy's ability of ad-hoc resource utilization.-optimal strategies areinsensitive to skew and provide a transparent interface to parallelism as they ensure aprovable near-optimal exploitation of the processing environment. Finally; we discuss …,*,1998,3
Region-based indexing in an image database,NJ Nes; ML Kersten,textabstractImage retrieval systems based on the image-query-by-example paradigm locatetheir answer set using a similarity measure of the query image with all images stored in thedatabase. Although this approach generally works for quick re-location ofidentical'or partlyoccluded images; it does not support the more interesting query type aimed at findingimages with a particular image fragment. In this paper we introduce a regionbased indexingscheme to support retrieval of images on the basis of both global and local image features.,proceedings of The International Conference on Imaging Science; Systems; and Technology; Las Vegas,1997,3

Column Store for GWAC: A High-cadence; High-density; Large-scale Astronomical Light Curve Pipeline and Distributed Shared-nothing Database,Meng Wan; Chao Wu; Jing Wang; Yulei Qiu; Liping Xin; Sjoerd Mullender; Hannes Mühleisen; Bart Scheers; Ying Zhang; Niels Nes; Martin Kersten; Yongpan Huang; Jinsong Deng; Jianyan Wei,Abstract The ground-based wide-angle camera array (GWAC); a part of the SVOM spacemission; will search for various types of optical transients by continuously imaging a field ofview (FOV) of 5000 degrees 2 every 15 s. Each exposure consists of 36× 4k× 4k pixels;typically resulting in 36×~ 175;600 extracted sources. For a modern time-domain astronomyproject like GWAC; which produces massive amounts of data with a high cadence; it ischallenging to search for short timescale transients in both real-time and archived data; andto build long-term light curves for variable sources. Here; we develop a high-cadence; high-density light curve pipeline (HCHDLP) to process the GWAC data in real-time; and design adistributed shared-nothing database to manage the massive amount of archived data whichwill be used to generate a source catalog with more than 100 billion records during 10 …,Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific,2016,2
Fast; explainable view detection to characterize exploration queries,Thibault Sellam; Martin Kersten,Abstract The aim of data exploration is to get acquainted with an unfamiliar database.Typically; explorers operate by trial and error: they submit a query; study the result; andrefine their query subsequently. In this paper; we investigate how to help them understandtheir query results. In particular; we focus on medium to high dimension spaces: if thedatabase contains dozens or hundreds of columns; which variables should they inspect?We propose to detect subspaces in which the users' selection is different from the rest of thedatabase. From this idea; we built Ziggy; a tuple description engine. Ziggy can detectinformative subspaces; and it can explain why it recommends them; with visualizations andnatural language. It can cope with mixed data; missing values; and it penalizes redundancy.Our experiments reveal that it is up to an order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art …,Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2016,2

Integrated querying of XML data in RDBMSs,Albrecht Schmidt; Stefan Manegold; Martin Kersten,Abstract This paper proposes a way to integrate cleanly relational databases and XMLdocuments. The main idea is to draw a clear line of demarcation between the two conceptsby modelling XML documents as a new atomic SQL type. The standardised XML tools likeXPath; XQuery; XSLT are then user-defined functions that operate on this type. Well-definedinteroperability is guaranteed by; on the one hand; defining a standard way to markup SQLrelations as XML documents and; thus; to make them accessible to the XML tools; on theother hand; XPath and XQuery queries run against the XML portion of the database can usethe same predefined schema to make their results accessible to the SQL language forfurther processing. Additionally; a method for set-oriented evaluation of regular pathexpressions is presented that integrates into our implementation framework.,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2003,2

Ziggy: Characterizing query results for data explorers,Thibault Sellam; Martin Kersten,Abstract Data exploration has received much attention during the last few years. The aim isto learn interesting new facts from a possibly unfamiliar data set. Typically; explorers operateby trial and error: they write a query; inspect the results and refine their specificationsaccordingly. In this demo proposal; we present Ziggy; a system to help them understandtheir query results. Ziggy's aim is to complement an existing exploration system. It assumesthat users already have a query in mind; but they do not know what is interesting about it. Toassist them; it detects characteristic views; that is; small sets of columns on which the tuplesin the results are different from those in the rest of the database. Thanks to these views; ourexplorers can understand why their selection is unique and make more informed explorationdecisions.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,1
In memory processing of massive point clouds for multi-core systems,Kostis Kyzirakos; Foteini Alvanaki; Martin Kersten,Abstract LIDAR is a popular remote sensing method used to examine the surface of theEarth. LIDAR instruments use light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges (variabledistances) and generate vast amounts of precise three dimensional point data describingthe shape of the Earth. Processing large collections of point cloud data and combining themwith auxiliary GIS data remain an open research problem. Past research in the area ofgeographic information systems focused on handling large collections of complex geometricobjects stored on disk and most algorithms have been designed and studied in a single-thread setting even though multi-core systems are well established.

Fast cartography for data explorers,Thibault Sellam; Martin Kersten,Abstract Exploration is the act of investigating unknown regions. An analyst exploring adatabase cannot; by definition; compose the right query or use the appropriate data miningalgorithm. However; current data management tools cannot operate without well definedinstructions. Therefore; browsing an unknown database can be a very tedious process. Ourproject; Atlas; is an attempt to circumvent this problem. Atlas is an active DBMS front-end;designed for database exploration. It generates and ranks several data maps from a userquery. A data map is a small set of database queries (less than a dozen); in which eachquery describes an interesting region of the database. The user can pick one and submit itfor further exploration. In order to support interaction; the system should operate in quasi-real time; possibly at the cost of precision; and require as little input parameters as …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,1

80 New Packages to Mine Database Query Logs,Thibault Sellam; Martin Kersten,Abstract: The query log of a DBMS is a powerful resource. It enables many practicalapplications; including query optimization and user experience enhancement. And yet;mining SQL queries is a difficult task. The fundamental problem is that queries are symbolicobjects; not vectors of numbers. Therefore; many popular statistical concepts; such asmeans; regression; or decision trees do not apply. Most authors limit themselves to ad hocalgorithms or approaches based on neighborhoods; such as k Nearest Neighbors. Ourproject is to challenge this limitation. We introduce methods to manipulate SQL queries as ifthey were vectors; thereby unlocking the whole statistical toolbox. We present three familiesof methods: feature maps; kernel methods; and Bayesian models. The first technique directlyencodes queries into vectors. The second one transforms the queries implicitly.

A Database System with Amnesia.,Martin L Kersten; Lefteris Sidirourgos,ABSTRACT Big Data comes with huge challenges. Its volume and velocity makes handling;curating; and analytical processing a costly affair. Even to simply “look at” the data within ana priori defined budget and with a guaranteed interactive response time might be impossibleto achieve. Commonly applied scale-out approaches will hit the technology and monetarywall soon; if not done so already. Likewise; blindly rejecting data when the channels are full;or reducing the data resolution at the source; might lead to loss of valuable observations. Anarmy of well-educated database administrators or full software stack architects might dealwith these challenges albeit at substantial cost. This calls for a mostly knobless DBMS with afundamental change in database management. Data rotting has been proposed as adirection to find a solution [10; 11].

Blaeu: mapping and navigating large tables with cluster analysis,Thibault Sellam; Robin Cijvat; Richard Koopmanschap; Martin Kersten,Abstract Blaeu is an interactive database exploration tool. Its aim is to guide casual usersthrough large data tables; ultimately triggering insights and serendipity. To do so; it relies ona double cluster analysis mechanism. It clusters the data vertically: it detects themes; groupsof mutually dependent columns that highlight one aspect of the data. Then it clusters thedata horizontally. For each theme; it produces a data map; an interactive visualization of theclusters in the table. The data maps summarize the data. They provide a visual synopsis ofthe clusters; as well as facilities to inspect their content and annotate them. But they also letthe users navigate further.

Multi-core column-store parallelization under concurrent workload,Mrunal Gawade; Martin Kersten; Alkis Simitsis,Abstract Columnar database systems; designed for an optimal OLAP workload performance;strive for maximum multi-core utilization under concurrent query executions. However; multi-core parallel plan generated for isolated execution leads to suboptimal performance duringconcurrent query execution. In this paper; we analyze the concurrent workload resourcecontention effects on multi-core plans using three intra-query parallelization techniques;static; adaptive; and cost model parallelization. We focus on a plan level comparison ofselected TPC-H queries; using in-memory multi-core columnar systems. Excessive partitionsin statically parallelized plans result into heavy L3 cache misses leading to memorycontention; degrading query performance severely. Overall; adaptive plans show morerobustness; less scheduling overheads; and an average 50% execution time …,Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware,2016,*
Have a chat with clustine; conversational engine to query large tables,Thibault Sellam; Martin Kersten,Abstract Thanks the recent advances of AI and the stellar popularity of messaging apps (eg;WhatsApp); chatbots are no longer bound to customer support services and computermuseums. Indeed; they provide a mighty; lightweight and accessible way to provide servicesover the Internet. In this paper; we introduce Clustine; a chatbot to help users query largetables through short messages. The main idea is to combine cluster analysis and textgeneration to compress query results; describe them with natural language and makerecommendations. We present the architecture of our system; demonstrate it with two usecases; and present early validation experiments with 12 real datasets to show that itspromises are reachable.,Proceedings of the Workshop on Human-In-the-Loop Data Analytics,2016,*

Data Vaults: a Database Welcome to Scientiﬁc File Repositories,MG Ivanova; Y Kargin; ML Kersten; S Manegold; Y Zhang; M Datcu; D Espinoza Molina,textabstractEfficient management and exploration of high-volume scientific file repositorieshave become pivotal for advancement in science. We propose to demonstrate the DataVault; an extension of the database system architecture that transparently opens scientificfile repositories for efficient in-database processing and exploration. The Data Vaultfacilitates science data analysis using high-level declarative languages; such as thetraditional SQL and the novel array-oriented SciQL. Data of interest are loaded from theattached repository in a just-in-time manner without need for up-front data ingestion. Thedemo is built around concrete implementations of the Data Vault for two scientific use cases:seismic time series and Earth observation images.

Transaction Processing in the Hybrid OLTP&OLAP Main-Memory Database System HyPer,Alfons Kemper Thomas Neumann Jan Finis; Florian Funke; Viktor Leis Henrik Mühe Tobias Mühlbauer; Wolf Rödiger,Abstract Two emerging hardware trends have re-initiated the development of in-coredatabase systems: ever increasing main-memory capacities and vast multi-core parallelprocessing power. Main-memory capacities of several TB allow to retain all transactionaldata of even the largest applications in-memory on one (or a few) servers. The vastcomputational power in combination with low data management overhead yieldsunprecedented transaction performance which allows to push transaction processing (awayfrom application servers) into the database server and still “leaves room” for additional queryprocessing directly on the transactional data. Thereby; the often postulated goal of real-timebusiness intelligence; where decision makers have access to the latest version of thetransactional state; becomes feasible.

An array data model and query language for EO image databases SciQL; A Query Language for Science Applications,Martin Kersten; Niels Nes; Ying Zhang; Milena Ivanova; Stefan Manegold,Executive Summary Scientific applications are still poorly served by contemporary relationaldatabase systems. At best; the system provides a bridge towards an external library usinguser-defined functions; explicit import/export facilities or linked-in Java/C# interpreters. Timehas come to rectify this with SciQL1; a SQL query language for scientific applications witharrays as first class citizens. It provides a seamless symbiosis of array-; set-; and sequence-interpretation using a clear separation of the mathematical object from its underlyingimplementation. A key innovation is to extend value-based grouping in SQL: 2003 withstructural grouping; ie; fixed-sized and unbounded groups based on explicit relationshipsbetween their dimension attributes. It leads to a generalization of window-based queryprocessing with wide applicability in science domains. This paper is focused on the …,*,2011,*

A column-oriented data stream engine,Erietta Liarou; Romulo Goncalves; Martin Kersten,ABSTRACT This paper introduces the DataCell; a data stream management systemdesigned as a seamless integration of continuous queries based on bulk event processingin an SQL software stack. The continuous stream queries are based on a predicate-window;called “basket” expressions; which support arbitrary complex SQL subqueries including; butnot limited to; temporal and sequence constraints. The DataCell is designed for bulk eventprocessing to capitalize proven relational column-store database technology to achieveefficient resource utilization. It is implemented on top of an open-source DBMS. In this workwe describe in detail the DataCell architecture; its data model; and its processing scheme.An analysis of the core algorithms provides an outlook on its performance in the envisionedapplication domains.,*,2008,*

REPORT INS-E0603 MAY 2006,FE Groffen; ML Kersten; S Manegold,ABSTRACT The current database deployment palette ranges from networked sensor-baseddevices to large data/compute Grids. Both extremes present common challenges fordistributed DBMS technology. The local storage per device/node/site is severely limitedcompared to the total data volume being managed and the local processing power is toolimited to handle a high query load. In this paper; we propose Armada: a novel referencemodel for a distributed database architecture to facilitate evolutionary growth. Participatingsystems can autonomously decide to take responsibility in the distributed data managementtask. The system adapts to varying workloads and supports dynamic system re-sizing; eggrowing and shrinking of the system at large. Armada uses lineage trails to capture themetadata and history.

XIRAF Ultimate Forensic Querying,Wouter Alink; Raoul Bhoedjang; Peter Boncz; Arjen de Vries,A typical digital forensic investigation involves these four phases: 1. media capture (eg;forensic disk duplication); 2. feature extraction (eg; parsing file systems; mailboxes; chatlogs; etc.); 3. analysis (browsing; querying; correlating); 4. reporting (writing down findingsfor court). This paper addresses two key problems that occur in the feature extraction andanalysis phases of a computer system investigation. First; the amount of data to process in atypical investigation is huge. Modern computer systems are routinely equipped withhundreds of gigabytes of storage and a large investigation will often involve multiplesystems; so the amount of data to process can run into terabytes. The amount of timeavailable for processing this data is often limited (eg; because of legal limitations). Also; theprobability that a forensic investigator will miss important traces increases,digital investigation,2006,*

Bio-Inspired Data Management,Martin Kersten; Arno Siebes,Abstract The pervasive penetration of database technology may suggest that we havereached the end of the database research era. The contrary is true. Emerging technology; inhardware; software; and connectivity; brings a wealth of opportunities to push technology toa new level of maturity. Furthermore; ground breaking results are obtained in Quantum-andDNA-computing using nature as inspiration for its computational models. This chapterprovides a vision on a new brand of database architectures; ie an Organic Database Systemwhere a large collection of connected; autonomous data cells implement a semanticmeaningful store/recall information system. It explores the analogy of a biological complex tocharter the contours of this research vision. A concrete computational model is defined andillustrated by examples as a step into this direction. 1,Intelligent Algorithms in Ambient and Biomedical Computing,2006,*

Storing XML Documents in Databases,Albrecht Schmidt; Stefan Manegold; Martin Kersten,Abstract Ever since the Extensible Markup Language (XML)(W3C; 1998b) began to be usedto exchange data between diverse sources; interest has grown in deploying datamanagement technology to store and query XML documents. A number of approachespropose to adapt relational database technology to store and maintain XML documents(Deutsch; Fernandez & Suciu; 1999; Florescu & Kossmann; 1999; Klettke & Meyer; 2000;Shanmugasundaram et al.; 1999; Tatarinov et al.; 2002; O'Neil et al.; 2004).

REPORT INS-E0408 SEPTEMBER 2004,ML Kersten; S Manegold,ABSTRACT Query performance strongly depends on finding an execution plan that touchesas few superfluous tuples as possible. The access structures deployed for this purpose;however; are non-discriminative. They assume every subset of the domain being indexed isequally important; and their structures cause a high maintenance overhead during updates.This approach often fails in decision support or scientific environments where indexselection represents a weak compromise amongst many plausible plans. An alternativeroute; explored here; is to continuously adapt the database organization by makingreorganization an integral part of the query evaluation process. Every query is first analyzedfor its contribution to break the database into multiple pieces; such that both the requiredsubset is easily retrieved and subsequent queries may benefit from the new partitioning …,*,2004,*

While cache-conscious variants for various relational algorithmshave been described; previous work has mostly ignored (the cost of) projection columns.However; real-life joins almost always come with projections; such that proper projectioncolumn manipulation should be an integral part of any generic join algorithm. In this paper;we analyze cache-conscious hash-join algorithms including projections on two storageschemes: N-ary Storage Model (NSM) and Decomposition Storage Model (DSM).

REPORT INS-E0411 DECEMBER 2004,M Zukowski; PA Boncz; ML Kersten,ABSTRACT Data mining; information retrieval and other application areas exhibit a queryload with multiple concurrent queries touching a large fraction of a relation. This leads toindividual query plans based on a table scan or large index scan. The implementation of thisaccess path in most database systems is straightforward. The" Scan" operator issues nextpage requests to the buffer manager without concern for the system state. Conversely; thebuffer manager is not aware of the work ahead and it focuses on keeping the most-recently-used pages in the buffer pool. This paper introduces" cooperative scans"--a new algorithm;based on a better sharing of knowledge and responsibility between the" Scan" operator andthe buffer manager; which significantly improves performance of concurrent scan queries. Inthis approach; queries share the buffer content; and progress of the scans is optimized by …,*,2004,*

REPORT INS-R0301 MARCH 31; 2003,AR van Ballegooij; AP de Vries; ML Kersten,ABSTRACT Developing multimedia applications in relational databases is hindered by amismatch in computational frameworks. Efficient manipulation of multimedia data calls forarray-based processing; which at best is available as a database add-on; not supported bythe query optimizer. As a result; array-based processing ends up in dedicated programsoutside the DBMS: non-reusable black boxes. The goal of our research is to reduce this gapbetween user-needs and system functionality by developing a seemless integration of arrayprocessing in a relational algebra engine. The paper introduces a declarative language forarray-expressions based on the array comprehension; and its mapping to a relational kernelin a prototype implementation.

REPORT INS-R0109 OCTOBER 31; 2001,AP de Vries; N Mamoulis; NJ Nes; ML Kersten,ABSTRACT In content-based retrieval systems; the goal of similarity search is to identify thek most similar images to a given example. Images are represented and queried by high-dimensional feature vectors encoding dominant characteristics like color and texture. Wepropose an efficient similarity search method that is robust to dimensionality and has optimalspace complexity. Our approach fragments the feature vectors vertically; and computes thesimilarity of all images dimension by dimension. The innovation lies in gradually removingimages that cannot participate in the response set. We show how to apply this scheme fortwo common similarity metrics; namely histogram intersection and euclidean distance. Theimplementation of our algorithm in Monet illustrates that core database technology supportsimage retrieval well; without special extensions. Finally; we report the effectiveness of our …,*,2001,*

Cost distribution of search spaces in query optimization,CA Galindo Legaria; J Pellenkoft; ML Kersten,Abstract Query optimization algorithms explore a large space of query execution planslooking for an optimal solution. The predominant algorithms move around the search spacein either a deterministic or probabilistic way. The performance of probabilistic optimizationalgorithms is strongly in uenced by the cost distribution over the search space; theconnectivity of the space and the overhead cost. The transformation free (TF) QueryOptimization strategy proposed in this paper is insensitive to the search space connectivity.We show that under weak conditions and the assumption of an accurate cost model theperformance and accuracy of the TF strategy in comparable with probabilistic strategies.,*,1994,*

The problem gets even harder if standard technology like printed circuit boards;racks; and cabinets; must be used. We investigate three-dimensional arrangements of buttery networks. We construct xu-stage butter y networks from u-stage networks. The sub-networks can be arranged in x cubes of dimension x? 1 such that subnetworks in cubes iand i+ 1 are connected only if they di er in dimension i. This allows for regular wiring andhence for use of standard components. The proposed method generalizes a result by Wise;which is obtained by choosing x= 2.,*,1993,*

A series of (open) database issues isgiven for which the object-oriented paradigm does not provide an elegant solution.Following we describe a refinement of the OO concepts which emphasizes the dynamicclassification of objects through its evolving properties rather than the origine of itsinstantiation method. Such an approach is called object-centered and is the basis fororganizing the database in the programming language Godai. The complementary aspectexplored is to organize the processing around active agents; called guardians; which arehigh-level declarative process descriptions which algorithmically react to states (changes) ofthe database.,On Object-Oriented Database System,1991,*
Logging and Recovery in PRISMA,Carel A van den Berg; Martin L Kersten,Abstract The recovery methods for main-memory database systems are mostly based onmaintaining a disk based log and checkpoint. The information written to the log usuallyconsists of low level information; before-after images or single tuple updates. In this paperwe examine the effect of writing higher level update information to the log. This results inless logging overhead during normal processing; but an increased replay overhead duringrecovery. We introduce a cost model for analyzing the effect of higher level logging on thetransaction throughput; and present the results of a performance analysis based on this costmodel.,Workshop on Parallel Database Systems,1990,*

Implementing PRISMA/DB in an OOPL,Annita N Wilschut Paul WPJ Grefen; Peter MG Apers; Martin L Kersten,Abstract PRISMA/DB is implemented in a parallel object-oriented language to gain insight inthe usage of parallelism. This environment allows us to experiment with parallelism bysimply changing the allocation of objects to the processors of the PRISMA machine. Theseobjects are obtained by a strictly modular design of PRISMA/DB. Communication betweenthe objects is required to cooperatively handle the various tasks; but it limits the potential forparallelism. From this approach; we hope to gain a better understanding of parallelism;which can be used to enhance the performance of PRISMA/DB.,Database Machines: Sixth International Workshop; Iwdm'89; Deauville; France; June 19-21; 1989.

with the Software Testpilot,F Andrès; F Kwakkel; ML Kersten,Abstract Relational database systems come with a query optimizer to plan the executionorder of individual operators using a cost model of the underlying system. Despite the largebody of research on optimization rules and cost approximation; little effort has been investedin the design of effective tech-niques for their validation. In this paper we discuss a methodto calibrate cost models using the Software Testpilot; a performance assessment tool. Theapproach is based on taking an initial cost model and to refine it using the capa-bilities of theunderlying DBMS kernel using automatically generated experiments. Apart from simplifyinga time consuming task; it improves the effec-tiveness of the query optimizer by being tunedtowards its hardware platform. The technique is illustrated for a novel parallel DBMS; calledDBS3.,*,*,*
Distributed Processing and Transaction Replication in MonetDB-Towards a Scalable Analytical Database System in the Cloud,Ying Zhang; Dimitar Nedev; Panagiotis Koutsourakis; Martin Kersten,Abstract. Thanks to its flexibility (ie new computing jobs can be set up in minutes; withouthaving to wait for hardware procurement) and elasticity (ie more or less resources can beallocated to instantly match the current workload); cloud computing has rapidly gained muchinterests from both academic and commercial users. Increasingly moving into the cloud is aclear trend in the software developments. To provide its users a fast in-memory optimisedanalytical database system with all the conveniences of the cloud environment; weembarked upon extending the open-source column store database MonetDB with newfeatures to make it cloud-ready.

In this paper we study the space of operator trees that can be used to answer a joinquery; with the goal of generating elements form this space at random. We solve theproblem for queries with acyclic query graphs. We first count; in O (n") time; the exactnumber of trees that can be used to evaluate a given query on n relations. The intermediateresults of the counting procedure then serve to generate random; uniformly distributedoperator trees in O (n") time per tree. We also es-tablish a mapping between the N operatortrees for a query and the integers 1 through N–ie a ranking-and describe ranking and un-ranking procedures with complexity O (n") and O (n" log n); respectively.,*,*,*

Armada: a Model for an Evolving Database,Fabian Groffen; Martin Kersten; Stefan Manegold,Soon we face a common repository size scaling into petabytes; filled with data that needs tobe stored and processed. However; the rapidly improving technology cannot keep up withthe data growth rate; hence data processing becomes more and more an expensive andtime-consuming task. This problem is of major concern; since data processing is a coreprocess for many businesses and applications. Yet a real solution to the data growthproblem has to be found. Scaling into multiple machines to process the data is currentlysuccessfully applied in grids and distributed databases. However; the centralised scalingtechnique using a large number of machines; is fragile from an availability point of view. Allsystems depend on the availability of one. Moreover; this single point-of-failure can easilyget overloaded; thereby forming the bottleneck in serving a high workload. A novel …,*,*,*

CS-R9521 1995,ML Kersten; M Holsheimer,Abstract One of the main obstacles in applying data mining techniques to large; real-worlddatabases is the lack of e cient data management. In this paper; we outline a two-levelarchitecture; consisting of a mining tool and a database server. Key elements in its successare a clear separation of concerns: the mining tool organizes and controls the searchprocess; while all data-handling is performed by the parallel main memory DBMS. Data isstored as a set of binary tables. The interaction consists of queries for statistical information.Properties of the DBMS and the search algorithm are exploited for optimization of the datahandling. In particular; results of previous computations are re-used; and I/O activity isreduced by keeping a small hot-set of binary tables in main-memory. As test results show;this system handles large datasets at a competitive performance.,*,*,*

To alleviate these problems we define a formalmodel that explicates the database semantics through entity definitions and limits their usealong well-defined paths. Our approach is based on six design axioms and conceptsborrowed topology. This way we achieve an unified description of both the databaseintension and its extension. In particular; we show that generalisation/specialisationhierarchies are naturally cast into proper subset hierarchies in the entity type topology.Moreover; the limitations posed on the construction of entity types preserve the Armstrongaxioms for functional dependencies.

INS-R9805 February 28; 1998,S Manegold; F Waas; ML Kersten,ABSTRACT A key assumption underlying query optimization schemes for parallelprocessing is that their cost models can deal with the multitude of e ects encountered duringthe execution phase. Unfortunately; this is rarely the case and the optimal processing is onlyachieved in a few situations. In this paper we address the problem to achieve optimalprocessing under a pipelined execution strategy. The approach taken is based on a novelanalytical framework| which establishes a formal treatment of both data ow and processingenvironment| to validate execution strategies. The framework is based on the notion of-optimality which re ects an execution strategy's ability of ad-hoc resource utilization.-optimalstrategies are insensitive to skew and provide a transparent interface to parallelism as theyensure a provable near-optimal exploitation of the processing environment.,*,*,*

INS-R0006 February 29; 2000,HGP Bosch; SJ Mullender,Scheduling disk activity for a mixed workload is a challenging problem. While the basicissues of scheduling real-time traffic have been addressed; this has usually been at theexpense of best-effort traffic–which is an important component of a mixed workload. Wehave found that giving priority to best-effort requests over real-time requests in such a waythat real-time requests do not miss their deadlines; significantly improves the latency of thebest-effort requests compared to non-prioritizing scheduling techniques. We argue thatwhen slack time is available in the schedule–ie; there is time between any end of real-timerequest invocation and its deadline–best-effort requests need to run before the real-timerequests.,*,*,*
INS-R9912 October 31; 1999,S Manegold; P Boncz; ML Kersten,ABSTRACT In the past decade; the exponential growth in commodity CPUs speed has faroutpaced advances in memory latency. A second trend is that CPU performance advancesare not only brought by increased clock rate; but also by increasing parallelism inside theCPU. Current database systems have not yet adapted to these trends; and show poorutilization of both CPU and memory resources on current hardware. In this article; we showhow these resources can be optimized for large joins and translate these insights intoguidelines for future database architectures; encompassing data structures; algorithms; costmodeling; and implementation. In particular; we discuss how vertically fragmented datastructures optimize cache performance on sequential data access. On the algorithmic side;we refine the partitioned hash-join with a new partitioning algorithm called radix-cluster …,*,*,*

Panel Program,Martin Kersten,To survive in our digital society a person can rely on laptops; PDAs; telephones; etc. As longas its data sources are independent; devices are never replaced; nor new devices enter ourrealm of existence; we will survive easily. However; life runs a different course and we haveto spent a lot of time and effort to keep the data sources" up-to-date" and consistent. Taken inisolation; each application appears as a trivial task and its developers will not be inclined toconsider a DBMS the right approach to manage a list of a few tens of records. Theinvestment is too high and the macro benefits (interoperability and evolution) are unclear. Atthe same time; to secure product lines and enable interoperability between products; thedevelopers are forced to rethink transaction management; resource optimization; and queryprocessing.,*,*,*

INS-R9912 October 31; 1999,Optimizing Main-Memory Join On Modern; Hardware S Manegold; P Boncz; ML Kersten,ABSTRACT In the past decade; the exponential growth in commodity CPUs speed has faroutpaced advances in memory latency. A second trend is that CPU performance advancesare not only brought by increased clock rate; but also by increasing parallelism inside theCPU. Current database systems have not yet adapted to these trends; and show poorutilization of both CPU and memory resources on current hardware. In this article; we showhow these resources can be optimized for large joins and translate these insights intoguidelines for future database architectures; encompassing data structures; algorithms; costmodeling; and implementation. In particular; we discuss how vertically fragmented datastructures optimize cache performance on sequential data access. On the algorithmic side;we refine the partitioned hash-join with a new partitioning algorithm called radix-cluster …,*,*,*

INS-R9905 April 30; 1999,Martin L Kersten; APJM Siebes,ABSTRACT The pervasive penetration of database technology may suggest that we havereached the end of the database research era. The contrary is true. Emerging technology; inhardware; software; and connectivity; brings a wealth of opportunities to push technology toa new level of maturity. Furthermore; ground breaking results are obtained in Quantum-andDNA-computing using nature as inspiration for its computational models. This paperprovides a vision on a new brand of database architectures; ie an Organic Database Systemwhere a large collection of connected; autonomous data cells implement a semanticmeaningful store/recall information system. It explores the analogy of a biological complex tocharter the contours of this research vision. A concrete computational model is defined andillustrated by examples as a step into this direction.,*,*,*

Emerging “vertical” database systems in support of scientific data,Per Svensson; Peter Boncz; Milena Ivanova; Martin Kersten; Niels Nes,Abstract. This chapter surveys and discusses the evolution of a certain class of databasearchitectures; more recently referred to as “vertical databases”. The topics discussed in thischapter include the evolution of storage structures from the 1970‟ s till now; datacompression techniques; and query processing techniques for single-and multi-variablequeries in vertical databases. Next; the chapter covers in detail the architecture and designconsiderations of a particular (open source) vertical database system; called MonetDB. Thisis followed by an example of using MonetDB for the SkyServer data; and the queryprocessing improvements it offers.,*,*,*
