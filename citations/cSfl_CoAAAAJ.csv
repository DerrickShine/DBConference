Spectral changes of stochastic beams scattered on a deterministic medium,Mayukh Lahiri; Emil Wolf,It is well known that scattering of a polychromatic plane wave by a random medium; ie; by amedium whose refractive index varies randomly with position; may produce frequency shiftsof spectral lines. It has been a common perception that a random medium is required forgeneration of such spectral shifts by scattering. In this Letter we show that such aphenomenon occurs even when the refractive index of the medium is a deterministicfunction of position. We also show that this phenomenon may be used to obtain informationabout the structure of a deterministic medium.,Optics letters,2012,21
Polarization properties of stochastic light beams in the space–time and space–frequency domains,Mayukh Lahiri,Mayukh Lahiri Department of Physics and Astronomy; University of Rochester; Rochester; NewYork 14627; USA (mayukh@pas.rochester.edu) Received July 10; 2009; revised August 11;2009; accepted August 20; 2009; posted August 26; 2009 (Doc.

Theory of quantum imaging with undetected photons,Mayukh Lahiri; Radek Lapkiewicz; Gabriela Barreto Lemos; Anton Zeilinger,Abstract A novel quantum imaging technique has recently been demonstrated in anexperiment; where the photon used for illuminating an object is not detected; the image isobtained by interfering two beams; none of which ever interacts with the object. Here wepresent a detailed theoretical analysis of the experiment. We show that the objectinformation is present only in the interference term and not in the individual intensities of theinterfering beams. We also theoretically establish that the magnification of the imagingsystem depends on two wavelengths: the average wavelength of the photon that illuminatesthe object and the average wavelength of the photon that is detected. Our analysis affirmsthat the imaging process is based on the principle that quantum interference occurs wheninterferometric path information is unavailable.,Physical Review A,2015,20
The influence of the degree of cross-polarization on the Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect,Asma Al-Qasimi; Mayukh Lahiri; David Kuebel; Daniel FV James; Emil Wolf,We show; by an example; that the knowledge of the degree of coherence and of the degreeof polarization of a light beam incident on two photo detectors is not adequate to predictcorrelations in the fluctuations of the currents generated in the detectors (the Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect). The knowledge of the so-called degree of cross-polarization; introduced notlong ago; is also needed.,Optics Express,2010,20
Cross-spectral density matrices of polarized light beams,Mayukh Lahiri; Emil Wolf,We show that there is no unique form of the cross-spectral density matrix of completelypolarized light beams. We present three kinds of such matrices; each of which represents abeam that is completely polarized at every point. Some of the beams do not imitatemonochromatic beams; in contrast to the usual assumption made in polarization optics.,Optics letters,2009,17
Theory of refraction and reflection with partially coherent electromagnetic beams,Mayukh Lahiri; Emil Wolf,Abstract Laws of refraction and reflection of light are governed by the classic Fresnelformulas.

Wefind that coherence properties of such beams change; in general; on refraction and onreflection at a planar interface.,Physical Review A,2012,15
Implications of complete coherence in the space–frequency domain,Mayukh Lahiri; Emil Wolf,It was shown not long ago that complete spatial coherence of light at a pair of points in thespace–time domain may be interpreted as a manifestation of so-called “statistical similarity”between the fluctuating field at the two points. In this Letter; we consider complete spatialcoherence at a pair of points in the space–frequency domain and derive a condition that thefield at those points must obey. We illustrate the usefulness of the condition by an example.,Optics letters,2011,14
Entanglement by Path Identity,Mario Krenn; Armin Hochrainer; Mayukh Lahiri; Anton Zeilinger,Abstract Quantum entanglement is one of the most prominent features of quantummechanics and forms the basis of quantum information technologies. Here we present anovel method for the creation of quantum entanglement in multipartite and high-dimensionalsystems. The two ingredients are (i) superposition of photon pairs with different origins and(ii) aligning photons such that their paths are identical. We explain the experimentallyfeasible creation of various classes of multiphoton entanglement encoded in polarization aswell as in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces—starting only from nonentangled photon pairs.For two photons; arbitrary high-dimensional entanglement can be created. The idea ofgenerating entanglement by path identity could also apply to quantum entities other thanphotons. We discovered the technique by analyzing the output of a computer algorithm …,Physical Review Letters,2017,13

Cross-spectral density matrix of the far field generated by a blackbody source,Mayukh Lahiri; Emil Wolf,In 1994 James demonstrated that the degree of polarization of light may change onpropagation; even in free space [4]. Other examples of such changes were later discussed inseveral publications [5–7]. To fully understand this phenomenon and to describe itquantitatively; it is necessary to employ a more general correlation matrix than the one introducedby Wiener. Such a matrix; known as cross-spectral density matrix; characterizes the correlationsof the electric field at two rather than one point in space (see Ref. [8]; Chapter 9) … In the presentpaper we determine the cross-spectral density matrix of the far field produced by radiation whichemerges from a planar opening in a cavity containing blackbody radiation (see Fig. 1). Our treatmentis restricted to the paraxial domain. Using this matrix we show that the radiation in the paraxialregion of the far field; is completely unpolarized; in agreement with a result derived by …,Optics Communications,2008,12
Quantifying the momentum correlation between two light beams by detecting one,Armin Hochrainer; Mayukh Lahiri; Radek Lapkiewicz; Gabriela Barreto Lemos; Anton Zeilinger,Abstract We report a measurement of the transverse momentum correlation between twophotons by detecting only one of them. Our method uses two identical sources in anarrangement in which the phenomenon of induced coherence without induced emission isobserved. In this way; we produce an interference pattern in the superposition of one beamfrom each source. We quantify the transverse momentum correlation by analyzing thevisibility of this pattern. Our approach might be useful for the characterization of correlatedphoton pair sources and may lead to an experimental measure of continuous variableentanglement; which relies on the detection of only one of two entangled particles.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2017,10
Wave-particle duality and polarization properties of light in single-photon interference experiments,Mayukh Lahiri,We consider superposition of two states of light polarized along mutually orthogonaldirections. We show that partial polarization of the superposed light may be interpreted as a manifestationof the wave-particle duality … PACS number(s): 42.50.Ar; 42.25.Ja … Quantum systems (quantons[1]) possess properties of both particles and waves. Bohr's correspondence principle [2] suggeststhat these two properties are mutually exclusive. In other words; depending on the experimentalsituation; a quanton will behave as a particle or as a wave. In the third volume of his famous lectureseries [3]; Feynman emphasized that this wave-particle duality may be understood from a Young'stwo-pinhole interference experiment [4]. In such an experiment; a quanton may arrive at the detectoralong two different paths. If one can determine which path the quanton traveled; then no interferencefringe will be found (ie; the quanton will show complete particle behavior). On the other …,Physical Review A,2011,9

Interference fringes controlled by noninterfering photons,Armin Hochrainer; Mayukh Lahiri; Radek Lapkiewicz; Gabriela B Lemos; Anton Zeilinger,Interference phenomena play a fundamental role in physics; and interferometric techniqueshave helped advance science and technology significantly. In this Letter; we observe spatialfringes in the interference of two beams; which are controlled by a third beam through thephenomenon of induced coherence without induced emission. We show that theinterference pattern depends on the alignment of this third beam in an analogous way; asfringes created in a traditional division of amplitude interferometer depend on the relativealignment of the two interfering beams. We demonstrate that the pattern is characterized byan equivalent wavelength; which corresponds to a combination of the wavelengths of theinvolved light beams. Our results open up the possibility of developing new techniques; suchas wavefront sensing and holography at wavelengths for which no suitable single-photon …,Optica,2017,7

Twin-photon correlations in single-photon interference,Mayukh Lahiri; Armin Hochrainer; Radek Lapkiewicz; Gabriela Barreto Lemos; Anton Zeilinger,Abstract The measurement of the correlation between two quantum systems or particles hasa broad significance in physics and also plays a central role in the fields of quantum opticsand quantum information science. We propose a method of measuring the correlationbetween the transverse momenta of two photons; in which one only needs to detect one ofthe photons. We show that it is possible to generate a single-photon fringe pattern by usingtwo spatially separated identical biphoton sources. The fringes are similar to the onesobserved in a Michelson interferometer and possess certain remarkable properties. Astriking feature of the fringes is that although the pattern is obtained by detecting one photononly of each photon pair; the fringes shift due to a change in the optical path traversed by theundetected photon; the shift is characterized by a combination of wavelengths of both …,Physical Review A,2017,6
Change in spatial coherence of light on refraction and on reflection,Mayukh Lahiri; Emil Wolf,A theory of refraction and reflection of partially coherent electromagnetic beams has beenrecently developed. In this paper; we apply it to study the change in spatial coherencecaused by refraction and by reflection more fully.

Beam condition for scattering on random media,Mayukh Lahiri; Emil Wolf,Properties of random media are frequently investigated by studying their interactions withstochastic electromagnetic fields. However; a stochastic beam does not necessarily retain itsbeamlike form on scattering; and the theory of stochastic electromagnetic fields that are notbeamlike is rather complicated. In this paper a necessary and sufficient condition is derivedfor a beam to retain its beamlike form after it is scattered on a stochastic medium. Weillustrate the result by an example.,JOSA A,2009,6
An inverse problem in the theory of stochastic electromagnetic beams,David Kuebel; Mayukh Lahiri; Emil Wolf,Abstract The cross-spectral density matrix of an electromagnetic beam has been playingincreasingly important role in studies of changes of spectra; of coherence and of polarizationas the beam propagates. In this paper we derive solution to an inverse problem; whichmakes it possible to determine the cross-spectral density matrix of the beam in the sourceplane z= 0; from the knowledge of the matrix in any cross-section z= z 0> 0 in the half-spaceinto which the beam propagates. We apply the result to the theory of so-called Stokesbeams; which were introduced not long ago.,Optics Communications,2009,6
Partial polarization by quantum distinguishability,Mayukh Lahiri; Armin Hochrainer; Radek Lapkiewicz; Gabriela Barreto Lemos; Anton Zeilinger,Abstract We establish that a connection exists between wave-particle duality of photons andpartial polarization of a light beam. We perform a two-path lowest-order (single photon)interference experiment and demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that thedegree of polarization of the light beam emerging from an output of the interferometerdepends on path distinguishability. In our experiment; we are able to change the quantumstate of the emerging photon from a pure state to a fully mixed state without any directinteraction with the photon. Although most lowest-order interference experiments can beexplained by classical theory; our experiment has no genuine classical analog. Our resultsshow that a case exists where the cause of partial polarization is beyond the scope ofclassical theory.,Physical Review A,2017,5
Statistical similarity and cross-spectral purity of stationary stochastic fields,Mayukh Lahiri; Emil Wolf,In practical situations; one often generates a beam by superposition of two or more lightbeams. The beam generated by superposition displays; in general; different spectralproperties than do the original beams. However; there are some optical beams; called cross-spectrally pure beams; which can generate a light beam of identical spectral distribution onsuperposition. The relationship between cross-spectral purity and spatial coherence hasbeen the subject of investigations for some time. Recently; a concept of so-called statisticalsimilarity has been introduced which provides a new way to elucidate complete spatialcoherence. In this Letter; we discuss some implications of statistical similarity of an opticalfield on its cross-spectral purity.,Optics letters,2012,5
Concept of purity in the theory of optical polarization,Mayukh Lahiri,It was shown some time ago that the space-time and the space-frequency degrees ofpolarization of a stochastic electromagnetic beam are not equivalent to each other. It is notpossible; in general; to obtain a formal relationship between them. In this Letter; we discusscertain conditions under which they are directly related. These conditions lead to theconcept of polarization-purity. If an optical beam obeys these conditions; its space-frequencydegree of polarization has the same value at all frequencies present in the spectrum; andthe value is equal to the space-time degree of polarization.,Optics letters,2013,4
Spatial coherence properties of monochromatic electromagnetic beams and of laser modes,Mayukh Lahiri; Emil Wolf,Abstract It is shown that; contrary to common belief; monochromatic light beams are; ingeneral; not spatially completely coherent; ie; they will; in general; not produce fringes of unitvisibility in a Young's double pinhole interference experiment. We cite experiments withlaser modes which confirm this result.,Physics Letters A,2009,4
Effect of scattering on cross-spectral purity of light,Mayukh Lahiri; Emil Wolf,Abstract The concept of cross-spectral purity was introduced by Mandel in connection withthe modulation of spectral distribution of optical fields in superposition experiments. It is nowknown that spectral distribution of light can also change on scattering. We investigate theeffect of scattering on cross-spectral purity. We show that the purity is; in general; notpreserved on scattering. We also discuss some conditions under which it can be preservedat certain pairs of points in the far-zone.,Optics Communications,2014,3

Contributions to the Theories of Coherence and Polarization of Light,Mayukh Lahiri,Abstract In this thesis; coherence and polarization properties of stochastic optical fields areinvestigated. The so-called cross-spectral density matrices of polarized and natural lightbeams are studied. It is shown how coherence and polarization properties of stochasticbeams change on superposition. The relationship between the so-called space-time andspace-frequency descriptions of completely polarized fields and of completely coherentfields are investigated. An inverse scattering problem involving a random medium isdiscussed. In this context; the condition which ensures that a beam retains its beam-like formon scattering; is also presented. Basic polarization properties of light beams are discussedbased on quantum mechanical theory of fields. A quantum theory of optical coherence in thespace-frequency domain is also presented.,*,2012,2
Coherence and Statistical Optics,Mayukh Lahiri,In traditional optics; an electric field is usually represented by a deterministic function.Although a deterministic model is useful for the analysis of many problems; it cannot be usedto explain certain physical phenomena which arise from the random fluctuations present inoptical fields. Optical coherence and optical polarization are two examples of suchphenomena. The theory of statistical optics has been being developed to explain andanalyze these types of properties of light. The theory of optical coherence has its root in theYoung's interference experiment which shows that light emerging from two pinholes mayinterfere and produce a fringe pattern [1]. Coherence is often regarded as the ability of lightto interfere. Many years ago; Zernike introduced the concept of degree of coherence in termsof the visibility of fringes produced in a Young's interference experiment [2]. On the other …,Photonics; Volume 1: Fundamentals of Photonics and Physics,2015,1
Quantum Theory of Coherence and Polarization of Light,Mayukh Lahiri,When we open our eyes on earth for the first time; light generates the sensation of vision inour mind. If there was no light; our way of thinking would undoubtedly be quite different.Therefore; it is natural to ask the question; what is light? Our early inquisitiveness about lightis documented in many stories and characters from almost all religions and cultures. Later;with the development of science; we tried to use more rigorous techniques to understand thenature of light. However; regardless of intense investigations for centuries on this subject; weare far from obtaining a convincing answer to the question “what is light?” Einstein seems tohave put it best1:,*,2012,1
Theory of optical coherence in the space-time and in the space-frequency domains,Mayukh Lahiri; Emil Wolf,Abstract: The relationship between the theories of optical coherence in space-time andspace- frequency domains is discussed.

Zernike defined the degree of coherence of light at two points ina wave field as the maximum visibility of interference fringes formed by superposing light arrivingfrom the two points. Zernike's formulation did not take into account any time delay between theinterfering beams and; consequently; it could not explain some rather important coherenceproperties. In 1955; Zernike's definition was generalized by including time difference …,Frontiers in Optics,2010,1
Many-Particle Interferometry and Entanglement by Path Identity,Mayukh Lahiri,Abstract: We present a general scheme of many-particle interferometry in which two identicalsources are used and" which-way information" is erased by making paths of one or moreparticles identical. We show that an $(NM) $-particle interference pattern is observed wheneach source can emit $ N $ particles and paths of $ M $($< N $) particles are made identical.These $ M $ particles with identical paths are never detected. The scheme allows us togenerate $(NM) $-particle entangled states that directly correspond to the interferencepatterns: an entangled state is obtained when a maximum is attained in a corresponding setof interference patters. Properties of these states depend on the difference; $ NM $; ratherthan on the individual values of $ N $ and $ M $. We provide general forms of these statesand show that they can be expressed as superpositions of various Dicke states. We also …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.09102,2018,*
Can Induced Coherence without Induced Emission be Non-Quantum?,Mayukh Lahiri; Armin Hochrainer; Radek Lapkiewicz; Gabriela Barreto Lemos; Anton Zeilinger,Abstract: Interference of two beams produced at separate biphoton sources was firstobserved more than two decades ago. The phenomenon; often called" induced coherencewithout induced emission"; has recently gained attention after its applications to imaging;spectroscopy; and measuring biphoton correlations have been discovered. The sourcesused in the corresponding experiments are nonlinear crystals pumped by laser light. Theuse of a laser pump makes the occurrence of induced (stimulated) emission unavoidableand the effect of stimulated emission can be observed in the joint detection rate of the twobeams. This fact raises the question whether the stimulated emission also lays a role ininducing the coherence. Here we investigate a case in which the crystals are pumped with asingle-photon Fock state. We find that coherence is induced even though the possibility of …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.09974,2017,*

Erratum: Entanglement by Path Identity [Phys. Rev. Lett. 118; 080401 (2017)],Mario Krenn; Armin Hochrainer; Mayukh Lahiri; Anton Zeilinger,The statement that the experimental setup shown in Fig. 2 (a) in Chap. III of theSupplemental Material creates a fivedimensional six-photon GHZ state is incorrect; aspointed out to us by Xuemei Gu. Likewise; the generalization of that statement in the maintext for n≥ 5 photons with d≥ 3 dimensions is also incorrect.

Effects of Refraction and Reflection on Coherence Properties of Light,Mayukh Lahiri; Emil Wolf,Abstract: Partially coherent light beams are encountered both in classical and in quantumoptics. Their coherence properties generally depend on the correlation properties of theirsources. In this paper; we propose a technique for controlling the coherence properties ofoptical beams in laboratory environment. The technique is based on the fact that coherenceproperties of partially coherent electromagnetic beams can be changed on refraction and onreflection; and that the changes can be controlled by varying the angle of incidence.Subjects: Optics (physics. optics) Cite as: arXiv: 1210.3653 [physics. optics](or arXiv:1210.3653 v2 [physics. optics] for this version) Submission history From: Mayukh Lahiri [viewemail][v1] Fri; 12 Oct 2012 22: 43: 05 GMT (2882kb; D)[v2] Tue; 23 Oct 2012 17: 53: 06 GMT(2883kb; D),arXiv preprint arXiv:1210.3653,2012,*
Statistical Similarity and Complete Coherence in the Space-frequency Domain,Mayukh Lahiri; Emil Wolf,The classical theory of optical coherence describes the statistical behavior of optical fields andis formulated in terms of certain measurable correlation functions of the fluctuating field [1]. Notlong ago; a new viewpoint; based on the concept of so-called statistical similarity; has been introduced[2]; which elucidates the phenomenon of complete coherence. This concept is ratherremarkable; because it explains spatial coherence in terms of the non-measurable fluctuatingfield; rather than in terms of its measurable correlation functions. In this presentation we showthat an idea; which reflects the notion of “statistical similarity”; can be developed in thespace-frequency domain; and we illustrate its usefulness by an example. A randomly fluctuatingscalar field at a point P(r); at a time t; may be represented by a statistical ensemble {V (r; t)} ofcomplex fields [1]. We assume that the ensemble is statistically stationary; at least in the …,Frontiers in Optics,2011,*
Partial Polarization of Light in a Single-photon Interference Experiment,Mayukh Lahiri,Feynman [1] emphasized that the concept of wave-particle duality may be understood from aYoung's two-pinhole interference experiment. In such an experiment a photon may arrive at thedetector along two different paths. If one can determine which path the photon traveled; thenno interference fringe will be found (ie; the photon will show complete particle behavior). Onthe other hand; if one cannot obtain any information about the photon's path; then interferencefringes with unit visibility will be obtained (ie; the photon will show complete wave behavior);assuming that the intensities at the two pinholes are the same. In the intermediate case whenone has partial “which-path information” (WPI); fringes with visibility lesser than unity areobtained; even if the intensities at the two pinholes are equal. The relation between fringe visibilityand WPI has been investigated in Refs. [2]-[4]. It has been established that a quantitative …,Frontiers in Optics,2011,*
Quantum theory of optical coherence in the space-frequency domain,Mayukh Lahiri; Emil Wolf,Coherence theory is mainly concerned with the fundamental laws that govern the behavior offluctuating optical fields. Modern formulation of this subject is due to Frits Zernike [1]. Zernikequantified the ability of light to interfere by a quantity called the degree of coherence. He definedit in terms of the visibility (measure of sharpness) of the interference fringes produced in an Young'stwo-pinhole experiment. However; because Zernike's formulation did not take into account apossible time delay that may exist between the two interfering beams; his theory could not explainsome rather important coherence properties of light. Later; Zernike's formulation was generalizedby including the time delay into the analysis and it was shown that the corresponding correlationfunctions obeys certain propagation laws [2]. This formulation is known as the space-time formulationof optical coherence theory. Dirac's quantization of electromagnetic fields [3] made it …,CLEO: Science and Innovations,2011,*

APS Members,Mario Krenn; Xuemei Gu; Anton Zeilinger,We show a surprising link between experimental setups to realize high-dimensional multipartitequantum states and Graph Theory. In these setups; the paths of photons are identified such thatthe photon-source information is never created. We find that each of these setups correspondsto an undirected graph; and every undirected graph corresponds to an experimental setup. Everyterm in the emerging quantum superposition corresponds to a perfect matching in the graph.Calculating the final quantum state is in the complexity class \textsc{\#P-complete}; thus cannotbe done efficiently. To strengthen the link further; theorems from Graph Theory -- such as Hall'smarriage problem -- are rephrased in the language of pair creation in quantum experiments.We show explicitly how this link allows to answer questions about quantum experiments (suchas which classes of entangled states can be created) with graph theoretical methods …,*,*,*
