Superplume Metasomatism: Evidence from Siberian mantle xenoliths,Geoffrey Howarth; Peter Barry; John Pernet-Fisher; Ioannis Baziotis; Nikolay Pokhilenko; Lyudmila Pokhilenko; Robert Bodnar; Lawrence Taylor,Abstract The Siberian craton contains> 1000 kimberlite intrusions of various ages (Silurianto Jurassic); making it an ideal locality for a craton-wide study on the evolution of the sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM). The primary objective of this study is to characterizethe temporal and spatial metasomatic effects on the Siberian SCLM; focusing on themetasomatic imprint rendered by the Siberian superplume. We report new major-and trace-element mineral data for mantle peridotite xenoliths; obtained from the Late DevonianUdachnaya and the Late Jurassic Obnazhennaya kimberlites; which bracket the thermalclimax of the Siberian superplume.,Lithos,2014,50
The Tissint Martian meteorite as evidence for the largest impact excavation,Ioannis P. Baziotis; Yang Liu; Paul S. DeCarli; H. Jay Melosh; Harry Y. McSween; Robert J. Bodnar; Lawrence A. Taylor,Abstract High-pressure minerals in meteorites provide clues for the impact processes thatexcavated; launched and delivered these samples to Earth. Most Martian meteorites aresuggested to have been excavated from 3 to 7 km diameter impact craters. Here we showthat the Tissint meteorite; a 2011 meteorite fall; contains virtually all the high-pressurephases (seven minerals and two mineral glasses) that have been reported in isolatedoccurrences in other Martian meteorites. Particularly; one ringwoodite (75× 140 μm 2)represents the largest grain observed in all Martian samples. Collectively; the ubiquitoushigh-pressure minerals of unusually large sizes in Tissint indicate that shock metamorphismwas widely dispersed in this sample (~ 25 GPa and~ 2;000 C). Using the size and growthkinetics of the ringwoodite grains; we infer an initial impact crater with~ 90 km diameter …,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,2013,43
High-pressure/low-temperature metamorphism of basalts in Lavrion (Greece): implications for the preservation of peak metamorphic assemblages in blueschists and...,Ioannis Baziotis; Alexander Proyer; Evripidis Mposkos,Abstract The Upper Tectonic Unit of the Lavrion area is part of the Attic-Cycladic blueschistbelt and was affected by high-pressure; low-temperature metamorphism. Blueschists andgreenschists occur in the same outcrop and are believed to have experienced the samepressure–temperature (P–T) history which has been quantified using geothermobarometryand pseudosections for specific bulk-rock compositions. Calculated P–T conditions indicateminimum pressure of~ 0.9 GPa and temperature of~ 370° C for the peak of metamorphism.The prograde and retrograde paths followed a very similar low geothermal gradient (10–12°C/km) with cooling during decompression. Pseudosections show that both blueschists andgreenschists can exist stably at the metamorphic peak; the dominant amphibole being afunction of bulk composition: the blueschists; on average; have lower Mg# than the …,European Journal of Mineralogy,2009,26
Tracing high-pressure metamorphism in marbles: Phase relations in high-grade aluminous calcite–dolomite marbles from the Greek Rhodope massif in the system...,A Proyer; E Mposkos; I Baziotis; G Hoinkes,Abstract Four different types of parageneses of the minerals calcite; dolomite; diopside;forsterite; spinel; amphibole (pargasite);(Ti–) clinohumite and phlogopite were observed incalcite–dolomite marbles collected in the Kimi-Complex of the Rhodope MetamorphicProvince (RMP). The presence of former aragonite can be inferred from carbonateinclusions; which; in combination with an analysis of phase relations in the simplified systemCaO–MgO–Al 2 O 3–SiO 2–CO 2 (CMAS–CO 2) show that the mineral assemblagespreserved in these marbles most likely equilibrated at the aragonite–calcite transition;slightly below the coesite stability field; at ca. 720° C; 25 kbar and a CO 2~ 0.01. Thethermodynamic model predicts that no matter what activity of CO 2; garnet has to be presentin aluminous calcite–dolomite-marble at UHP conditions.,Lithos,2008,19
Pressure–temperature evolution of eclogites from the Kechros complex in the Eastern Rhodope (NE Greece),E Mposkos; I Baziotis; A Proyer,Abstract The Rhodope Domain in NE Greece consists of different tectonometamorphiccomplexes involved in the Alpine collisional history between the Eurasian and Africanplates. In the Kechros Complex; which is the lowermost tectonic unit in the East Rhodope; alense of kyanite eclogite occurs within orthogneiss and common eclogites are foundbetween serpentinized peridotite and underlying pelitic gneisses. In kyanite eclogite; thehigh-pressure (HP) mineral assemblage is Grt+ Omp (Jd 35–55)+ Ky+ Ph+ Qz+Rt+(indirectly inferred Tlc+ Law); a Na-rich tremolite and zoisite formed at or near peakmetamorphic conditions. In common eclogites; the HP mineral assemblage is Grt+ Omp(Jd29–41)+ Rt and; with less certainty; Amp (Gln-rich+ Brs+ Wnc+ Hbl)±Czo.

Origin of metabasites from upper tectonic unit of the Lavrion area (SE Attica; Greece): Geochemical implications for dual origin with distinct provenance of blueschist...,I Baziotis; E Mposkos,Abstract The Lavrion area forms the westernmost part of the Attic–Cycladic crystalline belt(ACCB) and is built up by two tectonic units metamorphosed at HP/LT conditions. In theUpper Tectonic Unit metabasic rocks occur as greenschists and blueschists. Major and traceelements plotted against Mg# show a systematic increase in TiO 2; Fe 2 O 3*; Na 2 O; Zr; Y;V; La and Yb and a decrease in Al 2 O 3; Ni and Cr with decreasing Mg#. Typically; theblueschists always exhibit a more evolved basaltic composition. The greenschists arecharacterized by LREE-depleted chondrite-normalized REE patterns and Zr/Nb values thatrange from 15 to 24. The blueschists are characterized by slightly LREE-enriched chondrite-normalized REE patterns and lower Zr/Nb ratios (6.6–11.3).

The applicationdepends on environmental concerns related to the chemical modification of the adsorbentand the release of toxic compounds from the loaded material to the soil or the water duringadsorption. The present work focused on the phosphate (PO 4-P) removal from aqueoussolutions under low P concentrations (0.5–10 mg/L) by using Ca (OH) 2-pretreated naturalzeolite (CaT-Z). As activation agent; Ca (OH) 2 presents benefits in terms of pretreatmentcosts and environmental impact of the applied adsorbent. The pretreatment of natural zeolite(clinoptilolite) with 0.25 mol/L Ca (OH) 2 led to an increase of P removal from 1.7 to 97.6% atinitial P concentration of 10 mg/L; pH 7 and 298 K.

The two metamorphic events are well imprinted in the mineralassemblages; mineral compositions and textural relationships of metapelites within theNestos Shear Zone in the Sidironero complex. The Jurassic event at HP-UHP metamorphicconditions is characterized by the mineral assemblage garnetkyanite-Ti-rich phengite at thepeak pressure. The Eocene metamorphic event at moderate HP conditions and minimumpressure> 0.9 GPa is characterized by the mineral assemblages St-Grt-Ms-Ky-Bt with garnetgrowth at the expense of kyanite or staurolite; and Grt-St-Ky-Bt with peak PT conditionswithin the St+ Bt+ Ky stability field.,Επιστημονική Επετηρίδα του Τμήματος Γεωλογίας (ΑΠΘ),2010,11

Geochemical investigation proclaims the tied genetic relationshipof the amphibolitized eclogites and the associated tonalitic–trondhjemitic dykes. The majorand trace element contents and rare earth element patterns of the amphibolitized eclogitesindicate formation of their protoliths by fractional crystallization of tholeiitic magmas in a back-arc environment. The tonalites and trondhjemites are characterized by moderate to high Srcontents (> 130 ppm); and low Y (< 8.2 ppm) and heavy rare earth element contents (Ybcontent of 0.19–0.88 ppm). The chemical composition of the tonalitic and trondhjemitic dykesare best explained by partial melting of a tholeiitic source like the amphibolitized eclogites …,International Journal of Earth Sciences,2008,11
Dolomitic marbles from the ultrahigh-pressure metamorphic Kimi complex in Rhodope; NE Greece,E Mposkos; I Baziotis; A Proyer; G Hoinkes,Summary Dolomitic marbles from the Organi and Pandrosos areas of the ultrahigh-pressure(UHP) metamorphic Kimi complex in East Rhodope; NE Greece have the mineralassemblage: Cal+ Dol+ Ol+ Phl±Di±Hbl±Spl±Ti–Chu+ retrograde Srp and Chl. Severalgenerations of calcite and dolomite with variable composition and texture represent differentstages of the P–T evolution: The first stage is represented by matrix dolomite(\rmX_\rmMgCO_3= 0.48) and relic domains of homogenous composition in matrix calcite(\rmX_\rmMgCO_3= 0.11–0.13); the second stage is evident from precipitation of lath-shaped and vermicular dolomite in matrix calcite. The third stage is represented by veinletsof almost pure CaCO 3 and domainal replacement of prior calcite by nearly pure CaCO 3+Ca-rich dolomite (\rmX_\rmMgCO_3= 0.34–0.43).

Petrogenesis of ultramafic rocks from the ultrahigh-pressure metamorphic Kimi Complex in Eastern Rhodope (NE Greece),I Baziotis; E Mposkos; Paul D Asimow,Abstract Widespread bodies of garnet–spinel metaperidotites with pyroxenitic layers occur inthe ultrahigh-pressure metamorphic Kimi Complex. In this study we address the origin ofsuch peridotite–pyroxenite associations in the context of polybaric melting regimes. Weconduct a detailed geochemical investigation of major and trace element relations andcompare them with a range of major element modelling scenarios. With increasing bulk-rockMgO content; the garnet–spinel metaperidotites exhibit decreasing CaO; Al2O3; TiO2; andNa2O along with increasing Ni and a gradually increasing Zr/Zr* anomaly; consistent with anorigin as residues after variable degrees of melt extraction.

Kylander-Clark; Rolf L. Romer,Abstract The specific chemical composition of monazite in shear zones is controlled by thesyndeformation dissolution–precipitation reactions of the rock-forming minerals. This relationcan be used for dating deformation; even when microfabric characteristics like shapepreferred orientation or intracrystalline deformation of monazite itself are missing. Monazitecontemporaneously formed in and around the shear zones may have different compositions.These depend on the local chemical context rather than reflecting successive crystallizationepisodes of monazite. This is demonstrated in polymetamorphic; mylonitic high-pressure(HP) garnet–kyanite granulites of the Alpine Sidironero Complex (Rhodope UHP terrain;Northern Greece). The studied mylonitic rocks escaped from regional migmatization at 40–36 Ma and from subsequent shearing through cooling until 36 Ma. In-situ laser-ablation …,Lithos,2015,8

Physico-chemical properties of different carbonate rocks: are they highly enough to control lime reactivity?,Ioannis Baziotis; George Leontakianakos; Alexander Proyer; Heesoo Lee; Stamatios Tsimas,Abstract We have examined 5 different carbonate rocks in order to study their behaviorduring calcination at different temperatures (900; 1050 and 12000C for 30 min) andhydration properties of quick limes and the final interconnection of the primary material withthe reactivity of the slaked lime. Quick limes calcined at 9000C show the lower reactivityvalues. This could be related to the low calcination temperature or to the short calcinationtime of 30 min which was insufficient to produce enough lime. The samples calcined attemperatures of 12000C are less reactive compared to those calcined at 10500C; indicatedby parameters such as the (CaO+ MgO) Lime; the time required to reach the temperaturemaximum and the reactivity rate. This; probably could be due to annealing effects such ascrystal coarsening and reduction of porosity at relatively high temperatures.,International Journal of Chemistry,2011,7
Metamorphic reprocessing of a serpentinized carbonate-bearing peridotite after detachment from the mantle wedge: AP–T path constrained from textures and phase...,E Mposkos; I Baziotis; A Proyer,Abstract In the central Rhodope mountains of Greece a carbonate-bearing metaperidotitelens∼ 200× 500 m in size crops out as part of the high-to ultrahigh-pressure metamorphicUpper Sidironero Complex∼ 500 m SE of the Gorgona Village; north of Xanthi town.

Petrography and geochemistry of the enriched basaltic shergottite Northwest Africa 2975,Qi He; Long Xiao; J Brian Balta; Ioannis P Baziotis; Weibiao Hsu; Yunbin Guan,Abstract We present a study of the petrology and geochemistry of basaltic shergottiteNorthwest Africa 2975 (NWA 2975). NWA 2975 is a medium-grained basalt with subophiticto granular texture. Electron microprobe (EMP) analyses show two distinct pyroxenecompositional trends and patchy compositional zoning patterns distinct from those observedin other meteorites such as Shergotty or QUE 94201. As no bulk sample was available to usfor whole rock measurements; we characterized the fusion crust and its variability bysecondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS) measurements and laser ablation inductivelycoupled plasma spectroscopy (LA-ICP-MS) analyses as a best-available proxy for the bulkrock composition. The fusion crust major element composition is comparable to the bulkcomposition of other enriched basaltic shergottites; placing NWA 2975 within that sample …,Meteoritics & Planetary Science,2015,6

These minerals decomposed to a texturally complex set of secondary mineralsduring subsequent stages of retrograde metamorphism. The reactions involve severalgenerations of geikielite-ilmenite as well as zirconolite [(Ca; Th; U) Zr (Ti; Fe; Nb; Ta) 2O7];kassite/cafetite [CaTi2O4 (OH) 2/CaTi2O5· H2O]; Ti-bearing humite group minerals;thorianite; and sometimes euxenite [(Ca; U; Th; REE)(Nb; Ta; Ti) 2 (O; OH) 6]. Stablecoexistence of zircon and olivine is observed and stably coexisting titanite with olivineand/or humite-group minerals is reported here for the first time outside of carbonatites;kimberlites; or lamprophyres.

Mineral chemistry of the Tissint meteorite: Indications of two‐stage crystallization in a closed system,Yang Liu; Ioannis P Baziotis; Paul D Asimow; Robert J Bodnar; Lawrence A Taylor,Abstract The Tissint meteorite is a geochemically depleted; olivine-phyric shergottite. Olivinemegacrysts contain 300–600 μm cores with uniform Mg#(~ 80±1) followed by concentriczones of Fe-enrichment toward the rims. We applied a number of tests to distinguish therelationship of these megacrysts to the host rock. Major and trace element compositions ofthe Mg-rich core in olivine are in equilibrium with the bulk rock; within uncertainty; and rareearth element abundances of melt inclusions in Mg-rich olivines reported in the literature aresimilar to those of the bulk rock. Moreover; the P Kα intensity maps of two large olivine grainsshow no resorption between the uniform core and the rim. Taken together; these lines ofevidence suggest the olivine megacrysts are phenocrysts. Among depleted olivine-phyricshergottites; Tissint is the first one that acts mostly as a closed system with olivine …,Meteoritics & Planetary Science,2016,4

Asimow,Abstract The whole-rock chemistry of eclogites; partially amphibolitized eclogites; and dykeamphibolites from the metamorphic Kechros complex in the eastern Rhodope Mountainspreserves evidence of the geodynamic framework for the origin of their protoliths. Major andtrace-element concentrations define two distinct protolith groups for the eclogites. The low-Fe–Ti (LFT) eclogites have low-TiO 2 content (< 0.67 wt%); negative high field strengthelement anomalies; and variable enrichments in large ion lithophile elements (LILE). Therare earth element (REE) patterns are characterized by strong light-REE (LREE) enrichmentand heavy-REE (HREE) depletion. The high-Fe–Ti (HFT) eclogites have small to moderateLILE enrichment and lack Nb anomalies.

Raman microspectroscopy of carbonaceous material using the 633 nm line of a He–Ne laser: application to the metamorphic rocks of Attica,I Baziotis; E Mposkos; N Skarpelis,Raman spectra data of carbonaceous material (RSCM) from low-grade metamorphic rocksof Attica allows the application of a modified empirical RSCM thermometer. Previous Ramanstudies of carbonaceous material from regionally metamorphosed rocks have focused onthe dependence of graphitization on temperature using laser sources with 514.5 nm; 532nmand 785nm (Beyssac et al. 2002; Tice et al. 2004; Rahl et al. 2005). We have performedRaman spectral analyses using the 632.817 nm line of a He-Ne laser. For the calibrationprocedure; independent thermobarometric methods were applied. The samples werecalibrated for the temperature range 250-5500C. The R1 (D1/G) H ranges between 3.22 and0.12 and the R2 [D1/(D1+ D2+ G) A] between 0.73 and 0.10; both ratios decrease withtemperature.

Amphibole zonation as a tool for tracing metamorphic histories: examples from Lavrion and Penteli metamorphic core complexes,Ioannis Baziotis; Alexander Proyer; Evripides Mposkos; Antonios Marsellos; George Leontakianakos,The amphiboles represent the predominant minerals in high pressure/low temperaturemetamafic rocks. Amphibole composition (eg cations Si; Al; Na) depends on the bulkcomposition; the solid solution's gaps and the PT conditions during metamorphism. The AlIV;NaA and Ti increase with temperature; whereas AlV I and NaB with pressure (Triboulet;1992). Increase of Si+ 4 and decrease of AlV I and (NaA+ NaB) in clinoamphibole isconcurrent with pressure decrease. We focus on Na-and Ca-amphiboles from greenschistsand blueschists from Lavrion (upper tectonic unit-UTU) and Penteli (lower tectonic unit-LTU)metamorphic complexes (Baziotis et al. 2009; Baziotis & Mposkos; 2011) in order to unravelthe relation of zonation with:(1) the physicochemical conditions and (2) the PT stages duringmetamorphic evolution.

Assessment of the quality of calcination of marbles from Thassos Island using Raman Spectroscopy and X-Ray Diffraction,G Leontakianakos; I Baziotis; E Profitis; E Chatzitheodoridis; S Tsimas,Abstract The degree of calcination of a dolomitic and a calcitic marble from Thassos Island;was investigated; by combining both Raman spectroscopy (RS) and X-Ray diffraction (XRD)techniques. The samples were prepared in isometric 2 cm cubes and calcined at threedifferent temperatures; 900; 1050 and 1200 0C for 2 hours in order to produce quick lime.RS was applied at the lime sample's surface and inner (near core) part after gently crushing.XRD was applied on the bulk rock specimens in order to verify the transformation processduring heating of the raw material. Quality control of the applied calcination procedure isprovided through the hydration of quick lime. The rise in solution temperature suggests thechemical “reactivity” of the produced slaked lime.

Sorption mechanism (s) of orthophosphate onto Ca (OH) 2 pretreated bentonite,Giorgos Markou; Vassilis J Inglezakis; Dimitris Mitrogiannis; Ilias Efthimiopoulos; Maria Psychoyou; Petros Koutsovitis; Koenraad Muylaert; Ioannis Baziotis,Bentonite was chemically pretreated with Ca (OH) 2 to enhance orthophosphatephosphorus (OPP) sorption capacity (qe). The pretreatment resulted in an increase of qefrom about 0.3 mg P per g to about 8 mg P per g at pH 7 and 25° C; and of OPPconcentration 100 mg P per L. The effects of solution pH; OPP concentration; sorbentdosage; and temperature on OPP sorption onto pretreated bentonite were investigated. Thevariation of initial pH (4–9) did not affect qe; however; re-adjustment of the final pH showedthat the variation of the final pH had a significant positive effect on qe. The sorption kineticsshowed a low rate; reaching half of qe in the first 4 h and equilibrium after 96 h. Thecalculated Langmuir qmax was 11.68 mg P per g. Thermodynamic analysis suggests thatthe sorption process is spontaneous and endothermic. Desorption of OPP was high in …,RSC Advances,2016,2

Ιnfluence of natural water composition on reactivity of quicklimes derived from Ca-rich and Mg-rich limestones; implications for sustainability of lime manufacturing th...,George Geontakianakos; Ioannis Baziotis; Vassilis Stathopoulos; Zacharenia Kypritidou; Lefteris Profitis; Elias ; Chatzitheodoridis; Stamatis Tsimas,We studied the effects of water quality on the hydration of quicklimes prepared from calciticlimestone and dolomitic limestone during calcination at 1050° C. At a low total chloride andsulfate content; reactivity is insensitive to concentration and no effect on quicklime slaking isseen. At higher concentrations; however; we observe a chromatographic effect for chloridesand sulfates. Concentrated chlorides react with the slaking water; forming products such asCaCl2 that are much more soluble than Ca (OH) 2; which facilitates transformation ofquicklime to slaked lime. In the range of sulfate concentrations in natural waters weobserved no effect of sulfates during quicklime hydration. Consequently; in natural watersand their mixtures (conductivity< 2600 μS cm− 1); only chloride concentrations are found topromote quicklime hydration.

In recent work; using detailed petrography; electron microprobemethod; micro-Raman Spectroscopy on serial sections; we investigated the presence ofhigh-pressure (Hi-P) polymorphs occurring in impact-melt pockets throughout our 10 gmsample. Based upon the static and dynamic phase experimentation; we reconstructed thePTt conditions for the formation of these many polymorphs (Baziotis et al.; 2012; NatureComm.). Tissint is an olivine-phyric shergottite; with large olivine grains (2000 C.Furthermore; the large size of ringwoodite in Tissint likely reflects prolonged shockdurations.

Amphibole chemistry from the Penteli metamorphic core complex: implication for the metamorphic evolution of eastern Attica,I. Baziotis; E Mposkos; G. Leontakianakos,The amphiboles represent one of the predominant minerals of HP/LT metabasites. Theircomposition depends on the effective bulk composition; the solid solution's gaps and the PTconditions during the various metamorphic stages. The distribution of the cations Si; Al andNa; at the crystal sites of the amphibole crystals is mainly controlled by the physicochemicalconditions during their crystallization. The Al2O3 content is tightly connected with pressureand temperature increase. The AlIV and NaA increase are related with temperature increasewhereas that of AlV I and NaB with pressure one. In particular; the Na-rich amphibolezonation is expressed in terms of AlIV; AlV I; Fe+ 2; Fe+ 3; NaB and (Na+ K) A. Increase ofSi+ 4 and decrease of AlV I and (NaA+ NaB) is concurrent with pressure decrease.

Petrology and geochemistry of eclogites from the Kechros Metamorphic Complex in eastern Rhodope (NE Greece),Evripides Mposkos; Ioannis Baziotis; Paul Asimow,The Rhodope Metamorphic Province (RMP) is one of the major tectonic units in northernGreece. It consists of different tectonometamorphic complexes involved in the Alpinecollisional history between the Eurasian and African plates. In eastern Rhodope a JurassicUHP metamorphism is documented in the uppermost Kimi Complex by the presence ofmicrodiamond inclusions in garnets from pelitic gneisses (Mposkos and Kostopoulos 2001).Partially or completely amphibolitized eclogites are common recording PT conditions> 1.8GPa and 7500C for the eclogitic stage and 1.5 GPa and 8200C for an early stage ofexhumation (Bauer et al. 2007).,Geophysical Research Abstracts,2010,1

Geochemistry of the Serifos calc-alkaline granodiorite pluton; Greece: constraining the crust and mantle contributions to I-type granitoids,C Stouraiti; I Baziotis; PD Asimow; H Downes,Abstract The Late Miocene (11.6–9.5 Ma) granitoid intrusion on the island of Serifos(Western Cyclades; Aegean Sea) is composed of syn-to post-tectonic granodiorite withquartz monzodiorite enclaves; cut by dacitic and aplitic dikes. The granitoid; a typical I-typemetaluminous calcic amphibole-bearing calc-alkaline pluton; intruded the CycladicBlueschists during thinning of the Aegean plate. Combining field; textural; geochemical andnew Sr–Nd–O isotope data presented in this paper; we postulate that the Serifos intrusion isa single-zoned pluton.

Ultramafic lavas and high-Mg basaltic dykes from the Othris ophiolite complex; Greece,Ioannis Baziotis; Maria Economou-Eliopoulos; Paul D Asimow,Abstract We evaluate the petrography and geochemistry of an unusual suite of subduction-related Phanerozoic high-MgO rocks from the Othris ophiolite complex in Greece; some ofwhich have previously been described as komatiitic lavas. In particular; we study ultramafic;olivine-phyric lavas from the Agrilia area and high-Mg basaltic dykes from the Pournari area.We seek to define primary magmatic MgO contents and initial liquidus temperatures as wellas the differentiation sequence and cooling rates experienced by the lavas and dykes. Oneof our goals is to relate the Othris case to known komatiite and boninite occurrences and toaddress whether Othris documents an important new constraint on the temporal evolution ofambient mantle temperature; plume-related magmatism; and subduction of oceaniclithosphere.

Geochemical models of melting and magma storage conditions for basalt lava from Santorini Volcano; Greece,Ioannis Baziotis; Jun-Ichi Kimura; Avgoustinos Pantazidis; Stephan Klemme; Jasper Berndt; Paul Asimow,Abstract Santorini volcano sits 150 km above the Wadati-Benioff zone of the Aegean arc;where the African plate subducts northward beneath the Eurasian continent (Papazachos etal. 2000). Santorini volcano has a long history: activity started ca. 650 ka (mainly rhyolitesand rhyodacites); with active pulses following ca. 550 ka (basalt to rhyodacite) and ca. 360ka (large explosive eruptions of andesite to rhyodacite and minor basalt); culminating in thecaldera-forming Bronze-age Minoan event (Druitt et al. 1999). As in many arc volcanoes;scenarios of fractional crystallization with or without mixing between felsic and maficmagmas have been proposed to explain the compositions; textures; and eruptive styles ofSantorini products (eg; Huijsmans & Barton 1989; Montazavi & Sparks 2004; Andújar et al.2015).

Ultramafic lavas and pyroxene-spinifex high-Mg basaltic dykes from the Othris ophiolite complex; Greece,Ioannis Baziotis; Maria Economou-Eliopoulos; Paul Asimow,Abstract This study aims to constrain the physico-chemical conditions and processesassociated with the origin of ultramafic lavas of the Agrilia formation and high-Mg basalticdykes in the Pournari area within the Othris ophiolite complex; a supra-subduction zoneophiolite of Mesozoic age (Paraskevopoulos & Economou; 1986; Barth et al.; 2008). Hand-sample-scale spinifex texture is lacking from the ultramafic lavas and; despite whole-rockMgO contents greater than 31 wt.%; we infer an upper bound of 17 wt.% MgO for the eruptedliquid; and thus identify these lavas as picrites containing accumulated olivine. We usetextural and compositional criteria to divide the crystals within the Agrilia lavas between pre-eruptive and post-eruptive growth phases.

P-Rich Olivines in the Impact Melt Lithology of the Chelyabinsk Meteorite. In,Ioannis Baziotis; Ludovic Ferrière; Paul D. Asimow; Dan Topa; Franz Brandstätter,Introduction: There has recently been widespread interest in the use of phosphorus (P); amoderately incompatible and very slowly diffusing element; to constrain the history ofmineral growth and timescales of petrogenetic processes. The low diffusivity of P in meltleads to complex growth zoning in olivine; and the low diffusivity in olivine then allows thepreservation of such zoning over magmatic residence times and high temperatures. P-richsilicates; especially olivine; have been found in many terrestrial and extraterrestrial rocks.However; various factors can affect P concentration in silicates; including (among others)nonequilibrium incorporation; melt composition; temperature; oxygen fugacity; and apatitesaturation.

PHOSPHORUS ZONING FROM SECONDARY OLIVINE IN MANTLE XENOLITH FROM MIDDLE ATLAS MOUNTAINS (MOROCCO; AFRICA): IMPLICATIONS FOR...,K Mavrogonatos; S Flemetakis; A Papoutsa; S Klemme; J Berndt; G Economou; A Pantazidis; I Baziotis; PD Asimow,Abstract Mantle xenolith samples in contact with basalt flows were collected from theTafraoute maar in Morocco. Discrete melt veins are present in one xenolith sample;crosscutting primary layering and foliation. We used both optical microscopy and electronmicroprobe analysis to characterize the glasses and minerals in the melt veins. The meltveins consist of glass and crystals of olivine; clinopyroxene; plagioclase; spinel and apatite.The olivine in the melt veins is quite distinct from the same mineral within the matrix due toits characteristic P-enriched rims (up to 0.3 wt.%). Correlations between Al and P; as well asexperimentally determined partition coefficient for P; point towards non-equilibriumpartitioning during rapid crystal growth at the end of crystallization.,Bulletin of the Geological Society of Greece,2016,*

THEORICAL OBSERVATIONS OF THE ICE FILLED CRATERS ON MARTIAN MOON DEIMOS,Ioannis P. Baziotis,Abstract: For decades mankind has envisioned a manned mission to Mars. Some plansinitiated the concept that using Martian Moon Deimos as a possible stepping stone to Mars.However; within the last several decades one of the questions that has evaded scientists is:”Does Deimos have any ice upon it's surface and/or in it's craters?” Why? Because ice is aform of water; and water as far as outer space is concerned in the number one most preciousresource. Not only because water is a fundamental essential for sustaining life; but it is alsonecessary for producing rocket fuel. However; one of the foremost problems in being able toascertain if there is any water on Deimos is the fact that the closest images ever taken ofDeimos last occurred when the Voyager 2 Orbiter mission was able to take some images ofthe surface of Deimos as close as 30 km.

A case study of different limestones during quick lime and slaked-lime production,G Leontakianakos; I Baziotis; G Ekonomou; G Delagrammatikas; CT Galbenis; S Tsimas,Abstract We have examined 5 different limestones in order to study their behavior i) duringcalcination at different temperatures (900; 1050 and 1200 C for 30 min) and ii) afterhydration of quick limes derived to slaked lime. Quick limes calcined at 900 C show thelower reactivity values. This could be related to the low calcination temperature or to theshort calcination time of 30 min which was unable to produce enough lime. The samplescalcined at temperatures of 1200 C are less reactive compared to the hydrated limes whichwere prepared by hydration of quick lime calcined at 1050 C; indicating by parameters suchas the (CaO+ MgO) Lime; the time required to become the temperature maximum and thereactivity rate. These; probably could be due to crystal growth at relative high temperatures.,*,2010,*
RECORD OF TW O ALPINE HIGH-P M ETAM ORPHIC EVENTS IN THE TITAROS OPHIOLITE COM PLEX OF THE PELAGONIAN ZONE (GREECE),E Mposkos; I Baziotis; A andKrohe,Abstract: W e present new petrological data of the Titaros ophiolite complex and discusstheir significance for the Alpine geodynamic evolution in the Pelagonian realm. There aretwo Alpine high-P metamorphic stages. The first stage; at pressures between 0.8-1.4 GPaand minimum temperatures 570-6100C occurred in late Jurassic/early Cretaceous and isassociated with the obduction of the ophiolite complexes onto the Pelagonian crust. At thisstage the Titaros ophiolite was subducted together with crustal rocks of the Pelagonian zoneas a result of tectonic erosion of the ophiolite margin. The second stage occurred in theEocene at much lower temperatures (about 4000C and minimum pressure~ 0.7 GPa). It isinterpreted to reflect the final closure of the Vardar-Axios ocean and collision/underthrustingof the Apulia microcontinent under Europe.,*,2010,*
PETROLOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY OF GARNET-SPINEL METAPERIDOTITES AND ASSOCIATED SPINEL-GARNET CLINOPYROXENITES FROM THE UHP KIM...,E MPOSKOS; I BAZIOTIS; S PALIKARI; M PERRAKI; A DIAMANTOPOULOS,Abstract. The garnet-spinel metaperidotites of ultra-high pressure metamorphic KimiComplex from the Rhodope Metamorphic Province represent a segment of convectingasthenosphere into the mantle wedge. It was primarily garnetperidotite equilibrated duringascent first into the expanded stability field of garnet-chromian spinel peridotite at T>12000C and 30 kbar. The associated spinel-garnet pyroxenites represent primary HPmagmatic rocks crystallized from melts within the stability field of garnet pyroxenite.Decompression and substantial cooling of both rock types occurred at depth up to~ 15 kbarand 750-7650C; within the Cr-spinel peridotite/garnet pyroxenite stability field. Major; traceand REE geochemistry indicates that the peridotites are residues from varying degrees ofpartial melting (< 35%). The associated garnet pyroxenites are frozen melts; derived from …,*,2006,*

BEACHROCKS CEMENT CHARACTERISTICS AND CONDITIONS OF FORMATION. CASE STUDY PLATANIAS BEACH; CHANIA; GREECE,A Petropoulos; I Baziotis; Ch Anagnostou; N Evelpidou,Abstract Beachrocks represents a coastal deposition in the intertidal area; and studying theirproperties may lead to create a model which identifies the conditions of their formation(paleo-environment). This paper focuses most intently on the cement material which is ableto recover the paleo-environment conditions during diagenesis of such coastal sediment.We used optical microscopy; secondary electron microscopy and Raman Spectroscopy tocharacterize the cement texture; mineralogy and chemistry in the beachrocks. The existenceof pure calcite primarily controlled by the meteorite water; while Mg-calcite appears betweenthe lowermeteoric and the upper marine phreatic zone. Finally; the presence of aragoniteassociated with the marine phreatic to lower marine vadose environment.,Bulletin of the Geological Society of Greece,*,*
