The D 0 (D 0) spectrumcovers a transverse momentum (p T) range of 0.1< p T< 3 G e V/c; whereas the electronspectra cover a range of 1< p T< 4 G e V/c. The electron spectra show approximate binarycollision scaling between p+ p and d+ A u collisions. From these two independent analyses;the differential cross section per nucleon-nucleon binary interaction at midrapidity for opencharm production from d+ A u collisions at BNL RHIC is d σ cc NN/dy= 0.30±0.04 (stat)±0.09(syst) m b.

A time-of-flight detector based on multi-gap resistive platechamber technology is used for particle identification. The particle-species dependence ofthe Cronin effect is observed to be significantly smaller than that at lower energies. The ratioof the nuclear modification factor (R d Au) between protons (p+ p¯) and charged hadrons (h)in the transverse momentum range 1.2< p T< 3.0 GeV/c is measured to be 1.19±0.05(stat)±0.03 (syst) in minimum-bias collisions and shows little centrality dependence. Theyield ratio of (p+ p¯)/h in minimum-bias d+ Au collisions is found to be a factor of 2 lowerthan that in Au+ Au collisions; indicating that the Cronin effect alone is not enough toaccount for the relative baryon enhancement observed in heavy ion collisions at RHIC.,Physics Letters B,2005,219

At intermediate transversemomentum (p T from 1.5–5 GeV/c); the 62.4 GeV v 2 (p T) and v 4 (p T) values are consistentwith the quark-number scaling first observed at 200 GeV.

Resonance decay effects on anisotropy parameters,Xin Dong; S Esumi; P Sorensen; Nu Xu; Z Xu,Abstract We present the elliptic flow v 2 of pions produced from resonance decays. Thetransverse momentum p T spectra of the parent particles are taken from thermal model fitsand their v 2 are fit under the assumption that they follow a number-of-constituent-quark(NCQ) scaling law expected from quark-coalescence models. The v 2 of pions fromresonance particle decays is found to be similar to the measured pion v 2. We also proposethe measurement of electron v 2 as a means to extract open-charm v 2 and investigatewhether a thermalized system of quasi-free quarks and gluons (a quark–gluon plasma) iscreated in collisions of Au nuclei at RHIC.,Physics Letters B,2004,153
Extensive particle identification with TPC and TOF at the STAR experiment,Ming Shao; Olga Barannikova; Xin Dong; Yuri Fisyak; Lijuan Ruan; Paul Sorensen; Zhangbu Xu,Abstract Particle identification (PID) capabilities are studied by using the Time ProjectionChamber (TPC) and a Time-Of-Flight (TOF) detector together at STAR. The identificationcapability of charged hadrons is greatly extended compared with that achieved by TPC andTOF separately. Particle spectra from p+ p; d+ Au collisions at s NN= 200 GeV and Au+ Aucollisions at s NN= 62.4 GeV are used to develop the methods. The transverse momentum(p T) ranges of π; and p (p¯) identification are from∼ 0.3 GeV/c to∼ 10 GeV/c. The high p Treach is limited by statistics in current data sets. An important conceptual advance wasdeveloped to identify electrons by using a combination of d E/dx in TPC and velocityinformation from the TOF detectors; which is important for future low-mass dilepton programat STAR.,Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators; Spectrometers; Detectors and Associated Equipment,2006,141

The D 0 meson yields in central Au+ Au collisions are strongly suppressedcompared to those in p+ p scaled by N bin; for transverse momenta p T> 3 GeV/c;demonstrating significant energy loss of charm quarks in the hot and dense medium.

Systematic measurements of the dielectron yield as afunction of transverse momentum (p T) and collision centrality show an enhancementcompared to a cocktail simulation of hadronic sources in the low invariant-mass region (Mee< 1 GeV/c 2). This enhancement cannot be reproduced by the ρ-meson vacuum spectralfunction.

Suppression of nonphotonic electrons from enhancement of charm baryons in heavy ion collisions,P Sorensen; X Dong,Abstract In Au+ Au collisions at 2< p T< 6 GeV/c baryon production is enhanced compared top+ p collisions. Since charm baryon decays produce electrons less frequently than charmmeson decays; the nonphotonic electron spectrum is sensitive to the Λ c/D ratio. In thisreport we study the dependence of the nonphotonic electron spectrum on the baryon-to-meson ratio for charm hadrons. As an example; we take the Λ c/D ratio to have the sameform as the Λ/KS 0 ratio. In this case; even if the total charm quark yield in Au+ Au collisionsscales with the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions (N bin); the electron spectrum at2< p T< 5 GeV/c is suppressed by as much as 20% relative to N bin scaled p+ p collisions.,Physical Review C,2006,46

Electrons triggered andidentified by the Barrel Electro-Magnetic Calorimeter (BEMC); pure protons (anti-protons)and pions from Λ (Λ¯); and KS 0 decays are used to obtain the dE/dx value and its width atgiven β γ= p/m. We found that the deviation of the dE/dx from the Bichsel function can be upto 0.4 σ (∼ 3%) in p+ p collisions at s NN= 200 GeV taken and subsequently calibrated inyear 2005. The deviation is approximately a function of β γ independent of particle speciesand can be described with the function f (x)= A+ B/(C+ x 2).

The freeze-outcontributions from vector mesons are also taken into account. The space-time evolution isdescribed by a 2+ 1 dimensional ideal hydrodynamic model.

This detector is fully integrated into the STAR trigger systemand provides the primary input to the minimum-bias trigger in Au+ Au collisions. Theinformation from the detector is used both in the STAR Level-0 trigger and offline to measurethe location of the primary collision vertex along the beam pipe and the event “start time”needed by other fast-timing detectors in STAR. The offline timing resolution of singledetector channels in full-energy Au+ Au collisions is~ 100 ps; resulting in a start timeresolution of a few tens of picoseconds and a resolution on the primary vertex location of~ 1cm.,Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators; Spectrometers; Detectors and Associated Equipment,2014,26

Stopping effects in U+ U collisions with a beam energy of 520 MeV/nucleon,Xiao-Feng Luo; Xin Dong; Ming Shao; Ke-Jun Wu; Cheng Li; Hong-Fang Chen; Hu-Shan Xu,Abstract A relativistic transport model (ART1. 0) is applied to simulate the stopping effects intip-tip and body-body U+ U collisions; at a beam kinetic energy of 520 MeV/nucleon. Oursimulation results have demonstrated that both central collisions of the two extremeorientations can achieve full stopping and also form a bulk of hot; dense nuclear matter witha sufficiently large volume and long duration; because of the largely deformed uraniumnuclei. The nucleon sideward flow in the tip-tip collisions is nearly three times larger thanthat in body-body ones at the normalized impact parameter b/b max< 0. 5; and that the body-body central collisions have a large negative nucleon elliptic flow v 2=− 12% in contrast tozero in tip-tip ones. Thus the extreme circumstance and the novel experimental observablesin tip-tip and body-body collisions can provide a good condition and sensitive probe for …,Physical Review C,2007,22

The equation of state study in UU collisions at CSR; Lanzhou,ZG Xiao; X Dong; F Liu; XF Luo; KJ Wu; HS Xu; N Xu; WL Zhan,Abstract The cooling storage ring; to be built at Lanzhou; will be able to deliver heavy ionbeams up to uranium up to 0.52 GeV/u. It is expected to make considerable contribution tonuclear EOS study in the high net baryon-density region. With a relativistic transport model;we performed simulations for U+ U collisions with different orientations. It is shown that bycombining the forward neutron multiplicity and an event-wise elliptic flow selection; it ispossible to identify the tip–tip and body–body head-on collisions. The effective identificationof these two extreme configurations will allow us to study the EOS at the highest baryondensity in the U+ U collisions.,Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics,2007,11

Hadronic Trigger using electromagnetic calorimeter and particle identification at high-pT with STAR Detector,Hongyu Da; Xiangli Cui; Gene Van Buren; JC Dunlop; Xin Dong; Lijuan Ruan; Anthony Timmins; Zebo Tang; Xiaolian Wang; Yichun Xu; Zhangbu Xu,Abstract: We derive a new method to improve the statistics of identified particles at hightransverse momentum (\pt) using online-triggered events by the Barrel Electro-Magnetic-Calorimeter (BEMC) detector. The BEMC is used to select hadronic interaction and energydeposit from showers created by charged hadrons ($\pi^{\pm}; K^{\pm} $ and $ p $($\bar {p}$)) in the BEMC. With this trigger; the statistics of the high\pt particles are significantlyenhanced by about a factor of 100 with selection efficiency up to 20%. In addition; resonantstates ($\rho^ 0$; $ K^{\star} $) and weak-decay V0 (\Ks and\La (\aLa)) can be constructedby selecting the BEMC-trigger hadron as one of its daughters. We also show that the triggerefficiency can be obtained reliably in simulation and data-driven approaches.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1112.2946,2011,4
Improvement of resonance reconstruction with time-of-flight detector at STAR experiment,Yichun Xu; Xin Dong; Ziping Zhang; Zebo Tang; Ming Shao,Abstract With the upgrade of the barrel Time-Of-Flight (TOF) detector; based on Multi-gapResistive Plate Chamber technology; the particle identification capability of the STARexperiment will be improved greatly. In order to further understand the performance of TOFmore practically; vector meson φ (1020) and K*(892) are reconstructed from their two-charged-particle decay mode using the data generated from Au+ Au collisions at s NN= 200GeV. With the TOF to identify one of the two charged-daughter particles; the resonancesignificance could be increased by 2–4 times; compared to the identification of two charged-daughter particles using the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) only. This promisingperformance on resonance reconstruction from the TOF will enhance the measurements ofshort lived particles at RHIC.,Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators; Spectrometers; Detectors and Associated Equipment,2008,3
Single Electron Transverse Momentum and Azimuthal Anisotropy Distributions: Charm Hadron Production at RHIC,Xin Dong,Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is a basic gauge field theory to describe stronginteractions. Lattice QCD calculations predict a phase transition from hadronic matter to adeconfined; locally thermalized Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) state at high temperature andsmall baryon density. Plenty of exciting results from RHIC experiments in the first three yearshave demonstrated that a hot dense matter with strong collective motion which cannot bedescribed with hadronic degrees of freedom was created at RHIC. Charm quarks arebelieved to be mostly created from initial gluon fusion in heavy ion collisions. Since they aremassive; charm hadrons are proposed to be ideal probes to study the early stage dynamicsin heavy ion collisions.,arXiv preprint nucl-ex/0509011,2005,3
A study of charm quark correlations in ultra-relativistic $ p $+ $ p $ collisions with PYTHIA,Shusu Shi; Xin Dong; Mustafa Mustafa,Abstract: Measurements of heavy flavor quark (charm and bottom) correlations in heavy ioncollisions are instrumental to understand the flavor dependence of energy loss mechanismsin hot and dense QCD media. Experimental measurements of these correlations in baseline$ p $+ $ p $ collisions are crucial to understand the contributions of perturbative and non-perturbative QCD processes to the correlation functions and further help in interpretingcorrelation measurements in heavy ion collisions. In this paper; we investigate $ D $-$\bar{D} $ meson correlations and $ D $ with one particle from $ D $ meson decay daughtercorrelations using PYTHIA Event Generator in $ p $+ $ p $ collisions at $\sqrt {s} $= 200; 500and 5500 GeV. Charm/bottom events are found to contribute mainly to the away side/nearside pattern of $ D $-electron correlations; respectively. In the energy region of RHIC; $ D …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1507.00614,2015,2

Alignment calibration and performance study of the STAR PXL detector,Long Ma; Xin Dong; Hao Qiu; Spiros Margetis; Yu-Gang Ma,Abstract We report in this paper the alignment calibration of the STAR pixel detector (PXL)prototype for the RHIC 2013 run and performance study of the full PXL detector installed andcommissioned in the RHIC 2014 run. PXL detector is the innermost two silicon layers of theSTAR heavy flavor tracker aiming at high-precision reconstruction of secondary decay vertexof heavy flavor particles. To achieve the physics goals; the calibration work was done on thedetector with high precision.

Heavy quark results from STAR,Xin Dong,Abstract I report the most recent measurements on open heavy flavor production at RHIC onbehalf of the STAR collaboration. The total charm production cross section in midrapidity atRHIC energy is found to approximately scale by number of binary collisions in d+ Au; Cu+Cu and Au+ Au collisions. The nuclear modification factor of non-photonic electrons isstrongly suppressed in central Au+ Au collisions; suggesting substantial heavy quark energyloss at RHIC. The bottom decay contribution to non-photonic electrons was studied via the e–h and e–D 0 azimuthal angular correlations. The bottom contribution is found to be importantat p T> 5 GeV/c; and is consistent with the FONLL calculation within uncertainties. Charmproduction through gluon jet splitting was measured by studying the D*±contents in the fullyreconstructed jets in p+ p collisions. This rate is consistent with pQCD evaluation of gluon …,The European Physical Journal C,2009,1
Study on MRPC-TOF timing properties and calibration methods,Liang Li; Ming Shao; Hongfang Chen; Cheng Tang Zebo Li; Xin Dong; Xiaolian Wang,A prototype Time-of-Flight (TOF) detector; consisting of 28 Multi-gap Resistive PlateChambers (MRPC); has been successfully operated at RHIC-STAR experiment since 2003.Extensive study on the calibration procedure of the MRPC-TOF is performed in order tobetter understand MRPC's performance. Improvements and extension on current calibrationmethod are discussed. Furthermore; it has been found that the position resolution of thereconstruction system at STAR has significant impact on the MRPC time resolution. Aftersubtracting this effect; the intrinsic time resolution of MRPC is found to be about 60 ps; whichis in good agreement to beam test results.(authors),High Energy Physics and Nuclear Physics,2007,1

Charm quarks in medium and their contribution to di-electron spectra in relativistic heavy ion collisions,Hao-jie Xu; Xin Dong; Li-juan Ruan; Qun Wang; Zhang-bu Xu; Yi-fei Zhang,Abstract We study the dynamics of charm quarks in the partonic medium and its implicationfor the di-electron spectra in high-energy heavy ion collisions. The charm quarks traversinga thermal medium are simulated by the relativistic Langevin equation for elastic scattering ofcharm quarks by thermal partons in an expanding fireball. The transport coefficients of thecharm quarks are calculated by the in-medium T-matrix method; where a static heavy quarkpotential is used with parameters fitted by the lattice QCD results. The di-electron invariantmass spectra are computed in the most central collisions and are compared to the STARdata. The angular correlations of di-electrons are almost the same in p+ p and Au+ Aucollisions in the mass range 1.1< M< 2.5 GeV/c 2 with a back-to-back feature. This meansthat the angular correlation is intact even with medium interaction at the energy of the …,Physical Review C,2014,*

Polarization Measurements of Hyperons and Vector Mesons in Heavy Ion Collisions at STAR,Xin Dong; STAR Collaboration,Particles produced in non‐central relativistic heavy ion collisions could become globallypolarized due to the initial large orbital angular momentum and QCD spin‐orbital coupling.Measurements of the polarization wrt various kinematic planes may give insight into themechanisms by which the polarization arises. We report the polarization measurements of Λ(Λ̄); and spin alignment of K* and φ wrt the reaction plane in Au+ Au collisions at RHIC. Inaddition the spin alignment of the K* and φ can be extracted wrt a second plane; theproduction plane; which gives insight into the possible size of polarization phenomena in theproduction dynamics of vector mesons; is also reported.,AIP Conference Proceedings,2009,*
Nuclear stopping and sideward-flow correlation from 0.35 A to 200 A GeV,Xiao-Feng Luo; Ming Shao; Xin Dong; Cheng Li,Abstract The correlation between the nuclear stopping and the scale invariant nucleonsideward flow at energies ranging from those available at the GSI heavy ion synchrotron(SIS) to those at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) is studied within ultrarelativisticquantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD). The universal behavior of the two experimentalobservables for various colliding systems and scale impact parameters are found to behighly correlated with each other. As there is no phase transition mechanism involved in theUrQMD; the correlation may be broken down by the sudden change of the bulk properties ofthe nuclear matter; such as the formation of quark-gluon plasma (QGP); which can beemployed as a QGP phase transition signal in high-energy heavy ion collisions.Furthermore; we also point out that the appearance of a breakdown of the correlation may …,Physical Review C,2008,*
Open charm production at RHIC: Recent results from STAR,Xin Dong; STAR Collaboration,Abstract We report recent measurements on the open charm production in d+ Au and p+ pcollisions at s_ NN= 200 GeV from the STAR detector at RHIC.

The mid-rapidity charm differentialcross section per nucleon-nucleon collision from d+ Au collisions at RHIC is d σ _ c ̄ c^NN/dy= 0.30 ± 0.04 (stat.) ± 0.09 (syst.) mb; which is higher than predictions from most of theNLO pQCD calculations.
