Tools for privacy preserving distributed data mining,Chris Clifton; Murat Kantarcioglu; Jaideep Vaidya; Xiaodong Lin; Michael Y Zhu,Abstract Privacy preserving mining of distributed data has numerous applications. Eachapplication poses different constraints: What is meant by privacy; what are the desiredresults; how is the data distributed; what are the constraints on collaboration andcooperative computing; etc. We suggest that the solution to this is a toolkit of componentsthat can be combined for specific privacy-preserving data mining applications. This paperpresents some components of such a toolkit; and shows how they can be used to solveseveral privacy-preserving data mining problems.,ACM Sigkdd Explorations Newsletter,2002,972
Access Pattern disclosure on Searchable Encryption: Ramification; Attack and Mitigation.,Mohammad Saiful Islam; Mehmet Kuzu; Murat Kantarcioglu,Abstract The advent of cloud computing has ushered in an era of mass data storage inremote servers. Remote data storage offers reduced data management overhead for dataowners in a cost effective manner. Sensitive documents; however; need to be stored inencrypted format due to security concerns. But; encrypted storage makes it difficult to searchon the stored documents. Therefore; this poses a major barrier towards selective retrieval ofencrypted documents from the remote servers.

Inferring private information using social network data,Jack Lindamood; Raymond Heatherly; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract On-line social networks; such as Facebook; are increasingly utilized by many users.These networks allow people to publish details about themselves and connect to theirfriends. Some of the information revealed inside these networks is private and it is possiblethat corporations could use learning algorithms on the released data to predict undisclosedprivate information. In this paper; we explore how to launch inference attacks using releasedsocial networking data to predict undisclosed private information about individuals. We thenexplore the effectiveness of possible sanitization techniques that can be used to combatsuch inference attacks under different scenarios.,Proceedings of the 18th international conference on World wide web,2009,216

Efficient similarity search over encrypted data,Mehmet Kuzu; Mohammad Saiful Islam; Murat Kantarcioglu,In recent years; due to the appealing features of cloud computing; large amount of data havebeen stored in the cloud. Although cloud based services offer many advantages; privacy andsecurity of the sensitive data is a big concern. To mitigate the concerns; it is desirable tooutsource sensitive data in encrypted form. Encrypted storage protects the data againstillegal access; but it complicates some basic; yet important functionality such as the searchon the data. To achieve search over encrypted data without compromising the privacy;considerable amount of searchable encryption schemes have been proposed in theliterature. However; almost all of them handle exact query matching but not similaritymatching; a crucial requirement for real world applications.

Secure multidimensional range queries over outsourced data,Bijit Hore; Sharad Mehrotra; Mustafa Canim; Murat Kantarcioglu,Abstract In this paper; we study the problem of supporting multidimensional range querieson encrypted data. The problem is motivated by secure data outsourcing applications wherea client may store his/her data on a remote server in encrypted form and want to executequeries using server's computational capabilities. The solution approach is to compute asecure indexing tag of the data by applying bucketization (a generic form of datapartitioning) which prevents the server from learning exact values but still allows it to check ifa record satisfies the query predicate. Queries are evaluated in an approximate mannerwhere the returned set of records may contain some false positives. These records thenneed to be weeded out by the client which comprises the computational overhead of ourscheme. We develop a bucketization procedure for answering multidimensional range …,The VLDB Journal,2012,156
When do data mining results violate privacy?,Murat Kantarcioǧlu; Jiashun Jin; Chris Clifton,Abstract Privacy-preserving data mining has concentrated on obtaining valid results whenthe input data is private. An extreme example is Secure Multiparty Computation-basedmethods; where only the results are revealed. However; this still leaves a potential privacybreach: Do the results themselves violate privacy? This paper explores this issue;developing a framework under which this question can be addressed. Metrics are proposed;along with analysis that those metrics are consistent in the face of apparent problems.,Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2004,147
Privacy-preserving naive bayes classification,Jaideep Vaidya; Murat Kantarcıoğlu; Chris Clifton,Abstract Privacy-preserving data mining—developing models without seeing the data–isreceiving growing attention. This paper assumes a privacy-preserving distributed datamining scenario: data sources collaborate to develop a global model; but must not disclosetheir data to others. The problem of secure distributed classification is an important one. Inmany situations; data is split between multiple organizations. These organizations may wantto utilize all of the data to create more accurate predictive models while revealing neithertheir training data/databases nor the instances to be classified. Naïve Bayes is often used asa baseline classifier; consistently providing reasonable classification performance.

Preventing private information inference attacks on social networks,Raymond Heatherly; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Online social networks; such as Facebook; are increasingly utilized by many people. Thesenetworks allow users to publish details about themselves and to connect to their friends.Some of the information revealed inside these networks is meant to be private. Yet it ispossible to use learning algorithms on released data to predict private information. In thispaper; we explore how to launch inference attacks using released social networking data topredict private information. We then devise three possible sanitization techniques that couldbe used in various situations. Then; we explore the effectiveness of these techniques andattempt to use methods of collective inference to discover sensitive attributes of the data set.We show that we can decrease the effectiveness of both local and relational classificationalgorithms by using the sanitization methods we described.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2013,140
An approach to evaluate data trustworthiness based on data provenance,Chenyun Dai; Dan Lin; Elisa Bertino; Murat Kantarcioglu,Abstract Today; with the advances of information technology; individual people andorganizations can obtain and process data from different sources. It is critical to ensure dataintegrity so that effective decisions can be made based on these data. An importantcomponent of any solution for assessing data integrity is represented by techniques andtools to evaluate the trustworthiness of data provenance. However; few efforts have beendevoted to investigate approaches for assessing how trusted the data are; based in turn onan assessment of the data sources and intermediaries. To bridge this gap; we propose adata provenance trust model which takes into account various factors that may affect thetrustworthiness and; based on these factors; assigns trust scores to both data and dataproviders. Such trust scores represent key information based on which data users may …,Workshop on Secure Data Management,2008,124
Private record matching using differential privacy,Ali Inan; Murat Kantarcioglu; Gabriel Ghinita; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Private matching between datasets owned by distinct parties is a challengingproblem with several applications. Private matching allows two parties to identify the recordsthat are close to each other according to some distance functions; such that no additionalinformation other than the join result is disclosed to any party. Private matching can besolved securely and accurately using secure multi-party computation (SMC) techniques; butsuch an approach is prohibitively expensive in practice. Previous work proposed the releaseof sanitized versions of the sensitive datasets which allows blocking; ie; filtering out sub-setsof records that cannot be part of the join result. This way; SMC is applied only to a smallfraction of record pairs; reducing the matching cost to acceptable levels. The blocking step isessential for the privacy; accuracy and efficiency of matching. However; the state-of-the …,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2010,121
Security issues in querying encrypted data,Murat Kantarcıoǧlu; Chris Clifton,Abstract There has been considerable interest in querying encrypted data; allowing a“secure database server” model where the server does not know data values. This papershows how results from cryptography prove the impossibility of developing a server thatmeets cryptographic-style definitions of security and is still efficient enough to be practical.The weaker definitions of security supported by previous secure database server proposalshave the potential to reveal significant information. We propose a definition of a securedatabase server that provides probabilistic security guarantees; and sketch how a practicalsystem meeting the definition could be built and proven secure. The primary goal of thispaper is to provide a vision of how research in this area should proceed: efficient encrypteddatabase and query processing with provable security properties.,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2005,119
A cryptographic approach to securely share and query genomic sequences,Murat Kantarcioglu; Wei Jiang; Ying Liu; Bradley Malin,To support large-scale biomedical research projects; organizations need to share person-specific genomic sequences without violating the privacy of their data subjects. In the past;organizations protected subjects' identities by removing identifiers; such as name and socialsecurity number; however; recent investigations illustrate that deidentified genomic data canbe ldquoreidentifiedrdquo to named individuals using simple automated methods. In thispaper; we present a novel cryptographic framework that enables organizations to supportgenomic data mining without disclosing the raw genomic sequences.

The applicability of the perturbation based privacy preserving data mining for real-world data,Li Liu; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract The perturbation method has been extensively studied for privacy preserving datamining. In this method; random noise from a known distribution is added to the privacysensitive data before the data is sent to the data miner. Subsequently; the data minerreconstructs an approximation to the original data distribution from the perturbed data anduses the reconstructed distribution for data mining purposes. Due to the addition of noise;loss of information versus preservation of privacy is always a trade off in the perturbationbased approaches. The question is; to what extent are the users willing to compromise theirprivacy? This is a choice that changes from individual to individual. Different individuals mayhave different attitudes towards privacy based on customs and cultures. Unfortunately;current perturbation based privacy preserving data mining techniques do not allow the …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2008,97
A hybrid approach to private record linkage,Ali Inan; Murat Kantarcioglu; Elisa Bertino; Monica Scannapieco,Real-world entities are not always represented by the same set of features in different datasets. Therefore matching and linking records corresponding to the same real-world entitydistributed across these data sets is a challenging task. If the data sets contain privateinformation; the problem becomes even harder due to privacy concerns. Existing solutions ofthis problem mostly follow two approaches: sanitization techniques and cryptographictechniques. The former achieves privacy by perturbing sensitive data at the expense ofdegrading matching accuracy. The later; on the other hand; attains both privacy and highaccuracy under heavy communication and computation costs. In this paper; we propose amethod that combines these two approaches and enables users to trade off betweenprivacy; accuracy and cost.

Data intensive query processing for large RDF graphs using cloud computing tools,Mohammad Farhan Husain; Latifur Khan; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Cloud computing is the newest paradigm in the IT world and hence the focus of newresearch. Companies hosting cloud computing services face the challenge of handling dataintensive applications. Semantic web technologies can be an ideal candidate to be usedtogether with cloud computing tools to provide a solution. These technologies have beenstandardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). One such standard is theResource Description Framework (RDF). With the explosion of semantic web technologies;large RDF graphs are common place. Current frameworks do not scale for large RDFgraphs. In this paper; we describe a framework that we built using Hadoop; a popular opensource framework for Cloud Computing; to store and retrieve large numbers of RDF triples.We describe a scheme to store RDF data in Hadoop Distributed File System.

Privately computing a distributed k-nn classifier,Murat Kantarcıoǧlu; Chris Clifton,Abstract The ability of databases to organize and share data often raises privacy concerns.Data warehousing combined with data mining; bringing data from multiple sources under asingle authority; increases the risk of privacy violations. Privacy preserving data miningprovides a means of addressing this issue; particularly if data mining is done in a way thatdoesn't disclose information beyond the result. This paper presents a method for privatelycomputing k–nn classification from distributed sources without revealing any informationabout the sources or their data; other than that revealed by the final classification result.,European conference on principles of data mining and knowledge discovery,2004,81
Using anonymized data for classification,Ali Inan; Murat Kantarcioglu; Elisa Bertino,In recent years; anonymization methods have emerged as an important tool to preserveindividual privacy when releasing privacy sensitive data sets. This interest in anonymizationtechniques has resulted in a plethora of methods for anonymizing data under differentprivacy and utility assumptions. At the same time; there has been little research addressinghow to effectively use the anonymized data for data mining in general and for distributeddata mining in particular. In this paper; we propose a new approach for building classifiersusing anonymized data by modeling anonymized data as uncertain data. In our method; wedo not assume any probability distribution over the data. Instead; we propose collecting allnecessary statistics during anonymization and releasing these together with the anonymizeddata. We show that releasing such statistics does not violate anonymity.

A constraint satisfaction cryptanalysis of bloom filters in private record linkage,Mehmet Kuzu; Murat Kantarcioglu; Elizabeth Durham; Bradley Malin,Abstract For over fifty years;“record linkage” procedures have been refined to integrate datain the face of typographical and semantic errors. These procedures are traditionallyperformed over personal identifiers (eg; names); but in modern decentralized environments;privacy concerns have led to regulations that require the obfuscation of such attributes.Various techniques have been proposed to resolve the tension; including secure multi-partycomputation protocols; however; such protocols are computationally intensive and do notscale for real world linkage scenarios. More recently; procedures based on Bloom filterencoding (BFE) have gained traction in various applications; such as healthcare; where theyyield highly accurate record linkage results in a reasonable amount of time.

Sovereign joins,Rakesh Agrawal; Dmitri Asonov; Murat Kantarcioglu; Yaping Li,We present a secure network service for sovereign information sharing whose only trustedcomponent is an off-theshelf secure coprocessor. The participating data providers sendencrypted relations to the service that sends the encrypted results to the recipients. Thetechnical challenge in implementing such a service arises from the limited capability of thesecure coprocessors: they have small memory; no attached disk; and no facility forcommunicating directly with other machines in the network. The internal state of an ongoingcomputation within the secure coprocessor cannot be seen from outside; but its interactionswith the server can be exploited by an adversary.

Quantifying the correctness; computational complexity; and security of privacy-preserving string comparators for record linkage,Elizabeth Durham; Yuan Xue; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bradley Malin,Abstract Record linkage is the task of identifying records from disparate data sources thatrefer to the same entity. It is an integral component of data processing in distributed settings;where the integration of information from multiple sources can prevent duplication andenrich overall data quality; thus enabling more detailed and correct analysis. Privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) is a variant of the task in which data owners wish toperform linkage without revealing identifiers associated with the records. This task isdesirable in various domains; including healthcare; where it may not be possible to revealpatient identity due to confidentiality requirements; and in business; where it could bedisadvantageous to divulge customers' identities. To perform PPRL; it is necessary to applystring comparators that function in the privacy-preserving space. A number of privacy …,Information Fusion,2012,66

Towards privacy preserving access control in the cloud,Mohamed Nabeel; Elisa Bertino; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham,It is very costly and cumbersome to manage database systems in-house especially for smallor medium organizations. Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) hosted in the cloud provides anattractive solution; which is flexible; reliable; easy and economical to operate; for suchorganizations. However security and privacy issues concerning the storage of the data in thecloud and access via the Internet have been major concerns for many organizations. Thedata and the human resources are the life blood of any organization. Hence; they should bestrongly protected. In this paper; we identify the challenges in securing DaaS model andpropose a system called CloudMask that lays the foundation for organizations to enjoy allthe benefits of hosting their data in the cloud while at the same time supporting fine-grainedand flexible access control for shared data hosted in the cloud.,Collaborative Computing: Networking; Applications and Worksharing (CollaborateCom); 2011 7th International Conference on,2011,59
An efficient approximate protocol for privacy-preserving association rule mining,Murat Kantarcioglu; Robert Nix; Jaideep Vaidya,Abstract The secure scalar product (or dot product) is one of the most used sub-protocols inprivacy-preserving data mining. Indeed; the dot product is probably the most common sub-protocol used. As such; a lot of attention has been focused on coming up with secureprotocols for computing it. However; an inherent problem with these protocols is theextremely high computation cost–especially when the dot product needs to be carried outover large vectors. This is quite common in vertically partitioned data; and is a real problem.In this paper; we present ways to efficiently compute the approximate dot product. Weimplement the dot product protocol and demonstrate the quality of the approximation. Ourdot product protocol can be used to securely and efficiently compute association rules fromdata vertically partitioned between two parties.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2009,58
A language for provenance access control,Tyrone Cadenhead; Vaibhav Khadilkar; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract Provenance is a directed acyclic graph that explains how a resource came to be inits current form. Traditional access control does not support provenance graphs. We cannotachieve all the benefits of access control if the relationships between the data and theirsources are not protected. In this paper; we propose a language that complements andextends existing access control languages to support provenance. This language alsoprovides access to data based on integrity criteria. We have also built a prototype to showthat this language can be implemented effectively using Semantic Web technologies.,Proceedings of the first ACM conference on Data and application security and privacy,2011,57
Approximate and exact hybrid algorithms for private nearest-neighbor queries with database protection,Gabriel Ghinita; Panos Kalnis; Murat Kantarcioglu; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Mobile devices with global positioning capabilities allow users to retrieve points ofinterest (POI) in their proximity. To protect user privacy; it is important not to disclose exactuser coordinates to un-trusted entities that provide location-based services. Currently; thereare two main approaches to protect the location privacy of users:(i) hiding locations insidecloaking regions (CRs) and (ii) encrypting location data using private information retrieval(PIR) protocols. Previous work focused on finding good trade-offs between privacy andperformance of user protection techniques; but disregarded the important issue of protectingthe POI dataset D. For instance; location cloaking requires large-sized CRs; leading toexcessive disclosure of POIs (O (| D|) in the worst case).

Privacy-preserving data mining in the malicious model,Murat Kantarcioglu; Onur Kardes,Most of the cryptographic work in privacy-preserving distributed data mining deals with semi-honest adversaries; which are assumed to follow the prescribed protocol but try to inferprivate information using the messages they receive during the protocol. Although the semi-honest model is reasonable in some cases; it is unrealistic to assume that adversaries willalways follow the protocols exactly. In particular; malicious adversaries could deviatearbitrarily from their prescribed protocols. Secure protocols that are developed againstmalicious adversaries require utilisation of complex techniques. Clearly; protocols that canwithstand malicious adversaries provide more security. However; there is an obvious trade-off: protocols that are secure against malicious adversaries are generally more expensivethan those secure against semi-honest adversaries only. In this paper; our goal is to make …,International Journal of Information and Computer Security,2008,56
Differentiating code from data in x86 binaries,Richard Wartell; Yan Zhou; Kevin W Hamlen; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract Robust; static disassembly is an important part of achieving high coverage for manybinary code analyses; such as reverse engineering; malware analysis; reference monitor in-lining; and software fault isolation. However; one of the major difficulties currentdisassemblers face is differentiating code from data when they are interleaved. This paperpresents a machine learning-based disassembly algorithm that segments an x86 binary intosubsequences of bytes and then classifies each subsequence as code or data. Thealgorithm builds a language model from a set of pre-tagged binaries using a statistical datacompression technique. It sequentially scans a new binary executable and sets a breakingpoint at each potential code-to-code and code-to-data/data-to-code transition. Theclassification of each segment as code or data is based on the minimum cross-entropy …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2011,52
Transforming semi-honest protocols to ensure accountability,Wei Jiang; Chris Clifton; Murat Kantarcıoğlu,Abstract The secure multi-party computation (SMC) model provides means for balancing theuse and confidentiality of distributed data. This is especially important in the field of privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM). Increasing security concerns have led to a surge in work onpractical secure multi-party computation protocols. However; most are only proven secureunder the semi-honest model; and security under this adversary model is insufficient formany PPDM applications. SMC protocols under the malicious adversary model generallyhave impractically high complexities for PPDM. We propose an accountable computing (AC)framework that enables liability for privacy compromise to be assigned to the responsibleparty without the complexity and cost of an SMC-protocol under the malicious model.

A practical and secure multi-keyword search method over encrypted cloud data,Cengiz Orencik; Murat Kantarcioglu; Erkay Savas,Cloud computing technologies become more and more popular every year; as manyorganizations tend to outsource their data utilizing robust and fast services of clouds whilelowering the cost of hardware ownership. Although its benefits are welcomed; privacy is stilla remaining concern that needs to be addressed. We propose an efficient privacy-preserving search method over encrypted cloud data that utilizes minhash functions. Most ofthe work in literature can only support a single feature search in queries which reduces theeffectiveness. One of the main advantages of our proposed method is the capability of multi-keyword search in a single query. The proposed method is proved to satisfy adaptivesemantic security definition. We also combine an effective ranking capability that is based onterm frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) values of keyword document pairs …,Cloud Computing (CLOUD); 2013 IEEE Sixth International Conference on,2013,49
Secure management of biomedical data with cryptographic hardware,Mustafa Canim; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bradley Malin,The biomedical community is increasingly migrating toward research endeavors that aredependent on large quantities of genomic and clinical data. At the same time; variousregulations require that such data be shared beyond the initial collecting organization (eg;an academic medical center). It is of critical importance to ensure that when such data areshared; as well as managed; it is done so in a manner that upholds the privacy of thecorresponding individuals and the overall security of the system. In general; organizationshave attempted to achieve these goals through deidentification methods that removeexplicitly; and potentially; identifying features (eg; names; dates; and geocodes). However; agrowing number of studies demonstrate that deidentified data can be reidentified to namedindividuals using simple automated methods. As an alternative; it was shown that …,IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine,2012,47
An architecture for privacy-preserving mining of client information,Murat Kantarcioglu; Jaideep Vaidya,Abstract Due to privacy concerns; clients of some services may not want to reveal theirprivate information. Even in these situations; data mining is feasible without sacrificing userprivacy. Prior approaches to this problem generally trade off accuracy for security; withoutgiving provable bounds on security. Alternatives to the randomization technique arerequired to enable accurate data mining while strictly preserving privacy. In this paper; wepresent a general architecture that enables privacy-preserving mining of client information.Under some reasonable assumptions; we show that our methods are secure; whilemaintaining the accuracy of the results.,Proceedings of the IEEE international conference on Privacy; security and data mining-Volume 14,2002,45

Classifier evaluation and attribute selection against active adversaries,Murat Kantarcıoğlu; Bowei Xi; Chris Clifton,Abstract Many data mining applications; such as spam filtering and intrusion detection; arefaced with active adversaries. In all these applications; the future data sets and the trainingdata set are no longer from the same population; due to the transformations employed by theadversaries. Hence a main assumption for the existing classification techniques no longerholds and initially successful classifiers degrade easily. This becomes a game between theadversary and the data miner: The adversary modifies its strategy to avoid being detected bythe current classifier; the data miner then updates its classifier based on the new threats. Inthis paper; we investigate the possibility of an equilibrium in this seemingly never endinggame; where neither party has an incentive to change. Modifying the classifier causes toomany false positives with too little increase in true positives; changes by the adversary …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2011,43
A game-theoretical approach for finding optimal strategies in a botnet defense model,Alain Bensoussan; Murat Kantarcioglu; SingRu Celine Hoe,Abstract Botnets are networks of computers infected with malicious programs that allowcybercriminals/botnet herders to control the infected machines remotely without the user'sknowledge.

Efficient privacy-aware record integration,Mehmet Kuzu; Murat Kantarcioglu; Ali Inan; Elisa Bertino; Elizabeth Durham; Bradley Malin,Abstract The integration of information dispersed among multiple repositories is a crucialstep for accurate data analysis in various domains. In support of this goal; it is critical todevise procedures for identifying similar records across distinct data sources. At the sametime; to adhere to privacy regulations and policies; such procedures should protect theconfidentiality of the individuals to whom the information corresponds. Various private recordlinkage (PRL) protocols have been proposed to achieve this goal; involving secure multi-party computation (SMC) and similarity preserving data transformation techniques. SMCmethods provide secure and accurate solutions to the PRL problem; but are prohibitivelyexpensive in practice; mainly due to excessive computational requirements.

Impact of security risks on cloud computing adoption,Murat Kantarcioglu; Alain Bensoussan; Sing Ru Hoe,Cloud computing has been a paradigm shift in the information technology domain. It offerspotential benefits to users in terms of instant availability; scalability and resource sharing;while potentially posing security issues. Especially; recent events like Amazons systemfailure increased the concerns related to cloud computing. Given these security andreliability concerns; we explore the optimal decision rule for moving certain IT function topublic clouds. We formulate the problem as an entrepreneurial decision for an optimalstopping time at which the entrepreneur shall migrate to the cloud computing paradigm. Twodifferent models are presented. Recognizing that an important and specific issue related todifferent computing paradigm is the potential" security" risk posed by each technology; weconsider security risks in both models.

A game-theoretic approach for high-assurance of data trustworthiness in sensor networks,Hyo-Sang Lim; Gabriel Ghinita; Elisa Bertino; Murat Kantarcioglu,Sensor networks are being increasingly deployed in many application domains ranging fromenvironment monitoring to supervising critical infrastructure systems (eg; the power grid).Due to their ability to continuously collect large amounts of data; sensor networks representa key component in decisionmaking; enabling timely situation assessment and response.However; sensors deployed in hostile environments may be subject to attacks byadversaries who intend to inject false data into the system. In this context; datatrustworthiness is an important concern; as false readings may result in wrong decisions withserious consequences (eg; large-scale power outages). To defend against this threat; it isimportant to establish trust levels for sensor nodes and adjust node trustworthiness scores toaccount for malicious interferences.

A risk management approach to RBAC,Ebru Celikel; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Even if Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is employed properly; distributeddatabase environments are still prone to illegitimate access attempts: in RBAC; userspotentially carry the risk of illegal access attempts via credentials violation; or unintentional/intentional incorrect use of already granted permissions via role misuse/abuse. Weintroduce a probabilistic risk management model for enhanced access control in suchdatabases. We incorporate failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) scheme formeasuring user risks in our design. We combine components as credentials; queries; rolehistory logs and expected utility for a probabilistic formulation of risk. We presentexperimental results that we obtained on real world database.

Transforming provenance using redaction,Tyrone Cadenhead; Vaibhav Khadilkar; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract Ongoing mutual relationships among entities rely on sharing quality informationwhile preventing release of sensitive content. Provenance records the history of a documentfor ensuring both; the quality and trustworthiness; while redaction identifies and removessensitive information from a document. Traditional redaction techniques do not extend to thedirected graph representation of provenance. In this paper; we propose a graph grammarapproach for rewriting redaction policies over provenance. Our rewriting procedure convertsa high level specification of a redaction policy into a graph grammar rule that transforms aprovenance graph into a redacted provenance graph. Our prototype shows that thisapproach can be effectively implemented using Semantic Web technologies.,Proceedings of the 16th ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2011,40
A secure protocol for protecting the identity of providers when disclosing data for disease surveillance,Khaled El Emam; Jun Hu; Jay Mercer; Liam Peyton; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bradley Malin; David Buckeridge; Saeed Samet; Craig Earle,Abstract Background Providers have been reluctant to disclose patient data for public-healthpurposes. Even if patient privacy is ensured; the desire to protect provider confidentiality hasbeen an important driver of this reluctance. Methods Six requirements for a surveillanceprotocol were defined that satisfy the confidentiality needs of providers and ensure utility topublic health. The authors developed a secure multi-party computation protocol using thePaillier cryptosystem to allow the disclosure of stratified case counts and denominators tomeet these requirements. The authors evaluated the protocol in a simulated environment onits computation performance and ability to detect disease outbreak clusters.

Privacy preserving decision tree mining from perturbed data,Li Liu; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Privacy preserving data mining has been investigated extensively. The previous worksmainly fall into two categories; perturbation and randomization based approaches andsecure multi-party computation based approaches. The earlier perturbation andrandomization approaches have a step to reconstruct the original data distribution. The newresearch in this area adopts different data distortion methods or modifies the data miningtechniques to make it more suitable to the perturbation scenario. Secure multi-partycomputation approaches which employ cryptographic tools to build data mining models facehigh communication and computation costs; especially when the number of partiesparticipating in the computation is large.

An approach to securely identifying beneficial collaboration in decentralized logistics systems,Chris Clifton; Ananth Iyer; Richard Cho; Wei Jiang; Murat Kantarcıoğlu; Jaideep Vaidya,The problem of sharing manufacturing; inventory; or capacity to improve performance isapplicable in many decentralized operational contexts. However; the solution of suchproblems commonly requires an intermediary or a broker to manage information securityconcerns of individual participants. Our goal is to examine use of cryptographic techniquesto attain the same result without the use of a broker. To illustrate this approach; we focus ona problem faced by independent trucking companies that have separate pick-up anddelivery tasks and wish to identify potential efficiency-enhancing task swaps while limitingthe information they must reveal to identify these swaps. We present an algorithm that findsopportunities to swap loads without revealing any information except the loads swapped;along with proofs of the security of the protocol.

A survey of privacy-preserving methods across horizontally partitioned data,Murat Kantarcioglu,Data mining can extract important knowledge from large data collections; but sometimesthese collections are split among various parties. Data warehousing; bringing data frommultiple sources under a single authority; increases risk of privacy violations. Furthermore;privacy concerns may prevent the parties from directly sharing even some meta-data.Distributed data mining and processing provide a means to address this issue; particularly ifqueries are processed in a way that avoids the disclosure of any information beyond thefinal result. This chapter describes methods to mine horizontally partitioned data withoutviolating privacy and discusses how to use the data mining results in a privacy-preservingway. The methods described here incorporate cryptographic techniques to minimize theinformation shared; while adding as little as possible overhead to the mining and …,*,2008,35
A practical approach to achieve private medical record linkage in light of public resources,Mehmet Kuzu; Murat Kantarcioglu; Elizabeth Ashley Durham; Csaba Toth; Bradley Malin,Abstract Objective Integration of patients' records across resources enhances analytics. Toaddress privacy concerns; emerging strategies such as Bloom filter encodings (BFEs);enable integration while obscuring identifiers. However; recent investigations demonstrateBFEs are; in theory; vulnerable to cryptanalysis when encoded identifiers are randomlyselected from a public resource. This study investigates the extent to which cryptanalysisconditions hold for (1) real patient records and (2) a countermeasure that obscures thefrequencies of the identifying values in encoded datasets. Design First; to investigate thestrength of cryptanalysis for real patient records; we build BFEs from identifiers in anelectronic medical record system and apply cryptanalysis using identifiers in a publiclyavailable voter registry. Second; to investigate the countermeasure under ideal …,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association,2012,33
Private medical record linkage with approximate matching,Elizabeth Durham; Yuan Xue; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bradley Malin,Abstract Federal regulations require patient data to be shared for reuse in a de-identifiedmanner. However; disparate providers often share data on overlapping populations; suchthat a patient's record may be duplicated or fragmented in the de-identified repository. Toperform unbiased statistical analysis in a de-identified setting; it is crucial to integraterecords that correspond to the same patient. Private record linkage techniques have beendeveloped; but most methods are based on encryption and preclude the ability to determinesimilarity; decreasing the accuracy of record linkage. The goal of this research is to integratea private string comparison method that uses Bloom filters to provide an approximate match;with a medical record linkage algorithm. We evaluate the approach with 100;000 patients'identifiers and demographics from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. We …,AMIA Annual Symposium Proceedings,2010,33
Composite bloom filters for secure record linkage,Elizabeth A Durham; Murat Kantarcioglu; Yuan Xue; Csaba Toth; Mehmet Kuzu; Bradley Malin,The process of record linkage seeks to integrate instances that correspond to the sameentity. Record linkage has traditionally been performed through the comparison ofidentifying field values (eg; Surname); however; when databases are maintained bydisparate organizations; the disclosure of such information can breach the privacy of thecorresponding individuals. Various private record linkage (PRL) methods have beendeveloped to obscure such identifiers; but they vary widely in their ability to balancecompeting goals of accuracy; efficiency and security. The tokenization and hashing of fieldvalues into Bloom filters (BF) enables greater linkage accuracy and efficiency than otherPRL methods; but the encodings may be compromised through frequency-basedcryptanalysis.

Adversarial support vector machine learning,Yan Zhou; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham; Bowei Xi,Abstract Many learning tasks such as spam filtering and credit card fraud detection face anactive adversary that tries to avoid detection. For learning problems that deal with an activeadversary; it is important to model the adversary's attack strategy and develop robustlearning models to mitigate the attack. These are the two objectives of this paper. Weconsider two attack models: a free-range attack model that permits arbitrary data corruptionand a restrained attack model that anticipates more realistic attacks that a reasonableadversary would devise under penalties. We then develop optimal SVM learning strategiesagainst the two attack models. The learning algorithms minimize the hinge loss whileassuming the adversary is modifying data to maximize the loss.

SecureMA: protecting participant privacy in genetic association meta-analysis,Wei Xie; Murat Kantarcioglu; William S Bush; Dana Crawford; Joshua C Denny; Raymond Heatherly; Bradley A Malin,Abstract Motivation: Sharing genomic data is crucial to support scientific investigation suchas genome-wide association studies. However; recent investigations suggest the privacy ofthe individual participants in these studies can be compromised; leading to serious concernsand consequences; such as overly restricted access to data. Results: We introduce a novelcryptographic strategy to securely perform meta-analysis for genetic association studies inlarge consortia. Our methodology is useful for supporting joint studies among disparate datasites; where privacy or confidentiality is of concern. We validate our method using threemultisite association studies.

A privacy-preserving framework for integrating person-specific databases,Murat Kantarcioglu; Wei Jiang; Bradley Malin,Abstract Many organizations capture personal information; but the quantity of recordsneeded to detect statistically significant patterns is often beyond the grasp of a single datacollector. In the biomedical realm; this problem has pressed regulatory agencies to requirefunded investigators to share research-derived data to public repositories. The challenge;however; is that shared records must not reveal the identity of the subjects. In this paper; weextend a secure framework in which data holders contribute and query encrypted person-specific data stored on a third party's server. Specifically; we develop protocols that enabledata holders to merge personal records; thus creating larger profiles and diminishingduplication. The repository administrator can merge records via encrypted identifiers withoutdecrypting or inferring the contents of the joined records. Our model is more practical than …,International Conference on Privacy in Statistical Databases,2008,30

Inference attack against encrypted range queries on outsourced databases,Mohammad Saiful Islam; Mehmet Kuzu; Murat Kantarcioglu,Abstract To mitigate security concerns of outsourced databases; quite a few protocols havebeen proposed that outsource data in encrypted format and allow encrypted query executionon the server side. Among the more practical protocols; the" bucketization" approachfacilitates query execution at the cost of reduced efficiency by allowing some false positivesin the query results. Precise Query Protocols (PQPs); on the other hand; enable the server toexecute queries without incurring any false positives. Even though these protocols do notreveal the underlying data; they reveal query access pattern to an adversary. In this paper;we introduce a general attack on PQPs based on access pattern disclosure in the context ofsecure range queries. Our empirical analysis on several real world datasets shows that theproposed attack is able to disclose significant amount of sensitive data with high accuracy …,Proceedings of the 4th ACM conference on Data and application security and privacy,2014,27
A secure distributed logistic regression protocol for the detection of rare adverse drug events,Khaled El Emam; Saeed Samet; Luk Arbuckle; Robyn Tamblyn; Craig Earle; Murat Kantarcioglu,Abstract Background There is limited capacity to assess the comparative risks ofmedications after they enter the market. For rare adverse events; the pooling of data frommultiple sources is necessary to have the power and sufficient population heterogeneity todetect differences in safety and effectiveness in genetic; ethnic and clinically definedsubpopulations. However; combining datasets from different data custodians or jurisdictionsto perform an analysis on the pooled data creates significant privacy concerns that wouldneed to be addressed.

Incentive compatible privacy-preserving data analysis,Murat Kantarcioglu; Wei Jiang,In many cases; competing parties who have private data may collaboratively conduct privacy-preserving distributed data analysis (PPDA) tasks to learn beneficial data models or analysisresults. Most often; the competing parties have different incentives. Although certain PPDAtechniques guarantee that nothing other than the final analysis result is revealed; it isimpossible to verify whether participating parties are truthful about their private input data.Unless proper incentives are set; current PPDA techniques cannot prevent participatingparties from modifying their private inputs. incentive compatible privacy-preserving dataanalysis techniques This raises the question of how to design incentive compatible privacy-preserving data analysis techniques that motivate participating parties to provide truthfulinputs.

Building disclosure risk aware query optimizers for relational databases,Mustafa Canim; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bijit Hore; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract Many DBMS products in the market provide built in encryption support to deal withthe security concerns of the organizations. This solution is quite effective in preventing dataleakage from compromised/stolen storage devices. However; recent studies show that asignificant part of the leaked records have been done so by using specialized malwares thatcan access the main memory of systems. These malwares can easily capture the sensitiveinformation that are decrypted in the memory including the cryptographic keys used todecrypt them. This can further compromise the security of data residing on disk that areencrypted with the same keys. In this paper we quantify the disclosure risk of encrypted datain a relational DBMS for main memory-based attacks and propose modifications to thestandard query processing mechanism to minimize such risks.

GuardMR: fine-grained security policy enforcement for MapReduce systems,Huseyin Ulusoy; Pietro Colombo; Elena Ferrari; Murat Kantarcioglu; Erman Pattuk,Abstract Executing data analytics tasks in MapReduce systems introduces new security andprivacy concerns as the processed unstructured datasets may contain sensitive information(eg; social security numbers; business sensitive information) at the level of individualrecords; and the existing file-level access control mechanisms provide all or nothing accessto the entire dataset. To address these concerns; we propose GUARDMR which is a novel;modular framework that can enforce fine-grained security policies at the key-value level inMapReduce systems. The presented security policies can dynamically create authorizedviews of data resources based on the organizational roles of the MapReduce users.GUARDMR further simplifies the specification of authorized views via automaticallygenerating the bytecode of the functions necessary for creating the views; from the high …,Proceedings of the 10th ACM Symposium on Information; Computer and Communications Security,2015,24
Social network classification incorporating link type values,Raymond Heatherly; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Classification of nodes in a social network and its applications to security informatics havebeen extensively studied in the past. However; previous work generally does not considerthe types of links (eg; whether a person is friend or a close friend) that connect socialnetworks members for classification purposes. Here; we propose modified Naive BayesClassification schemes to make use of the link type information in classification tasks.Basically; we suggest two new Bayesian classification methods that extend a traditionalrelational Naive Bayes Classifier; namely; the Link Type relational Bayes Classifier and theWeighted Link Type Bayes Classifier. We then show the efficacy of our proposed techniquesby conducting experiments on data obtained from the Internet Movie Database.,Intelligence and Security Informatics; 2009. ISI'09.

Vigiles: Fine-grained access control for mapreduce systems,Huseyin Ulusoy; Murat Kantarcioglu; Erman Pattuk; Kevin Hamlen,Security concerns surrounding the rise of Big Data systems have stimulated myriad new BigData security models and implementations over the past few years. A significantdisadvantage shared by most of these implementations is that they customize the underlyingsystem source code to enforce new policies; making the customizations difficult to maintainas these layers evolve over time (eg; over version updates). This paper demonstrates how abroad class of safety policies; including fine-grained access control policies at the level ofkey-value data pairs rather than files; can be elegantly enforced on MapReduce clouds withminimal overhead and without any change to the system or OS implementations. Theapproach realizes policy enforcement as a middleware layer that rewrites the cloud's front-end API with reference monitors.

Incentive compatible distributed data mining,Murat Kantarcioglu; Robert Nix,In this paper; we propose a game-theoretic mechanism to encourage truthful data sharingfor distributed data mining. Our proposed mechanism uses the classic Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism and does not rely on the ability to verify the data of the partiesparticipating in the distributed data mining protocol. Instead; we incentivize truth tellingbased solely on the data mining result. Under reasonable assumptions; we prove that thesemechanisms are incentive compatible for distributed data mining. In addition; throughextensive experimentation; we show that they are applicable in practice.,Social Computing (SocialCom); 2010 IEEE Second International Conference on,2010,23
The applicability of the perturbation model-based privacy preserving data mining for real-world data,Li Liu; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Perturbation method is a very important technique in privacy preserving data mining. In thistechnique; loss of information versus preservation of privacy is always a trade off. Thequestion is; how much are the users willing to compromise their privacy? This is a choicethat changes from individual to individual. In this paper; we propose an individuallyadaptable perturbation model; which enables the individuals to choose their own privacylevel. Hence our model provides different privacy guarantees for different privacypreferences. We test our new perturbation model by applying different reconstructionmethods to the perturbed data sets. Furthermore; we build decision tree and Naive Bayesclassifier models on the reconstructed data sets both for synthetic and real world data sets.For the synthetic data set; our experimental results indicate that our model enables the …,Data Mining Workshops; 2006.

Formal anonymity models for efficient privacy-preserving joins,Murat Kantarcioglu; Ali Inan; Wei Jiang; Bradley Malin,Abstract Organizations; such as federally-funded medical research centers; must share de-identified data on their consumers to publicly accessible repositories to adhere to regulatoryrequirements. Many repositories are managed by third-parties and it is often unknown ifrecords received from disparate organizations correspond to the same individual. Failure toresolve this issue can lead to biased (eg; double counting of identical records) andunderpowered (eg; unlinked records of different data types) investigations. In this paper; wepresent a secure multiparty computation protocol that enables record joins via consumers'encrypted identifiers. Our solution is more practical than prior secure join models in that dataholders need to interact with the third party one time per data submission.

A hybrid approach to private record matching,Ali Inan; Murat Kantarcioglu; Gabriel Ghinita; Elisa Bertino,Real-world entities are not always represented by the same set of features in different datasets. Therefore; matching records of the same real-world entity distributed across these datasets is a challenging task. If the data sets contain private information; the problem becomeseven more difficult. Existing solutions to this problem generally follow two approaches:sanitization techniques and cryptographic techniques. We propose a hybrid technique thatcombines these two approaches and enables users to trade off between privacy; accuracy;and cost. Our main contribution is the use of a blocking phase that operates over sanitizeddata to filter out in a privacy-preserving manner pairs of records that do not satisfy thematching condition.

Inthis paper; we address several design issues related to querying encrypted data in relationaldatabases. Based on our experiments; we propose new and efficient techniques to reducethe cost of cryptographic operations while processing different types of queries.

Mining cyclically repeated patterns,Ismail H Toroslu; Murat Kantarcioglu,Abstract In sequential pattern mining; the support of the sequential pattern for the transactiondatabase is defined only by the fraction of the customers supporting this sequence; which isknown as the customer support. In this paper; a new parameter is introduced for eachcustomer; called as repetition support; as an additional constraint to specify the minimumnumber of repetitions of the patterns by each customer. We call the patterns discoveredusing this technique as cyclically repeated patterns. The additional parameter makes thenew mining technique more efficient and also helps discovering more useful patterns byreducing the number of patterns searched. Also; ordinary sequential pattern mining can berepresented as a special case of the cyclically repeated pattern mining.

Trust evaluation of data provenance,Chenyun Dai; Dan Lin; Elisa Bertino; Murat Kantarcioglu,Abstract With the increased need of data sharing among multiple organizations likegovernment organizations; financial corporations; medical hospitals and academicinstitutions; it is critical to ensure data integrity so that effective decisions can be made basedon these data. An important component of any solution for assessing data integrity isrepresented by techniques and tools to evaluate the trustworthiness of data provenance.However; few efforts have been devoted to investigate approaches for assessing howtrusted the data are; based in turn on an assessment of the data sources and intermediaries.To bridge this gap; we propose a data provenance trust model. Our trust model takes intoaccount various factors that may affect the trustworthiness and; based on these factors;assigns trust scores to both data and data providers. Such trust scores represent key …,Center for Education and Research Information Assurance and Security,2008,16
Secure data storage and retrieval in the cloud,Bhavani Thuraisingham; Vaibhav Khadilkar; Anuj Gupta; Murat Kantarcioglu; Latifur Khan,With the advent of the World Wide Web and the emergence of e-commerce applications andsocial networks; organizations across the world generate a large amount of data daily. Thisdata would be more useful to cooperating organizations if they were able to share their data.Two major obstacles to this process of data sharing are providing a common storage spaceand secure access to the shared data. In this paper we address these issues by combiningcloud computing technologies such as Hive and Hadoop with XACML policy based securitymechanisms that provide fine-grained access to resources.

Distributed search over encrypted big data,Mehmet Kuzu; Mohammad Saiful Islam; Murat Kantarcioglu,Abstract Nowadays; huge amount of documents are increasingly transferred to the remoteservers due to the appealing features of cloud computing. On the other hand; privacy andsecurity of the sensitive information in untrusted cloud environment is a big concern. Toalleviate such concerns; encryption of sensitive data before its transfer to the cloud hasbecome an important risk mitigation option. Encrypted storage provides protection at theexpense of a significant increase in the data management complexity. For effectivemanagement; it is critical to provide efficient selective document retrieval capability on theencrypted collection. In fact; considerable amount of searchable symmetric encryptionschemes have been designed in the literature to achieve this task. However; with theemergence of big data everywhere; available approaches are insufficient to address …,Proceedings of the 5th ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy,2015,14
Silver lining: Enforcing secure information flow at the cloud edge,Safwan Mahmud Khan; Kevin W Hamlen; Murat Kantarcioglu,SilverLine is a novel; exceptionally modular framework for enforcing mandatory informationflow policies for Java computations on commodity; data-processing; Platform-as-a-Serviceclouds by leveraging Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) and In-lined Reference Monitors(IRMs). Unlike traditional system-level approaches; which typically require modifications tothe cloud kernel software; OS/hypervisor; VM; or cloud file system; SilverLine automaticallyin-lines secure information flow tracking code into untrusted Java binaries as they arrive atthe cloud. This facilitates efficient enforcement of a large; flexible class of information flowand mandatory access control policies without any customization of the cloud or itsunderlying infrastructure. The cloud and the enforcement framework can therefore bemaintained completely separately and orthogonally (ie; modularly).

Contractual agreement design for enforcing honesty in cloud outsourcing,Robert Nix; Murat Kantarcioglu,Abstract To save time and money; businesses and individuals have begun outsourcing theirdata and computations to cloud computing services. These entities would; however; like toensure that the queries they request from the cloud services are being computed correctly. Inthis paper; we use the principles of economics and competition to vastly reduce thecomplexity of query verification on outsourced data. Instead of building a specializedcomputation system for verifying the result of a single outsourced query; we rely on asecond; non-colluding data outsourcing entity; whose services are required only a minisculefraction of the time. Using a game theoretic model; we show that given the proper incentivestructure; we can effectively deter dishonest behavior on the part of the data outsourcingservices with a very small expected cost increase. We then prove that the incentive for an …,International Conference on Decision and Game Theory for Security,2012,14
Preventing Cryptographic Key Leakage in Cloud Virtual Machines.,Erman Pattuk; Murat Kantarcioglu; Zhiqiang Lin; Huseyin Ulusoy,Abstract In a typical infrastructure-as-a-service cloud setting; different clients harness thecloud provider's services by executing virtual machines (VM). However; recent studies haveshown that the cryptographic keys; the most crucial component in many of our daily usedcryptographic protocols (eg; SSL/TLS); can be extracted using cross-VM side-channelattacks. To defeat such a threat; this paper introduces HERMES; a new system that aims toprotect the cryptographic keys in the cloud against any kind of cross-VM side-channelattacks by simply partitioning the cryptographic keys into random shares; and storing eachshare in a different VM. Moreover; it also periodically re-shares the cryptographic keys;thereby invalidating the potentially extracted partial ones. We have implemented HERMESas a library extension that is transparent to the application software; and performed deep …,USENIX Security Symposium,2014,13

Privacy-preserving data mining applications in the malicious model,Murat Kantarcioglu; Onur Kardes,Although the semi-honest model is reasonable in some cases; it is unrealistic to assume thatadversaries will al-ways follow the protocols exactly. In particular; malicious adversariescould deviate arbitrarily from their prescribed protocols. Clearly; protocols that can withstandmalicious adversaries provide more security. However; there is an ob-vious trade-off:protocols that are secure against malicious adversaries are generally more expensive thanthose secure against semi-honest adversaries only. In this paper; our goal is to make ananalysis of trade-offs between perfor-mance and security in privacy-preserving distributeddata mining algorithms in the two models. In order to make a realistic comparison; weenhance commonly used subpro-tocols that are secure in the semi-honest model with zeroknowledge proofs to be secure in the malicious model.

Towards fine grained RDF access control,Jyothsna Rachapalli; Vaibhav Khadilkar; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract The Semantic Web is envisioned as the future of the current web; where theinformation is enriched with machine understandable semantics. According to the WorldWide Web Consortium (W3C);" The Semantic Web provides a common framework thatallows data to be shared and reused across application; enterprise; and communityboundaries". Among the various technologies that empower Semantic Web; the mostsignificant ones are Resource Description Framework (RDF) and SPARQL; which facilitatedata integration and a means to query respectively. Although Semantic Web is elegantly andeffectively equipped for data sharing and integration via RDF; lack of efficient means tosecurely share data pose limitations in practice. In order to make data sharing andintegration pragmatic for Semantic Web; we present a query language based secure data …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2014,12
Efficient tree pattern queries on encrypted xml documents,Jianneng Cao; Fang-Yu Rao; Mehmet Kuzu; Elisa Bertino; Murat Kantarcioglu,Abstract Outsourcing XML documents is a challenging task; because it encrypts thedocuments; while still requiring efficient query processing. Past approaches on this topiceither leak structural information or fail to support searching that has constraints on XMLnode content. In addition; they adopt a filtering-and-refining framework; which requires theusers to prune false positives from the query results. To address these problems; we presenta solution for efficient evaluation of tree pattern queries (TPQs) on encrypted XMLdocuments. We create a domain hierarchy; such that each XML document can beembedded in it. By assigning each node in the hierarchy a position; we create for eachdocument a vector; which encodes both the structural and textual information about thedocument. Similarly; a vector is created also for a TPQ. Then; the matching between a …,Proceedings of the Joint EDBT/ICDT 2013 workshops,2013,12
Privacy-preserving data mining,Chris Clifton; M Kantarcıoğlu; Jaideep Vaidya,Abstract The growth of data mining has raised concerns among privacy advocates. Some ofthis is based on a misunderstanding of what data mining does. The previous chapters haveshown how data mining concentrates on extraction of rules; patterns and other suchsummary knowledge from large data sets. This would not seem to inherently violate privacy;which is generally concerned with the release of individual data values rather thansummaries.,*,2005,12
Multi-Keyword search over encrypted data with scoring and search pattern obfuscation,Cengiz Orencik; Ayse Selcuk; Erkay Savas; Murat Kantarcioglu,Abstract Search over encrypted data recently became a critical operation that raised aconsiderable amount of interest in both academia and industry. Especially; as outsourcing;sensitive data to cloud prove to be a strong trend to benefit from the unmatched storage andcomputing capacities thereof. Indeed; privacy-preserving search over encrypted data; an aptterm to address privacy-related issues concomitant in outsourcing sensitive data; have beenwidely investigated in the literature under different models and assumptions. In this work; wepropose an efficient scheme that allows privacy-preserving search over encrypted datausing queries with multiple keywords. Most important contributions of this work are asfollows. Firstly; using a property referred as δ δ-mean query obfuscation; the proposedscheme hides the search patterns; which are allowed to leak in many works in the …,International Journal of Information Security,2016,11
RETRO: a framework for semantics preserving SQL-to-SPARQL translation,Jyothsna Rachapalli; Vaibhav Khadilkar; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract. There have been several attempts to make RDBMS and RDF stores inter-operate.The most popular one; D2RQ; has explored one direction; ie; to look at RDBMS throughRDF lenses. In this paper we present RETRO; which investigates the reverse direction; ie; tolook at RDF through Relational lenses. RETRO generates a relational schema from an RDFstore; enabling a user to query RDF data using SQL. A significant advantage of this directionin-addition to interoperability is that it makes numerous relational tools developed over thepast several decades; available to the RDF stores. In order to provide interoperabilitybetween these two systems one needs to resolve the heterogeneity between their respectivedata models and include schema mapping; data mapping and query mapping in thetransformation process [5].

Scalable and efficient reasoning for enforcing role-based access control,Tyrone Cadenhead; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract Today; many organizations generate large amount of data and have many usersthat need only partial access to resources at any time to collaborate in making criticaldecisions. Thus; there is a need for a scalable access control model that simplifies themanagement of security policies and handles the heterogeneity inherent in the informationsystem. This paper proposes an ontology-based distributed solution to this problem; with thebenefits of being scalable and producing acceptable response times.,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2010,11
Query optimization in encrypted relational databases by vertical schema partitioning,Mustafa Canim; Murat Kantarcioglu; Ali Inan,Abstract Security and privacy concerns; as well as legal considerations; force manycompanies to encrypt the sensitive data in their databases. However; storing the data inencrypted format entails significant performance penalties during query processing. In thispaper; we address several design issues related to querying encrypted relationaldatabases. The experiments we conducted on benchmark datasets show that excessivedecryption costs during query processing result in CPU bottleneck. As a solution we proposea new method based on schema decomposition that partitions sensitive and non-sensitiveattributes of a relation into two separate relations. Our method improves the systemperformance dramatically by parallelizing disk IO latency with CPU-intensive operations (ie;encryption/decryption).,Workshop on Secure Data Management,2009,11
Managing risks in RBAC employed distributed environments,Ebru Celikel; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Role Based Access Control (RBAC) has been introduced in an effort to facilitateauthorization in database systems. It introduces roles as a new layer in between users andpermissions. This not only provides a well maintained access granting mechanism; but alsoalleviates the burden to manage multiple users. While providing comprehensive accesscontrol; current RBAC models and systems do not take into consideration the possible risksthat can be incurred with role misuse. In distributed environments a large number of usersare a very common case; and a considerable number of them are first time users. This factmagnifies the need to measure risk before and after granting an access. We investigate themeans of managing risks in RBAC employed distributed environments and introduce aprobability based novel risk model. Based on each role; we use information about user …,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2007,11
A framework for policies over provenance,Tyrone Cadenhead; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract Provenance captures the history of a data item. This ensures the quality; thetrustworthiness and the correctness of shared information; but the provenance may containsensitive information so we may need to hide it. Sometimes we need access control policiesto protect sensitive components and allow access based on certain properties. In othercases; we may need to share provenance but use redaction policies to circumvent therelease of sensitive information. In this paper; we formulate an automatic procedure overprovenance by combining these policies in an unified framework.,policy,2011,10
Query processing techniques for compliance with data confidence policies,Chenyun Dai; Dan Lin; Murat Kantarcioglu; Elisa Bertino; Ebru Celikel; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract Data integrity and quality is a very critical issue in many data-intensive decision-making applications. In such applications; decision makers need to be provided with highquality data on which they can rely on with high confidence. A key issue is that obtaininghigh quality data may be very expensive. We thus need flexible solutions to the problem ofdata integrity and quality. This paper proposes one such solution based on four keyelements. The first element is the association of a confidence value with each data item inthe database. The second element is the computation of the confidence values of queryresults by using lineage propagation. The third element is the notion of confidence policies.Such a policy restricts access to the query results by specifying the minimum confidencelevel that is required for use in a certain task by a certain subject. The fourth element is an …,Workshop on Secure Data Management,2009,10

A hybrid private record linkage scheme: Separating differentially private synopses from matching records,Jianneng Cao; Fang-Yu Rao; Elisa Bertino; Murat Kantarcioglu,Private record linkage protocols allow multiple parties to exchange matching records; whichrefer to the same entities or have similar values; while keeping the non-matching onessecret. Conventional protocols are based on computationally expensive cryptographicprimitives and therefore do not scale. To address these scalability issues; hybrid protocolshave been recently proposed that combine differential privacy techniques with securemultiparty computation techniques. However; a drawback of such protocols is that theydisclose to the parties both the matching records and the differentially private synopses ofthe datasets involved in the linkage. Consequently; differential privacy is no longer alwayssatisfied. To address this issue; we propose a novel framework; which separates the privatesynopses from the matching records. The two parties do not access the synopses directly …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,9
Efficient privacy-aware search over encrypted databases,Mehmet Kuzu; Mohammad Saiful Islam; Murat Kantarcioglu,Abstract In recent years; database as a service (DAS) model where data management isoutsourced to cloud service providers has become more prevalent. Although DAS modeloffers lower cost and flexibility; it necessitates the transfer of potentially sensitive data tountrusted cloud servers. To ensure the confidentiality; encryption of sensitive data before itstransfer to the cloud emerges as an important option. Encrypted storage provides protectionbut it complicates data processing including crucial selective record retrieval. To achieveselective retrieval over encrypted collection; considerable amount of searchable encryptionschemes have been proposed in the literature with distinct privacy guarantees. Among theavailable approaches; oblivious RAM based ones offer optimal privacy. However; they arecomputationally intensive and do not scale well to very large databases.

A game theoretical framework for adversarial learning,Murat Kantarcioglu; Bowei Xi; Chris Clifton,Abstract Many data mining applications; ranging from spam filtering to intrusion detection;are faced with active adversaries. In all these applications; initially successful classifiers willdegrade easily. This becomes a game between the adversary and the data miner: Theadversary modifies its strategy to avoid being detected by the current classifier; the dataminer then updates its classifier based on the new threats. In this paper; we investigate thepossibility of an equilibrium in this seemingly never ending game; where neither party hasan incentive to change. Modifying the classifier causes too many false positives with too littleincrease in true positives; changes by the adversary decrease the utility of the false negativeitems that aren't detected. We develop a game theoretic framework where the equilibriumbehavior of adversarial learning applications can be analyzed; and provide a solution for …,CERIAS 9th Annual Information Security Symposium,2008,9
An adaptable perturbation model of privacy preserving data mining,Li Liu; Bhavani Thuraisingham; Murat Kantarcioglu; Latifur Khan,Abstract Several approaches to privacy preserving data mining have been developed inrecent years. These approaches can be classified into two main categories; they are basedon perturbation and randomization techniques [1-4] and secure multi-party computationbased techniques (SMC)[5-9]. The approach proposed by Kargupta et. al in [10] poses achallenge to the perturbation and randomization-based approaches. It claims that suchapproaches may lose information as well as not provide privacy by introducing randomnoise to the data. By using random matrix properties; Kargupta et. al successfully separatesthe data from the random noise and subsequently discloses the original data. Severalapproaches [5-9] fall into the second category (ie the multi-party computation); but they allrequire very high computation costs. Furthermore; these multi-party computation based …,ICDM Workshop on Privacy and Security Aspects of Data Mining; Huston; TX US,2005,9

Privacy-aware dynamic feature selection,Erman Pattuk; Murat Kantarcioglu; Huseyin Ulusoy; Bradley Malin,Big data will enable the development of novel services that enhance a company's marketadvantage; competition; or productivity. At the same time; the utilization of such a servicecould disclose sensitive data in the process; which raises significant privacy concerns. Toprotect individuals; various policies; such as the Code of Fair Information Practices; as wellas recent laws require organizations to capture only the minimal amount of data necessaryto support a service. While this is a notable goal; choosing the minimal data is a non-trivialprocess; especially while considering privacy and utility constraints.

Sparse bayesian adversarial learning using relevance vector machine ensembles,Yan Zhou; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Data mining tasks are made more complicated when adversaries attack by modifyingmalicious data to evade detection. The main challenge lies in finding a robust learningmodel that is insensitive to unpredictable malicious data distribution. In this paper; wepresent a sparse relevance vector machine ensemble for adversarial learning. The noveltyof our work is the use of individualized kernel parameters to model potential adversarialattacks during model training. We allow the kernel parameters to drift in the direction thatminimizes the likelihood of the positive data. This step is interleaved with learning theweights and the weight priors of a relevance vector machine. Our empirical resultsdemonstrate that an ensemble of such relevance vector machine models is more robust toadversarial attacks.,Data Mining (ICDM); 2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on,2012,8

Privacy-preserving distributed data mining and processing on horizontally partitioned data,Murat Kantarcioglu,Data mining technology has emerged as a means of identifying patterns and trends fromlarge quantities of data. Recently; there has been growing concern over the privacyimplications of data mining. Some of this is public pcrccption: Tho “Data Mining MoratoriumAct of 2003" introduced in the US Senate [36] was based on a fear of government searchesof private data for individual information; rather than what the technical community views asData Mining. However; concerns remain. VVhile data mining is generally aimed atproducing general models rather than learning about speciﬁc individuals; the process ofdata mining creates integrated data warehouses that pose real privacy issues.

SEMROD steers data and computation through public andprivate machines in such a way that no knowledge about sensitive data is leaked to publicmachines. For this purpose; SEMROD keeps trace of intermediate keys (generated duringMR execution) that become sensitive; based on which it makes dynamic task schedulingdecisions. SEMROD guarantees that adversaries viz. public machines) cannot gainany``additional''information about sensitive data from either the data stored on publicmachines or the communication between public and private machines during job execution.SEMROD extends naturally from a single MR job to multi-phase MR jobs that result; forinstance; from compiling Hive queries into MR jobs.

In this paper; we use two snapshotsfrom the Twitter network and analyze data interest patterns of users in time to understandindividual and collective user behavior on social networks. Building topical profiles of users;we propose novel metrics to identify anomalous friendships; and validate our results withAmazon Mechanical Turk experiments. We show that although more than 80% of allfriendships on Twitter are created due to data interests; 83% of all users have at least onefriendship that can be explained neither by users' past interest nor collective behavior ofother similar users.,Social Network Analysis and Mining,2014,7

Static disassembly is a crucialprerequisite for software reverse engineering; and has many applications in computersecurity and binary analysis. The general problem is provably undecidable because of theheavy use of unaligned instruction encodings and dynamically computed control flows in thex86 architecture. Limited work in machine learning and data mining has been undertaken onthis subject. This paper shows that semantic meanings of opcode sequences can beleveraged to infer similarities between groups of opcode and operand sequences.

Adversarial learning with bayesian hierarchical mixtures of experts,Yan Zhou; Murat Kantarcioglu,Abstract Many data mining applications operate in adversarial environment; for example;webpage ranking in the presence of web spam. A growing number of adversarial datamining techniques are recently developed; providing robust solutions under specific defense-attack models. Existing techniques are tied to distributional assumptions geared towardsminimizing the undesirable impact of given attack models. However; the large variety ofattack strategies renders the adversarial learning problem multimodal. Therefore; it calls fora more flexible modeling ideology for equivocal input. In this paper we present a Bayesianhierarchical mixtures of experts for adversarial learning.

When do firms invest in privacy-preserving technologies?,Murat Kantarcioglu; Alain Bensoussan; SingRu Celine Hoe,Abstract Privacy is a central concern in the information age. In some circumstances;customers' decisions whether to use firms' services rely on the extent of privacy that firms areable to provide; for example; the use of certain banking services; health care informationtechnology [7]... etc. Firms thus face crucial assessment of investment on privacy-preservingtechnologies. Two important factors affect firms' valuation:(1) a customer's valuation of hisprivate information and (2) a customer's profitability to the firm. The former determines thepotential customer base that a firm can exploit given certain privacy protection; and the latterestablishes profits that a firm can make.

Expanding access to large-scale genomic data while promoting privacy: a game theoretic approach,Zhiyu Wan; Yevgeniy Vorobeychik; Weiyi Xia; Ellen Wright Clayton; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bradley Malin,Emerging scientific endeavors are creating big data repositories of data from millions ofindividuals. Sharing data in a privacy-respecting manner could lead to importantdiscoveries; but high-profile demonstrations show that links between de-identified genomicdata and named persons can sometimes be reestablished. Such re-identification attackshave focused on worst-case scenarios and spurred the adoption of data-sharing practicesthat unnecessarily impede research. To mitigate concerns; organizations have traditionallyrelied upon legal deterrents; like data use agreements; and are considering suppressing oradding noise to genomic variants. In this report; we use a game theoretic lens to developmore effective; quantifiable protections for genomic data sharing. This is a fundamentallydifferent approach because it accounts for adversarial behavior and capabilities and …,The American Journal of Human Genetics,2017,6
Risk-aware data processing in hybrid clouds,Vaibhav Khadilkar; Kerim Y Oktay; Bijit Hore; Murat Kantarcioglu; Sharad Mehrotra; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract: This paper explores query processing in a hybrid cloud model where a user's localcomputing capability is exploited alongside public cloud services to deliver an efficient andsecure data management solution. Hybrid clouds offer numerous economic advantagesincluding the ability to better manage data privacy and confidentiality; as well as exertingcontrol on monetary expenses of consuming cloud services by exploiting local resources.Nonetheless; query processing in hybrid clouds introduces numerous challenges; theforemost of which is; how to partition data and computation between the public and privatecomponents of the cloud. The solution must account for the characteristics of the workloadthat will be executed; the monetary costs associated with acquiring/operating cloud servicesas well as the risks affiliated with storing sensitive data on a public cloud.

Poster: Inference attacks against searchable encryption protocols,Mohammad Saiful Islam; Mehmet Kuzu; Murat Kantarcioglu,Abstract The advent of cloud computing has ushered in an era of mass data storage inremote servers. Remote data storage offers reduced data management overhead for dataowners in a cost effective manner. Sensitive documents; however; need to be stored inencrypted format due to security concerns. But; encrypted storage makes it difficult to searchon the stored documents. Therefore; this poses a major barrier towards selective retrieval ofencrypted documents from the remote servers. Various protocols have been proposed forkeyword search over encrypted data (commonly referred to as searchable encryption) toaddress this issue. Oblivious RAM type protocols offer secure search over encrypted data;but are too expensive to be used in practical applications. Unfortunately; all of the symmetrickey based encryption protocols leak data access patterns due to efficiency reasons.

Mixture of gaussian models and bayes error under differential privacy,Bowei Xi; Murat Kantarcioglu; Ali Inan,Abstract Gaussian mixture models are an important tool in Bayesian decision theory. In thisstudy; we focus on building such models over statistical database protected underdifferential privacy. Our approach involves querying necessary statistics from a databaseand building a Bayesian classifier over the noise added responses generated according todifferential privacy. We formally analyze the sensitivity of our query set. Since there aremultiple methods to query a statistic; either directly or indirectly; we analyze the sensitivitiesfor different querying methods. Furthermore we establish theoretical bounds for the Bayeserror for the univariate (one dimensional) case. We study the Bayes error for the multivariate(high dimensional) case in experiments with both simulated data and real life data.

Bi-directional translation of relational data into virtual RDF stores,Sunitha Ramanujam; Vaibhav Khadilkar; Latifur Khan; Steven Seida; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham,A vast majority of the world's valuable data currently exists in relational databases and otherlegacy storage systems. In order for Semantic Web applications to access such legacy datawithout replication or synchronization of the same; the gap between the two needs to bebridged. Several efforts exist that publish relational data as Resource DescriptionFramework (RDF) triples; however almost all current work in this arena is uni-directional;presenting the existing and new data from an underlying relational database into acorresponding virtual RDF store in a read-only manner.

Towards data confidentiality and a vulnerability analysis framework for cloud computing,Kerim Y Oktay; Mahadevan Gomathisankaran; Murat Kantarcioglu; Sharad Mehrotra; Anoop Singhal,Abstract This chapter explores two related challenges in the context of secure processing incloud computing. The first is the concern of “loss of control” that results from outsourcing dataand computation to the clouds. While loss of control has multiple manifestations; the chapterfocusses on the potential loss of data privacy and confidentiality when cloud providers areuntrusted. Instead of using a well studied (but still unsolved) approach of encrypting datawhen outsourcing it and computing on the encrypted domain; the paper advocates risk-based processing over a hybrid cloud architecture as a possible solution. Hybrid clouds area composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private; community; or public) thatremain unique entities; but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technologythat enables data and application portability.

REDACT: a framework for sanitizing RDF data,Jyothsna Rachapalli; Vaibhav Khadilkar; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract Resource Description Framework (RDF) is the foundational data model of theSemantic Web; and is essentially designed for integration of heterogeneous data fromvarying sources. However; lack of security features for managing sensitive RDF data whilesharing may result in privacy breaches; which in turn; result in loss of user trust. Therefore; itis imperative to provide an infrastructure to secure RDF data. We present a set of graphsanitization operations that are built as an extension to SPARQL. These operations allowone to sanitize sensitive parts of an RDF graph and further enable one to build moresophisticated security and privacy features; thus allowing RDF data to be shared securely.,Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web,2013,5
Approximate privacy-preserving data mining on vertically partitioned data,Robert Nix; Murat Kantarcioglu; Keesook J Han,Abstract In today's ever-increasingly digital world; the concept of data privacy has becomemore and more important. Researchers have developed many privacy-preservingtechnologies; particularly in the area of data mining and data sharing. These technologiescan compute exact data mining models from private data without revealing private data; butare generally slow. We therefore present a framework for implementing efficient privacy-preserving secure approximations of data mining tasks. In particular; we implement twosketching protocols for the scalar (dot) product of two vectors which can be used as sub-protocols in larger data mining tasks. These protocols can lead to approximations whichhave high accuracy; low data leakage; and one to two orders of magnitude improvement inefficiency. We show these accuracy and efficiency results through extensive …,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2012,5
Secure data processing in a hybrid cloud,Vaibhav Khadilkar; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract: Cloud computing has made it possible for a user to be able to select a computingservice precisely when needed. However; certain factors such as security of data andregulatory issues will impact a user's choice of using such a service. A solution to theseproblems is the use of a hybrid cloud that combines a user's local computing capabilities (formission-or organization-critical tasks) with a public cloud (for less influential tasks). Weforesee three challenges that must be overcome before the adoption of a hybrid cloudapproach: 1) data design: How to partition relations in a hybrid cloud?

Modeling adversarial learning as nested Stackelberg games,Yan Zhou; Murat Kantarcioglu,Abstract Many data mining applications potentially operate in an adversarial environmentwhere adversaries adapt their behavior to evade detection. Typically adversaries alter dataunder their control to cause a large divergence of distribution between training and test data.Existing state-of-the-art adversarial learning techniques try to address this problem in whichthere is only a single type of adversary. In practice; a learner often has to face multiple typesof adversaries that may employ different attack tactics. In this paper; we tackle thechallenges of multiple types of adversaries with a nested Stackelberg game framework. Wedemonstrate the effectiveness of our framework with extensive empirical results on bothsynthetic and real data sets. Our results demonstrate that the nested game framework offersmore reliable defense against multiple types of attackers.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2016,4
AccountableMR: Toward accountable MapReduce systems,Huseyin Ulusoy; Murat Kantarcioglu; Erman Pattuk; Lalana Kagal,Traditional security techniques (eg; authorization and encryption) have been extensivelyused in data management systems to provide security and privacy for many years. However;recent security breaches (eg; WikiLeaks) showed that even if perfect access control isachieved; malicious insiders can still infer sensitive information and can misuse thissensitive information. To address this issue; accountability is introduced to deterinappropriate use of data through provision of usage control; privacy-aware interfaces; andcareful monitoring and auditing. In this paper; we propose an accountable MapReducearchitecture; where specific data usage is allowed after fine-grained transparentauthorizations (ie; individual record level); and such data usage are subject to effectiveaccountability assessments by those who seek to assure privacy and security policy …,Big Data (Big Data); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,4
Hippocratic binary instrumentation: First do no harm,Meera Sridhar; Richard Wartell; Kevin W Hamlen,Abstract In-lined Reference Monitors (IRMs) cure binary software of security violations byinstrumenting them with runtime security checks. Although over a decade of research hasfirmly established the power and versatility of the in-lining approach to security; itswidespread adoption by industry remains impeded by concerns that in-lining may corrupt orotherwise harm intended; safe behaviors of the software it protects. Practitioners with suchconcerns are unwilling to adopt the technology despite its security benefits for fear that somesoftware may break in ways that are hard to diagnose.

Self-training with selection-by-rejection,Yan Zhou; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Practical machine learning and data mining problems often face shortage of labeled trainingdata. Self-training algorithms are among the earliest attempts of using unlabeled data toenhance learning. Traditional self-training algorithms label unlabeled data on whichclassifiers trained on limited training data have the highest confidence. In this paper; a self-training algorithm that decreases the disagreement region of hypotheses is presented. Thealgorithm supplements the training set with self-labeled instances. Only instances thatgreatly reduce the disagreement region of hypotheses are labeled and added to the trainingset. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed self-training algorithm can effectivelyimprove classification performance.,Data Mining (ICDM); 2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on,2012,4

However; formulating correctpolicy specifications for such frameworks to enforce remains a daunting undertaking withfew supporting tools. A visualization approach is proposed to aid in this task. In contrast toexisting approaches; which typically involve tedious and error-prone manual inspection ofcomplex binary code; the proposed framework provides automatically generated; security-aware visual models that follow the UML specification. This facilitates formulation and testingof prototype security policy specifications in a faster and more reliable manner than ispossible with existing manual approaches.,*,2010,4

However; for data to be usedto their full power; data security and privacy are critical. Data security and privacy have beenwidely investigated over the past thirty years. However; today we face new issues insecuring and protecting data; that result in new challenging research directions. Some ofthose challenges arise from increasing privacy concerns with respect to the use of suchhuge amount of data; and from the need of reconciling privacy with the use of data. Otherchallenges arise because the deployments of new data collection and processing devices;such as those used in IoT systems; increase the attack potential.

Leveraging Unique CPS Properties to Design Better Privacy-Enhancing Algorithms,Jairo Giraldo; Alvaro Cardenas; Murat Kantarcioglu,Abstract Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have unique properties that can be exploited todesign new privacy-enhancing technologies that minimize the negative impact to the utilityof CPS. In this paper we show two examples of these properties. The first example looks athow differential privacy degrades CPS performance due to the large noise addition; and wethen show how the inherent noise of CPS can be leveraged to reduce the additional noiseadded by differential privacy algorithms; and therefore; minimize the negative impact on thesystem utility and safety. In the second example we look at the ability to sample at sensorreadings on demand; and how this flexibility can be used to design adaptive sensorsampling algorithms that hide sensitive information without the need to add noise.,Proceedings of the Hot Topics in Science of Security: Symposium and Bootcamp,2017,2
Process-driven data privacy,Weiyi Xia; Murat Kantarcioglu; Zhiyu Wan; Raymond Heatherly; Yevgeniy Vorobeychik; Bradley Malin,Abstract The quantity of personal data gathered by service providers via our daily activitiescontinues to grow at a rapid pace. The sharing; and the subsequent analysis of; such datacan support a wide range of activities; but concerns around privacy often prompt anorganization to transform the data to meet certain protection models (eg; k-anonymity or ε-differential privacy). These models; however; are based on simplistic adversarialframeworks; which can lead to both under-and over-protection. For instance; such modelsoften assume that an adversary attacks a protected record exactly once. We introduce aprincipled approach to explicitly model the attack process as a series of steps. Specifically;we engineer a factored Markov decision process (FMDP) to optimally plan an attack from theadversary's perspective and assess the privacy risk accordingly.

A dynamic approach to detect anomalous queries on relational databases,Mohammad Saiful Islam; Mehmet Kuzu; Murat Kantarcioglu,Abstract Protecting sensitive datasets from insider and outsider attacks has been a majorconcern over the years. Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) has been thede facto standard to store; retrieve and manage large datasets efficiently in the last fewyears. However; as surprising as it seems; not a lot of works can be found in the literaturewhich protect databases from anomalous accesses. In this paper; we present a novelIntrusion Detection System (IDS) for relational databases. Our primary objective is to protectdatabases from both insider and outsider threats by detecting anomalous access patternsusing Hidden Markov Model (HMM). While most of the previous notable works in this areafocus on query syntax to detect anomalous access; our approach takes into account theamount of sensitive information a query result contains to detect a potential intrusion …,Proceedings of the 5th ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy,2015,2

Risk aware approach to data confidentiality in cloud computing,Kerim Yasin Oktay; Vaibhav Khadilkar; Murat Kantarcioglu; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract This paper explores the issue of “loss of control” that results when users outsourcedata and computation to the clouds. While loss of control has multiple manifestations; wefocus on the data privacy and confidentiality implications when cloud providers areuntrusted. Instead of following the well studied (but still unsolved) path of encrypting datawhen outsourcing and computing on the encrypted domain; the paper advocates a risk-based approach over a hybrid cloud architecture as a possible solution. Hybrid clouds are acomposition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private; community; or public) thatremain unique entities; but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technologythat enables data and application portability. Hybrid clouds offer an opportunity to selectivelyoutsource data and computation based on the level of sensitivity involved. The paper …,International Conference on Information Systems Security,2013,2
Measuring expertise and bias in cyber security using cognitive and neuroscience approaches,Daniel Krawczyk; James Bartlett; Murat Kantarcioglu; Kevin Hamlen; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Toward the ultimate goal of enhancing human performance in cyber security; we attempt tounderstand the cognitive components of cyber security expertise. Our initial focus is on cybersecurity attackers-often called “hackers”. Our first aim is to develop behavioral measures ofaccuracy and response time to examine the cognitive processes of pattern-recognition;reasoning and decision-making that underlie the detection and exploitation of securityvulnerabilities. Understanding these processes at a cognitive level will lead to theorydevelopment addressing questions about how cyber security expertise can be identified;quantified; and trained. In addition to behavioral measures our plan is to conduct afunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of neural processing patterns that candifferentiate persons with different levels of cyber security expertise.

Studying dynamic equilibrium of cloud computing adoption with application of Mean Field Games,SingRu Hoe; Murat Kantarcioglu; Alain Bensoussan,Computing is undergoing a substantial shift from client/server to the cloud. The enthusiasmfor cloud infrastructures is not only present in the business world; but also extends togovernment agencies. Managers of both segments thus need to have a clear view of howthis new era will evolve in the coming years; in order to appropriately react to a changingeconomic and technological environment. In this study; we explore the dynamic equilibriumof cloud computing adoption through the application of Mean Field Games. In ourformulation; each agent (ie; each firm or government agency) arbitrates between “continuingto implement the traditional on-site computing paradigm” and “moving to adopt the cloudcomputing paradigm”.

Data intensive query processing for Semantic Web data using Hadoop and MapReduce,Mohammad Farhan Husain,Abstract Semantic Web is an emerging area to augment human reasoning. Varioustechnologies are being developed in this arena which have been standardized by the WorldWide Web Consortium (W3C). One such standard is the Resource Description Framework(RDF). Semantic Web technologies can be utilized to build efficient and scalable systems forCloud Computing. With the explosion of semantic web technologies; large RDF graphs arecommon place. This poses significant challenges for the storage and retrieval of RDFgraphs. Current frameworks do not scale for large RDF graphs and as a result do notaddress these challenges.

An Evaluation of Privacy; Risks and Utility with Provenance,Tyrone Cadenhead; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract—The web provides an open environment; where anyone can assert anything andpublish it; therefore; it is important for users to be aware of the data quality in order to use thedata appropriately. Many published databases are in fact legitimate and contain sensitiveinformation that should not be disclosed to unauthorized users. To decide which databaseshave high quality data; we could use provenance information to accompany the informationretrieved. Releasing provenance data; however; could have important privacyconsequences. Therefore; we need to be careful in choosing what kind of provenanceinformation to reveal. In our work; we propose a Semantic Webbased inferencing frameworkthat provides a risk-based approach to decide what kind of provenance information torelease.,Secur. Knowl. Manag.

Enforcing honesty in assured information sharing within a distributed system,Ryan Layfield; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract The growing number of distributed information systems such as the internet hascreated a need for security in data sharing. When several autonomous parties attempt toshare data; there is not necessarily any guarantee that the participants will share datatruthfully. In fact; there is often a large incentive to engage in behavior that can sabotage theeffectiveness of such a system. We analyze these situations in light of game theory; amathematical model which permits us to consider behavior and choices for any autonomousparty. This paper uses this theory to create a behavior enforcement method that does notneed a central management system. We use a simple punishment method that is inherentlyavailable in most scenarios. Our approach is applicable to a variety of assured informationsharing applications where the members of a coalition have to work together to solve a …,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2007,2
Secure logical schema and decomposition algorithm for proactive context dependent attribute based inference control,Uğur Turan; İsmail Hakkı Toroslu; Murat Kantarcıoğlu,Abstract Inference problem has always been an important and challenging topic of dataprivacy in databases. In relational databases; the traditional solution to this problem was todefine views on relational schemas to restrict the subset of attributes and operationsavailable to the users in order to prevent unwanted inferences. This method is a form ofdecomposition strategy; which mainly concentrates on the granularity of the accessible fieldsto the users; to prevent sensitive information inference. Nowadays; due to increasing datasharing among parties; the possibility of constructing complex indirect methods to obtainsensitive data has also increased. Therefore; we need to not only consider security threatsdue to direct access to sensitive data but also address indirect inference channels usingfunctional and probabilistic dependencies (eg; deducing gender of an individual from his …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2017,1
Security vs. privacy: How integrity attacks can be masked by the noise of differential privacy,Jairo Giraldo; Alvaro A Cardenas; Murat Kantarcioglu,Privacy concerns have increased in the last years due to the unprecedented scale of datacollected regarding human activity. Differential privacy has emerged in the last decade as animportant mechanism to ensure privacy by adding random noise with a specific distributionto the information being collected (eg; adding noise to smart meters; and sensor readings).Differential privacy has been mainly used in private databases; but lately it has also beenextended to consider applications like estimation; consensus algorithms; and control ofdynamical systems. In addition to privacy; another threat to modern control systems is that ofintegrity attacks; where an attacker compromises a sensor or control signal and thenattempts to drive a dynamical system to an undesired state.

Detecting discrimination in a black-box classifier,Yasmeen Alufaisan; Murat Kantarcioglu; Yan Zhou,Data mining techniques are playing an increasing role in making crucial decisions in ourdaily lives ranging from credit card approvals to employment decisions. Typically algorithmsused to build decision models remain as a black-box to the end user. Therefore the processof decision making appears to be opaque. At the same time; increasing the transparency ofa black-box decision making model allows us to discover hidden discrimination; and holdentities accountable. Although algorithmic transparency with respect to black box classifiersrequires addressing many challenges; our main objective in this paper is to investigatewhether a black-box classification model is biased against certain subgroups. Specifically;we study the indirect discrimination of hidden protected features.

Searching for software diversity: attaining artificial diversity through program synthesis,Gilmore R Lundquist; Vishwath Mohan; Kevin W Hamlen,Abstract A means of attaining richer; more comprehensive forms of software diversity on amass scale is proposed through leveraging and repurposing a closely related; yet heretoforeuntapped; line of computer science research---automatic program synthesis. It is argued thatthe search-based methodologies presently used for obtaining implementations fromspecifications can be broadened relatively easily to a search for many candidate solutions;potentially diversifying the software monoculture. Small-scale experiments using the Rosettesynthesis tool offer preliminary support for this proposed approach. But the possible rewardsare not without danger: It is argued that the same approach can power a dangerous newlevel of sophistication for malware mutation and reactively adaptive software threats.,Proceedings of the 2016 New Security Paradigms Workshop,2016,1
Practical Differentially Private Modeling of Human Movement Data,Harichandan Roy; Murat Kantarcioglu; Latanya Sweeney,Abstract Exciting advances in big data analysis suggest that sharing personal information;such as health and location data; among multiple other parties could have significantsocietal benefits. However; privacy issues often hinder data sharing. Recently; differentialprivacy emerged as an important tool to preserve privacy while sharing privacy-sensitivedata. The basic idea is simple. Differential privacy guarantees that results learned fromshared data do not change much based on the inclusion or exclusion of any single person'sdata. Despite the promise; existing differential privacy techniques addresses specific utilitygoals and/or query types (eg; count queries); so it is not clear whether they can preserveutility for arbitrary types of queries.

It isalso an attractive cloud outsourcing technology: driven by economical benefits; many majorcompanies like Amazon; Google; and Microsoft provide key-value storage services to theircustomers. However; customers are reluctant to utilize such services due to security andprivacy concerns.

Practical privacy preserving record integration and search,Mehmet Kuzu,Abstract The integration of information dispersed among multiple repositories is a crucialstep for accurate data analytics. In support of this goal; it is critical to devise procedures foridentifying similar records across distinct data sources. At the same time; to adhere toprivacy regulations and policies; such procedures should protect the confidentiality of theindividuals to whom the information corresponds. Various techniques have been proposedto resolve the tension; involving secure multi-party computation (SMC) and similaritypreserving data transformation. SMC methods provide secure and accurate solutions to theproblem; but they are prohibitively expensive in practice.

This trend has been accompanied by numerousincidents of data theft and has resulted in more corporations preferring to store theirsensitive records in an encrypted format. Since traditional cryptographic operations entailsignificant amount of arithmetic calculations; latencies generally arise while recording orretrieving sensitive data.

This paperoffers an optimized decomposition strategy for the external schema; which concentrates onthe privacy policy and required associations of attributes for the intended user roles. Themethod proposed in this article performs a proactive decomposition of the external schema;in order to satisfy both the forbidden and required associations of attributes. Functionaldependency constraints of a database schema can be represented as a graph; in which …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1803.00497,2018,*

Spatial counts under differential privacy mechanism on changing spatial scales,Jun Jiang; Bowei Xi; Murat Kantarcioglu,Abstract With a spatial statistical database covering a large region; how to publishdifferential privacy protected information is a challenge. In previous works; information waspublished using large fixed spatial cells. In this paper; we develop novel flexible methods topublish the spatial information; which allows the users to freely move around the largeregion; zoom in and zoom out at arbitrary locations; and obtain information over spatialareas both large and small. We develop two methods to publish the spatial informationprotected under differential privacy. First the region is divided into the smallest spatial cells;where each cell does not observe an event happening more than once. Given repeatedmeasurements; such as multiple day data; the noise added Bernoulli probabilities arecomputed for all the smallest spatial cells.

Building a Dossier on the Cheap: Integrating Distributed Personal Data Resources Under Cost Constraints,Imrul Chowdhury Anindya; Harichandan Roy; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bradley Malin,Abstract A wide variety of personal data is routinely collected by numerous organizationsthat; in turn; share and sell their collections for analytic investigations (eg; market research).To preserve privacy; certain identifiers are often redacted; perturbed or even removed. Asubstantial number of attacks have shown that; if care is not taken; such data can be linkedto external resources to determine the explicit identifiers (eg; personal names) or infersensitive attributes (eg; income) for the individuals from whom the data was collected. Assuch; organizations increasingly rely upon record linkage methods to assess the risk suchattacks pose and adopt countermeasures accordingly.

There are various initiativesto make these datasets more widely available to recipients who sign Data Use Certificateagreements; whereby penalties are levied for violations. A particularly popular penalty is thetemporary revocation; often for several months; of the recipient's data usage rights.

Security and privacy trade-offs in CPS by leveraging inherent differential privacy,Jairo Giraldo; Alvaro Cardenas; Murat Kantarcioglu,Cyber-physical systems are subject to natural uncertainties and sensor noise that can beamplified/attenuated due to feedback. In this work; we want to leverage these properties inorder to define the inherent differential privacy of feedback-control systems without theaddition of an external differential privacy noise. If larger levels of privacy are required; weintroduce a methodology to add an external differential privacy mechanism that injects theminimum amount of noise that is needed. On the other hand; we show how the combinationof inherent and external noise affects system security in terms of the impact that integrityattacks can impose over the system while remaining undetected. We formulate a bileveloptimization problem to redesign the control parameters in order to minimize the attackimpact for a desired level of inherent privacy.,Control Technology and Applications (CCTA); 2017 IEEE Conference on,2017,*

Gaussian Mixture Models for Classification and Hypothesis Tests Under Differential Privacy,Xiaosu Tong; Bowei Xi; Murat Kantarcioglu; Ali Inan,Abstract Many statistical models are constructed using very basic statistics: mean vectors;variances; and covariances. Gaussian mixture models are such models. When a data setcontains sensitive information and cannot be directly released to users; such models can beeasily constructed based on noise added query responses. The models nonethelessprovide preliminary results to users. Although the queried basic statistics meet thedifferential privacy guarantee; the complex models constructed using these statistics may notmeet the differential privacy guarantee. However it is up to the users to decide how to querya database and how to further utilize the queried results.

Such smartindustrial control systems fall into the category of Internet of Things (IoT). However; in manycases; the data transmitted by such IoT devices includes sensitive information and users arefaced with an all-or-nothing choice: either they adopt the proposed services and releasetheir private data; or refrain from using services which could be beneficial but posesignificant privacy risks. Unfortunately; encryption alone does not solve the problem; thoughtechniques to counter these privacy risks are emerging (eg; by using applications that alter;merge or bundle data to ensure they cannot be linked to a particular user).

A Practical Framework for Executing Complex Queries over Encrypted Multimedia Data,Fahad Shaon; Murat Kantarcioglu,Abstract Over the last few years; data storage in cloud based services has been very populardue to easy management and monetary advantages of cloud computing. Recentdevelopments showed that such data could be leaked due to various attacks. To addresssome of these attacks; encrypting sensitive data before sending to cloud emerged as animportant protection mechanism. If the data is encrypted with traditional techniques;selective retrieval of encrypted data becomes challenging. To address this challenge;efficient searchable encryption schemes have been developed over the years.

Data integration is one of the key features of RDF;however; absence of secure means for managing sensitive RDF data may prevent sharingof critical data altogether or may cause serious damage. Towards this end we present alanguage for sanitizing RDF graphs; which comprises a set of sanitization operations thattransform a graph by concealing the sensitive data.

Extending the classification of nodes in social networks,Raymond Heatherly; Murat Kantarcioglu,Because of computational concerns; social network analysis generally uses only directlyconnected nodes to perform classification tasks. However; recent research indicates that thismethod of classification may not consider that nodes in the graph could have differentinfluence over other nodes near them in the graph. It is possible that well-selected nodesmay have a stronger importance in a social graph. Here; we analyze methods by whichthese important nodes may be identified and used to improve the classification of nodeswithin the social graph. We also show the effect of incorporating these important nodes insocial network classification.,Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI); 2011 IEEE International Conference on,2011,*

Secured data provenance using semantic web technologies,Tyrone Cadenhead,Abstract Provenance is the lineage of a resource (or data item) and is essential for variousdomains; including healthcare; intelligence; E-science; legal and industry. The ongoingmutual relationships among entities in these domains rely on sharing quality information;which has created a critical need for provenance in these domains. However; revealingcomplete provenance raises security concerns; as provenance contains both sensitive andnon-sensitive information. The main challenge of protecting provenance lies in its directedgraph structure. This structure captures the history of data items and their causalrelationships. Furthermore; current security policies such as access control and redactionwere mainly developed for protecting single data items or data records; and therefore cannotextend to protecting the lineage of a data item.

The nature ofan epidemic requires careful consideration of all possible vectors over which an infectioncan spread. Our work takes the SIR model and creates a detailed hybridization of existingsimulations to allow a large search space to be explored. We then create a Stackelberggame to evaluate all possibilities with respect to the investment of available resources andconsider the resulting scenarios.

Preventing Private Information Inference,Raymond Heatherly; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract On-line social networks; such as Facebook; are increasingly utilized by manypeople. These networks allow users to publish details about them-selves and connect totheir friends. Some of the information revealed inside these networks is meant to be private.Yet it is possible that corporations could use learning algorithms on released data to predictundisclosed private information. In this paper; we explore how to launch inference attacksusing released social networking data to predict undisclosed private information aboutindividuals.

Horizontally Partitioned Data,Murat Kantarcioglu,A hash function is a well-defined deterministic algorithm that takes as input data of arbitrarylength and produces a short fixed-length digital representation of the data; or a digest; as itsoutput. The output of a hash function can serve the role of a digital ''fingerprint''of the inputdata; as an important design property of hash functions is that of collision resilience: twohashes produced on different inputs are very unlikely to result in the same value.Furthermore; given a hash function output; it is normally infeasible to find a (previouslyunseen) input that matches that output (this property is called preimage resistance).,*,2009,*
Geospatial Semantic Web; Definition,Bhavani Thuraisingham; Latifur Khan; Ganesh Subbiah; Ashraful Alam; Murat Kantarcioglu,Gaussian processes (GPs) are local approximation techniques that model spatial data byplacing (and updating) priors on the covariance structures underlying the data. Originallydeveloped for geo-spatial contexts; they are also applicable in general contexts that involvecomputing and modeling with multi-level spatial aggregates; eg; modeling a configurationspace for crystallographic design; casting folding energies as a function of a protein'scontact map; and formulation of vaccination policies taking into account social dynamics ofindividuals. Typically; we assume a parametrized covariance structure underlying the data tobe modeled. We estimate the covariance parameters conditional on the locations for whichwe have observed data; and use the inferred structure to make predictions at new locations.GPs have a probabilistic basis that allow us to estimate variances at unsampled locations …,*,2008,*
Report# 4 Research and simulation of game theoretical techniques for data sharing among semi-trustworthy partners,Ryan Layfield; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract Our objective within our work has been to consider the interaction of participantswithin a loose coalition. In particular; we are interested in a scenario in which those involvedhave made a reluctant but necessary decision to trade information to achieve some goal. Agreat deal of work has already been done in the areas of secret sharing and protocolenforcement. However; even if agreements to exchange are kept; there is no guaranteewhat is shared is legitimate. The ultimate goal of this research is to create a behavior whichworks optimally against lying agencies while taking advantage of implicit trust. Our results atthis point in the research suggest our algorithm is effective against basic opponents; thoughmore refinement is needed. We discuss which behaviors worked for the players and why;with regards to the motivating factors for each strategy. Essentially we are using game …,Information Operations Across Infospheres,2006,*
Individually Adaptable Perturbation Model for Privacy Preserving Data Mining,Li Liu; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham,ABSTRACT Perturbation method is a very important technique in privacy preserving datamining. In this technique; loss of information versus preservation of privacy is always a tradeoff. The question is; how much is the user willing to compromise his or her privacy? This is achoice that changes from individual to individual. In this paper; we propose an individuallyadaptable perturbation model; which enables the individuals to choose their own privacylevel. Hence our model provides different privacy guarantees for different privacypreferences. We test our new perturbation model by applying different reconstructionmethods to the perturbed dataseis. Furthermore; we build decision tree models on thereconstructed dataset to test the effect of our perturbation model on the data mining results.These results indicate that our model enables the users to choose their own privacy level …,*,2006,*

CERIAS Tech Report 2005-51 PRIVACY-PRESERVING DISTRIBUTED DATA MINING AND PROCESSING ON HORIZONTALLY PARTITIONED DATA,Murat Kantarcioglu,Data mining technology has emerged as a means of identifying patterns and trends fromlarge quantities of data. Recently; there has been growing concern over the privacyimplications of data mining. Some of this is public perception: The “Data Mining MoratoriumAct of 2003” introduced in the US Senate [36] was based on a fear of government searchesof private data for individual information; rather than what the technical community views asData Mining. However; concerns remain. While data mining is generally aimed at producinggeneral models rather than learning about specific individuals; the process of data miningcreates integrated data warehouses that pose real privacy issues. Data that is of limitedsensitivity by itself becomes highly sensitive when integrated; and gathering the data undera single roof greatly increases the opportunity for misuse.

We focus on a problem faced by independenttrucking companies that have separate pickup and delivery tasks; the identification ofpotential efficiency enhancing task swaps between these companies. A second goal is tolimit the information the parties must reveal to identify these swaps. By integrating state-of-the-art techniques from cryptography into an operations context we present an algorithm thatfinds opportunities to swap loads without revealing any information except the loadsswapped; along with proofs of the security.

Adversarial Data Mining: A Game Theoretic Approach,Murat Kantarcioglu; Bowei Xi,Summary Many real world applications; ranging from spam filtering to intrusion detection;are facing malicious adversaries who actively transform the objects under their control toavoid detection. Data mining techniques are highly useful tools for cyber defense; since theyplay an important role in distinguishing the legitimate from the destructive. Unfortunately;traditional data mining techniques are insufficient to handle such adversarial problemsdirectly. The adversaries adapt to the data miner's reactions; and data mining algorithmsconstructed based on a training dataset degrades quickly. Our proposed adversarial datamining framework addresses the challenges posed by malicious adversaries. In this surveyarticle; we discuss the theory; the techniques; and the applications of our proposedadversarial data mining framework. We model the adversarial data mining applications as …,*,*,*

Hypothesis Tests and Classification with Gaussian Mixture Models under Differential Privacy,Bowei Xi; Murat Kantarcıoglu; Xiaosu Tong; Ali Inan,A lot of statistical inference over a specific data-set requires obtaining some very basicstatistics such as the mean vector and the covariance matrix of the data. This is often astraightforward task. However; when the data-set in question contains sensitive information;special care has to be taken in order to prevent direct access to the data; even for researchpurposes. Instead of granting direct access; the data users or the researchers are providedwith a sanitized view of the database containing private information. Dwork proves in [1] thatevery privacy protection mechanism is vulnerable to some kind of background knowledgeand “bad disclosures” might occur regardless of participation into the attacked database.Therefore; Dwork suggests that instead of tailoring privacy definitions against different typesof background knowledge; one should minimize the risk of disclosure that arises from …,*,*,*
Incentive Compatible Privacy-preserving Distributed Data Sharing and Mining,Murat Kantarcıoglu,Privacy and security; particularly maintaining confidentiality of data; have become achallenging issue with advances in information and communication technology. In addition;the ability to communicate and share data has many benefits as well as obvious securityrisks. For example; Department of Energy supports research on building much more efficientdiesel engines [1]; which would require the collaboration of geographically distributedindustries; national laboratories; and universities. Those institutions (including thecompeting industrial partners with potentially conflicting incentives) need to share theirprivate data for building data mining models that enable them to understand the underlyingphysical phenomena. Secure multi-party computation (SMC) techniques [2] have recentlyemerged as one of the answers to secure distributed data sharing and mining. Informally …,*,*,*
An Integrated Approach For Efficient Privacy Preserving Distributed Data Analytics,Murat Kantarcıoglu,Privacy and security; particularly maintaining confidentiality of data; have becomechallenging issues with advances in information and communication technology. The abilityto communicate and share data has many benefits; and the idea of an “omniscient” datasource carries great value to research and building more accurate data analysis models. Forexample; various hospitals may need to share their privacy sensitive genomic data alongwith the hospital discharge data for building data mining models that enable them tounderstand the underlying relationship between genes and diseases. Similarly; differentpharmaceutical companies may want to combine their privacy sensitive research data topredict the effectiveness of certain protein families on some diseases. Secure multi-partycomputation (SMC) techniques [7] have recently emerged as one of the answers to …,*,*,*

TRACK,Joliet Room; Aled Edwards; Murat Kantarcioglu; Anita Fineberg; Chris Cassa; Bradley Malin; CHEO Khaled El Emam,More and more health information is being collected about us–and much of that data iscollected; transmitted and stored electronically. This not only includes clinical information;but increasingly life style and genetic information as well. There is growing demand to usethis personal health information for research; administrative; and policy making purposes. Atthe same time; there have recently been at least 143 data breaches in Canada and US frommedical establishments affecting more than 6.3 million records (see http://www.ehealthinformation. ca/dataloss). This has multiple negative consequences: from reducingthe trust of patients in the public and private organizations that manage their personalinformation; to patients adopting privacy protective behaviors that may be detrimental to theirwell being. This trust; once lost; is difficult to regain.,*,*,*
