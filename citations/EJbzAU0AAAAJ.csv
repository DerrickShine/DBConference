Genetic deficiency in plasma protein HRG enhances tumor growth and metastasis by exacerbating immune escape and vessel abnormalization,Sònia Tugues; Satoshi Honjo; Christian König; Oriol Noguer; Marie Hedlund; Johan Botling; Sofie Deschoemaeker; Mathias Wenes; Charlotte Rolny; Wilhelm Jahnen-Dechent; Massimiliano Mazzone; Lena Claesson-Welsh,Histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) is a 75-kDa heparin-binding plasma protein implicated inthe regulation of tumor growth and vascularization. In this study; we show that hrg−/− micechallenged with fibrosarcoma or pancreatic carcinoma grow larger tumors with increasedmetastatic properties. Compared with wild-type mice; fibrosarcomas in hrg−/− mice weremore hypoxic; necrotic; and less perfused; indicating enhanced vessel abnormalization.HRG deficiency was associated with a suppressed antitumor immune response; with bothincreased infiltration of M2 marker–expressing macrophages and decreased infiltration ofdendritic cells and cytotoxic T cells. Analysis of transcript expression in tumor-associated aswell as peritoneal macrophages from hrg−/− mice revealed an increased expression ofgenes associated with a proangiogenic and immunoinhibitory phenotype.

Tetraspanin CD63 promotes vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2-β1 integrin complex formation; thereby regulating activation and downstream signaling in...,Sònia Tugues; Satoshi Honjo; Christian König; Narendra Padhan; Jeffrey Kroon; Laura Gualandi; Xiujuan Li; Irmeli Barkefors; Victor L Thijssen; Arjan W Griffioen; Lena Claesson-Welsh,Background: The tetraspanin CD63 is known to regulate protein trafficking; leukocyterecruitment; and adhesion processes. Results: Silencing of CD63 disrupts complexformation between β1 integrin and VEGFR2; resulting in impaired downstream signaling.Conclusion: CD63 supports VEGFR2 activation and signaling in vitro and in vivo.Significance: A novel role for the tetraspanin CD63 in the convergence between integrin andgrowth factor signaling in angiogenesis. Abstract CD63 is a member of the transmembrane-4 glycoprotein superfamily (tetraspanins) implicated in the regulation of membrane proteintrafficking; leukocyte recruitment; and adhesion processes. We have investigated theinvolvement of CD63 in endothelial cell (EC) signaling downstream of β1 integrin and VEGF.We report that silencing of CD63 in primary ECs arrested capillary sprouting and tube …,Journal of Biological Chemistry,2013,20
Relatives' perception of stressors and psychological outcomes–Results from a survey study,Bastian Matt; Daniel Schwarzkopf; Konrad Reinhart; Christian König; Christiane S Hartog,Abstract Purpose To identify relevant stressors or resources of relatives of critically illpatients and explore their relationship with psychological outcomes. Materials and methodsProspective mixed-method study performed in 4 multidisciplinary ICUs of an urbanacademic hospital. Main relatives of consecutive patients with severe sepsis werequestioned after 90days by structured interview. Quantitative data included demographiccharacteristics; ICU experience; Impact-of-Event Scale (posttraumatic stress) and HospitalAnxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); answers to open questions about stressors andresources were transcribed verbatim and analyzed by thematic analysis. Results 143/205(70%) relatives participated. Satisfaction with communication and care was high.Experiencing a stressor predicted posttraumatic stress (p= 0.014) and anxiety (p= 0.019) …,Journal of critical care,2017,3
A patient cohort on long-term sequelae of sepsis survivors: study protocol of the Mid-German Sepsis Cohort,André Scherag; Christiane S Hartog; Carolin Fleischmann; Dominique Ouart; Franziska Hoffmann; Christian König; Miriam Kesselmeier; Sandra Fiedler; Monique Philipp; Anke Braune; Cornelia Eichhorn; Christin Gampe; Heike Romeike; Konrad Reinhart,Introduction An increasing number of patients survive sepsis; however; we lack valid data onthe long-term impact on morbidity from prospective observational studies. Therefore; wedesigned an observational cohort to quantify mid-term and long-term functional disabilitiesafter intensive care unit (ICU)-treated sepsis. Ultimately; findings for the Mid-German SepsisCohort (MSC) will serve as basis for the implementation of follow-up structures for patientswith sepsis and help to increase quality of care for sepsis survivors. Methods and analysisAll patients surviving ICU-treated sepsis are eligible and are recruited from five study centresin Germany (acute care hospital setting in Jena; Halle/Saale; Leipzig; Bad Berka; Erfurt;large long-term acute care hospital and rehabilitation setting in Klinik Bavaria Kreischa).Screening is performed by trained study nurses. Data are collected on ICU management …,BMJ Open,2017,*
1446: WHAT MATTERS MOST TO SURVIVORS OF SEPSIS? DEVELOPMENT OF PATIENT-REPORTED QUALITY-OF-LIFE DOMAINS,Christiane Hartog; Bastian Matt; Andreas Kortgen; Christian König,Methods: Development of an interview guideline based on literature review; qualitativeinterviews and a consensus process. Interviews were conducted with sepsis survivors frominterdisciplinary ICUs of a German university hospital. Interviews were transcribed verbatimwith a fixed set of transcription rules and analyzed qualitatively with the interpretativephenomenological analysis approach. Codes and subcodes were applied to the data; acodebook was developed and evaluated by an independent experienced researcher.Codes were clustered into domains. Consensus was achieved by Delphi process withclinicians and survivors or relatives ('experts'). Results: Interviews were carried out with 15survivors (8 male) with a mean age of 62 years (range: 27–87 years) and mean 11 monthsafter sepsis onset (range: 5–40 months). Mean interview duration was 68 minutes (range …,Critical Care Medicine,2016,*
