Single-electron transistor strongly coupled to an electrostatically defined quantum dot,W Lu; AJ Rimberg; KD Maranowski; AC Gossard,A system is described in which an Al-based superconducting single-electron transistor (S–SET) is fabricated directly above an electrostatically defined quantum dot formed in a two-dimensional electron gas. This arrangement allows the coupling capacitance between the S–SET central island and the dot to be comparable to the tunneling capacitances of the dot. Asa result; the measured sensitivity of the S–SET referred to charge on the dot is 1.2× 10− 4e/Hz; about an order of magnitude better than previously reported results. The increasedsensitivity makes this system ideally suited for broadband measurements such as study ofindividual tunneling events.,Applied Physics Letters,2000,24

Large quantities of Si nanowires can be grown with a fast growth rate at a lowtemperature of 520° C via a vapor-liquid-solid process using Al as catalyst. The use of highH 2 partial pressure was found to effectively mitigate the Al catalyst oxidation problem; andhigher SiH 4 partial pressure was found to produce smaller diameter nanowires.

The macroscopic bonding pads of the S-SETalong with the 2DEG form a microstrip transmission line.

A winner-take-all training algorithm; inconjunction with Oja's rule; is used to learn an overcomplete dictionary of feature primitivesthat resemble Gabor filters.

Salama,Abstract High-density memristor-crossbar architecture is a very promising technology forfuture computing systems. The simplicity of the gateless-crossbar structure is both itsprincipal advantage and the source of undesired sneak-paths of current. This parasiticcurrent could consume an enormous amount of energy and ruin the readout process. Weintroduce new adaptive-threshold readout techniques that utilize the locality and hierarchyproperties of the computer-memory system to address the sneak-paths problem. Theproposed methods require a single memory access per pixel for an array readout. Besides;the memristive crossbar consumes an order of magnitude less power than state-of-the-artreadout techniques.,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2016,16

Replicating Kernels with a Short Stride Allows Sparse Reconstructions with Fewer Independent Kernels,Peter F Schultz; Dylan M Paiton; Wei Lu; Garrett T Kenyon,Abstract: In sparse coding it is common to tile an image into nonoverlapping patches; andthen use a dictionary to create a sparse representation of each tile independently. In thissituation; the overcompleteness of the dictionary is the number of dictionary elementsdivided by the patch size. In deconvolutional neural networks (DCNs); dictionaries learnedon nonoverlapping tiles are replaced by a family of convolution kernels. Hence adjacentpoints in the feature maps (V1 layers) have receptive fields in the image that are translationsof each other. The translational distance is determined by the dimensions of V1 incomparison to the dimensions of the image space. We refer to this translational distance asthe stride. We implement a type of DCN using a modified Locally Competitive Algorithm(LCA) to investigate the relationship between the number of kernels; the stride; the …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1406.4205,2014,12

Semiconductor nanowire growth and integration,Lin Chen; Wei Lu; Charles M Lieber,Semiconductor nanowires refer to crystal structures with diameters as small as a fewnanometers and lengths up to tens of micrometers or even millimeters. Nanowires can beproduced either through conventional subtractive nanofabrication processes; via lithographyand etching; or through additive nanomaterial growth methods. The quality of “top-down”fabricated nanowires are in principle determined by the starting material; although the sizereduction techniques used to fabricate these structures inevitably introduce damage (eg;roughness) that can degrade overall quality. The top-down approach; which relies heavilyon the precision of the lithography and etching tools; also becomes less cost-effective whenscaling to ca. 10 nm size regimes.

The experimental observations can beexplained within the 2nd-order memristor theoretical framework; which states that the deviceconductance (weight) can be determined by multiple internal state variables that can bemodulated at different time scales and lead to different activity-dependent synapticbehaviors.

Oxygen vacancies in amorphous-Ta2O5 from first-principles calculations,Jihang Lee; Emmanouil Kioupakis; Wei Lu,Abstract Oxygen vacancies are thought to play a crucial role in the electrical and opticalproperties of tantalum pentoxide (Ta 2 O 5) devices. Even though numerous experimentalstudies on oxygen vacancies in Ta 2 O 5 exist; experimentally detected defects areambiguously identified due to the absence of an accurate and conclusive theoreticalanalysis.

Memristors hold promise for use in diverse applications such as memory; logic;analog circuits; and neuromorphic systems. This chapter addresses the key issues in systemarchitecture for an alternative approach based on complementary resistive switch (CRS) thathas been reported to mitigate sneak current-path problems of large and fully passivenanocrossbar arrays. Most logic concepts use resistive switches as programmableinterconnects; eg; CMOL. The logic states 0 and 1 are represented by the perpendicularmagnetization state of the single-domain nanomagnet (NM).
