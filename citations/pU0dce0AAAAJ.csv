Updates; a new frontier,Serge Abiteboul,Abstract We consider the main features of updates in databases. Recent results on updatesare briefly described and used to raise various questions. It is argued that well-acceptedquery properties like safety and determinism should not be strictly enforced in the context ofupdates. The issue of declarative versus procedural update languages is also addressed.Finally; update-based database specifications are considered and compared to moretraditional approaches.,International Conference on Database Theory,1988,1545
Optimizing joins in a map-reduce environment,Foto N Afrati; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract Implementations of map-reduce are being used to perform many operations on verylarge data. We examine strategies for joining several relations in the map-reduceenvironment. Our new approach begins by identifying the" map-key;" the set of attributes thatidentify the Reduce process to which a Map process must send a particular tuple. Eachattribute of the map-key gets a" share;" which is the number of buckets into which its valuesare hashed; to form a component of the identifier of a Reduce process. Relations have theirtuples replicated in limited fashion; the degree of replication depending on the shares forthose map-key attributes that are missing from their schema.

Approximation schemes for minimizing average weighted completion time with release dates,Foto Afrati; Evripidis Bampis; Chandra Chekuri; David Karger; Claire Kenyon; Sanjeev Khanna; Ioannis Milis; Maurice Queyranne; Martin Skutella; Clifford Stein; Maxim Sviridenko,We consider the problem of scheduling n jobs with release dates on m machines so as tominimize their average weighted completion time. We present the first known polynomialtime approximation schemes for several variants of this problem. Our results include PTASsfor the case of identical parallel machines and a constant number of unrelated machineswith and without preemption allowed. Our schemes are efficient: for all variants the runningtime for/spl alpha/(1+/spl epsiv/) approximation is of the form f (1//spl epsiv/; m) poly (n).,Foundations of Computer Science; 1999. 40th Annual Symposium on,1999,219
Approximating a collection of frequent sets,Foto Afrati; Aristides Gionis; Heikki Mannila,Abstract One of the most well-studied problems in data mining is computing the collection offrequent item sets in large transactional databases. One obstacle for the applicability offrequent-set mining is that the size of the output collection can be far too large to be carefullyexamined and understood by the users. Even restricting the output to the border of thefrequent item-set collection does not help much in alleviating the problem. In this paper weaddress the issue of overwhelmingly large output size by introducing and studying thefollowing problem: What are the k sets that best approximate a collection of frequent itemsets? Our measure of approximating a collection of sets by k sets is defined to be the size ofthe collection covered by the the k sets; ie; the part of the collection that is included in one ofthe k sets. We also specify a bound on the number of extra sets that are allowed to be …,Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2004,179

The complexity of the travelling repairman problem,Foto Afrati; Stavros Cosmadakis; Christos H Papadimitriou; George Papageorgiou; Nadia Papakostantinou,Abstract.—In the travelling repairman problem (TRP) we are given a finite set of points andthe travel times between any two ofthem; and wish to find the route through them whichminimizes the sum of the delays for reaching each point. We consider the TRP when ailpoints are on the straight line; and give a polynomial-time algorithm for it. If we havedeadlines (that is; bounds on the maximum delay for each point) the problem becomes NP-complete; but can be solved by a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm.

Upper and lower bounds on the cost of a map-reduce computation,Anish Das Sarma; Foto N Afrati; Semih Salihoglu; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract In this paper we study the tradeoff between parallelism and communication cost in amap-reduce computation. For any problem that is not" embarrassingly parallel;" the finer wepartition the work of the reducers so that more parallelism can be extracted; the greater willbe the total communication between mappers and reducers. We introduce a model ofproblems that can be solved in a single round of map-reduce computation. This modelenables a generic recipe for discovering lower bounds on communication cost as a functionof the maximum number of inputs that can be assigned to one reducer. We use the model toanalyze the tradeoff for three problems: finding pairs of strings at Hamming distance d;finding triangles and other patterns in a larger graph; and matrix multiplication. For findingstrings of Hamming distance 1; we have upper and lower bounds that match exactly. For …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,118
Repair checking in inconsistent databases: algorithms and complexity,Foto N Afrati; Phokion G Kolaitis,Abstract Managing inconsistency in databases has long been recognized as an importantproblem. One of the most promising approaches to coping with inconsistency in databasesis the framework of database repairs; which has been the topic of an extensive investigationover the past several years. Intuitively; a repair of an inconsistent database is a consistentdatabase that differs from the given inconsistent database in a minimal way. So far; most ofthe work in this area has addressed the problem of obtaining the consistent answers to aquery posed on an inconsistent database. Repair checking is the following decisionproblem: given two databases r and r'; is r'a repair of r? Although repair checking is afundamental algorithmic problem about inconsistent databases; it has not received as muchattention as consistent query answering. In this paper; we give a polynomial-time …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Database Theory,2009,111

Map-reduce extensions and recursive queries,Foto N Afrati; Vinayak Borkar; Michael Carey; Neoklis Polyzotis; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract We survey the recent wave of extensions to the popular map-reduce systems;including those that have begun to address the implementation of recursive queries usingthe same computing environment as map-reduce. A central problem is that recursive taskscannot deliver their output only at the end; which makes recovery from failures much morecomplicated than in map-reduce and its nonrecursive extensions. We propose severalalgorithmic ideas for efficient implementation of recursions in the map-reduce environmentand discuss several alternatives for supporting recovery from failures without restarting theentire job.,Proceedings of the 14th international conference on extending database technology,2011,85
Generating efficient plans for queries using views,Foto N Afrati; Chen Li; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract We study the problem or generating efficient; equivalent rewritings using views tocompute the answer to a query. We take the closed-world assumption; in which views arematerialized from base relations; rather than views describing sources in terms of abstractpredicates; as is common when the open-world assumption is used. In the closed-worldmodel; there can be an infinite number of different rewritings that compute the same answer;yet have quite different performance. Query optimizers take a logical plan (a rewriting of thequery) as an input; and generate efficient physical plans to compute the answer. Thus ourgoal is to generate a small subset of the possible logical plans without missing an optimalphysical plan. We first consider a cost model that counts the number of subgoals in aphysical plan; and show a search space that is guaranteed to include an optimal rewriting …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2001,84
Enumerating subgraph instances using map-reduce,Foto N Afrati; Dimitris Fotakis; Jeffrey D Ullman,The theme of this paper is how to find all instances of a given “sample” graph in a larger“data graph;” using a single round of map-reduce. For the simplest sample graph; thetriangle; we improve upon the best known such algorithm. We then examine the generalcase; considering both the communication cost between mappers and reducers and the totalcomputation cost at the reducers. To minimize communication cost; we exploit thetechniques of [1] for computing multiway joins (evaluating conjunctive queries) in a singlemap-reduce round. Several methods are shown for translating sample graphs into a union ofconjunctive queries with as few queries as possible. We also address the matter ofoptimizing computation cost. Many serial algorithms are shown to be “convertible;” in thesense that it is possible to partition the data graph; explore each partition in a separate …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,83
Fuzzy joins using mapreduce,Foto N Afrati; Anish Das Sarma; David Menestrina; Aditya Parameswaran; Jeffrey D Ullman,Fuzzy/similarity joins have been widely studied in the research community and extensivelyused in real-world applications. This paper proposes and evaluates several algorithms forfinding all pairs of elements from an input set that meet a similarity threshold. Thecomputation model is a single MapReduce job. Because we allow only one MapReduceround; the Reduce function must be designed so a given output pair is produced by only onetask; for many algorithms; satisfying this condition is one of the biggest challenges. We breakthe cost of an algorithm into three components: the execution cost of the mappers; theexecution cost of the reducers; and the communication cost from the mappers to reducers.The algorithms are presented first in terms of Hamming distance; but extensions to editdistance and Jaccard distance are shown as well.

Answering queries using views with arithmetic comparisons,Foto Afrati; Chen Li; Prasenjit Mitra,Abstract We consider the problem of answering queries using views; where queries andviews are conjunctive queries with arithmetic comparisons (CQACs) over dense orders.Previous work only considered limited variants of this problem; without giving a completesolution. We have developed a novel algorithm to obtain maximally-contained rewritings(MCRs) for queries having left (or right) semi-interval-comparison predicates. For semi-interval queries; we show that the language of finite unions of CQAC rewritings is notsufficient to find a maximally-contained solution; and identify cases where datalog issufficient.

Parallel skyline queries,Foto N Afrati; Paraschos Koutris; Dan Suciu; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract In this paper; we design and analyze parallel algorithms for skyline queries. Theskyline of a multidimensional set consists of the points for which no other point exists that isat least as good along every dimension. As a framework for parallel computation; we useboth the MP model proposed in Koutris and Suciu (2011); which requires that the data isperfectly load-balanced; and a variation of the model in Afrati and Ullman (2010); the GMPmodel; which demands weaker load balancing constraints. In addition to load balancing; wewant to minimize the number of blocking steps; where all processors must wait andsynchronize. We propose a 2-step algorithm in the MP model for any dimension of thedataset; as well a 1-step algorithm for the case of 2 and 3 dimensions. Finally; we present a1-step algorithm in the GMP model for any number of dimensions and a 1-step algorithm …,Theory of Computing Systems,2015,64
Answering queries using materialized views with disjunctions,Foto N Afrati; Manolis Gergatsoulis; Theodoros Kavalieros,Abstract We consider the problem of answering datalog queries using materialized views.More specifically; queries are rewritten to refer to views instead of the base relations overwhich the queries were originally written. Much work has been done on program rewritingthat produces an equivalent query. In the context of information integration; though; theimportance of using views to infer as many answers as possible has been pointed out.Formally; the problem is: Given a datalog program P is there a datalog program P v whichuses only views as EDB predicates and (i) produces a subset of the answers that Pproduces and (ii) any other program P′ v over the views with property (i) is contained in Pv? In this paper we investigate the problem in the case of disjunctive view definitions.,International Conference on Database Theory,1999,63
A Hypertext Model Supporting Query Mechanisms.,Foto N Afrati; Constantinos D Koutras,ABSTRACT: A formal model of hypertext is described in this paper. The purpose is two-fold:a) building on Garg's work ([Garg 88]); to enhance his model so as to express advancedfeatures of hypertext systems (such as structured nodes; scripts; typed and attributed links);and b) to demonstrate the expressive power of the model by showing that several problemsconcerning knowledge organization; browsing and navigation in the hyperspace; may havea simple solution in the framework of the model; as a result of a powerful query mechanism.The principles and fundamentals of the model are defined in detail; while its power andsimplicity is illustrated by presenting some simple examples of information organization inhypertext fashion.,ECHT,1990,61
Answering aggregate queries in data exchange,Foto Afrati; Phokion G Kolaitis,Abstract Data exchange; also known as data translation; has been extensively investigatedin recent years. One main direction of research has focused on the semantics and thecomplexity of answering first-order queries in the context of data exchange betweenrelational schemas. In this paper; we initiate a systematic investigation of the semantics andthe complexity of aggregate queries in data exchange; and make a number of conceptualand technical contributions. Data exchange is a context in which incomplete informationarises; hence one has to cope with a set of possible worlds; instead of a single database.Three different sets of possible worlds have been explored in the study of the certainanswers of first-order queries in data exchange: the set of possible worlds of all solutions;the set of possible worlds of all universal solutions; and a set of possible worlds derived …,Proceedings of the twenty-seventh ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2008,57

Selecting and using views to compute aggregate queries,Foto Afrati; Rada Chirkova,Abstract We consider a workload of aggregate queries and investigate the problem ofselecting views that (1) provide equivalent rewritings for all queries; and (2) are optimal; inthat the cost of evaluating the query workload is minimized. We consider conjunctive viewsand rewritings; with or without aggregation; in each rewriting; only one view contributes tocomputing the aggregated query output. We look at query rewriting using existing views andat view selection. In the query-rewriting problem; we give su. cient and necessary conditionsfor a rewriting to exist. For view selection; we prove complexity results. Finally; we givealgorithms for obtaining rewritings and selecting views.,International Conference on Database Theory,2005,48

Scheduling in switching networks with set-up delays,Foto Afrati; Timos Aslanidis; Evripidis Bampis; Ioannis Milis,Abstract We consider the (preemptive bipartite scheduling problem PBS)(Crescenzi etal.;“On approximating a scheduling problem;” Journal of Combinatorial Optimization; vol. 5;pp. 287–297; 2001) arising in switching communication systems; where each input andoutput port can be involved in at most one communication at the same time. Given a set ofcommunication tasks to be communicated from the transmitters to the receivers of such asystem; we aim to find a schedule minimizing the overall transmission time. To achieve this;we allow the preemption of communication tasks. However; in practice preemption comeswith a cost; d; and this renders the problem NP-hard (Gopal et al.;“An optimal switchingalgorithm for multibeam satellite systems with variable bandwidth beams;” IEEE Trans.Commun.; vol. 30; pp. 2475–2481; 1982).

Transitive closure and recursive datalog implemented on clusters,Foto N Afrati; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract Implementing recursive algorithms on computing clusters presents a number of newchallenges. In particular; we consider the endgame problem: later rounds of a recursionoften transfer only small amounts of data; causing high overhead for interprocessorcommunication. One way to deal with the endgame problem is to use an algorithm thatreduces the number of rounds of the recursion. Especially; in an application like transitiveclosure (" TC") there are several recursive-doubling algorithms that use a logarithmic; ratherthan linear; number of rounds. Unfortunately; recursive-doubling algorithms can deducemany more facts than the linear TC algorithms; which could negate the cost savings from theelimination of the overhead due to the proliferation of small files. We are thus led to considerTC algorithms that; like the linear algorithms; have the unique decomposition property …,Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2012,35
Rewriting queries using views in the presence of arithmetic comparisons,Foto Afrati; Chen Li; Prasenjit Mitra,Abstract We consider the problem of answering queries using views; where queries andviews are conjunctive queries with arithmetic comparisons over dense orders.

We firstshow that obtaining equivalent rewritings for conjunctive queries with arithmeticcomparisons is decidable. Then; we consider the problem of finding maximally containedrewritings (MCRs) where the decidability proof does not carry over. We investigate twospecial cases of this problem where the query uses only semi-interval comparisons. In bothcases decidability of finding MCRs depends on the query containment test.

The complexity of cubical graphs,Foto Afrati; Christos H Papadimitriou; George Papageorgiou,A graph is cubical if it is a subgraph of a hypercube; the dimension of the smallest suchhypercube is the dimension of the graph. We show several results concerning this class ofgraphs. We use a characterization of cubical graphs in terms of edge coloring to show thatthe dimension of biconnected cubical graphs is at most half the number of nodes. We alsoshow that telling whether a graph is cubical is NP-complete. Finally; we propose a heuristicfor minimizing the dimension of trees; which yields an embedding of the tree in a hypercubeof dimension at most the square of the true dimension of the tree.,Information and control,1985,29
On rewriting XPath queries using views,Foto Afrati; Rada Chirkova; Manolis Gergatsoulis; Benny Kimelfeld; Vassia Pavlaki; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract The problem of rewriting a query using a materialized view is studied for a wellknown fragment of XPath that includes the following three constructs: wildcards; descendantedges and branches. In earlier work; determining the existence of a rewriting was shown tobe coNP-hard; but no tight complexity bound was given. While it was argued that Σ 3 p is anupper bound; the proof was based on results that have recently been refuted. Consequently;the exact complexity (and even decidability) of this basic problem has been unknown; andthere have been no practical rewriting algorithms if the query and the view use all the threeconstructs mentioned above. It is shown that under fairly general conditions; there are onlytwo candidates for rewriting and hence; the problem can be practically solved by twocontainment tests.

On containment of conjunctive queries with arithmetic comparisons,Foto Afrati; Chen Li; Prasenjit Mitra,Abstract We study the following problem: how to test if Q 2 is contained in Q 1; where Q 1and Q 2 are conjunctive queries with arithmetic comparisons? This problem is fundamentalin a large variety of database applications. Existing algorithms first normalize the queries;then test a logical implication using multiple containment mappings from Q 1 to Q 2. We areinterested in cases where the containment can be tested more efficiently. This work aims to(a) reduce the problem complexity from Π ^P_\rm2-completeness to NP-completeness inthese cases;(b) utilize the advantages of the homomorphism property (ie; the containmenttest is based on a single containment mapping) in applications such as those of answeringqueries using views; and (c) observing that many real queries have the homomorphismproperty.

Most past work provides customsolutions to specific problems; eg; performing fuzzy joins in map-reduce; clustering; graphanalyses; and so on. While some problems are amenable to very efficient map-reducealgorithms; some other problems do not lend themselves to a natural distribution; and haveprovable lower bounds.

Data exchange in the presence of arithmetic comparisons,Foto Afrati; Chen Li; Vassia Pavlaki,Abstract Data exchange is the problem of transforming data structured under a schema(called source) into data structured under a different schema (called target). The emphasis ofdata exchange is to materialize a target instance (called solution) that satisfies therelationship between the schemas. Universal solutions were shown to be the most suitablesolutions; mainly because they can be used to answer conjunctive queries posed over thetarget schema. Trying to extend this result to more expressive query languages fails; even ifwe only add inequalities (≠) to conjunctive queries. In this work we study data exchange inthe presence of general arithmetic comparisons (<;≤;>;≥;=;≠):(a) We consider queriesposed over the target schema that belong to the class of unions of conjunctive queries witharithmetic comparisons (in short CQACs).(b) We exploit arithmetic comparisons to define …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,19

Determinacy and query rewriting for conjunctive queries and views,Foto N Afrati,Abstract Answering queries using views is the problem which examines how to derive theanswers to a query when we only have the answers to a set of views. Constructing rewritingsis a widely studied technique to derive those answers. In this paper we consider the problemof the existence of rewritings in the case where the answers to the views uniquely determinethe answers to the query. Specifically; we say that a view set V determines a query Q if forany two databases D 1; D 2 it holds: V (D 1)= V (D 2) implies Q (D 1)= Q (D 2). We considerthe case where query and views are defined by conjunctive queries and investigate thequestion: If a view set V determines a query Q; is there an equivalent rewriting of Q using V?We present here interesting cases where there are such rewritings in the language ofconjunctive queries.

Query containment under bag and bag-set semantics,Foto N Afrati; Matthew Damigos; Manolis Gergatsoulis,Abstract Conjunctive queries (CQs) are at the core of query languages encountered in manylogic-based research fields such as AI; or database systems. The majority of existing workassumes set semantics but often in real applications the manipulation of duplicate tuples isrequired. One of the major problems that arises as part of advanced features of queryoptimization; data integration; query reformulation and many other research topics is testingfor containment of such queries. In this work; we investigate the complexity of querycontainment problem for CQs under bag semantics (ie duplicate tuples are allowed in boththe database and the results of queries) and under bag-set semantics (ie duplicates areallowed in the result of the queries but not in the database). We derive complexity results forthese problems for five major subclasses of CQs; and we also find necessary conditions …,Information Processing Letters,2010,18

We show that the query “one-line” is not expressible in FO+ order (ieinequality constraint). In fact; the result is stronger in that we prove that it is not expressible inany higher order logic either. Furthermore; we show that the same query can be expressedin FO+ linear by giving a non-trivial sentence that characterizes the class of databasesconsisting of exactly one line.,ESPRIT WG CONTESSA Workshop on Constraint Databases and Applications,1995,17

In the presence ofarithmetic comparisons (ACs) the problem becomes more complex. We do not know how tofind maximally contained rewritings in the general case. There are algorithms which findmaximally contained rewritings only for special cases such as when ACs are restricted to besemi-interval. However; we know that the problem of finding an equivalent rewriting (if thereexists one) in the presence of ACs is decidable; yet still doubly exponential. This complexitycalls for an efficient algorithm which will perform better on average than the complete …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,14
Linearisability on datalog programs,Foto Afrati; Manolis Gergatsoulis; Francesca Toni,Abstract Linear Datalog programs are programs whose clauses have at most oneintensional atom in their bodies. We explore syntactic classes of Datalog programs(syntactically non-linear) which turn out to express no more than the queries expressed bylinear Datalog programs. In particular; we investigate linearisability of (database queriescorresponding to) piecewise linear Datalog programs and chain queries:(a) We prove thatpiecewise linear Datalog programs can always be transformed into linear Datalog programs;by virtue of a procedure which performs the transformation automatically. The procedurerelies upon conventional logic program transformation techniques.(b) We identify a newclass of linearisable chain queries; referred to as pseudo-regular; and prove theirlinearisability constructively; by generating; for any given pseudo-regular chain query; the …,Theoretical Computer Science,2003,14
Aims and status of the Themistocle physics experiment,Gérard Fontaine; P Baillon; L Behr; B Dudelzak; P Eschstruth; P Espigat; J Fabre; G Fontaine; R George; C Ghesquière; F Kovacs; C Meynadier; Y Pons; M Rivoal; P Roy; P Schune; T Socroun,Abstract THEMISTOCLE is a Particle Physics experiment proposing to search for newphenomena in photon-hadron interactions at an energy beyond the scale of the StandardModel. The use of cosmic beams of high energy gamma rays should be possible by a strongenhancement of the signal to background ratio on point-like sources; achieved via anangular resolution better than 1 mrd and based on a high precision timing analysis of theCerenkov light wavefront of atmospheric showers. An 18 mirror pilot experiment is nowbeing set-up and should be competitive with existing or planned air shower detectors. It willbe used to evaluate the design limits and the “beam” properties before proposing theconstruction of a larger scale detector.,Nuclear Physics B-Proceedings Supplements,1990,14
Cluster computing; recursion and datalog,Foto N Afrati; Vinayak Borkar; Michael Carey; Neoklis Polyzotis; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract The cluster-computing environment typified by Hadoop; the open-sourceimplementation of map-reduce; is receiving serious attention as the way to execute queriesand other operations on very large-scale data. Datalog execution presents several unusualissues for this enviroment. We discuss the best way to execute a round of seminaiveevaluation on a computing cluster using the map-reduce. Using transitive closure as anexample; we examine the cost of executing recursions in several different ways. Recursiveprocesses such as evaluation of a recursive Datalog program do not fit the key map-reduceassumption that tasks deliver output only when they are completed. As a result; theresilience under compute-node failure that is a key element of the map-reduce framework isnot supported for recursive programs. We discuss extensions to this framework that are …,*,2011,13
Rewriting queries using views with negation,Foto Afrati; Vassia Pavlaki,Abstract Data integration and query reformulation are classical examples of problems thatrequire techniques developed in both AI and database systems fields. In this work weaddress the problem of rewriting queries using views which has many applications. Inparticular; we consider queries and views that are conjunctive queries with safe negation(CQNs). We prove that given a CQN query and a set of CQN views; finding equivalentrewritings is decidable in both cases where the rewriting is in the language of CQNs orunions of CQNs. We prove decidability by giving upper bounds on the number of subgoalsof the rewritings. We limit the search space of potential equivalent CQN rewritings andMaximally Contained CQN Rewritings (MCRs) to the language of unions of CQs in the casewhere the query is CQ. Finally; we give a sound and complete algorithm for finding …,AI Communications,2006,13
Matching bounds for the all-pairs MapReduce problem,Foto Afrati; Jeffrey Ullman,Abstract The all-pairs problem is an input-output relationship where each outputcorresponds to a pair of inputs; and each pair of inputs has a corresponding output. Itmodels similarity joins where no simplification of the search for similar pairs; eg; locality-sensitive hashing; is possible; and each input must be compared with every other input todetermine those pairs that are" similar." When implemented by a MapReduce algorithm;there was a gap; a factor of 2; between the lower bound on necessary communication andthe communication required by the best known algorithm. In this brief paper we show thatthe lower bound can essentially be met.,Proceedings of the 17th International Database Engineering & Applications Symposium,2013,12
The synthesis of communication protocols,Foto Afrati; Christos H Papadimitriou; George Papageorgiou,Abstract We define a notation (specification language) for describing desired patterns ofcommunication among components of a distributed system through multiport; unreliablechannels. Our language specifies the network topology; and the kinds of informationtransmission desired. We give a polynomial-time algorithm for determining whether aspecification is satisfiable; our algorithm can actually construct a protocol that achieves thespecified exchange of information; optimized with respect to two possible criteria. Examplessuggest that our method can automatically synthesize reasonably complex protocols.,Algorithmica,1988,12
Mining chains of relations,Foto Aftrati; Gautam Das; Aristides Gionis; Heikki Mannila; Taneli Mielikäinen; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Traditional data mining methods consider the problem of mining a single relationthat relates two different attributes. For example; in a scientific bibliography database;authors are related to papers; and we may be interested in discovering association rulesbetween authors based on the papers that they have co-authored. However; in real life it isoften the case that we have multiple attributes related through chains of relations. Forexample; authors write papers; and papers belong to one or more topics; defining a three-level chain of relations. In this paper we consider the problem of mining such relationalchains. We formulate a generic problem of finding selector sets (subsets of objects from oneof the attributes) such that the projected dataset—the part of the dataset determined by theselector set—satisfies a specific property. The motivation for our approach is that a given …,*,2012,11
Rewriting conjunctive queries determined by views,Foto Afrati,Abstract Answering queries using views is the problem which examines how to derive theanswers to a query when we only have the answers to a set of views. Constructing rewritingsis a widely studied technique to derive those answers. In this paper we consider the problemof existence of rewritings in the case where the answers to the views uniquely determine theanswers to the query. Specifically; we say that a view set V determines a query Q if for anytwo databases D 1; D 2 it holds: V(D_1)=V(D_2) implies Q (D 1)= Q (D 2). We consider thecase where query and views are defined by conjunctive queries and investigate thequestion: If a view set V determines a query Q; is there an equivalent rewriting of Q using V?We present here interesting cases where there are such rewritings in the language ofconjunctive queries. Interestingly; we identify a class of conjunctive queries; CQ path; for …,International Symposium on Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science,2007,11
Designing good algorithms for MapReduce and beyond,Foto N Afrati; Magdalena Balazinska; Anish Das Sarma; Bill Howe; Semih Salihoglu; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract As MapReduce/Hadoop grows in importance; we find more exotic applicationsbeing written this way. Not every program written for this platform performs as well as wemight wish. There are several reasons why a MapReduce program can underperformexpectations. One is the need to balance the communication cost of transporting data fromthe mappers to the reducers against the computation done at the mappers and reducersthemselves. A second important issue is selecting the number of rounds of MapReduce. Athird issue is that of skew. If wall-clock time is important; then using many different reduce-keys and many compute nodes may minimize the time to finish the job. Yet if the data isuncooperative; and no provision is made to distribute the data evenly; much of the work isdone by a single node.,Proceedings of the Third ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing,2012,10
Adaptive-sampling algorithms for answering aggregation queries on Web sites,Foto N Afrati; Paraskevas V Lekeas; Chen Li,Abstract Many Web sites publish their data in a hierarchical structure. For instance; Amazon.com organizes its pages on books as a hierarchy; in which each leaf node corresponds to acollection of pages of books in the same class (eg; books on Data Mining). Users can easilybrowse this class by following a path from the root to the corresponding leaf node; such as“Computers & Internet–Databases–Storage–Data Mining”. Business applications oftenrequire to submit aggregation queries on such data; such as “finding the average price ofbooks on Data Mining”. On the other hand; it is computationally expensive to compute theexact answer to such a query due to the large amount of data; its dynamicity; and limitedWeb-access resources. In this paper; we study how to answer such aggregation queriesapproximately with quality guarantees using sampling. We study how to use adaptive …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2008,10
Bounded arity Datalog (≠) queries on graphs,Foto N Afrati,Abstract We show that there are Datalog (≠) queries on graphs (ie; the extensionaldatabase contains a single binary relation) that require recursively defined predicates ofarbitrarily large width. More specifically; we prove that fixed subgraph homeomorphismqueries require width of recursively defined predicates which is at least equal to the numberof arcs in the pattern graph.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,1997,10
On the convergence of query evaluation,Foto Afrati; Christos H Papadimitriou; George Papageorgiou; Athena Roussou; Yehoshua Sagiv; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract We propose a “sideways information passing” method for evaluating Horn clausequeries in the presence of monotonicity constraints on the database relations. We give anecessary and sufficient condition for its convergence and show that testing for the conditionis polynomial when the arity of the relations is bounded; and PSPACE-complete otherwise.We also prove a related condition for the case of downward finite domains (eg; Herbranduniverses); thus improving an algorithm by Naish for a class of Prolog programs.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,1989,10
Assignment problems of different-sized inputs in MapReduce,Foto Afrati; Shlomi Dolev; Ephraim Korach; Shantanu Sharma; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract A MapReduce algorithm can be described by a mapping schema; which assignsinputs to a set of reducers; such that for each required output there exists a reducer thatreceives all the inputs participating in the computation of this output. Reducers have acapacity that limits the sets of inputs they can be assigned. However; individual inputs mayvary in terms of size. We consider; for the first time; mapping schemas where input sizes arepart of the considerations and restrictions. One of the significant parameters to optimize inany MapReduce job is communication cost between the map and reduce phases. Thecommunication cost can be optimized by minimizing the number of copies of inputs sent tothe reducers. The communication cost is closely related to the number of reducers ofconstrained capacity that are used to accommodate appropriately the inputs; so that the …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2016,9
Bounds for Overlapping Interval Join on MapReduce.,Foto N Afrati; Shlomi Dolev; Shantanu Sharma; Jeffrey D Ullman,ABSTRACT We consider the problem of 2-way interval join; where we want to find all pairsof overlapping intervals; ie; intervals that share at least one point in common. We presentlower and upper bounds on the replication rate for this problem when it is implemented inMapReduce. We study three cases; where intervals in the input are:(i) unit-length andequally-spaced;(ii) variable-length and equally-spaced; and (iii) equally-spaced with specificdistribution of the various lengths. Our algorithms offer intuition as how to build algorithms forother cases; especially when we have some statistical knowledge about the distribution ofthe lengths of the intervals. Eg; if mostly large intervals interact with small intervals and notwithin themselves; then we believe our techniques can be extended to achieve betterreplication rate.,EDBT/ICDT Workshops,2015,9
Union rewritings for XPath fragments,Foto Afrati; Matthew Damigos; Manolis Gergatsoulis,Abstract In this paper; we study the problem of finding an equivalent rewriting of an XPathquery using multiple views; and we show that the union operator may be required in order tofind such a rewriting. In particular; focusing on the fragment of XPath containing bothdescendant edges and wildcard labels; we propose an algorithm that outputs a union ofsingle-view rewritings (if there exists any) which equivalently rewrites a given query. For thesame fragment of XPath; we give necessary and sufficient conditions for query containmentand equivalence of unions of queries.,Proceedings of the 15th Symposium on International Database Engineering & Applications,2011,9

View selection for real conjunctive queries,Foto Afrati; Rada Chirkova; Manolis Gergatsoulis; Vassia Pavlaki,Abstract Given a query workload; a database and a set of constraints; the view-selectionproblem is to select views to materialize so that the constraints are satisfied and the viewscan be used to compute the queries in the workload efficiently. A typical constraint; which weconsider in the present work; is to require that the views can be stored in a given amount ofdisk space. Depending on features of SQL queries (eg; the DISTINCT keyword) and onwhether the database relations on which the queries are applied are sets or bags; thequeries may be computed under set semantics; bag-set semantics; or bag semantics. In thispaper we study the complexity of the view-selection problem for conjunctive queries andviews under these semantics. We show that bag semantics is the “easiest to handle”(weshow that in this case the decision version of view selection is in NP); whereas under set …,Acta Informatica,2007,9
On the expressiveness of query languages with linear constraints; capturing desirable spatial properties,Foto Afrati; Theodore Andronikos; Theodore Kavalieros,Abstract We explore the expressive power of the query language of first order logic withlinear constraints. Natural queries are shown to be expressible in this language in a non-trivial fashion. We further investigate the ability of the language to capture certain propertiesthat seem desirable in spatial databases. We show that; although these properties arecaptured in a certain extent; there are still cases where the language has counter-intuitivebehavior. In this context; we show that FO+ linear cannot distinguish between databases thatcarry similar spatial characteristics; eg; two different ellipses.,International Workshop on Constraint Database Systems,1997,9

Anchor points algorithms for hamming and edit distance,Foto Afrati; Anish Das Sarma; Anand Rajaraman; Pokey Rule; Semih Salihoglu; Jeffrey Ullman,Algorithms for computing similarity joins in MapReduce were offered in [2]. Similarity joinsask to find input pairs that are within a certain distance d according to some distancemeasure. Here we explore the``anchor-points algorithm''of [2]. We continue looking atHamming distance; and show that the method of that paper can be improved; in particular; ifwe want to find strings within Hamming distance d; and anchor points are chosen so thatevery possible input is within Hamming distance k of some anchor point; then it is sufficientto send each input to all anchor points within distance (d/2)+ k; rather than d+ k as wassuggested in the earlier paper. This improves on the communication cost of the MapReducealgorithm; ie; reduces the amount of data transmitted among machines. Further; the sameholds for edit distance; provided inputs all have the same length n and either the length of …,*,2014,8
Selecting and using views to compute aggregate queries,Foto Afrati; Rada Chirkova,Abstract We consider a workload of aggregate queries and investigate the problem ofselecting materialized views that (1) provide equivalent rewritings for all the queries; and (2)are optimal; in that the cost of evaluating the query workload is minimized. We considerconjunctive views and rewritings; with or without aggregation; in each rewriting; only oneview contributes to computing the aggregated query output. We look at query rewriting usingexisting views and at view selection. In the query-rewriting problem; we give sufficient andnecessary conditions for a rewriting to exist. For view selection; we prove complexity results.Finally; we give algorithms for obtaining rewritings and selecting views.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2011,8
Maximum H-colourable subdigraphs and constraint optimization with arbitrary weights,Peter Jonsson; Andrei Krokhin,Abstract In the maximum constraint satisfaction problem (Max CSP); one is given a finitecollection of positive-weight constraints on overlapping sets of variables; and the goal is toassign values from a given domain to the variables so that the total weight of satisfiedconstraints is maximized. We consider this problem and its variant Max AW CSP where theweights are allowed to be both positive and negative; and study how the complexity of theproblems depends on the allowed constraint types. We prove that Max AW CSP over anarbitrary finite domain exhibits a dichotomy: it is either polynomial-time solvable or NP-hard.Our proof builds on two results that may be of independent interest: one is that the problemof finding a maximum H-colourable subdigraph in a given digraph is either NP-hard or trivialdepending on H; and the other a dichotomy result for Max CSP with a single allowed …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2007,8
Datalog programs and their persistency numbers,Foto Afrati; Stavros Cosmadakis; Eugénie Foustoucos,Abstract The relation between Datalog programs and homomorphism problems andbetween Datalog programs and bounded treewidth structures has been recognized forsome time and given much attention recently. Additionally; the essential role of persistentvariables (of program expansions) in solving several relevant problems has also started tobe observed. It turns out that to understand the contribution of these persistent variables tothe difficulty of some expressibility problems; we need to understand the interrelationshipamong different notions of persistency numbers; some of which we introduce and/orformalize in the present work.

This paper answers this question for several rounds for the problem ofcomputing the equijoin of n relations. Given any query Q with width w; intersection width iw;input size IN; output size OUT; and a cluster of machines with M=\Omega (IN\frac{1}{\epsilon}) memory available per machine; where\epsilon> 1 and w\ge 1 are constants;we show that: 1.

We present a system architecture forQuery-Performance Enhancement by Tuning (QPET); which combines design and use ofderived data in an end-to-end approach to automated query-performance tuning. Our focusis on a tradeo. between (1) the amount of system resources spent on designing derived dataand on keeping the data up to date; and (2) the degree of the resulting improvement in queryperformance.

We optimize on communication cost; ie; theamount of data that is transferred from the mappers to the reducers. We identify joinattributes values that appear very frequently; Heavy Hitters (HH). We distribute HH valuedrecords to reducers avoiding skew by using an adaptation of the Shares~\cite {AfUl}algorithm to achieve minimum communication cost. Our algorithm is implemented forexperimentation and is offered as open source software. Furthermore; we investigate a classof multiway joins for which a simpler variant of the algorithm can handle skew.

Storing and querying tree-structured records in dremel,Foto N Afrati; Dan Delorey; Mosha Pasumansky; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract In Dremel; data is stored as nested relations. The schema for a relation is a tree; allof whose nodes are attributes; and whose leaf attributes hold values. We explore filter andaggregate queries that are given in the Dremel dialect of SQL. Complications arise becauseof repeated attributes; ie; attributes that are allowed to have more than one value. We focuson the common class of Dremel queries that are processed on column-stored data in a waythat results in query processing time that is linear on the size of the relevant data; ie; data inthe columns that participate in the query. We formally define the data model; the querylanguage and the algorithms for query processing in column-stored data. The concepts ofrepetition context and semi-flattening are introduced here and play a central role inunderstanding this class of queries and their algorithms.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,5

The centerpiece of this exploration is a computational model thatcaptures the essentials of the environment in which systems like Hadoop operate. Files areunordered sets of tuples that can be read and/or written in parallel; processes are limited inthe amount of input/output they can perform; and processors are available in essentiallyunlimited supply. We develop; in this model; an algorithm for sorting that has a worst-caserunning time better than the obvious implementations of parallel sorting.,*,2009,5
On solving efficiently the view selection problem under bag-semantics,Foto Afrati; Matthew Damigos; Manolis Gergatsoulis,Abstract In this paper; we investigate the problem of view selection for workloads ofconjunctive queries under bag semantics. In particular we aim to limit the search space ofcandidate viewsets. In that respect we start delineating the boundary between queryworkloads for which certain restricted search spaces suffice. They suffice in the sense thatthey do not compromise optimality in that they contain at least one of the optimal solutions.We start with the general case; where we give a tight condition that candidate views cansatisfy and still the search space (thus limited) does contain at least one optimal solution.Preliminary experiments show that this reduces the size of the search space significantly.Then we study special cases. We show that for chain query workloads; taking only chainviews may miss all optimum solutions; whereas; if we further limit the queries to be path …,International Workshop on Business Intelligence for the Real-Time Enterprise,2008,4
On containment of conjunctive queries with arithmetic comparisons (extended version),Foto Afrati; Chen Li; Prasenjit Mitra,Abstract In this paper we study the following problem: how to test whether Q¾ is contained inQ½; where Q½ and Q¾ are conjunctive queries with arithmetic comparisons? This problemis fundamental in a large variety of database applications. Existing algorithms first normalizethe queries; then test a logical implication using multiple containment mappings from Q½ toQ¾. We are interested in cases where the containment can be tested more efficiently. Thiswork is mainly motivated by (1) reducing the problem complexity from¥ p ¾-completeness toNP-completeness in these cases; and (2) utilizing the advantages of the homomorphismproperty (ie; the containment test is based on a single containment mapping); in applicationssuch as those of answering queries using views. The following are our results.(1) We showseveral cases where the normalization step is not needed; thus reducing the size of the …,In EDBT,2003,4
Definability and compression,Foto Afrati; Hans Leiß; Michel De Rougemont,Abstract A compression algorithm takes a finite structure of a class K as input and producesa finite structure of a different class K'as output. Given a property P on the class K defined ina logic ℒ; we study the definability of property P on the class K'. We consider twocompression schemes on unary ordered structures (strings); compression by run-lengthencoding and the classical Lempel-Ziv-78 scheme. First-order properties of strings are first-order on run-length compressed strings; but this fails for images; ie 2-dimensional strings.We present simple first-order properties of strings which are not first-order definable onstrings compressed with the Lempel-Ziv-78 compression scheme. We show that allproperties of strings that are first-order definable on strings are definable on Lempel-Zivcompressed strings in FO (TC); the extension of first-order logic with the transitive closure …,Fundamenta Informaticae,2003,4

The complexity of cubical graphs,Foto Afrati; Christos H Papadimitriou; George Papageorgiou,Suppose that we are given a finite automaton; such as the one shown in Figure 1. We maywish to assign a bit vector of some fixed length to each state of the automaton; suchencoding of the states is desirable in connection to applications of finite automata tocommunicatiou protocols; for example [Pa]. We may encounter the following problem;though: If we assign bit vectors to states arbitrarily; we may end up with an automaton inwtfich transitions from one state to the next entail the change of scveral positions in thc bitvector (eg; to go from state 0010 to 1001 in Figure 1; three positions must be changed).Ideally; we would like to obtain an assignment in which adjacent states differ in only oneposition. This is not always possible; though. For example; the automaton in Figure 1 canhave no such assignment (for a variety of reasons to become evident soon).

Computing marginals using MapReduce,Foto N Afrati; Shantanu Sharma; Jonathan R Ullman; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract We consider the problem of computing data-cube marginals by a single round ofMapReduce; focusing on the relationship between the reducer size and the replication rate.Initially; we simplify the problem by making the extent of each dimension the same. Severalrecursive constructions meet or come close to the minimum possible replication rate for agiven reducer size. These ideas extend in two directions. We relax the assumption that theextents are all equal; and we consider how to compute marginals from lower-ordermarginals rather than from the raw data cube.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2017,3
Meta-MapReduce: A technique for reducing communication in MapReduce computations,Foto Afrati; Shlomi Dolev; Shantanu Sharma; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract: MapReduce has proven to be one of the most useful paradigms in the revolution ofdistributed computing; where cloud services and cluster computing become the standardvenue for computing. The federation of cloud and big data activities is the next challengewhere MapReduce should be modified to avoid (big) data migration across remote (cloud)sites. This is exactly our scope of research; where only the very essential data for obtainingthe result is transmitted; reducing communication; processing and preserving data privacyas much as possible. In this work; we propose an algorithmic technique for MapReducealgorithms; called Meta-MapReduce; that decreases the communication cost by allowing usto process and move metadata to clouds and from the map phase to reduce phase.

Query Containment for Databases with Uncertainty and Lineage.,Foto N Afrati; Angelos Vasilakopoulos,Abstract. We define and investigate the computational complexity of the query containmentproblem for data that support both uncertainty and lineage. Query containment depends onthe definition of database containment which; for traditional databases; is defined as asimple set containment for each relation. As this is not the case in the presence ofuncertainty and lineage; we revisit the notion of database containment and define variouskinds of it that may be natural in different practical situations. We investigate conjunctivequery containment for the various kinds of query containment that we introduce.,MUD,2010,3

Designing views to efficiently answer real SQL queries,Foto Afrati; Rada Chirkova; Manolis Gergatsoulis; Vassia Pavlaki,Abstract The problem of optimizing queries in the presence of materialized views and therelated view-design problem have recently attracted a lot of attention. Significant researchresults have been reported; and materialized views are increasingly used in queryevaluation in commercial data-management systems. At the same time; most results in theliterature assume set-theoretic semantics; whereas SQL queries have bag-theoreticsemantics (duplicates are not eliminated unless explicitly requested). This paper presentsresults on selecting views to answer queries in relational databases under set; bag; and bag-set semantics. The results can be used under each of the three assumptions; to find soundand complete algorithms for designing views and rewriting queries efficiently.,International Symposium on Abstraction; Reformulation; and Approximation,2005,3
On temporal logic versus datalog,Irène Guessarian; Eugénie Foustoucos; Theodore Andronikos; Foto Afrati,Abstract We provide a direct and modular translation from the temporal logics CTL; ETL;FCTL (CTL extended with the ability to express fairness) and the Modal μ-calculus toMonadic inf-Datalog with built-in predicates. We call it inf-Datalog because the semantics weprovide is a little different from the conventional Datalog least fixed point semantics; in thatsome recursive rules (corresponding to least fixed points) are allowed to unfold only finitelymany times; whereas others (corresponding to greatest fixed points) are allowed to unfoldinfinitely many times. We characterize the fragments of Monadic inf-Datalog that have thesame expressive power as Modal Logic (resp. CTL; alternation-free Modal μ-calculus andModal μ-calculus). Our translation is interesting because it is direct and succinct. Moreoverthe fragments of Monadic inf-Datalog that we have exhibited have very simple syntactic …,Theoretical computer science,2003,3
Chain queries expressible by linear datalog programs,Foto Afrati; Francesca Toni,First-order (algebraic) query languages lack recursion and; as a consequence; have limitedexpressive power. Datalog; the language of Horn logic without function symbols; embedsrecursion and therefore allows to express a far wider class of queries. However; queriesexpressed in Datalog are harder to evaluate than classical rstorder queries. As aconsequnce; in the (deductive) database community; many e orts have been devoted todetect special classes of Datalog programs for which e cient evaluation methods andoptimisation techniques exist 5]. Linear Programs are special Datalog programs whichbelong to NC2. 2 Since it is conjectured that NC2 P (in the same way that it is conjecturedthat P NP); linear programs are simpler to evaluate than generic Datalog programs;belonging to P.

Inheritance in object oriented datalog: A modular logic programming approach,Foto Afrati; Isambo Karali; Theodoros Mitakos,Abstract Modularity is a special form of logic programming composition that allowsincremental development and code reusability. It is natural to be considered as the formalframework to supply semantics to languages of logic programs (such as datalog) when theunderlying data model is object oriented. We show here that a) for various interesting formsof inheritance; clean and natural semantics can indeed be de ned based on the modularlogic programming framework that avoids the undesired complication of datalogneg and b)that for certain forms of inheritance; this semantics is equivalent to the semantics ofdatalogmeth which is provided by transformation to datalogneg.,*,1997,3
A new framework for join product skew,Victor Kyritsis; Paraskevas V Lekeas; Dora Souliou; Foto Afrati,Abstract Different types of data skew can result in load imbalance in the context of paralleljoins under the shared nothing architecture. We study one important type of skew; joinproduct skew (JPS). A static approach based on frequency classes is proposed which takesfor granted the data distribution of join attribute values. It comes from the observation that thejoin selectivity can be expressed as a sum of products of frequencies of the join attributevalues. As a consequence; an appropriate assignment of join sub-tasks that takes intoconsideration the magnitude of the frequency products can alleviate the join product skew.Motivated by the aforementioned remark; we propose an algorithm; called Handling JoinProduct Skew (HJPS); to handle join product skew.,International Workshop on Resource Discovery,2010,2

Rewriting queries using views in the presence of arithmetic comparisons,Foto Afrati; Chen Li; Prasenjit Mitra,Abstract We consider the problem of answering queries using views; where queries andviews are conjunctive queries with arithmetic comparisons over dense orders. Previous workonly considered limited variants of this problem; without giving a complete solution. We firstshow that obtaining equivalent rewritings for conjunctive queries with arithmeticcomparisons is decidable. Then we consider the problem of finding maximally containedrewritings (MCR) where the decidability proof does not carry over. We investigate twospecial cases of this problem where the query uses only semi-interval comparisons. In bothcases decidability of finding MCRs depends on the query containment test. First; we addressthe case where the homomorphism property holds in testing query containment. In this casedecidability is easy to prove but developing an efficient algorithm is not trivial.

Performance considerations on a random graph model for parallel processing,F Afrati; Andreas Stafylopatis,Abstract.—Consider a random directed acycîic graph (dag) with nodes 1; 2;...; n; and anedge from node i to node j {pnîy if i> j) with fixed probability p. Such a graph can be thoughtof as the task graph associated with a job and thus it serves as a parallel processing model;the vertices correspond to tasks and the edges correspond to precedence constraintsbetween tasks. In this case; the length of the graph corresponds to the parallel processingtime of the job (an infinité number of available processors is assumed) and the width of thegraph corresponds to the parallelism of the job. We estimate her e the average length of therandom dag (that is; the average processing time of the job) as a function of the probability pand the number of tasks n by establishing tight lower and upper bounds. The lower (resp.upper) bound is determined as being equal to the average length of a random dag …,RAIRO-Theoretical Informatics and Applications,1993,2

Cross-checking data sources in MapReduce,Foto Afrati; Zaid Momani; Nikos Stasinopoulos,Abstract Fact checking from multiple sources is investigated from different and diverseangles and the complexity and diversity of the problem calls for a wide range of methodsand techniques [1]. Fact checking tasks are not easy to perform and; most importantly; it isnot clear what kind of computations they involve. Fact checking usually involves a largenumber of data sources that talk about the same thing but we are not sure which holds thecorrect information; or which has any information at all about the query we care for [2]. A joinamong all or some data sources can guide us through a fact checking process. However;when we want to perform this join on a distributed computational environment such asMapReduce; it is not obvious how to distribute efficiently the records in the data sources tothe reduce tasks in order to join any subset of them in a single MapReduce job.

Handling skew in multiway joins in parallel processing,Foto N Afrati; Jeffrey D Ullman; Angelos Vasilakopoulos,Abstract: Handling skew is one of the major challenges in query processing. In distributedcomputational environments such as MapReduce; uneven distribution of the data to theservers is not desired. One of the dominant measures that we want to optimize in distributedenvironments is communication cost. In a MapReduce job this is the amount of data that istransferred from the mappers to the reducers. In this paper we will introduce a noveltechnique for handling skew when we want to compute a multiway join in one MapReduceround with minimum communication cost. This technique is actually an adaptation of theShares algorithm [Afrati et. al; TKDE 2011].,arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.03247,2015,1

Brief Announcement: Assignment of Different-Sized Inputs in MapReduce⋆,Foto Afrati; Shlomi Dolev; Ephraim Korach; Shantanu Sharma; Jeffrey D Ullman,Reducer Capacity. An important parameter to be considered in MapReduce algorithms isthe “reducer capacity.” A reducer is an application of the reduce function to a single key andits associated list of values. The reducer capacity is an upper bound on the sum of the sizesof the values that are assigned to the reducer. For example; we may choose the reducercapacity to be the size of the main memory of the processors on which the reducers run. Weassume that all the reducers have an identical capacity; denoted by q. Motivation andExamples. We demonstrate a new aspect of the reducer capacity in the scope of severalspecial cases. One useful special case is where an output depends on exactly two inputs.We present two examples where each output depends on exactly two inputs and define twoproblems that are based on these examples.,Distributed,2014,1

Common Security Attacks on a TCP/IP Environment,SA Paschos; FN Afrati,Abstract The TCP/IP protocol suite are the most widely used communication protocols.Although their implementation begun at late 1960s; the tradeoffs between security andperformance are not yet well understood. It is evident from the known severe attacks that hasundergone; that encryption might be necessary on special messages (DNS messages;routing tables exchange) or in the IP level. In this paper; we focus on the attacks that becomefeasible because of the nature of the TCP/IP protocols. There is not yet a consent in theInternet community on how to make TCP/IP more secure without a major downrating on itsperformance. Finally we investigate; in detail; a recent attack; namely; IP spoofing; whichtakes advantage of the finer mechanisms of TCP/IP.,3th WSEAS International Multiconference on Circuits; Systems; Communications and Computers,1999,1

We extend certain of these tools to be applied to a wider class ofprograms; as they were; they were applied to chain rule programs (ie; the relations on theright-hand side of the rule are binary and form a chain). We examine the parallel complexityof weak-chain rule programs (ie; the relations on the right-hand side of the rule form a weakchain); and prove certain subclasses to belong to NC.

Accessing data using views,Foto Afrati; Rada Chirkova; Prasenjit Mitra,Abstract A popular technique for answering queries using views is to first rewrite the queriesusing the views and then to evaluate the queries using the data in the views. Existing workhas addressed the problem of finding equivalent or maximally-contained rewritings (MCR) ofqueries using views. At the same time; emerging applications require investigating theproblem of rewriting queries using views in a more general setting; and pose new technicalchallenges. In this paper we consider the problem of finding whether there exist rewritingsthat (1) are contained in the query;(2) contain the query; or (3) overlap with the query. Weinvestigate complexity issues and present efficient sound and complete algorithms that findminimally containing rewritings (MiCR) and check for the existence of contained rewritings;which is an easier problem than finding an MCR.,*,*,1

Weshow that the replication rate is minimized when the reducers receive all the inputsnecessary to compute one marginal of higher order. That observation lets us view theproblem as one of covering sets of k dimensions with sets of a larger size m; a problem thathas been studied under the name" covering numbers." We offer a number of constructionsthat; for different values of k and m meet or come close to yielding the minimum possiblereplication rate for a given reducer size.,Proceedings of the 20th International Database Engineering & Applications Symposium,2016,*

Reducer capacity and communication cost in MapReduce algorithms design,Foto Afrati; Shlomi Dolev; Ephraim Korach; Shantanu Sharma; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract An important parameter to be considered in MapReduce algorithms is the" reducercapacity;" is introduced here for the first time. The reducer capacity is an upper bound on thesum of the sizes of the inputs that are assigned to the reducer. We consider; for the first time;the different sizes of the inputs; which are sent to the reducers. Another significant parameterin a MapReduce job is" communication cost"--the total amount of data transferred--betweenthe map and reduce phases. The communication cost can be minimized by minimizing thenumber of copies of inputs sent to the reducers.,Proceedings of the 8th ACM International Systems and Storage Conference,2015,*

Considerations on low complexity codes concerning symmetry and cyclicity,Μάρκος Ν Δενδρινός; Φώτο Αφράτη; Markos N Dendrinos; Foto N Afrati,The binary error correcting codes that are examined in this paper are codes which areconstructed out of shorter subcodes. The method of construction is well described by abipartite graph. The one set of nodes of this graph represents the single bits of a codewordof the new code; while the other set of nodes represents the subcodes; there are edges onlybetween subcode-nodes and bit-nodes; having the interpretation that the set of bits that areconnected to a specific subcode must be a codeword of this subcode. Cyclically symmetricalstructures of such code constructing graphs are studied here and the positive effect of cycliccodes (when used as subcodes on such structures) on the error-correcting capability of theresulting code is demonstrated. A class of codes with error-correcting capability t equals 3 isextensively studied in a rigorous theoretical way.,*,2015,*
Consistent Answers of Conjunctive Queries on Graphs,Foto N Afrati; Phokion G Kolaitis; Angelos Vasilakopoulos,Abstract: During the past decade; there has been an extensive investigation of thecomputational complexity of the consistent answers of Boolean conjunctive queries underprimary key constraints. Much of this investigation has focused on self-join-free Booleanconjunctive queries. In this paper; we study the consistent answers of Boolean conjunctivequeries involving a single binary relation; ie; we consider arbitrary Boolean conjunctivequeries on directed graphs. In the presence of a single key constraint; we show that for eachsuch Boolean conjunctive query; either the problem of computing its consistent answers isexpressible in first-order logic; or it is polynomial-time solvable; but not expressible in first-order logic.

Union rewritings for XPath fragments,Μανώλης Γεργατσούλης; Φώτο Αφράτη; M Damigos; Manolis Gergatsoulis; Foto Afrati,In this paper; we study the problem of finding an equivalent rewriting of an XPath queryusing multiple views; and we show that the union operator may be required in order to findsuch a rewriting. In particular; focusing on the fragment of XPath containing both descendantedges and wildcard labels; we propose an algorithm that outputs a union of single-viewrewritings (if there exists any) which equivalently rewrites a given query. For the samefragment of XPath; we give necessary and sufficient conditions for query containment andequivalence of unions of queries.,*,2011,*

Query containment under bag and bag-set semantics,Μανώλης Γεργατσούλης; Φώτο Αφράτη; M Damigos; Manolis Gergatsoulis; Foto Afrati,Conjunctive queries (CQs) are at the core of query languages encountered in many logic-based research fields such as AI; or database systems. The majority of existing workassumes set semantics but often in real applications the manipulation of duplicate tuples isrequired. One of the major problems that arises as part of advanced features of queryoptimization; data integration; query reformulation and many other research topics is testingfor containment of such queries. In this work; we investigate the complexity of querycontainment problem for CQs under bag semantics (ie duplicate tuples are allowed in boththe database and the results of queries) and under bag-set semantics (ie duplicates areallowed in the result of the queries but not in the database). We derive complexity results forthese problems for five major subclasses of CQs; and we also find necessary conditions …,*,2010,*
On solving efficiently the view selection problem under bag-semantics,Μανώλης Γεργατσούλης; Φώτο Αφράτη; M Damigos; Manolis Gergatsoulis; Foto Afrati,In this paper; we investigate the problem of view selection for workloads of conjunctivequeries under bag semantics. In particular we aim to limit the search space of candidateviewsets. In that respect we start delineating the boundary between query workloads forwhich certain restricted search spaces suffice. They suffice in the sense that they do notcompromise optimality in that they contain at least one of the optimal solutions. We start withthe general case; where we give a tight condition that candidate views can satisfy and stillthe search space (thus limited) does contain at least one optimal solution. Preliminaryexperiments show that this reduces the size of the search space significantly. Then we studyspecial cases. We show that for chain query workloads; taking only chain views may miss alloptimum solutions; whereas; if we further limit the queries to be path queries (ie; chain …,*,2009,*
On rewriting Xpath Queries Using Views,Μανώλης Γεργατσούλης; Φώτο Αφράτη; Rada Chirkova; B Kimelfeld; Βάσια Παυλάκη; Y Sagiv; Manolis Gergatsoulis; Foto Afrati; Vassia Pavlaki,The problem of rewriting a query using a materialized view is studied for a well knownfragment of XPath that includes the following three constructs: wildcards; descendant edgesand branches. In earlier work; determining the existence of a rewriting was shown to becoNP-hard; but no tight complexity bound was given. While it was argued that Σ 3 p is anupper bound; the proof was based on results that have recently been refuted. Consequently;the exact complexity (and even decidability) of this basic problem has been unknown; andthere have been no practical rewriting algorithms if the query and the view use all the threeconstructs mentioned above. It is shown that under fairly general conditions; there are onlytwo candidates for rewriting and hence; the problem can be practically solved by twocontainment tests. In particular; under these conditions; determining the existence of a …,*,2009,*
View selection for real conjunctive queries,Φώτο Αφράτη; Rada Chirkova; Μανώλης Γεργατσούλης; Βάσια Παυλάκη; Foto Afrati; Manolis Gergatsoulis; Vassia Pavlaki,Given a query workload; a database and a set of constraints; the view-selection problem isto select views to materialize so that the constraints are satisfied and the views can be usedto compute the queries in the workload efficiently. A typical constraint; which we consider inthe present work; is to require that the views can be stored in a given amount of disk space.Depending on features of SQL queries (eg; the DISTINCT keyword) and on whether thedatabase relations on which the queries are applied are sets or bags; the queries may becomputed under set semantics; bag-set semantics; or bag semantics. In this paper we studythe complexity of the view-selection problem for conjunctive queries and views under thesesemantics. We show that bag semantics is the “easiest to handle”(we show that in this casethe decision version of view selection is in NP); whereas under set and bag-set semantics …,*,2007,*

Finding equivalent rewritings in the presence of arithmetic comparisons,Μανώλης Γεργατσούλης; Φώτο Αφράτη; Rada Chirkova; Βάσια Παυλάκη; Foto Afrati; Vassia Pavlaki; Manolis Gergatsoulis,The problem of rewriting queries using views has received significant attention because ofits applications in a wide variety of data-management problems. For select-project-join SQL(aka conjunctive) queries and views; there are efficient algorithms in the literature; which findequivalent and maximally contained rewritings. In the presence of arithmetic comparisons(ACs) the problem becomes more complex. We do not know how to find maximallycontained rewritings in the general case. There are algorithms which find maximallycontained rewritings only for special cases such as when ACs are restricted to be semi-interval. However; we know that the problem of finding an equivalent rewriting (if there existsone) in the presence of ACs is decidable; yet still doubly exponential. This complexity callsfor an efficient algorithm which will perform better on average than the complete …,*,2006,*
Answering Queries Determined by Views,Foto Afrati,Abstract Answering queries using views is the problem which examines how to derive theanswers to a query when we only have the answers to a set of views. In this paper weinvestigate this problem in the case where the answers to the views uniquely determine theanswers to the query. We say that a view set V determines a query Q if for any twodatabases D1; D2 it holds: V (D1)= V (D2) implies Q (D1)= Q (D2). We consider the casewhere query and views are defined by conjunctive queries. We ask the question: If a viewset V determines a query Q; is there an equivalent rewriting of Q using V? Clearly if we canfind an equivalent rewriting then the complexity of answering the queries given a viewinstance is polynomial. In this paper we show that computing the answers to queriesdetermined by views is in NP∩ coNP. We find cases;(such as chain queries; views …,*,2005,*
On relating CTL to Datalog,Foto Afrati; Theodore Andronikos; Vassia Pavlaki; Eugénie Foustoucos; Irene Guessarian,Abstract: CTL is the dominant temporal specification language in practice mainly due to thefact that it admits model checking in linear time. Logic programming and the database querylanguage Datalog are often used as an implementation platform for logic languages. In thispaper we present the exact relation between CTL and Datalog and moreover we build onthis relation and known efficient algorithms for CTL to obtain efficient algorithms forfragments of stratified Datalog. The contributions of this paper are: a) We embed CTL intoSTD which is a proper fragment of stratified Datalog. Moreover we show that STD expressesexactly CTL--we prove that by embedding STD into CTL. Both embeddings are linear. b)CTL can also be embedded to fragments of Datalog without negation. We define a fragmentof Datalog with the successor build-in predicate that we call TDS and we embed CTL into …,arXiv preprint cs/0510012,2005,*

Designing views to efficiently answer real SQL queries,Μανώλης Γεργατσούλης; Φώτο Αφράτη; Βάσια Παυλάκη; Rada Chirkova; Manolis Gergatsoulis; Foto Afrati; Vassia Pavlaki,The problem of optimizing queries in the presence of materialized views and the relatedview-design problem have recently attracted a lot of attention. Significant research resultshave been reported; and materialized views are increasingly used in query evaluation incommercial data-management systems. At the same time; most results in the literatureassume set-theoretic semantics; whereas SQL queries have bagtheoretic semantics(duplicates are not eliminated unless explicitly requested). This paper presents results onselecting views to answer queries in relational databases under set; bag; and bag-setsemantics. The results can be used under each of the three assumptions; to find sound andcomplete algorithms for designing views and rewriting queries efficiently.,*,2005,*

The expressiveness of DAC,Foto Afrati; Irène Guessarian; Michel De Rougemont,Abstract We define a new logic-based query language; called DAC; which is an extension ofDatalog. A DAC (w (n); h (n))(b (n))-program consists of a family of Datalog programs P nsuch that w (n); h (n); b (n) bound the width of rules; the number of rules; and the recursiondepth of any P n; respectively. We exhibit queries which are not Datalog expressible but areDAC expressible. We also prove non-expressiveness results for DAC and we infer variousstrict hierarchies obtained by allowing more rapidly growing functions on the boundparameters.,Theoretical computer science,2002,*
Generating Efficient Plans for Queries Using Views (Full Version),Foto Afrati; Chen Li; Jeff Ullman,We study the problem of generating efficient; equivalent rewritings using views to computethe answer to a query. We take the closed-world assumption; in which views arematerialized from base relations; rather than views describing sources in terms of abstractpredicates; as is common when the open-world assumption is used. In the closed-worldmodel; there can be an infinite number of different rewritings that compute the same answer;yet have quite different performance. Query optimizers take a logical plan (a rewriting of thequery) as an input; and generate efficient physical plans to compute the answer. Thus ourgoal is to generate a small subset of the possible logical plans without missing an optimalphysical plan. We first consider a cost model that counts the number of subgoals in aphysical plan; and show a search space that is guaranteed to include an optimal rewriting …,*,2001,*

Datalog; the language of Horn logic without function symbols; embedsrecursion and therefore allows to express a far wider class of queries.

As aconsequnce; in the (deductive) database community; many e orts have been devoted todetect special classes of Datalog programs for which e cient evaluation methods andoptimisation techniques exist. Linear Programs are special Datalog programs which belongto NC2. 1 Since it is conjectured that NC2 P (in the same way that it is conjectured that PNP); linear programs are simpler to evaluate than generic Datalog programs; belonging to P.We study the relationship between linear programs and a special class of (recursive) …,*,1997,*

Arity Hierarchies for Fixed-Point Logics,Foto N Afrati,Abstract Fixed-point logic is the logic of inductively de nable relations over structures of aspeci c signature. The inductive de nitions are given via expressions of the rst order logic orfragments of it. A natural question is whether we can increase the expressive power of thelogic by allowing larger arities of the inductively de ned relations. A number of resultsappeared lately that essentially solved that problem for the most important variants of xed-point logic; by showing that the arity hierarchy formed is strict even in the case when theinductive de nitions are over structures containing a single binary relation (ie; graphs). Wereview these results and comment on the techniques that were used to prove them. In fact;for the query language Datalog; a strict hierarchy is also shown with respect to thepersistency {arity of the inductively de ned relations.,*,*,*

Designing and Using Views To Improve Performance of Aggregate Queries (September 9; 2004),Foto Afrati; Rada Chirkova; Shalu Gupta; Charles Loftis,Abstract. Data-intensive systems routinely use derived data; such as indexes or materializedviews; to improve query-evaluation performance. In this context; the problem of designingderived data is as follows: Given a set of queries and a database; return definitions ofderived data that; when materialized in the database; would reduce the evaluation costs ofthe queries. Designing materialized views and indexes is an important part of automatedquery-performance tuning in data-management systems that experience changes over time;where a system addresses the performance requirements of current frequent and importantqueries by periodically reconsidering and rematerializing the stored derived data. In thispaper we present an extensible system architecture for Query-Performance Enhancementby Tuning (QPET). QPET combines design and use of derived data in an end-to-end …,*,*,*
Revising Propositional Horn Clause Knowledge Bases,Foto Afratiz; Theodoros G Kavalierosz; Dimitri Theodoratosx,Abstract We investigate the problem of revising a propositional knowledge base; viewed asa set of Horn clauses. We present algorithms that revise the knowledge base with a Hornclause according to the Set of Theories Fagin and Ullman and Vardi] and the When In DoubtThrow It Out approaches Ginsberg]. Under the rst approach the problem has shown to beintractable even when further restrictions are applied. We show that the algorithms run inpolynomial time in the case where the number of" relevant" negative clauses and rules (denite clauses having at least one negative literal) in the knowledge base is bounded.Intermediate results about resolution deduction of literals from a set of Horn clauses areobtained; which are of interest in their own right.,*,*,*
Answering Queries Using Views with Arithmetic Comparisons Paper 87,Foto Afrati; Chen Li; Prasenjit Mitra,Abstract We consider the problem of answering queries using views; where queries andviews are conjunctive queries with arithmetic comparisons (CQACs) over dense orders.Previous work only considered limited variants of this problem; without giving a completesolution. We have developed an efficient algorithm to obtain maximallycontained rewritings(MCRs) for queries having left (or right) semi-interval-comparison predicates. For semi-interval queries we show that at least recursive datalog is necessary to find a maximally-contained solution; and identify cases where datalog is sufficient. Finally; we show thatobtaining equivalent rewritings for CQAC's is decidable.,*,*,*

Web Content Change Management using Agent-Oriented Approach,Ezz Hattab; Foto Afrati,Nowadays; organizations drive their businesses via the web that provides new opportunitiesand competitive threats. They are always in rush to deploy their updated contents with highquality in a competitive time. Due to lack of web change management systems and tools;most of the current web systems have problems with contents that are corrupted; outdatedand inconsistent. Current content management systems and studios; like Rational SuiteContent Studio [1]; MS SourceSafe [2]; Harvest [3] and PVCS [4]; aid developers to buildapplications in systematic and concurrent workflow. Such tools do not support issues relatedto content maintainability such as change impact analysis and propagation.,*,*,*
