Sindbad: a location-based social networking system,Mohamed Sarwat; Jie Bao; Ahmed Eldawy; Justin J Levandoski; Amr Magdy; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract This demo presents Sindbad; a location-based social networking system. Sindbadsupports three new services beyond traditional social networking services; namely; location-aware news feed; location-aware recommender; and location-aware ranking. These newservices not only consider social relevance for its users; but they also consider spatialrelevance. Since location-aware social networking systems have to deal with large numberof users; large number of messages; and user mobility; efficiency and scalability areimportant issues. To this end; Sindbad encapsulates its three main services inside the queryprocessing engine of PostgreSQL. Usage and internal functionality of Sindbad; implementedwith PostgreSQL and Google Maps API; are demonstrated through user (ie; web/phone) andsystem analyzer GUI interfaces; respectively.,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,52
Matrix factorization with explicit trust and distrust side information for improved social recommendation,Rana Forsati; Mehrdad Mahdavi; Mehrnoush Shamsfard; Mohamed Sarwat,Abstract With the advent of online social networks; recommender systems have becamecrucial for the success of many online applications/services due to their significance role intailoring these applications to user-specific needs or preferences. Despite their increasingpopularity; in general; recommender systems suffer from data sparsity and cold-startproblems. To alleviate these issues; in recent years; there has been an upsurge of interest inexploiting social information such as trust relations among users along with the rating data toimprove the performance of recommender systems. The main motivation for exploiting trustinformation in the recommendation process stems from the observation that the ideas we areexposed to and the choices we make are significantly influenced by our social context.However; in large user communities; in addition to trust relations; distrust relations also …,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2014,49
Horton: Online query execution engine for large distributed graphs,Mohamed Sarwat; Sameh Elnikety; Yuxiong He; Gabriel Kliot,Graphs are used in many large-scale applications; such as social networking. Themanagement of these graphs poses new challenges as such graphs are too large for asingle server to manage efficiently. Current distributed techniques such as map-reduce andPregel are not well-suited to processing interactive ad-hoc queries against large graphs. Inthis paper we demonstrate Horton; a distributed interactive query execution engine for largegraphs. Horton defines a query language that allows the expression of regular languagereach ability queries and provides a query execution engine with a query optimizer thatallows interactive execution of queries on large distributed graphs in parallel. In the demo;we show the functionality of Horton managing a large graph for a social networkingapplication called Codebook; whose graph represents data on software components …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,43
Horton+: a distributed system for processing declarative reachability queries over partitioned graphs,Mohamed Sarwat; Sameh Elnikety; Yuxiong He; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract Horton+ is a graph query processing system that executes declarative reachabilityqueries on a partitioned attributed multi-graph. It employs a query language; queryoptimizer; and a distributed execution engine. The query language expresses declarativereachability queries; and supports closures and predicates on node and edge attributes tomatch graph paths. We introduce three algebraic operators; select; traverse; and join; and aquery is compiled into an execution plan containing these operators. As reachability queriesaccess the graph elements in a random access pattern; the graph is therefore maintained inthe main memory of a cluster of servers to reduce query execution time. We develop adistributed execution engine that processes a query plan in parallel on the graph servers.Since the query language is declarative; we build a query optimizer that uses graph …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,34

Collecting real traffic datasets is tedious as itusually takes a significant amount of time and effort. Alternatively; many researchers opt togenerate synthetic traffic data using existing traffic generation tools; eg; Brinkhoff andBerlinMOD. Unfortunately; existing road network traffic generators require significant amountof time and effort to install; configure; and run. Moreover; it is not trivial to generate trafficdata in arbitrary spatial regions using existing traffic generators.

RecStore: an extensible and adaptive framework for online recommender queries inside the database engine,Justin J Levandoski; Mohamed Sarwat; Mohamed F Mokbel; Michael D Ekstrand,Abstract Most recommendation methods (eg; collaborative filtering) consist of (1) acomputationally intense offline phase that computes a recommender model based on users'opinions of items; and (2) an online phase consisting of SQL-based queries that use themodel (generated offline) to derive user preferences and provide recommendations forinteresting items. Current application usage trends require a completely onlinerecommender process; meaning the recommender model must update in real time as newopinions enter the system. To tackle this problem; we propose RecStore; a DBMS storageengine module capable of efficient online model maintenance. Externally; models managedby RecStore behave as relational tables; thus existing SQL-based recommendation queriesremain unchanged while gaining online model support.

A new approach for context-independent handwritten offline diagram recognition using support vector machines,Khaled S Refaat; Wael N Helmy; AbdelRahman H Ali; Mohamed S AbdelGhany; Amir F Atiya,Structured diagrams are very prevalent in many document types. Most people who need tocreate such diagrams use structured graphics editors such as Microsoft Visio [1]. Structuredgraphics editors are extremely powerful and expressive but they can be cumbersome to use[2]. We have shown through extensive timing experiments that structured diagrams drawn byhand will take only about 10% of the time it takes to draw one using a tool like Visio. Thisindicates the value of automated recognition of hand-written diagrams. Recently;applications have been developed that use online systems running on pen-input PCs thatallow users to create structured diagrams by drawing the diagram on the PC tablet. Theprogress of offline diagram recognition is still minimal. The objective of this paper is topropose a context-independent off-line diagram recognition system.

Context awareness in mobile systems,Mohamed Sarwat; Jie Bao; Chi-Yin Chow; Justin Levandoski; Amr Magdy; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract Context represents any information that can be used to characterize the situation ofan entity. An entity is a person; place; or object that is considered relevant to the interactionbetween a user and an application; including the user and application themselves. Theubiquity of mobile devices (eg; smartphones; GPS devices) has in part motivated the use ofcontextual information in modern mobile applications. From one perspective; context inmobile systems can fall into three categories:(a) user context that includes the personalattributes of the user; eg; spatial location and budget;(b) point-of-interest (POI) context; eg;restaurant location; operating time; and rating; and (c) environmental context; eg; weatherand road conditions.

Database management system support for collaborative filtering recommender systems,Mohamed Sarwat,Abstract Recommender systems help users identify useful; interesting items or content (data)from a considerably large search space. By far; the most popular recommendation techniqueused is collaborative filtering which exploits the users' opinions (eg; movie ratings) and/orpurchasing (eg; watching; reading) history in order to extract a set of interesting items foreach user. Database Management Systems (DBMSs) do not provide in-house support forrecommendation applications despite their popularity. Existing recommender systemarchitectures either do not employ a DBMS at all or only uses it as a data store whereas therecommendation logic is implemented in-full outside the database engine. Incorporating therecommendation functionality inside the DBMS kernel is beneficial for the followingreasons:(1) Many recommendation algorithms take as input structured data (users; items …,*,2014,1

On Evaluating Social Proximity-Aware Spatial Range Queries,Yuhan Sun; Nitin Pasumarthy; Mohamed Sarwat,Spatial range queries are used on a daily basis in real-life applications; such as GoogleMaps and Yelp. Many of those applications may need to rank the spatial objects; enclosedby the spatial range; before presenting the result to the end-user. Existing systems rankspatial objects according to different rules; such as average user rating; distance to theuser's location; etc... The popularity of social networks allowed many applications toleverage the social graph in delivering a social-proximity aware ranked list of spatial objects.In this paper; we formally define a query that returns the top-k spatial objects in a givenspatial region and rank them according to the social proximity of these objects to thequerying user (SKNNGEO). Furthermore; a framework that integrates a joint search on boththe social and spatial domains is proposed to efficiently solve the SKNNGEO query.

The proposed structure significantly shrinks index storage and maintenanceoverhead without compromising much on query execution performance. Experiments …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1604.03234,2016,*

Generation and optimization of data sharing among multiple data sources and consumers,*,Systems and methods for data sharing include generating at least one sharing plan with acheapest cost and/or a shortest execution time for one or more sharing arrangements.Admissibility of the one or more sharing arrangements is determined such that a critical timepath of the at least one sharing plan does not exceed a staleness level and a cost of the atleast one sharing plan does not exceed a capacity. Sharing plans of admissible sharingarrangements are executed while maintaining the staleness level.,*,2014,*
Social networking and mobility: A data management perspective,Mohamed Sarwat; Mohamed F Mokbel,In the first part; we start by giving a quick overview of social networking services (eg;Facebook; Twitter); their evolution; and how they impact the society. Similarly; we explain;through examples and case studies; how the widespread of mobile devices changed thecomputing paradigm in a way that impacted our daily life. In the second part; we presentstate-of-the-art research that lies within the intersection of both social networking andmobility; from the following perspectives: 1) geosocial queries; 2) geosocialrecommendation; 3) geosocial analytics; 4) geosocial visualization; and 5) geosocialcrowdsourcing.,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2013 IEEE 14th International Conference on,2013,*
Finding optimum combined plans among multiple sharing arrangements and multiple data sources and consumers,*,Systems and methods for data sharing include merging sharing plans of admissible sharingarrangements to provide a merged sharing plan. A set of all possible plumbings aredetermined for the merged sharing plan. A plumbing with a maximum profit is iterativelyapplied; using a processor; to the merged sharing plan for each plumbing of the set suchthat a staleness level is maintained to provide an optimized sharing plan.,*,2013,*

GeoSpark: A Cluster Computing Framework for Processing Spatial Data,Jia Yu; Jinxuan Wu; Mohamed Sarwat,ABSTRACT This paper introduces GeoSpark an in-memory cluster computing framework forprocessing large-scale spatial data. GeoSpark consists of three layers: Apache Spark Layer;Spatial RDD Layer and Spatial Query Processing Layer. Apache Spark Layer provides basicSpark functionalities that include loading/storing data to disk as well as regular RDDoperations. Spatial RDD Layer consists of three novel Spatial Resilient Distributed Datasets(SRDDs) which extend regular Apache Spark RDD to support geometrical and spatialobjects. GeoSpark provides a geometrical operations library that accesses Spatial RDDs toperform basic geometrical operations (eg; Overlap; Intersect). The system users canleverage the newly defined SRDDs to effectively develop spatial data processing programsin Spark. The Spatial Query Processing Layer efficiently executes spatial query …,*,*,*
