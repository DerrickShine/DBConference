Interactive top-k spatial keyword queries,Kai Zheng; Han Su; Bolong Zheng; Shuo Shang; Jiajie Xu; Jiajun Liu; Xiaofang Zhou,Conventional top-k spatial keyword queries require users to explicitly specify theirpreferences between spatial proximity and keyword relevance. In this work we investigatehow to eliminate this requirement by enhancing the conventional queries with interaction;resulting in Interactive Top-k Spatial Keyword (ITkSK) query. Having confirmed the feasibilityby theoretical analysis; we propose a three-phase solution focusing on both effectivenessand efficiency. The first phase substantially narrows down the search space for subsequentphases by efficiently retrieving a set of geo-textual k-skyband objects as the initialcandidates. In the second phase three practical strategies for selecting a subset ofcandidates are developed with the aim of maximizing the expected benefit for learning userpreferences at each round of interaction. Finally we discuss how to determine the …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,32
Approximate keyword search in semantic trajectory database,Bolong Zheng; Nicholas Jing Yuan; Kai Zheng; Xing Xie; Shazia Sadiq; Xiaofang Zhou,Driven by the advances in location positioning techniques and the popularity of locationsharing services; semantic enriched trajectory data have become unprecedentedlyavailable. While finding relevant Point-of-Interest (POIs) based on users' locations and querykeywords has been extensively studied in the past years; it is largely untouched to explorethe keyword queries in the context of semantic trajectory database. In this paper; we studythe problem of approximate keyword search in massive semantic trajectories. Given a set ofquery keywords; an approximate keyword query of semantic trajectory (AKQST) returns ktrajectories that contain the most relevant keywords to the query and yield the least traveleffort in the meantime. The main difference between AKQST and conventional spatialkeyword queries is that there is no query location in AKQST; which means the search …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,29
Sharkdb: An in-memory column-oriented trajectory storage,Haozhou Wang; Kai Zheng; Jiajie Xu; Bolong Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou; Shazia Sadiq,Abstract The last decade has witnessed the prevalence of sensor and GPS technologies thatproduce a high volume of trajectory data representing the motion history of moving objects.However some characteristics of trajectories such as variable lengths and asynchronoussampling rates make it difficult to fit into traditional database systems that are disk-based andtuple-oriented. Motivated by the success of column store and recent development of in-memory databases; we try to explore the potential opportunities of boosting the performanceof trajectory data processing by designing a novel trajectory storage within main memory. Incontrast to most existing trajectory indexing methods that keep consecutive samples of thesame trajectory in the same disk page; we partition the database into frames in which thepositions of all moving objects at the same time instant are stored together and aligned in …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM international conference on conference on information and knowledge management,2014,29
Keyword-aware continuous knn query on road networks,Bolong Zheng; Kai Zheng; Xiaokui Xiao; Han Su; Hongzhi Yin; Xiaofang Zhou; Guohui Li,It is nowadays quite common for road networks to have textual contents on the vertices;which describe auxiliary information (eg; business; traffic; etc.) associated with the vertex. Insuch road networks; which are modelled as weighted undirected graphs; each vertex isassociated with one or more keywords; and each edge is assigned with a weight; which canbe its physical length or travelling time. In this paper; we study the problem of keyword-aware continuous k nearest neighbour (KCkNN) search on road networks; which computesthe k nearest vertices that contain the query keywords issued by a moving object andmaintains the results continuously as the object is moving on the road network. Reducingthe query processing costs in terms of computation and communication has attractedconsiderable attention in the database community with interesting techniques proposed …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,8
Efficient retrieval of top-k most similar users from travel smart card data,Bolong Zheng; Kai Zheng; Mohamed A Sharaf; Xiaofang Zhou; Shazia Sadiq,Understanding the dynamics of human daily mobility patterns is essential for themanagement and planning of urban facilities and services. Travel smart cards; which recordusers' public transporting histories; capture rich information of users' mobility pattern. Thisprovides the opportunity to discover valuable knowledge from these transaction records. Inrecent years; research on measuring user similarity for behavior analysis has attracted a lotof attention in applications such as recommendation systems; crowd behavior analysisapplications; and numerous data mining tasks. In this paper; our goal is to estimate thesimilarity between users' travel patterns according to their travel smart card data. The core ofour proposal is a novel user similarity measurement; namely; Travel Spatial-TemporalSimilarity (TST); which measures the spatial range and temporal similarity between users …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2014 IEEE 15th International Conference on,2014,5
Cost-efficient spatial network partitioning for distance-based query processing,Jiping Wang; Kai Zheng; Hoyoung Jeung; Haozhou Wang; Bolong Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou,The efficiency of spatial query processing is crucial for many applications such as location-based services. In spatial networks; queries like k-NN queries are all based on networkdistance evaluation. Classic solutions for these queries rely on network expansion and arenot efficient enough for large networks. Some approaches have improved the queryefficiency but brought considerable space cost for index. To address these problems; wepropose a hierarchical graph partitioning based index named Partition Tree. It organizes thevertices of a spatial network into a hierarchy through a series of graph partitioningprocesses. Meanwhile precomputed distances are associated with this hierarchy to facilitateefficient query processing. Inspired by the observation that queries are usually invokedaround objects of interest; we propose a query-oriented optimization on top of the …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2014 IEEE 15th International Conference on,2014,4
Popularity-aware spatial keyword search on activity trajectories,Kai Zheng; Bolong Zheng; Jiajie Xu; Guanfeng Liu; An Liu; Zhixu Li,Abstract The proliferation of GPS-enabled smart mobile devices enables us to collect a large-scale trajectories of moving objects with GPS tags. While the raw trajectories that onlyconsists of positional information have been studied extensively; many recent works havebeen focusing on enriching the raw trajectories with semantic knowledge. The resultingdata; called activity trajectories; embed the information about behaviors of the movingobjects and support a variety of applications for better quality of services. In this paper; wepropose a Top-k Spatial Keyword (T k SK) query for activity trajectories; with the objective tofind a set of trajectories that are not only close geographically but also meet therequirements of the query semantically. Such kind of query can deliver more informativeresults than existing spatial keyword queries for static objects; since activity trajectories …,World Wide Web,2017,3
Efficient clue-based route search on road networks,Bolong Zheng; Han Su; Wen Hua; Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou; Guohui Li,With the advances in geo-positioning technologies and location-based services; it isnowadays quite common for road networks to have textual contents on the vertices. Previouswork on identifying an optimal route that covers a sequence of query keywords has beenstudied in recent years. However; in many practical scenarios; an optimal route might notalways be desirable. For example; a personalized route query is issued by providing someclues that describe the spatial context between PoIs along the route; where the result can befar from the optimal one. Therefore; in this paper; we investigate the problem of clue-basedroute search (${\sf {CRS}} $); which allows a user to provide clues on keywords and spatialrelationships. First; we propose a greedy algorithm and a dynamic programming algorithmas baselines. To improve efficiency; we develop a branch-and-bound algorithm that …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,2
PerNav: A route summarization framework for personalized navigation,Yaguang Li; Han Su; Ugur Demiryurek; Bolong Zheng; Kai Zeng; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract In this paper; we study a route summarization framework for PersonalizedNavigation dubbed PerNav-with which the goal is to generate more intuitive and customizedturn-by-turn directions based on user generated content. The turn-by-turn directionsprovided in the existing navigation applications are exclusively derived from underlying roadnetwork topology information ie; the connectivity of nodes to each other. Therefore; the turn-by-turn directions are simplified as metric translation of physical world (eg distance/time toturn) to spoken language. Such translation-that ignores human cognition about thegeographic space-is often verbose and redundant for the drivers who have knowledgeabout the geographical areas. PerNav utilizes wealth of user generated historical trajectorydata to extract namely" landmarks"(eg; point of interests or intersections) and frequently …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,2
Landmark-Based Route Recommendation with Crowd Intelligence,Bolong Zheng; Han Su; Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Route recommendation is one of the most widely used location-based servicesnowadays; as it is vital for nice-driving experience and smooth public traffic. Given a pair ofuser-specified origin and destination; a route recommendation service aims to provide userswith the routes of the best travelling experience according to given criteria. However; eventhe routes recommended by the big-thumb service providers can deviate significantly fromthe ones travelled by experienced drivers; which motivates the previous research thatleverages crowds' knowledge to improve the recommendation quality. Since routerecommendation is normally an online task; low-latency response to drivers' queries isrequired in this kind of systems. Unfortunately; latency of crowdsourced systems is usuallyhigh; because they need to generate tasks and wait for workers' feedbacks before …,Data Science and Engineering,2016,2

Probesim: scalable single-source and top-k simrank computations on dynamic graphs,Yu Liu; Bolong Zheng; Xiaodong He; Zhewei Wei; Xiaokui Xiao; Kai Zheng; Jiaheng Lu,Abstract Single-source and top-k SimRank queries are two important types of similaritysearch in graphs with numerous applications in web mining; social network analysis; spamdetection; etc. A plethora of techniques have been proposed for these two types of queries;but very few can efficiently support similarity search over large dynamic graphs; due to eithersignificant preprocessing time or large space overheads. This paper presents ProbeSim; anindex-free algorithm for single-source and top-k SimRank queries that provides a non-trivialtheoretical guarantee in the absolute error of query results. ProbeSim estimates SimRanksimilarities without precomputing any indexing structures; and thus can naturally supportreal-time SimRank queries on dynamic graphs. Besides the theoretical guarantee;ProbeSim also offers satisfying practical efficiency and effectiveness due to non-trivial …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,*

GPS-Simulated Trajectory Detection,Han Su; Wei Chen; Rong Liu; Min Nie; Bolong Zheng; Zehao Huang; Defu Lian,Abstract Due to the prevalence of GPS-enabled devices and wireless communicationtechnology; spatial trajectories have become the basis of many location based applications;eg; Didi. However; trajectory data suffers low quality problems causing by sensor errors andartificial forgeries. Sensor errors are inevitable while forgeries are always constructed onbad purpose. For example; some Didi drivers use GPS simulators to generate forgerytrajectories and make fake transactions. In this work we aim to distinguish whether a giventrajectory is a GPS simulated trajectory. By formulating this task as the problem of trafficspeed extracting and irregular measuring; we propose a simulated trajectory detectionframework. In traffic speed extracting phase; we first divide time into time slots and thenextract the regular speed of each road during each time slot.
