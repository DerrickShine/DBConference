CURE: an efficient clustering algorithm for large databases,Sudipto Guha; Rajeev Rastogi; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Clustering; in data mining; is useful for discovering groups and identifyinginteresting distributions in the underlying data. Traditional clustering algorithms either favorclusters with spherical shapes and similar sizes; or are very fragile in the presence ofoutliers. We propose a new clustering algorithm called CURE that is more robust to outliers;and identifies clusters having non-spherical shapes and wide variances in size. CUREachieves this by representing each cluster by a certain fixed number of points that aregenerated by selecting well scattered points from the cluster and then shrinking them towardthe center of the cluster by a specified fraction. Having more than one representative pointper cluster allows CURE to adjust well to the geometry of non-spherical shapes and theshrinking helps to dampen the effects of outliers.

ROCK: A robust clustering algorithm for categorical attributes,Sudipto Guha; Rajeev Rastogi; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Clustering; in data mining; is useful to discover distribution patterns in theunderlying data. Clustering algorithms usually employ a distance metric based (eg;euclidean) similarity measure in order to partition the database such that data points in thesame partition are more similar than points in different partitions. In this paper; we studyclustering algorithms for data with boolean and categorical attributes. We show thattraditional clustering algorithms that use distances between points for clustering are notappropriate for boolean and categorical attributes.

Efficient algorithms for mining outliers from large data sets,Sridhar Ramaswamy; Rajeev Rastogi; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract In this paper; we propose a novel formulation for distance-based outliers that isbased on the distance of a point from its k th nearest neighbor. We rank each point on thebasis of its distance to its k th nearest neighbor and declare the top n points in this ranking tobe outliers. In addition to developing relatively straightforward solutions to finding suchoutliers based on the classical nested-loop join and index join algorithms; we develop ahighly efficient partition-based algorithm for mining outliers. This algorithm first partitions theinput data set into disjoint subsets; and then prunes entire partitions as soon as it isdetermined that they cannot contain outliers. This results in substantial savings incomputation. We present the results of an extensive experimental study on real-life andsynthetic data sets. The results from a real-life NBA database highlight and reveal several …,ACM Sigmod Record,2000,1727
SPIRIT: Sequential pattern mining with regular expression constraints,Minos Garofalakis; Rajeev Rastogi; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Discovering sequential patterns is an important problem in data mining with a hostof application domains including medicine; telecommunications; and the World Wide Web.Conventional mining systems provide users with only a very restricted mechanism (basedon minimum support) for specifying patterns of interest. In this paper; we propose the use ofRegular Expressions (REs) as a flexible constraint specification tool that enables user-controlled focus to be incorporated into the pattern mining process. We develop a family ofnovel algorithms (termed SPIRIT–Sequential Pattern mIning with Regular expressIonconsTraints) for mining frequent sequential patterns that also satisfy user-specified REconstraints. The main distinguishing factor among the proposed schemes is the degree towhich the RE constraints are enforced to prune the search space of patterns during …,Proceedings of the international conference on very large data bases,1999,646
Approximate query processing using wavelets,Kaushik Chakrabarti; Minos Garofalakis; Rajeev Rastogi; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Approximate query processing has emerged as a cost-effective approach fordealing with the huge data volumes and stringent response-time requirements of today'sdecision support systems (DSS). Most work in this area; however; has so far been limited inits query processing scope; typically focusing on specific forms of aggregate queries.Furthermore; conventional approaches based on sampling or histograms appear to beinherently limited when it comes to approximating the results of complex queries over high-dimensional DSS data sets. In this paper; we propose the use of multi-dimensional waveletsas an effective tool for general-purpose approximate query processing in modern; high-dimensional applications. Our approach is based on building wavelet-coefficient synopsesof the data and using these synopses to provide approximate answers to queries.

Efficient filtering of XML documents with XPath expressions,C-Y Chan; Pascal Felber; Minos Garofalakis; Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract The publish/subscribe paradigm is a popular model for allowing publishers (ie; datagenerators) to selectively disseminate data to a large number of widely dispersedsubscribers (ie; data consumers) who have registered their interest in specific informationitems. Early publish/subscribe systems have typically relied on simple subscriptionmechanisms; such as keyword or” bag of words” matching; or simple comparison predicateson attribute values. The emergence of XML as a standard for information exchange on theInternet has led to an increased interest in using more expressive subscription mechanisms(eg; based on XPath expressions) that exploit both the structure and the content of publishedXML documents. Given the increased complexity of these new data-filtering mechanisms;the problem of effectively identifying the subscription profiles that match an incoming XML …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2002,565

Processing complex aggregate queries over data streams,Alin Dobra; Minos Garofalakis; Johannes Gehrke; Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in designing algorithms forquerying and analyzing streaming data (ie; data that is seen only once in a fixed order) withonly limited memory. Providing (perhaps approximate) answers to queries over suchcontinuous data streams is a crucial requirement for many application environments;examples include large telecom and IP network installations where performance data fromdifferent parts of the network needs to be continuously collected and analyzed. In this paper;we consider the problem of approximately answering general aggregate SQL queries overcontinuous data streams with limited memory. Our method relies on randomizing techniquesthat compute small" sketch" summaries of the streams that can then be used to provideapproximate answers to aggregate queries with provable guarantees on the …,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2002,396
PUBLIC: A decision tree classifier that integrates building and pruning,Rajeev Rastogi; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Classification is an important problem in data mining. Given a database of records;each with a class label; a classifier generates a concise and meaningful description for eachclass that can be used to classify subsequent records. A number of popular classifiersconstruct decision trees to generate class models. These classifiers first build a decision treeand then prune subtrees from the decision tree in a subsequent pruning phase to improveaccuracy and prevent" overfitting". Generating the decision tree in two distinct phases couldresult in a substantial amount of wasted effort since an entire subtree constructed in the firstphase may later be pruned in the next phase. In this paper; we propose PUBLIC; animproved decision tree classifier that integrates the second" pruning" phase with the initial"building" phase. In PUBLIC; a node is not expanded during the building phase; if it is …,VLDB,1998,390
WALRUS: A similarity retrieval algorithm for image databases,Apostol Natsev; Rajeev Rastogi; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Traditional approaches for content-based image querying typically compute asingle signature for each image based on color histograms; texture; wavelet tranforms etc.;and return as the query result; images whose signatures are closest to the signature of thequery image. Therefore; most traditional methods break down when images contain similarobjects that are scaled differently or at different locations; or only certain regions of theimage match. In this paper; we propose WALRUS (WAveLet-based Retrieval of User-specified Scenes); a novel similarity retrieval algorithm that is robust to scaling andtranslation of objects within an image. WALRUS employs a novel similarity model in whicheach image is first decomposed into its regions; and the similarity measure between a pair ofimages is then defined to be the fraction of the area of the two images covered by …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1999,323
Querying and mining data streams: you only get one look a tutorial,Minos Garofalakis; Johannes Gehrke; Rajeev Rastogi,Traditional Database Management Systems (DBMS) software is built on the concept ofpersistent data sets; that are stored reliably in stable storage and queried/updated severaltimes throughout their lifetime. For several emerging application domains; however; dataarrives and needs to be processed on a continuous (24 x 7) basis; without the benefit ofseveral passes over a static; persistent data image. Such continuous data streams arisenaturally; for example; in the network installations of large Telecom and Internet serviceproviders where detailed usage information (Call-Detail-Records (CDRs); SNMP/RMONpacket-flow data; etc.) from different parts of the underlying network needs to becontinuously collected and analyzed for interesting trends.

XTRACT: a system for extracting document type descriptors from XML documents,Minos Garofalakis; Aristides Gionis; Rajeev Rastogi; Sridhar Seshadri; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract XML is rapidly emerging as the new standard for data representation and exchangeon the Web. An XML document can be accompanied by a Document Type Descriptor (DTD)which plays the role of a schema for an XML data collection. DTDs contain valuableinformation on the structure of documents and thus have a crucial role in the efficient storageof XML data; as well as the effective formulation and optimization of XML queries. In thispaper; we propose XTRACT; a novel system for inferring a DTD schema for a database ofXML documents. Since the DTD syntax incorporates the full expressive power of regularexpressions; naive approaches typically fail to produce concise and intuitive DTDs. Instead;the XTRACT inference algorithms employ a sequence of sophisticated steps that involve:(1)finding patterns in the input sequences and replacing them with regular expressions to …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2000,321
A cost-based model and effective heuristic for repairing constraints by value modification,Philip Bohannon; Wenfei Fan; Michael Flaster; Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract Data integrated from multiple sources may contain inconsistencies that violateintegrity constraints. The constraint repair problem attempts to find" low cost" changes that;when applied; will cause the constraints to be satisfied. While in most previous work repaircost is stated in terms of tuple insertions and deletions; we follow recent work to define adatabase repair as a set of value modifications. In this context; we introduce a novel costframework that allows for the application of techniques from record-linkage to the search forgood repairs. We prove that finding minimal-cost repairs in this model is NP-complete in thesize of the database; and introduce an approach to heuristic repair-construction based onequivalence classes of attribute values. Following this approach; we define two greedyalgorithms. While these simple algorithms take time cubic in the size of the database; we …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,317
Provisioning a virtual private network: a network design problem for multicommodity flow,Anupam Gupta; Jon Kleinberg; Amit Kumar; Rajeev Rastogi; Bulent Yener,Abstract Consider a setting in which a group of nodes; situated in a large underlyingnetwork; wishes to reserve bandwidth on which to support communication. Virtual privatenetworks (VPNs) are services that support such a construct; rather than building a newphysical network on the group of nodes that must be connected; bandwidth in the underlyingnetwork is reserved for communication within the group; forming a virtual “sub-network.”Provisioning a virtual private network over a set off terminals gives rise to the followinggeneral network design problem. We have bounds on the cumulative amount of traffic eachterminal can send and receive; we must choose a path for each pair of terminals; and abandwidth allocation for each edge of the network; so that any traffic matrix consistent withthe given upper bounds can be feasibly routed. Thus; we are seeking to design a network …,Proceedings of the thirty-third annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing,2001,316
Topology discovery in heterogeneous IP networks,Yuri Breitbart; Minos Garofalakis; Cliff Martin; Rajeev Rastogi; S Seshadri; Avi Silberschatz,Knowledge of the up-to-date physical topology of an IP network is crucial to a number ofcritical network management tasks; including reactive and proactive resource management;event correlation; and root-cause analysis.

Algorithms for provisioning virtual private networks in the hose model,Amit Kumar; Rajeev Rastogi; Avi Silberschatz; Bulent Yener,Abstract Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) provide customers with predictable and securenetwork connections over a shared network. The recently proposed hose model for VPNsallows for greater flexibility since it permits traffic to and from a hose endpoint to be arbitrarilydistributed to other endpoints. In this paper; we develop novel algorithms for provisioningVPNs in the hose model. We connect VPN endpoints using a tree structure and ouralgorithms attempt to optimize the total bandwidth reserved on edges of the VPN tree. Weshow that even for the simple scenario in which network links are assumed to have infinitecapacity; the general problem of computing the optimal VPN tree is NP-hard. Fortunately; forthe special case when the ingress and egress bandwidths for each VPN endpoint are equal;we can devise an algorithm for computing the optimal tree whose time complexity is O …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2001,280
Graph summarization with bounded error,Saket Navlakha; Rajeev Rastogi; Nisheeth Shrivastava,Abstract We propose a highly compact two-part representation of a given graph G consistingof a graph summary and a set of corrections. The graph summary is an aggregate graph inwhich each node corresponds to a set of nodes in G; and each edge represents the edgesbetween all pair of nodes in the two sets. On the other hand; the corrections portion specifiesthe list of edge-corrections that should be applied to the summary to recreate G. Ourrepresentations allow for both lossless and lossy graph compression with bounds on theintroduced error. Further; in combination with the MDL principle; they yield highly intuitivecoarse-level summaries of the input graph G. We develop algorithms to construct highlycompressed graph representations with small sizes and guaranteed accuracy; and validateour approach through an extensive set of experiments with multiple real-life graph data …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,262

Holistic aggregates in a networked world: Distributed tracking of approximate quantiles,Graham Cormode; Minos Garofalakis; S Muthukrishnan; Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract While traditional database systems optimize for performance on one-shot queries;emerging large-scale monitoring applications require continuous tracking of complexaggregates and data-distribution summaries over collections of physically-distributedstreams. Thus; effective solutions have to be simultaneously space efficient (at each remotesite); communication efficient (across the underlying communication network); and providecontinuous; guaranteed-quality estimates. In this paper; we propose novel algorithmicsolutions for the problem of continuously tracking complex holistic aggregates in such adistributed-streams setting---our primary focus is on approximate quantile summaries; butour approach is more broadly applicable and can handle other holistic-aggregate functions(eg;" heavy-hitters" queries). We present the first known distributed-tracking schemes for …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,216
Mining optimized association rules with categorical and numeric attributes,Rajeev Rastogi; Kyuseok Shim,Mining association rules on large data sets has received considerable attention in recentyears. Association rules are useful for determining correlations between attributes of arelation and have applications in marketing; financial; and retail sectors. Furthermore;optimized association rules are an effective way to focus on the most interestingcharacteristics involving certain attributes. Optimized association rules are permitted tocontain uninstantiated attributes and the problem is to determine instantiations such thateither the support or confidence of the rule is maximized. In this paper; we generalize theoptimized association rules problem in three ways:(1) association rules are allowed tocontain disjunctions over uninstantiated attributes;(2) association rules are permitted tocontain an arbitrary number of uninstantiated attributes; and (3) uninstantiated attributes …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2002,208
Robust monitoring of link delays and faults in IP networks,Yigal Bejerano; Rajeev Rastogi,In this paper; we develop failure-resilient techniques for monitoring link delays and faults ina Service Provider or Enterprise IP network. Our two-phased approach attempts to minimizeboth the monitoring infrastructure costs as well as the additional traffic due to probemessages. In the first phase; we compute the locations of a minimal set of monitoringstations such that all network links are covered; even in the presence of several link failures.Subsequently; in the second phase; we compute a minimal set of probe messages that aretransmitted by the stations to measure link delays and isolate network faults. We show thatboth the station selection problem as well as the probe assignment problem are NP-hard.We then propose greedy approximation algorithms that achieve a logarithmic approximationfactor for the station selection problem and a constant factor for the probe assignment …,IEEE/ACM Transactions On Networking,2006,207

A transaction model for multidatabase systems,Sharad Mehrotra; Rajeev Rastogi; Abraham Silberschatz; Henry F Korth,A transaction model for multidatabase system (MDBS) applications in which globalsubtransactions may be either compensatable or retriable is presented. In this modelcompensation and retrying are used for recovery purposes. However; since such executionsmay no longer consist of atomic transactions; a correctness criterion that ensures thattransactions see consistent database states is necessary. A commit protocol and aconcurrency control scheme that ensures that all generated schedules are correct are alsopresented. The commit protocol eliminates the problem of blocking; which is characteristicsof the standard 2PC protocol. The concurrency control protocol can be used in any MDBSenvironment irrespective of the concurrency control protocol followed by the local DBMSs inorder to ensure serializability.,Distributed Computing Systems; 1992.; Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on,1992,207
Update propagation protocols for replicated databates,Yuri Breitbart; Raghavan Komondoor; Rajeev Rastogi; S Seshadri; Avi Silberschatz,Abstract Replication is often used in many distributed systems to provide a higher level ofperformance; reliability and availability. Lazy replica update protocols; which propagateupdates to replicas through independent transactions after the original transaction commits;have become popular with database vendors due to their superior performancecharacteristics. However; if lazy protocols are used indiscriminately; they can result in non-serializable executions. In this paper; we propose two new lazy update protocols thatguarantee serializability but impose a much weaker requirement on data placement thanearlier protocols. Further; many naturally occurring distributed systems; like distributed datawarehouses; satisfy this requirement. We also extend our lazy update protocols to eliminateall requirements on data placement. The extension is a hybrid protocol that propagates as …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1999,206
Walrus: A similarity retrieval algorithm for image databases,Apostol Natsev; Rajeev Rastogi; Kyuseok Shim,Approaches for content-based image querying typically extract a single signature from eachimage based on color; texture; or shape features. The images returned as the query resultare then the ones whose signatures are closest to the signature of the query image. Whileefficient for simple images; such methods do not work well for complex scenes since they failto retrieve images that match the query only partially; that is; only certain regions of theimage match. This inefficiency leads to the discarding of images that may be semanticallyvery similar to the query image since they may contain the same objects. The problembecomes even more apparent when we consider scaled or translated versions of the similarobjects. We propose WALRUS (wavelet-based retrieval of user-specified scenes); a novelsimilarity retrieval algorithm that is robust to scaling and translation of objects within an …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2004,172
Disk striping in video server environments,Banu Ozden; Rajeev Rastogi; Abraham Silberschatz,A growing number of applications need access to video data stored in digital form onsecondary storage devices (eg; video-on-demand; multimedia messaging). As a result;video servers that are responsible for the storage and retrieval; at fixed rates; of hundreds ofvideos from disks are becoming increasingly important. Since video data tends to bevoluminous; several disks are usually used in order to store the videos. A challenge is todevise schemes for the storage and retrieval of videos that distribute the workload evenlyacross disks; reduce the cost of the server and at the same time; provide good responsetimes to client requests for video data. We present schemes that are based on stripingvideos (fine-grained as well as coarse-grained) across disks in order to effectively utilizedisk bandwidth. The proposed schemes are starvation-free and provide good response …,Multimedia Computing and Systems; 1996.; Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Conference on,1996,166
Mining sequential patterns with regular expression constraints,Minos Garofalakis; Rajeev Rastogi; Kyuseok Shim,Discovering sequential patterns is an important problem in data mining with a host ofapplication domains including medicine; telecommunications; and the World Wide Web.Conventional sequential pattern mining systems provide users with only a very restrictedmechanism (based on minimum support) for specifying patterns of interest. As aconsequence; the pattern mining process is typically characterized by lack of focus andusers often end up paying inordinate computational costs just to be inundated with anoverwhelming number of useless results.

Independence is good: Dependency-based histogram synopses for high-dimensional data,Amol Deshpande; Minos Garofalakis; Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract Approximating the joint data distribution of a multi-dimensional data set through acompact and accurate histogram synopsis is a fundamental problem arising in numerouspractical scenarios; including query optimization and approximate query answering. Existingsolutions either rely on simplistic independence assumptions or try to directly approximatethe full joint data distribution over the complete set of attributes. Unfortunately; bothapproaches are doomed to fail for high-dimensional data sets with complex correlationpatterns between attributes.

Dali: A high performance main memory storage manager,Hosagrahar V Jagadish; Daniel Lieuwen; Rajeev Rastogi; Abraham Silberschatz; S Sudarshan,Abstract Performance needs of many database applications dictate that the entire databasebe stored in main memory. The Dali system is a main memory storage manager designed toprovide the persistence; availability and safety guarantees one typically expects from adiskresident database; while at the same time providing very high performance by virtue ofbeing tuned to support in-memory data. Dali follows the philosophy of treating all data;including system data; uniformly as database files that can be memory mapped and directlyaccessed/updated by user processes. Direct access provides high performance; slower; butmore secure; access is also provided through the use of a server process.

Data mining and the Web: past; present and future,Minos N Garofalakis; Rajeev Rastogi; S Seshadri; Kyuseok Shim,The World Wide Web is rapidly emerging as an important medium for transacting commerceas well as for the dissemination of information related to a wide range of topics (eg;business; government; recreation). According to most predictions; the majority of humaninformation will be available on the Web in ten years. These huge amounts of data raise agrand challenge; namely; how to turn the Web into a more useful information utility.Crawlers; search engines and Web directories like Yahoo! constitute the state-of-the-arttools for information retrieval on the Web today.

Efficiently monitoring bandwidth and latency in IP networks,Yuri Breitbart; Chee-Yong Chan; Minos Garofalakis; Rajeev Rastogi; Abraham Silberschatz,Effective monitoring of network utilization and performance indicators is a key enablingtechnology for proactive and reactive resource management; flexible accounting; andintelligent planning in next-generation IP networks. In this paper; we address thechallenging problem of efficiently monitoring bandwidth utilization and path latencies in anIP data network.

Buffer replacement algorithms for multimedia storage systems,Banu Ozden; Rajeev Rastogi; Abraham Silberschatz,In a disk-based storage system; a buffer cache is used to reduce the number of disk I/Os.The buffer manager is responsible for buffer replacement to free memory in order toaccommodate new data blocks from the disk. An optimal buffer replacement algorithm is onewhich yields the lowest number of cache misses and; as a result; the lowest number of diskI/Os. In general; optimal buffer replacement algorithms require future knowledge; andtherefore cannot be realized. Thus; most storage systems use approximation algorithmssuch as the least-recently-used (LRU) and most-recently-used (MRU) buffer replacementalgorithms. In this paper; we show that both of these algorithms yield poor performancewhen they are used in storage systems that provide support for continuous media data.

Algorithms for computing QoS paths with restoration,Yigal Bejerano; Yuri Breitbart; Ariel Orda; Rajeev Rastogi; Alexander Sprintson,There is a growing interest among service providers to offer new services with Quality ofService (QoS) guarantees that are also resilient to failures. Supporting QoS connectionsrequires the existence of a routing mechanism; that computes the QoS paths; ie; paths thatsatisfy QoS constraints (eg; delay or bandwidth). Resilience to failures; on the other hand; isachieved by providing; for each primary QoS path; a set of alternative QoS paths used upona failure of either a link or a node. The above objectives; coupled with the need to minimizethe global use of network resources; imply that the cost of both the primary path and therestoration topology should be a major consideration of the routing process. We undertake acomprehensive study of problems related to finding suitable restoration topologies for QoSpaths.

Given a database of records;each with a class label; a classifier generates a concise and meaningful description for eachclass that can be used to classify subsequent records. A number of popular classifiersconstruct decision trees to generate class models. These classifiers first build a decision treeand then prune subtrees from the decision tree in a subsequent pruning phase to improveaccuracy and prevent “overfitting”. Generating the decision tree in two distinct phases couldresult in a substantial amount of wasted effort since an entire subtree constructed in the firstphase may later be pruned in the next phase. In this paper; we propose PUBLIC; animproved decision tree classifier that integrates the second “pruning” phase with the initial“building” phase. In PUBLIC; a node is not expanded during the building phase; if it is …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2000,109
Processing set expressions over continuous update streams,Sumit Ganguly; Minos Garofalakis; Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract There is growing interest in algorithms for processing and querying continuous datastreams (ie; data that is seen only once in a fixed order) with limited memory resources. In itsmost general form; a data stream is actually an update stream; ie; comprising data-itemdeletions as well as insertions. Such massive update streams arise naturally in severalapplication domains (eg; monitoring of large IP network installations; or processing of retail-chain transactions). Estimating the cardinality of set expressions defined over several(perhaps; distributed) update streams is perhaps one of the most fundamental query classesof interest; as an example; such a query may ask" what is the number of distinct IP sourceaddresses seen in passing packets from both router R 1 and R 2 but not router R 3?".

Main-memory index structures with fixed-size partial keys,Philip Bohannon; Peter Mcllroy; Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract The performance of main-memory index structures is increasingly determined bythe number of CPU cache misses incurred when traversing the index. When keys are storedindirectly; as is standard in main-memory databases; the cost of key retrieval in terms ofcache misses can dominate the cost of an index traversal. Yet it is inefficient in both time andspace to store even moderate sized keys directly in index nodes. In this paper; weinvestigate the performance of tree structures suitable for OLTP workloads in the face ofexpensive cache misses and non-trivial key sizes. We propose two index structures; pkT-trees and pkB-trees; which significantly reduce cache misses by storing partial-keyinformation in the index. We show that a small; fixed amount of key information allows mostcache misses to be avoided; allowing for a simple node structure and efficient …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2001,104
Optimal configuration for BGP route selection,Thomas C Bressoud; Rajeev Rastogi; Mark A Smith,An Internet Service Provider must provide transit service for traffic between its customers andits providers and; at the same time; attempt to minimize network utilization and balance trafficaccording to the capacities of its border routers. Central to the selection of border routers fortransit traffic flows is the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) between Autonomous System (AS)peers; through which route advertisements for network prefixes determine the selection ofborder routers for each traffic flow. This paper examines the problem of determining anoptimal set of border routers for the advertisement of network prefixes so as to minimize thecost of traffic across a transit service provider's network while maintaining egress bandwidthconstraints at the border routers. Egress bandwidth constraints are considered becausethere is anecdotal evidence to suggest that the peering links between ASs are often …,INFOCOM 2003.

The concurrency control problem in multidatabases: Characteristics and solutions,Sharad Mehrotra; Rajeev Rastogi; Yuri Breitbart; Henry F Korth; Avi Silberschatz,Abstract A Multidatabase System (MDBS) is a collection of local database managementsystems; each of which may follow a different concurrency control protocol. Thisheterogeneity makes the task of ensuring global serializability in an MDBS environmentdifficult. In this paper; we reduce the problem of ensuring global serializability to the problemof ensuring serializability in a centralized database system. We identify characteristics of theconcurrency control problem in an MDBS environment; and additional requirements onconcurrency control schemes for ensuring global serializability. We then develop a range ofconcurrency control schemes that ensure global serializability in an MDBS environment; andat the same time meet the requirements. Finally; we study the tradeoffs between thecomplexities of the various schemes and the degree of concurrency provided by each of …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1992,99
The architecture of the Dali main-memory storage manager,Philip Bohannon; Daniel Lieuwen; Rajeev Rastogi; Avi Silberschatz; S Seshadri; S Sudarshan,Abstract Performance needs of many database applications dictate that the entire databasebe stored in main memory. The Dalí system is a main memory storage manager designed toprovide the persistence; availability and safety guarantees one typically expects from a disk-resident database; while at the same time providing very high performance by virtue of beingtuned to support in-memory data.

Tree pattern aggregation for scalable XML data dissemination,Chee-Yong Chan; Wenfei Fan; Pascal Felber; Minos Garofalakis; Rajeev Rastogi,Summary With the rapid growth of XML-document traffic on the Internet; scalable content-based dissemination of XML documents to a large; dynamic group of consumers hasbecome an important research challenge. To indicate the type of content that they areinterested in; data consumers typically specify their subscriptions using some XML patternspecification language (eg; XPath). Given the large volume of subscribers; system scalabilityand efficiency mandate the ability to aggregate the set of consumer subscriptions to asmaller set of content specifications; so as to both reduce their storage-space requirementsas well as speed up the document-subscription matching process. In this paper; we providethe first systematic study of subscription aggregation where subscriptions are specified withtree patterns (an important subclass of XPath expressions).

On the design of a low-cost video-on-demand storage system,Banu Özden; Rajeev Rastogi; Avi Silberschatz,Abstract Recent advances in storage technology; coupled with the dramatic increase in thebandwidth of networks; now make it possible to provide “video-on-demand” service toviewers. A video-on-demand server is a computer system that stores videos in compresseddigital form and provides support for various portions of compressed video data to beaccessed and transmitted concurrently. We present a low-cost storage architecture for avideo-on-demand server that relies principally on disks. The high bandwidths of disks inconjunction with a clever strategy for striping videos on them enables simultaneous accessand transmission of portions of a video; separated by fixed time intervals. We also presentschemes for implementing VCR-like functions including fast forward; rewind; and pause; andextend our schemes to the case in which videos have different rate requirements.,Multimedia Systems,1996,92
Spartan: A model-based semantic compression system for massive data tables,Shivnath Babu; Minos Garofalakis; Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract While a variety of lossy compression schemes have been developed for certainforms of digital data (eg; images; audio; video); the area of lossy compression techniques forarbitrary data tables has been left relatively unexplored. Nevertheless; such techniques areclearly motivated by the ever-increasing data collection rates of modern enterprises and theneed for effective; guaranteed-quality approximate answers to queries over massiverelational data sets. In this paper; we propose SPARTAN; a system that takes advantage ofattribute semantics and data-mining models to perform lossy compression of massive datatables. SPARTAN is based on the novel idea of exploiting predictive data correlations andprescribed error tolerances for individual attributes to construct concise and accurateClassification and Regression Tree (CaRT) models for entire columns of a table.

Re-tree: an efficient index structure for regular expressions,Chee-Yong Chan; Minos Garofalakis; Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract. Due to their expressive power; regular expressions (REs) are quickly becoming anintegral part of language specifications for several important application scenarios. Many ofthese applications have to manage huge databases of RE specifications and need toprovide an effective matching mechanism that; given an input string; quickly identifies theREs in the database that match it. In this paper; we propose the RE-tree; a novel indexstructure for large databases of RE specifications. Given an input query string; the RE-treespeeds up the retrieval of matching REs by focusing the search and comparing the inputstring with only a small fraction of REs in the database. Even though the RE-tree is similar inspirit to other tree-based structures that have been proposed for indexing multidimensionaldata; RE indexing is significantly more challenging since REs typically represent infinite …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2003,87

Non-serializable executions in heterogeneous distributed database systems,Sharad Mehrotra; Rajeev Rastogi; Henry F Korth; Abraham Silberschatz,The concept of serializability has been the traditionally accepted notion of correctness indatabase systems. However; in a heterogeneous distributed database system (HDBMS)environment; ensuring serializability is a difficult task mainly due to the desire of preservingthe local autonomy of the participating local database systems. The authors introduce a newcorrectness criterion fur HDBMSs; two-level serializability (2LSR); and show that it preservesdatabase consistency in several HDBMS models. Further; they present a simple protocol forensuring that schedules in an HDBMS environment are 2LSR. This protocol is easilyimplementable and does not violate the local autonomy of sites.,Parallel and Distributed Information Systems; 1991.; Proceedings of the First International Conference on,1991,85

Restoration algorithms for virtual private networks in the hose model,Giuseppe F Italiano; Rajeev Rastogi; Bülent Yener,A virtual private network (VPN) aims to emulate the services provided by a private networkover the shared Internet. The endpoints of a VPN are connected using abstractions such asvirtual channels (VCs) of ATM or label switched paths (LSPs) of MPLS technologies.Reliability of an end-to-end VPN connection depends on the reliability of the links and nodesin the fixed path that it traverses in the network. In order to ensure service quality andavailability in a VPN; seamless recovery from failures is essential. This work considers theproblem of fast recovery in the recently proposed VPN hose model. In the hose model;bandwidth is reserved for traffic aggregates instead of pairwise specifications to allow anytraffic pattern among the VPN endpoints.

Mining optimized gain rules for numeric attributes,Sergey Brin; Rajeev Rastogi; Kyuseok Shim,Association rules are useful for determining correlations between attributes of a relation andhave applications in the marketing; financial; and retail sectors. Furthermore; optimizedassociation rules are an effective way to focus on the most interesting characteristicsinvolving certain attributes. Optimized association rules are permitted to containuninstantiated attributes and the problem is to determine instantiations such that either thesupport; confidence; or gain of the rule is maximized. In this paper; we generalize theoptimized gain association rule problem by permitting rules to contain disjunctions overuninstantiated numeric attributes. Our generalized association rules enable us to extractmore useful information about seasonal and local patterns involving the uninstantiatedattribute.

XTRACT: Learning document type descriptors from XML document collections,Minos Garofalakis; Aristides Gionis; Rajeev Rastogi; Sridhar Seshadri; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract XML is rapidly emerging as the new standard for data representation and exchangeon the Web. Unlike HTML; tags in XML documents describe the semantics of the data andnot how it is to be displayed. In addition; an XML document can be accompanied by aDocument Type Descriptor (DTD) which plays the role of a schema for an XML datacollection. DTDs contain valuable information on the structure of documents and thus have acrucial role in the efficient storage of XML data; as well as the effective formulation andoptimization of XML queries. Despite their importance; however; DTDs are not mandatory;and it is frequently possible that documents in XML databases will not have accompanyingDTDs. In this paper; we propose XTRACT; a novel system for inferring a DTD schema for adatabase of XML documents.

There are keydifferences between ATGs and traditional attribute grammars. A traditional AG is definedwith a context free grammar and more complicated attributes (synthesized and inherited). Ittakes a string as an input; parses the string with the grammar; and computes attributes. Incontrast; it is not possible to “parse” a relational database with a DTD; thus; an ATG extractsrelevant data from the database via queries; and then constructs a parse tree of the DTDusing the data. There have also been applications of AGs to databases; for example; forconstructing query automata and for querying text files. These are mild variations oftraditional AGs and are quite different from ATGs.DTD-Directed Publishing with Attribute …,*,2002,77

Recommendations to boost content spread in social networks,Vineet Chaoji; Sayan Ranu; Rajeev Rastogi; Rushi Bhatt,Abstract Content sharing in social networks is a powerful mechanism for discovering contenton the Internet. The degree to which content is disseminated within the network depends onthe connectivity relationships among network nodes. Existing schemes for recommendingconnections in social networks are based on the number of common neighbors; similarity ofuser profiles; etc. However; such similarity-based connections do not consider the amount ofcontent discovered. In this paper; we propose novel algorithms for recommendingconnections that boost content propagation in a social network without compromising on therelevance of the recommendations. Unlike existing work on influence propagation; in ourenvironment; we are looking for edges instead of nodes; with a bound on the number ofincident edges per node.

In order to scale for large networks containing hundredsand thousands of subnets; OSPF supports a two-level hierarchical routing scheme throughthe use of OSPF areas. Subnet addresses within an area are aggregated; and thisaggregation is a crucial requirement for scaling OSPF to large AS domains; as it results insignificant reductions in routing table sizes; smaller link-state databases; and less networktraffic to synchronize the router link-state databases. On the other hand; addressaggregation also implies loss of information about the length of the shortest path to eachsubnet; which in turn; can lead to suboptimal routing.

Our approach eliminates the need to continuously track theglobal system state by decomposing global constraints into local constraints that can bechecked efficiently at each site.

On-line reorganization in object-oriented databases,*,An on-line reorganization method of an object-oriented database with physical referencesinvolves a novel fuzzy traversal of the database; or a partition thereof; to identify theapproximate parents of all migrating objects. Where the entire database is traversed theprocess begins from its persistent root. For traversals of a partition the process begins fromeach object with a reference pointing to it from outside the partition. To facilitate theidentification of these inter-partitional objects an External Reference Table (“ERT”) ismaintained. During the fuzzy traversal all new inserted and deleted references are tracked ina Temporary Reference Table (“TRT”). After the fuzzy traversal is completed; for eachmigrating object; a lock is obtained on the identified approximate parents and on all newparents in which references to the object were inserted; as indicated by the TRT.

Traveling with a pez dispenser (or; routing issues in mpls),Anupam Gupta; Amit Kumar; Rajeev Rastogi,A new packet routing model proposed by the Internet Engineering Task Force isMultiProtocol Label Switching; or MPLS [B. Davie and Y. Rekhter; MPLS: Technology andApplications; Morgan Kaufmann (Elsevier); New York; 2000]. Instead of each router'sparsing the packet network layer header and doing its lookups based on that analysis (as inmuch of conventional packet routing); MPLS ensures that the analysis of the header isperformed just once. The packet is then assigned a stack of labels; where the labels areusually much smaller than the packet headers themselves. When a router receives a packet;it examines the label at the top of the label stack and makes the decision of where the packetis forwarded based solely on that label. It can pop the top label off the stack if it so desires;and can also push some new labels onto the stack; before forwarding the packet. This …,SIAM Journal on Computing,2005,53

A new channel assignment mechanism for rural wireless mesh networks,Partha Dutta; Sharad Jaiswal; Debmalya Panigrahi; Rajeev Rastogi,In this paper we present a new channel allocation scheme for IEEE 802.11 based meshnetworks with point-to-point links; designed for rural areas. Our channel allocation schemeallows continuous full-duplex data transfer on every link in the network. Moreover; we do notrequire any synchronization across the links as the channel assignment prevents cross linkinterference. Our approach is simple. We consider any link in the network as made up of twodirected edges. To each directed edge at a node; we assign a non-interfering IEEE 802.11channel so that the set of channels assigned to the outgoing edges is disjoint from channelsassigned to the incoming edges. Evaluation of this scheme in a testbed demonstratethroughput gains of between 50-100%; and significantly less end-to-end delays; overexisting link scheduling/channel allocation protocols (such as 2P [11]) designed for point …,INFOCOM 2008.

Exploiting content redundancy for web information extraction,Pankaj Gulhane; Rajeev Rastogi; Srinivasan H Sengamedu; Ashwin Tengli,Abstract We propose a novel extraction approach that exploits content redundancy on theweb to extract structured data from template-based web sites. We start by populating a seeddatabase with records extracted from a few initial sites. We then identify values within thepages of each new site that match attribute values contained in the seed set of records. Tomatch attribute values with diverse representations across sites; we define a new similaritymetric that leverages the templatized structure of attribute content. Specifically; our metricdiscovers the matching pattern between attribute values from two sites; and uses this toignore extraneous portions of attribute values when computing similarity scores. Further; tofilter out noisy attribute value matches; we exploit the fact that attribute values occur at fixedpositions within template-based sites.

Routing and channel allocation in rural wireless mesh networks,Partha Dutta; Sharad Jaiswal; Rajeev Rastogi,IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi equipment based wireless mesh networks have recently been proposedas an inexpensive approach to connect far-flung rural areas. Such networks are built usinghigh-gain directional antenna that can establish long-distance point-point links. In recentwork; a new MAC protocol named 2P has been proposed that is suited for the interferencepattern within such a network. However; the 2P protocol requires the underlying graph (foreach 802.11 channel) to be bi-partite. Under the assumption that 2P is the MAC protocolused in the mesh network; we make the following contributions in this paper. Given K non-interfering 802.11 channels; we propose a simple cut-based algorithm to compute K bi-partite sub-graphs (on each of which the 2P protocol can be run separately).

In this paper; we present the end-to-end design ofa high performance RE matching system. Our system combines the processing efficiency ofDeterministic Finite Automata (DFA) with the space efficiency of Non-deterministic FiniteAutomata (NFA) to scale to hundreds of REs. In experiments with real-life RE data on datastreams; we found that a bulk of the DFA transitions are concentrated around a few DFAstates. We exploit this fact to cache only the frequent core of each DFA in memory asopposed to the entire DFA (which may be exponential in size). Further; we cluster REs suchthat REs whose interactions cause an exponential increase in the number of states areassigned to separate groups--this helps to improve cache hits by controlling the overall …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,41
Tracking set-expression cardinalities over continuous update streams,Sumit Ganguly; Minos Garofalakis; Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract. There is growing interest in algorithms for processing and querying continuousdata streams (ie; data seen only once in a fixed order) with limited memory resources. In itsmost general form; a data stream is actually an update stream; ie; comprising data-itemdeletions as well as insertions. Such massive update streams arise naturally in severalapplication domains (eg; monitoring of large IP network installations or processing of retail-chain transactions). Estimating the cardinality of set expressions defined over several(possibly distributed) update streams is perhaps one of the most fundamental query classesof interest; as an example; such a query may ask “what is the number of distinct IP sourceaddresses seen in passing packets from both router R 1 and R 2 but not router R 3?”.

Exploring the trade-off between label size and stack depth in MPLS routing,Anupam Gupta; Amit Kumar; Rajeev Rastogi,Multiprotocol label switching or MPLS technology is being increasingly deployed by severalof the largest Internet service providers to solve problems such as traffic engineering and tooffer IP services like virtual private networks (VPNs). In MPLS; the analysis of the packet(network layer) header is performed just once; and each packet is assigned a stack of labels;which is examined by subsequent routers when making forwarding decisions. Despite thefact that MPLS is becoming widespread on the Internet; we know essentially very little aboutthe performance one can achieve with it; and about the intrinsic trade-offs in its use ofresources. In this paper; we undertake a comprehensive study of the label size versus stackdepth trade-off for MPLS routing protocols on lines and trees.

The storage and retrieval of continuous media data,Banu Özden; Rajeev Rastogi; Avi Silberschatz,Summary Continuous media applications; which require a guaranteed transfer rate of thedata; are becoming an integral part of daily computational life. However; conventional filesystems do not provide rate guarantees; and are therefore unsuitable for the storage andretrieval of continuous media data. To meet the demands of these new applications;continuous media file systems; which provide rate guarantees by managing critical storageresources such as memory and disks must be designed.

Disk striping in video server environments,Banu Ozden; Rajeev Rastogi; Abraham Silberschatz,A growing number of applications need access to video data stored in digital form onsecondary storage devices (eg; video-on-demand; multimedia messaging). As a result;video servers that are responsible for the storage and retrieval; at fixed rates; of hundreds ofvideos from disks are becoming increasingly important. Since video data tends to bevoluminous; several disks are usually used in order to store the videos. A challenge is todevise schemes for the storage and retrieval of videos that distribute the workload evenlyacross disks; reduce the cost of the server and at the same time; provide good responsetimes to client requests for video data. We present schemes that are based on stripingvideos (fine-grained as well as coarse-grained) across disks in order to effectively utilize thedisk bandwidth.

Instead;it monitors QoS values for only a few paths; and exploits the fact that path anomalies are rareand anomalous states are well separated from normal operation; to rule out path QoSviolations in most situations. We propose a heuristic to select a small subset of networkpaths to monitor while ensuring that no QoS violations are missed.

However in multidatabase systems (MDBSs); ensuring globalserializability is a difficult task. The difficulty arises due to the heterogeneity of theconcurrency control protocols used by the participating local database managementsystems (DBMSs); and the desire to preserve the autonomy of the local DBMSs. In general;solutions to the global serializability problem result in executions with a low degree ofconcurrency. The alternative; relaxed serializability; may result in data inconsistency.

Cache management system for continuous media system,*,A cache management scheme is disclosed for buffering one or more continuous media filesbeing simultaneously accessed from a continuous media server by a plurality of mediaclients. The continuous media server stores pages of data that will likely be accessed in acache or buffer. The continuous media server implements a cache management strategythat exploits the sequential page access patterns for continuous media data; in order todetermine the buffer pages to be replaced from the cache. The cache management strategyinitially identifies unpinned pages as potential victims for replacement. Each unpinned pageis evaluated by the continuous media server and assigned a weight. Generally; the assignedweight ensures that a buffer with a larger weight will be accessed by a client later in timethan a buffer with a smaller weight. A page associated with a larger weight will be …,*,2000,26
Distributed multi-level recovery in main-memory databases,Philip Bohannon; James Parker; Rajeev Rastogi; S Seshadri; Abraham Silberschatz; S Sudarshan,The authors present two schemes for concurrency control and recovery in distributed main-memory databases. In the client-server scheme; clients ship log records to the server; whichapplies the updates to its database copy. In the shared disk scheme; each site broadcasts itsupdates to other sites. The above enable the schemes to support concurrent updates to thesame page at different sites. Both schemes support an explicit multi-level recoveryabstraction for high concurrency; reduced disk I/O by writing only redo log records to diskduring normal processing; and use of per-transaction redo and undo logs to reducecontention. Further; they use a fuzzy checkpointing scheme that writes only dirty pages todisk; yet minimally interferes with normal processing; not requiring updaters to even acquirea latch before updating a page.,Parallel and Distributed Information Systems; 1996.; Fourth International Conference on,1996,26

Data Mining Meets Network Management: The NEMESIS Project.,Minos N Garofalakis; Rajeev Rastogi,ABSTRACT Modern communication networks generate large amounts of operational data;including traffic and utilization statistics and alarm/fault data at various levels of detail. Thesemassive collections of network-management data can grow in the order of several Terabytesper year; and typically hide “knowledge” that is crucial to some of the key tasks involved ineffectively managing a communication network (eg; capacity planning and trafficengineering). In this short paper; we provide an overview of some of our recent and ongoingwork in the context of the NEMESIS project at Bell Laboratories that aims to develop noveldata warehousing and mining technology for the effective storage; exploration; and analysisof massive network-management data sets.

Scalable data mining with model constraints,Minos Garofalakis; Rajeev Rastogi,ABSTRACT Data mining can be abstractly defined as the process of extracting concise andinteresting models (or; patterns) from large amounts of data. Unfortunately; conventionalmining systems provide users with only very restricted mechanisms for specifying models ofinterest. As a consequence; the mining process is typically characterized by lack of focusand users often end up paying computational costs that are inordinately high compared tothe specific models] patterns of interest. Exploiting user-defined model constraints during themining process can help alleviate this problem and ensure system performance that iscommensurate with the level of user focus. Attaining such performance goals; however; isnot straightforward and; typically; requires the design of novel data mining algorithms thatmake effective use of the model constraints. In this paper; we provide an overview of our …,ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter,2000,24
Multimedia support for databases,Banu Özden; Rajeev Rastogi; Avi Silberschatz,Abstract Next generation database systems will need to provide support for both textual dataand other types of multimedia data (eg; images; video; audio). These two types of data differin their characteristics; and hence require different techniques for their organization andmanagement. For ex-ample; continuous media data (eg; video; audio) requires aguaranteed transfer rate. In thii paper; we provide an overview of 1) how database systemscan be architectured to support multimedia data; and 2) what are the main challenges indevising new algorithms to manage multimedia data. In order to provide rate guarantees forcontinuous media data; an admission controZscheme must be employed that determines; foreach client; whether there are sufficient resources available to service that client. Tomaximize the number of clients that can be admitted concurrently; the various system …,Proceedings of the sixteenth ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1997,24
Join-distinct aggregate estimation over update streams,Sumit Ganguly; Minos Garofalakis; Amit Kumar; Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract There is growing interest in algorithms for processing and querying continuous datastreams (ie; data that is seen only once in a fixed order) with limited memory resources.Providing (perhaps approximate) answers to queries over such streams is a crucialrequirement for many application environments; examples include large IP networkinstallations where performance data from different parts of the network needs to becontinuously collected and analyzed. The ability to estimate the number of distinct (sub)tuples in the result of a join operation correlating two data streams (ie; the cardinality of aprojection with duplicate elimination over a join) is an important requirement for several data-analysis scenarios. For instance; to enable real-time traffic analysis and load balancing; anetwork-monitoring application may need to estimate the number of distinct (< i> source< …,Proceedings of the twenty-fourth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2005,23
Strict histories in object-based database systems,Rajeev Rastogi; Henry F Korth; Abraham Silberschatz,Atomicity and durability are integral properties of transactions. Atomicity states that all theoperations associated with a transaction must be executed to completion; or none at all.Durability states that the effects of a committed transaction are never undone (that is; effectsof a committed transaction are persistent). If a history resulting from the concurrent executionof transactions is to preserve the atomicity and durability properties; then it must be at leastrecoverable [BHG87](a history is a sequence of read; write; commit; and abort operationsbelonging to all the transactions executed in the system). A history h is recoverable if for anytwo transactions Ti and Tj in h; if Tj reads the value of a data item written by Ti; then Ticommits or aborts before Tj commits. In a recoverable history; it is possible to undo theeffects of aborted transactions without undoing the effects of committed transactions …,Proceedings of the twelfth ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1993,23

Research issues in multimedia storage servers,Banu Özden; Rajeev Rastogi; Avi Silberschatz,Multimedia applications require support for the storage and retrieval of multimedia data;which typically consist of video; audio; text; and images. These data can be categorized intocontinuous media (CM) data (eg; video; audio) and noncontinuous media data (eg; text;images). CM data; in contrast to nonCM data; have certain timing characteristics associatedwith them. For example; video clips; which are typically stored in units of frames; must bedelivered to viewers at a certain rate (typically 30 frames/see). For video compressed usingthe MPEG-I standard; this translates to a data rate of approximately 1.5 Mbps. CM data arealso voluminous. For example; a 100-minute video compressed using the MPEG-Icompression algorithm requires about 1.25 GB of storage space.

Techniques for categorizing web pages,*,Web pages are efficiently categorized in a data processor without analyzing the content ofthe web pages. According to at least one embodiment; data is maintained that representssample URLs grouped into a plurality of clusters. The sample URLs of a cluster are used toproduce a URL regular expression pattern (“URL-regex”) that differentiates the sampleURLs of the cluster from the sample URLs of other clusters and that covers at least aspecified percentage of the sample URLs in the cluster. The process of producing a URL-regex is repeated for each of the clusters producing a URL-regex for each cluster. Webpages are then categorized into one of the clusters by determining which of the URL-regexpatterns produced for the clusters match URLs that refer to the web pages. Thus; a webpage may be categorized based on a URL that refers to the web page without having to …,*,2014,21
Lookahead buffer replacement method using ratio of clients access order offsets and buffer data block offsets,*,Two methods are disclosed for storing multimedia data that reduces the amount of disk I/Orequired by the system and cache misses experienced by the system. The first methoddetermines the future access of each data buffer in a cache memory. Once the future of thedata buffer is determined; the data buffer with the maximum future is allocated to store newblocks of data. The method approximates an optimal method of data buffer allocation; bycalculating the future of a data buffer; relative to clients that will access the data buffers. Thesecond method orders the clients based on the increasing distance of each client from theprevious client; clients release the buffers in this order into a LIFO queue; if a buffer isselected to load a new block of data; the buffer at the head of the LIFO queue is selected.,*,1999,21

Detection and recovery techniques for database corruption,Philip Bohannon; Rajeev Rastogi; S Seshadri; Abraham Silberschatz; S Sudarshan,Increasingly; for extensibility and performance; special purpose application code is beingintegrated with database system code. Such application code has direct access to databasesystem buffers; and as a result; the danger of data being corrupted due to inadvertentapplication writes is increased. Previously proposed hardware techniques to protect fromcorruption require system calls; and their performance depends on details of the hardwarearchitecture. We investigate an alternative approach which uses codewords associated withregions of data to detect corruption and to prevent corrupted data from being used bysubsequent transactions. We develop several such techniques which vary in the level ofprotection; space overhead; performance; and impact on concurrency.

Method for identifying outliers in large data sets,*,A new method for identifying a predetermined number of data points of interest in a largedata set. The data points of interest are ranked in relation to the distance to their neighboringpoints. The method employs partition-based detection algorithms to partition the data pointsand then compute upper and lower bounds for each partition. These bounds are then usedto eliminate those partitions that do contain the predetermined number of data points ofinterest. The data points of interest are then computed from the remaining partitions thatwere not eliminated. The present method eliminates a significant number of data points fromconsideration as the points of interest; thereby resulting in substantial savings incomputational expense compared to conventional methods employed to identify suchpoints.,*,2003,17
Scalable algorithms for mining large databases,Rajeev Rastogi; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract. A large number of corporations have invested heavily in information technology tomanage their businesses more effectively; and vast amounts of critical business data havebeen stored in database systems. The volume of this data is expected to grow considerablyin the near future. Yet many organizations have been unable to collect valuable insightsfrom the data to guide their marketing strategy; investment and management policies. One ofthe reasons for this is that most information is stored implicitly in the large amounts of data.Fortunately; new and sophisticated techniques being developed in the area of data miningcan help companies leverage their data more effectively and extract insightful informationfrom their data.

In thispaper; we address the problem of on-line reorganization in object databases; where a set ofobjects have to be migrated from one location to another. Specifically; we consider the casewhere objects in the database may contain physical references to other objects. Relocatingan object in this case involves finding the set of objects (parents) that refer to it; andmodifying the references in each parent.

Anomaly detection and diagnosis using passive monitoring,*,A system and method for determining optimal selection of paths for passively monitoring acommunications network. A diagnostic set of paths is determined by ensuring that; for allpairs of links in the network; the set contains one path having only one member of that pair.A detection subset of paths is determined by ensuring that; for all the links in the network;one member of the subset contains that link. Selecting a minimum detection and diagnosticset of paths minimizes the communication overhead imposed by monitoring. During normaloperation; only the detection subset need be monitored. Once an anomaly is detected; thesystem may switch to monitoring the full diagnostic set. The cost of deploying and operatingthe passive monitoring equipment is minimized by determining the minimum set of links onwhich a probe needs to be placed in order to monitor the diagnostic set of paths.,*,2011,12

Since video data tends to bevoluminous; several disks are usually used in order to store the videos. A challenge is todevise schemes for the storage and retrieval of videos that distribute the workload evenlyacross disks; reduce the cost of the server and at the same time; provide good responsetimes to client requests for video data. In this paper we present schemes that retrieve videosperiodically from disks in order to provide better response times to client requests. Wepresent two schemes that stripe videos across multiple disks in order to distribute the …,Data Engineering; 1997. Proceedings. 13th International Conference on,1997,12

Using semantic knowledge of distributed objects to increase reliability and availability,Pascal Felber; Ben Jai; Rajeev Rastogi; Mark Smith,As systems become more distributed; they also become more complex. To ensure consistentexecution while maximizing availability; distributed applications use various mechanismssuch as replication; load balancing; and data caching. The protocols used for consistencymanagement and component availability are traditionally instantiated by the application.However; in distributed object based environments like CORBA or Java RMI; theinfrastructure can often determine adequate protocols to guarantee liveness and safetybased on the request and semantic knowledge of the application. This paper discusses howsemantic knowledge of distributed objects can help implement intelligent behavior inmiddleware and choose optimal protocols for distributed component interactions.,Object-Oriented Real-Time Dependable Systems; 2001.

Using codewords to protect database data from a class of software errors,Philip Bohannon; Rajeev Rastogi; S Seshadri; Abraham Silberschatz; S Sudarshan,Increasingly; for extensibility and performance; special-purpose application code is beingintegrated with database system code. Such application code has direct access to databasesystem buffers and; as a result; the danger of data being corrupted due to inadvertentapplication writes is increased. Previously proposed hardware techniques to protect datafrom corruption required system calls; and their performance depended on the details of thehardware architecture. We investigate an alternative approach which uses codewordsassociated with regions of data to detect corruption and to prevent corrupted data from beingused by subsequent transactions. We develop several such techniques which vary in thelevel of protection; space overhead; performance and impact on concurrency. Thesetechniques are implemented in the Dali/spl acute/main-memory storage manager; and …,Data Engineering; 1999. Proceedings.; 15th International Conference on,1999,11
Exploiting transaction semantics in multidatabase systems,Rajeev Rastogi; Henry F Korth; Avi Silberschatz,Serializability is the traditionally accepted notion of correctness in most database systems.However; in a multidatabase system (MDBS) environment; where a number of pre-existingand autonomous database systems are integrated; requiring serializability could adverselyaffect the performance of the system. To enhance performance; one of the options is to relaxthe serializability requirement; and permit certain non-serializable executions. In this paper;we propose a powerful; yet simple mechanism; for specifying the set of non-serializableexecutions that are unacceptable in an MDBS environment. The undesirable interleavingsamong transactions are specified using regular expressions over transaction types. Themechanism facilitates the development of efficient graph-based schemes for ensuring thatthe concurrent execution of transactions meet the specifications.

Maintaining Database Consistency in Heterogeneous Distributed DatabaseSystems,Sharad Mehrotra; Rajeev Rastogi; Henry F Korth; Avi Silberschatz,Abstract The concept of serializability has been the traditionally accepted notion ofcorrectness in database systems. However; in a heterogeneous distributed database system(HDBMS) environment; ensuring serializability is a difficult task mainly due to the desire ofpreserving the various participating local database systems. In this paper; we introduce anew correctness criterion for HDBMSs; two level serializability (2LSR). We identifyrestrictions under which 2LSR schedules preserve database consistency. Further; wepresent a simple protocol for ensuring schedules are 2LSR. This protocol is easilyimplementable and does not violate the local autonomy of sites.,*,1991,11

Overcoming heterogeneity and autonomy in multidatabase systems,Sharad Mehrotra; Rajeev Rastogi; Yuri Breitbart; Henry F Korth; Abraham Silberschatz,Abstract A multidatabase system (MDBS) is a software system for integration of preexistingand independent local database management systems (DBMSs). The transactionmanagement problem in MDBSs consists of designing appropriate software; on top of localDBMSs; such that users can execute transactions that span multiple local DBMSs withoutjeopardizing database consistency. The difficulty in transaction management in MDBSsarises due to the heterogeneity of the transaction management algorithms used by the localDBMSs; and the desire to preserve their local autonomy. In this paper; we develop aframework for designing fault-tolerant transaction management algorithms for MDBSenvironments that effectively overcomes the heterogeneity-and autonomy-inducedproblems.

This matching problem is challengingbecause titles across the feeds have diverse representations with some missing importantkeywords like brand and others containing extraneous keywords related to productspecifications. In this paper; we propose a novel unsupervised matching algorithm thatleverages web earch engines to (1) enrich product titles by adding important missing tokensthat occur frequently in search results; and (2) compute importance scores for tokens basedon their ability to retrieve other (enriched title) tokens in search results.

Semi-supervised correction of biased comment ratings,Abhinav Mishra; Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract In many instances; offensive comments on the internet attract a disproportionatenumber of positive ratings from highly biased users. This results in an undesirable scenariowhere these offensive comments are the top rated ones. In this paper; we develop semi-supervised learning techniques to correct the bias in user ratings of comments. Our schemeuses a small number of comment labels in conjunction with user rating information toiteratively compute user bias and unbiased ratings for unlabeled comments. We show thatthe running time of each iteration is linear in the number of ratings; and the systemconverges to a unique fixed point. To select the comments to label; we devise an activelearning algorithm based on empirical risk minimization.

NFC enables aplethora of network management tasks like traffic demands estimation; application trafficprofiling; etc. In this paper; we investigate two computation sharing techniques for enablingstreaming applications such as NFC to scale to hundreds of queries. Our first techniqueinstantiates certain intermediate aggregates which are then used to generate the finalanswers for input queries. Our second technique coalesces the filter conditions of similarqueries and uses the coalesced filter to pre-filter stream data input to these queries.

Sketch-based multi-query processing over data streams,*,A method of efficiently providing estimated answers to workloads of aggregate; multi-joinSQL-like queries over a number of input data-streams. The method only examines each dataelements once and uses a limited amount of computer memory. The method uses joingraphs and atomic sketches that are essentially pseudo-random summaries formed usingrandom binary variables. The estimated answer is the product of all the atomic sketches forall the vertices in the query join graph. A query workload is processed efficiently byidentifying and sharing atomic sketches common to distinct queries; while ensuring that thejoin graphs remain well formed. The method may automatically minimize either the averagequery error or the maximum query error over the workload.,*,2008,8

Optimal configuration of OSPF aggregates,Yuri Breitbart; Minos Garofalakis; Amit Kumar; Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a popular protocol for routing within anAutonomous System (AS) domain. In order to scale for large networks containing hundredsand thousands of subnets; OSPF supports a twolevel hierarchical routing scheme throughthe use of OSPF areas. Each area consists of a set of interconnected subnets and trafficacross areas is handled by routers attached to two or more areas; known as Area BorderRouters (ABRs). OSPF ABRs are typically configured to aggregate the subnet addresses intheir areas and to advertise these aggregates in the remainder of the network instead ofindividual subnet addresses. Address aggregation within areas is a crucial requirement forscaling OSPF to large AS domains; as it results in significant reductions in routing tablesizes; smaller link-state databases; and less network traffic to synchronize the router link …,Proc. of IEEE INFOCOM02; New York; USA,2002,8

A Clustering algorithm for categorical attributes,Sudipto Guha; Rajeev Rastogi; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Clustering; in data mining; is useful to discover distribution patterns of theunderlying data. Clustering algorithms usually employ a distance based (eg; euclidean)similarity measure in order to partition the database such that data points in the samepartition are more similar than points in different partitions. In this paper; we study clusteringalgorithms for data with boolean and categorical attributes. We first show that the traditionalclustering algorithms using distance metric between points is not appropriate for booleanand categorical attributes. Instead; we propose a novel concept of links to measure thesimilarity/proximity between a pair of data points and develop a hierarchical clusteringalgorithm that employ links and not distance when merging clusters.

In particular; we address the problem of each peerchoosing the k best pointers to store (in addition to its index pointers) to minimize theaverage query lookup times.

Optimal scheduling for dynamic channel allocation in wireless LANs,S Jamaloddin Golestani; Rajeev Rastogi; Mark A Smith,Abstract Channel allocation schemes that have been used in cellular wireless ave limitedapplicability to Wireless LANs (WLANs) because of the small number of available channelsand irregular cell geometries in WLAN environments. In this paper; we propose a dynamic;frame-based channel allocation architecture for WLANs. In this architecture; time is dividedinto a sequence of consecutive frames (in the order of milliseconds); and in each frame; onlya non-interfering subset of access points (APs) is activated. Under broad traffic assumptions;we prove that the attainable system throughput can be optimized by scheduling APs andallocating channels in each frame such that a weighted sum of queue sizes at the activatedAPs is maximized. This optimality criterion for AP scheduling and channel allocation leads toa novel graph problem which is a variant of the well-known maximum independent set …,Wireless Networks,2010,3

We present novel algorithms for (a) discovering physical topology inheterogeneous (ie; multivendor) IP networks; and (b) discovering service topology in coredata or optical networks. Our algorithms for physical topology of IP networks rely on standardSNMP MIB information that is widely supported by modern IP network elements.

Efficient global transaction management in multidatabase systems,Sharad Mehrotra; Rajeev Rastogi; Yuri Breitbart; Henry P Korth; Avi Silberschatz,Abstract Concurrency control schemes for ensuring global serial-izability in a multidatabasesystem (MDBS) environment are complicated due to the autonomy of local databasemanagement systems (DBMSs). In this paper; we develop concurrency control schemes; forthe MDBS environment; that are simple; permit a high degree of concurrency and incurminimal overhead under two different assumptions on the nature of schedules produced bythe local DBMSs:(1) each local DBMS produces rigorous schedules;(2) each local DBMSproduces strongly recoverable schedules. Our interest in rigorous schedules stems from thefact that the majority of commercial DBMSs offer a concurrency control protocol thatgenerates rigorous schedules. However; the class of rigorous schedules is quite restrictivein terms of the amount of concurrency permitted. We; therefore; also consider the class of …,*,1993,3

Data Stream Management: A Brave New World,Minos Garofalakis; Johannes Gehrke; Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract Traditional data-management systems software is built on the concept of persistentdata sets that are stored reliably in stable storage and queried/updated several timesthroughout their lifetime. For several emerging application domains; however; data arrivesand needs to be processed on a continuous basis; without the benefit of several passes overa static; persistent data image. Such continuous data streams arise naturally; for instancetelecom and IP network monitoring. This volume focuses on the theory and practice of datastream management; and the difficult; novel challenges this emerging domain introduces fordata-management systems.

Allocation of channels to wireless LANs,*,Channels are allocated to one or more cells within a wireless LAN (WLAN) without causingunacceptable interference. The allocation involves dividing an allocation time period intoframes; each frame having a substantially short duration; and then allocating one or morechannels to one or more WLAN cells during each such frame according to an allocationvector. The vector assures that each cell allocated a channel is sufficiently distant from everyother cell allocated the same channel to minimize cross interference. Only those cellsallocated a channel are allowed to transmit during a given frame. The allocation vectors aredetermined in such a way that the performance of a WLAN is optimized.,*,2007,2
Efficient Design of End-to-End Probes for Source-Routed Networks,Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Rajeev Rastogi; Marina Thottan,Migration to a converged network has caused service providers to deploy real timeapplications such as voice over an IP (VoIP) network. From the provider's perspective; thesuccess of such emerging multimedia services over IP networks depend on mechanismswhich help understand the network-wide end-to-end performance dynamics. In this work; wepresent a mechanism to design efficient probes for measuring end-to-end performanceimpairments such as network delay and loss for a specific service in the provider network.We address two main issues related to deploying network probes:(1) the need for correlatingthe topology data with the measured values and (2) reducing the amount of probe traffic.

Architecture issues in multimedia storage systems,Banu Özden; Rajeev Rastogi; Avi Silberschatz,Abstract Next generation storage systems will need to provide support for both textual dataand other types of multimedia data (eg; images; video; audio). These two types of data differin their characteristics; and hence require different techniques for their organization andmanagement. In this paper; we provide an overview of 1) how storage systems can bearchitectured to support multimedia data; and 2) what are the main challenges in devisingnew algorithms to manage multimedia data. In order to provide rate guarantees forcontinuous media data; an admission control scheme must be employed that determines; foreach client; whether there are sufficient resources available to service that client. Tomaximize the number of clients that can be admitted concurrently; the various systemresources must be allocated and scheduled carefully.

Sketch-Based Multi-Query Processing over Data Streams,Alin Dobra; Minos Garofalakis; Johannes Gehrke; Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract We consider the problem of approximately answering multiple general aggregateSQL queries over continuous data streams with limited memory. Our method extends therandomizing techniques of Alon et al. that compute small “sketch” summaries of the streamsthat can then be used to provide approximate answers to aggregate queries with provableguarantees on the approximation error. By intelligently sharing the sketches among multiplequeries; the memory required can be reduced. We provide necessary and sufficientconditions for the sketch sharing to result in correct estimation and address optimizationproblems that arise. We also demonstrate how existing statistical information on the basedata (eg; histograms) can be used in the proposed framework to improve the quality of theapproximation provided by our algorithms.

High precision web extraction using site knowledge,*,Techniques for high precision web extraction using site knowledge are provided. Portions ofrepeating text are identified in unlabeled web pages from a particular web site. Based on theportions of repeating text; the unlabeled web pages are partitioned into a set of segments.Multiple labels are assigned to respectively corresponding multiple attributes in the set ofsegments; where assigning the multiple labels comprises applying a classification model toeach separate segment in the set of segments. First one or more labels are identified thatwere erroneously assigned to one or more attributes in the set of segments. Second one ormore correct labels for the one or more attributes are determined. The first one or morelabels in the set of segments are corrected by assigning the second one or more labels tothe one or more attributes.,*,2010,1
Tracking set-expression cardinalities over continuous update streams,*,A method of estimating set-expression cardinalities over data streams with guaranteed smallmaintenance time per data-element update. The method only examines each data elementonce and uses a limited amount of memory. The time-efficient stream synopsis extends 2-level hash-sketches by randomly; but uniformly; pre-hashing data-elements prior tologarithmically hashing them to a first-level hash-table. This generates a set of independent2-level hash-sketches. The set-union cardinality can be estimated by determining thesmallest hash-bucket index j at which only a predetermined fraction of the b hash-bucketshas a non-empty union| A∪ B|. Once a set-union cardinality is estimated; general set-expression cardinalities may be estimated by counting witness elements for the set-expression; ie; those first-level hash-buckets that are both a singleton for the set …,*,2009,1
Indexed Regular Expression Matching,Chee Yong Chan; Minos Garofalakis; Rajeev Rastogi,Regular expressions (REs) provide an expressive and powerful formalism for capturing the structureof messages; events; and documents. Consequently; they have been used extensively in thespecification of a number of languages for important application domains; including the XPathpattern language for XML documents [6] and the policy language of the Border Gateway Protocol(BGP) for propagating routing information between autonomous systems in the Internet [12].Many of these applications have to manage large databases of RE specifications and need toprovide an effective matching mechanism that; given an input string; quickly identifies all theREs in the database that match it. This RE retrieval problem is therefore important for a varietyof software components in the middleware and networking infrastructure of the Internet. The REretrieval problem can be stated as follows: Given a large set S of REs over an alphabet † …,*,2008,1

Concurrency control in multidatabase systems,Rajeev Ramnarain Rastogi,Abstract A multidatabase system (MDBS) is a software package that provides for theintegration of pre-existing independent database management systems (DBMSs). It enablesusers of a DBMS to retrieve and update data located at remote systems. Accesses andupdates to data are performed using transactions that preserve database consistency whenexecuted in isolation. The integrity of data is traditionallly preserved by ensuring that theconcurrent execution of transactions is serializable. However; serializability may not be theappropriate notion of correctness in an MDBS environment for the following reasons:(1)Difficult to achieve. The MDBS software which is built on top of the local DBMSs is unawareof indirect conflicts between global transactions due to the execution of local applicationsthat make calls directly to local DBMS interfaces.(2) Poor performance.

Strict Histories in Object-Based Database,Rajeev Rastogi; Henry F Korth; Avi Silberschatz,Abstract In order to ensure the simplicity of recovery in an object-based database systemenvironment; the notion of a strict history containing operations that are semantically richerthan read and write operations is of vital importance. A strict history is one in which recoveryfor aborted operations can be performed by simply executing their inverse operations. In thispaper; we develop concurrency control schemes based on commutativity betweenoperations and inverses of operations for efficiently ensuring that histories are strict. Weshow that in schemes based on commutativity; the time complexity for scheduling anoperation for execution is linear in the number of operations that have neither committed noraborted in the history. We also utilize the weakest precondition of operations in order to statenecessary and sufficient conditions for ensuring that scheduling an operation for …,*,1992,1

Model-Based Semantic Compression for Network-Data Tables,Babu Shivnath; Minos Garofalakis; Rajeev Rastogi; Avi Silberschatz,While a variety of lossy compression schemes have been developed for certain forms ofdigital data (eg; images; audio; video); the area of lossy compression techniques for arbitrarydata tables has been left relatively unexplored. Nevertheless; such techniques are clearlymotivated by the ever-increasing data collection rates of modern enterprises and the needfor effective; guaranteed-quality approximate answers to queries over massive relationaldata sets. In this paper; we propose Model-Based Semantic Compression (MBSC); a noveldata compression framework that takes advantage of attribute semantics and data-miningmodels to perform lossy compression of massive data tables.

and S. Sudarshan,Philip L Bohannon; Rajeev R Rastogi; Avi Silberschatz,A number of database applications—particularly in the telecommunications industry andother industries involved in real-time content delivery—require very high performanceaccess to data. Such applications typically need high transaction rates; coupled with verylow latency for transactions; and they impose stringent durability and availabilityrequirements. Consider; for example; a real phone-company application in which phone calldata is recorded and queries can be issued against the data. The application must be ableto process several thousand (albeit small) requests (lookups/updates) per second; with lessthan 50 milliseconds latency for lookups and less than a few minutes of down time per year.The increasing availability of large; relatively cheap memory suggests that more databaseapplications could reside entirely or almost entirely in main memory.

THE femm MULTIMEDIA STORAGE SERVER,Cliff Martin; PS Narayanan; Banu Ozden; Rajeev Rastogi; Avi Silberschatz,ABSTRACT Continuous media applications require a guaranteed transfer rate of data; whichconventional storage servers are not designed to provide. In this chapter; we describe thearchitecture of the Fellini multimedia storage manager implemented at AT&T BellLaboratories. Fellini supports the storage and retrieval of both continuous media (eg; video;audio) as well as conventional (eg; text; binary) data. Each client can access continuousmedia data at a separate rate concurrently with other clients. Clients can also accessconventional data (that does not have rate requirements) without violating the rateguarantees of other clients accessing continuous media data. In order to provide rateguarantees to clients; Fellini uses admission control to restrict the number of concurrentclients being serviced at any given time.

Enhancing pre-existing data managers with atomicity and durability,Rajeev Rastogi; Marie-Anne Neimat,Abstract Many of currently available managers of persistent data do not provide support forupdates that are atomic and durable. Developing from scratch the requisite software forincorporating the atomicity and durability properties into each of these pre-existing datamanagers is a time-consuming and formidable task. It is hence desirable to design and builda general purpose recovery manager that can be easily interfaced with pre-existing datamanagers. In this paper; we consider four recovery manager architectures that are based onrecovery algorithms proposed in the literature and recovery designs adopted in existingproducts. We evaluate the various architectures with respect to 1) the extent of themodifications they cause to the software of pre-existing data managers; and 2) the degree towhich they affect the performance of the data managers. Finally; we relate the experience …,International Conference on Applications of Databases,1994,*

Relaxing Serializability in Multidatabase Systems,Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract The concept of serializability has been tradition-ally accepted as the standardnotion of correctness in database systems. However; in a multidatabase sys-tem (MDBS);ensuring serializability is a diﬂlcult task mainly due to the desire of preserving the autonomyof the participating local database systems. In this paper; we introduce a new notion ofcorrectness; RS-correctness; that is based on preserving the integrity constraints of thedatabase. We present a new proto-col for ensuring that schedules in an MDBS environ-mentare Its-correct. The protocol preserves the local autonomy of sites.,*,*,*

Peer Caching for Faster Lookups in P2P Systems,Supratim Deb; Prakash Linga; Rajeev Rastogi; Anand Srinivasan,Abstract—In particular; we address the problem of each peer choosing the k best pointers tostore in addition to its index pointers to minimize the average query lookup times. We focuson two popular P2P systems; namely Pastry and Chord: we exploit the inherent structure ofthese systems to develop efficient; scalable algorithms for optimally choosing the kadditional pointers. Simulations with Chord and Pastry demonstrate that our algorithms arevery effective in reducing the lookup times significantly. Our approach is particularly usefulfor applications such as name services in mobile environments or location services; wherewe can expect a low churn rate for peers and a relatively higher churn rate for objects.,*,*,*

Network Data Mining and Analysis: The,Minos Garofalakis; Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract. Modern communication networks generate large amounts of operational data;including traffic and utilization statistics and alarm/fault data at various levels of detail. Thesemassive collections of network-management data can grow in the order of several Terabytesper year; and typically hide “knowledge” that is crucial to some of the key tasks involved ineffectively managing a communication network (eg; capacity planning and trafficengineering). In this short paper; we provide an overview of some of our recent and ongoingwork in the context of the project at Bell Laboratories that aims to develop novel datawarehousing and mining technology for the effective storage; exploration; and analysis ofmassive network-management data sets.

Versioning Algorithms for Improving Transaction Predictability in Real-time Main-memory Databases,Rajeev Rastogi; S Seshadri; Philip Bohannon; Dennis Leinbaugh; Avi Silberschatz; S Sudarshan,Abstract We present a design for multi-version concurrency control and recovery in a mainmemory database; and describe logical and physical versioning schemes that allow read-only transactions to execute without obtaining data item locks or system latches. Ourschemes enable a system to provide the guarantee that updaters will never interfere withread-only transactions; and read-only transactions will not be delayed (for the purpose ofensuring data consistency) as long as the operating system provides them with su cientcycles. Consequently; transaction executions become more predictable {this partiallyalleviates a major problem in real-time database system (RTDBS) scheduling; namely; signicant unpredictability in transaction execution times. As a result; in addition to a transaction'sdeadline; a more accurate estimate of its execution time can also be taken into account …,*,*,*
A Transaction Model for Multidatabase Systems,Rajeev Rastogi; Abraham Silberschatz,Abstract A multidatabase system (MDBS); consists of a number of sites; each of which runs adistinct com-mercial database management system (DBMS). The goal of an MDBS is tointegrate the various DBMSs to allow applications to access data residing in several DBMSs;without requiring modiﬁcations to the individual DBMSs. This implies that each site isallowed a high degree of local autonomy. This autonomy requirement makes the task ofensuring both the atomicity and isolation properties of transactions; in the presence offailures; difﬁcult. In this paper; we develop a semantically rich transaction model for MDBSapplications. We relax the atomicity requirement on transactions and propose a new suitablecorrectness criterion. We also develop new commit and concur-rency control protocols thatensure correctness and do not violate the local autonomy of the various sites.,*,*,*
