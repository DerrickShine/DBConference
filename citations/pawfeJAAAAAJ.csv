Thefirst we refer to as the spatial phase perturbation GS algorithm (SPP GSA). The second is acombined GS hybrid input–output algorithm (GS/HIOA). In this paper (Part I); it isdemonstrated that the SPP GS and GS/HIO algorithms are both much better at avoidingstagnation during phase retrieval; allowing them to successfully locate superior solutionscompared with either the GS or the HIO algorithms.

High-resolution light-field microscopy,Haoyu Li; Changliang Guo; Shu Jia,Traditional fluorescent imaging typically projects 2D spatial location (intensity) of individualemitters; while the angular (or wavefront) of the emitted light is overlooked; which contains criticalvolumetric information. The emerging light-field imaging methods can simultaneously captureboth spatial and angular information of light; allowing computational synthesis of 3D focal stacksacross the entire volume of specimen [1-4]. The pioneering development; presented by Levoyet al [1]; employed a microlens array in a microscopy system and demonstrated 3D volumetricreconstruction using post-processing algorithms. The work has been further advanced by Broxtonet al [2]; in which they showed a wave optics model to utilize the point-spread function (PSF)for 3D reconstruction; which was applied to image various biological systems [2-4].However; the spatial resolution is thus far still limited; which prohibits the visualization of …,Frontiers in Optics,2017,26
Iterative phase retrieval algorithms. Part II: Attacking optical encryption systems,Changliang Guo; Shi Liu; John T Sheridan,The modified iterative phase retrieval algorithms developed in Part I [Guo et al.; Appl. Opt.54; 4698 (2015) 10.1364/AO. 54.004698 APOPAI1559-128X] are applied to perform knownplaintext and ciphertext attacks on amplitude encoding and phase encoding Fourier-transform-based double random phase encryption (DRPE) systems. It is shown that the newalgorithms can retrieve the two random phase keys (RPKs) perfectly. The performances ofthe algorithms are tested by using the retrieved RPKs to decrypt a set of different ciphertextsencrypted using the same RPKs.

Optical double image encryption employing a pseudo image technique in the Fourier domain,Changliang Guo; Shi Liu; John T Sheridan,Abstract A novel optical encryption method is proposed involving double image encryptionin which one image is introduced as the pseudo image while the other is the original objectimage. The Double Random Phase Encoding technique is used to encrypt both the pseudoand object images into complex images. A unique binary image is then employed to firstgenerate the random phase key for the object image encryption and then to embed theencrypted object image into the encrypted pseudo image; which acts as host image. Boththe second random phase mask used for encoding the pseudo image and the binary imageact as encryption keys. If an attacker attempts to crack the random phase key and decrypt theoriginal object image; the pseudo image will be obtained instead. Simulation results androbustness tests are performed which demonstrate the feasibility of the algorithm.,Optics Communications,2014,9
Robustness of double random phase encoding spread-space spread-spectrum watermarking technique,Shi Liu; Bryan M Hennelly; Changliang Guo; John T Sheridan,Abstract In this paper the robustness of a recently proposed image watermarking scheme;namely the Double Random Phase Encoding spread-space spread-spectrum watermarking(DRPE SS-SS) technique; is investigated. The watermark; which is chosen to be in the formof a digital barcode image; is numerically encrypted using a simulation of the optical DRPEprocess. This produces a random complex image; which is then processed to form a realvalued random image with a low number of quantization levels. This signal is added to thehost image. Extraction of the barcode; involves applying an inverse DRPE process to thewatermarked image followed by low pass filtering. This algorithm is designed to utilize thecapability of the DRPE to reversibly spread the energy of the watermarking information inboth the space and spatial frequency domains. In this way the energy of the watermark in …,Signal Processing,2015,7

Measuring refractive index of glass by using two captures under speckle field illumination,Changliang Guo; Dayan Li; Damien P Kelly; John T Sheridan,Measurement of the refractive index of regular shaped glass by speckle correlation isreported. One intensity image in the diffraction field of a speckle-illuminated sample iscaptured by a CCD before the presence of glass sample and another intensity image iscaptured after the presence of glass sample. As the position of peak correlation coefficient isquantitatively related to the change in optical path length arising due to the presence ofglass; the refractive index of the glass can be evaluated by the correlation of the intensityimages before and after the glass insertion. The theoretical correlation function is firstderived that describes the relationship between optical path length change and speckledecorrelation.
