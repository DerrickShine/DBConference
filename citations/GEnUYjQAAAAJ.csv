Angle-based outlier detection in high-dimensional data,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Schubert; Arthur Zimek,Abstract Detecting outliers in a large set of data objects is a major data mining task aiming atfinding different mechanisms responsible for different groups of objects in a data set. Allexisting approaches; however; are based on an assessment of distances (sometimesindirectly by assuming certain distributions) in the full-dimensional Euclidean data space. Inhigh-dimensional data; these approaches are bound to deteriorate due to the notorious"curse of dimensionality". In this paper; we propose a novel approach named ABOD (Angle-Based Outlier Detection) and some variants assessing the variance in the angles betweenthe difference vectors of a point to the other points. This way; the effects of the" curse ofdimensionality" are alleviated compared to purely distance-based approaches. A mainadvantage of our new approach is that our method does not rely on any parameter …,Proceeding of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2008,331

Undoubtedly; research indata mining will continue and even increase over coming decades. In this article; we sketchour vision of the future of data mining.

The Gauss-tree: Efficient object identification in databases of probabilistic feature vectors,Christian Böhm; Alexey Pryakhin; Matthias Schubert,In applications of biometric databases the typical task is to identify individuals according tofeatures which are not exactly known. Reasons for this inexactness are varying measuringtechniques or environmental circumstances. Since these circumstances are not necessarilythe same when determining the features for different individuals; the exactness mightstrongly vary between the individuals as well as between the features. To identifyindividuals; similarity search on feature vectors is applicable; but even the use of adaptabledistance measures is not capable to handle objects having an individual level of exactness.Therefore; we develop a comprehensive probabilistic theory in which uncertain observationsare modeled by probabilistic feature vectors (pfv); ie feature vectors where the conventionalfeature values are replaced by Gaussian probability distribution functions. Each feature …,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06. Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on,2006,134
Web site mining: a new way to spot competitors; customers and suppliers in the world wide web,Martin Ester; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Schubert,Abstract When automatically extracting information from the world wide web; mostestablished methods focus on spotting single HTML-documents. However; the problem ofspotting complete web sites is not handled adequately yet; in spite of its importance forvarious applications. Therefore; this paper discusses the classification of complete websites. First; we point out the main differences to page classification by discussing a veryintuitive approach and its weaknesses. This approach treats a web site as one large HTML-document and applies the well-known methods for page classification. Next; we show howaccuracy can be improved by employing a preprocessing step which assigns an occurringweb page to its most likely topic. The determined topics now represent the information theweb site contains and can be used to classify it more accurately. We accomplish this by …,Proceedings of the eighth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2002,101
Using sets of feature vectors for similarity search on voxelized CAD objects,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Stefan Brecheisen; Peer Kröger; Martin Pfeifle; Matthias Schubert,Abstract In modern application domains such as multimedia; molecular biology and medicalimaging; similarity search in database systems is becoming an increasingly important task.Especially for CAD applications; suitable similarity models can help to reduce the cost ofdeveloping and producing new parts by maximizing the reuse of existing parts. Most of theexisting similarity models are based on feature vectors. In this paper; we shortly review threemodels which pursue this paradigm. Based on the most promising of these three models; weexplain how sets of feature vectors can be used for more effective and still efficient similaritysearch. We first introduce an intuitive distance measure on sets of feature vectors togetherwith an algorithm for its efficient computation. Furthermore; we present a method foraccelerating the processing of similarity queries on vector set data.

Route skyline queries: A multi-preference path planning approach,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Renz; Matthias Schubert,In recent years; the research community introduced various methods for processing skylinequeries in multidimensional databases. The skyline operator retrieves all objects beingoptimal wrt an arbitrary linear weighting of the underlying criteria. The most prominentexample query is to find a reasonable set of hotels which are cheap but close to the beach.In this paper; we propose an new approach for computing skylines on routes (paths) in aroad network considering multiple preferences like distance; driving time; the number oftraffic lights; gas consumption; etc. Since the consideration of different preferences usuallyinvolves different routes; a skyline-fashioned answer with relevant route candidates is highlyuseful. In our work; we employ graph embedding techniques to enable a best-first basedgraph exploration considering route preferences based on arbitrary road attributes.

Relation prediction in multi-relational domains using matrix factorization,Christoph Lippert; Stefan Hagen Weber; Yi Huang; Volker Tresp; Matthias Schubert; Hans-Peter Kriegel,Abstract The paper is concerned with relation prediction in multi-relational domains usingmatrix factorization. While most past predictive models focussed on one single relation typebetween two entity types; in the paper a generalized model is presented that is able to dealwith an arbitrary number of relation types and entity types in a domain of interest. The novelmulti-relational matrix factorization is domain independent and highly scalable.

Clustering multi-represented objects with noise,Karin Kailing; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Alexey Pryakhin; Matthias Schubert,Abstract Traditional clustering algorithms are based on one representation space; usually avector space. However; in a variety of modern applications; multiple representations exist foreach object. Molecules for example are characterized by an amino acid sequence; asecondary structure and a 3D representation. In this paper; we present an efficient density-based approach to cluster such multi-represented data; taking all available representationsinto account. We propose two different techniques to combine the information of all availablerepresentations dependent on the application. The evaluation part shows that our approachis superior to existing techniques.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2004,63
Accurate and efficient crawling for relevant websites,Martin Ester; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Schubert,Abstract Focused web crawlers have recently emerged as an alternative to the well-established web search engines. While the well-known focused crawlers retrieve relevantwebpages; there are various applications which target whole websites instead of singlewebpages. For example; companies are represented by websites; not by individualwebpages. To answer queries targeted at websites; web directories are an establishedsolution. In this paper; we introduce a novel focused website crawler to employ the paradigmof focused crawling for the search of relevant websites. The proposed crawler is based on atwo-level architecture and corresponding crawl strategies with an explicit concept ofwebsites. The external crawler views the web as a graph of linked websites; selects thewebsites to be examined next and invokes internal crawlers.

Classification of Websites as Sets of Feature Vectors.,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Schubert,ABSTRACT The world wide web is the largest source for all kind of information currentlyavailable. Due to its enormous size retrieving relevant information is a difficult task for whichusers often rely on directory services. A directory service provides a huge topic treecontaining links for each topic. Due to the generality of the topics most links direct towebsites or domains; instead of single webpages. For maintaining a directory service;automatic classification of new websites into the topics of the tree would be very beneficial.Therefore; this paper introduces a new approach to website classification that is based onsets of feature vectors. Compared to previous approaches our new method requires nopreprocessing; but provides high accuracy in efficient time.,Databases and applications,2004,61
Statistical density prediction in traffic networks,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Renz; Matthias Schubert; Andreas Zuefle,Abstract Recently; modern tracking methods started to allow capturing the position ofmassive numbers of moving objects. Given this information; it is possible to analyze andpredict the traffic density in a network which offers valuable information for traffic control;congestion prediction and prevention. In this paper; we propose a novel statistical approachto predict the density on any edge of such a network at some time in the future. Our methodis based on short-time observations of the traffic history. Therefore; knowing the destinationof each traveling individual is not required. Instead; we assume that the individuals will actrationally and choose the shortest path from their starting points to their destinations. Basedon this assumption; we introduce a statistical approach to describe the likelihood of anygiven individual in the network to be located at a certain position at a certain time. Since …,*,2008,54
Effective and efficient distributed model-based clustering,H-P Kriegel; Peer Kroger; Alexey Pryakhin; Matthias Schubert,In many companies data is distributed among several sites; ie each site generates its owndata and manages its own data repository. Analyzing and mining these distributed sourcesrequires distributed data mining techniques to find global patterns representing the completeinformation. The transmission of the entire local data set is often unacceptable because ofperformance considerations; privacy and security aspects; and bandwidth constraints.Traditional data mining algorithms; demanding access to complete data; are not appropriatefor distributed applications. Thus; there is a need for distributed data mining algorithms inorder to analyze and discover new knowledge in distributed environments. One of the mostimportant data mining tasks is clustering which aims at detecting groups of similar dataobjects. In this paper; we propose a distributed model-based clustering algorithm that …,Data Mining; Fifth IEEE International Conference on,2005,46
2D image registration in CT images using radial image descriptors,Franz Graf; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Schubert; Sebastian Pölsterl; Alexander Cavallaro,Abstract Registering CT scans in a body atlas is an important technique for aligning andcomparing different CT scans. It is also required for navigating automatically to certainregions of a scan or if sub volumes should be identified automatically. Common solutions tothis problem employ landmark detectors and interpolation techniques. However; thesesolutions are often not applicable if the query scan is very small or consists only of a singleslice. Therefore; the research community proposed methods being independent fromlandmark detectors which are using imaging techniques to register the slices in ageneralized height scale. In this paper; we propose an improved prediction method forregistering single slices. Our solution is based on specialized image descriptors andinstance-based learning.

Probabilistic ranking queries on gaussians,Christian Bohm; Alexey Pryakhin; Matthias Schubert,In many modern applications; there are no exact values available to describe the dataobjects. Instead; the feature values are considered to be uncertain. This uncertainty ismodeled by probability distributions instead of exact feature values. A typical application ofsuch an uncertainty model are moving objects where the exact position of each object canbe determined only at discrete time intervals. Queries often involve the positions of objectsbetween two such time stamps or after the last known time stamp. Then the objects areessentially uncertain unless the pattern of movement is very simple (eg linear). One of themost important probability density functions for those applications is the Gaussian or normaldistribution which can be defined by a mean value and a standard deviation. In this paper;we examine a new type of queries on uncertain data objects; called probability ranking …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2006. 18th International Conference on,2006,38
Skill-based differences in spatio-temporal team behaviour in defence of the ancients 2 (dota 2),Anders Drachen; Matthew Yancey; John Maguire; Derrek Chu; Iris Yuhui Wang; Tobias Mahlmann; Matthias Schubert; Diego Klabajan,Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games are among the most played digital games inthe world. In these games; teams of players fight against each other in arena environments;and the gameplay is focussed on tactical combat. In this paper; we present three data-drivenmeasures of spatio-temporal behaviour in Defence of the Ancients 2 (DotA 2): 1) Zonechanges; 2) Distribution of team members and: 3) Time series clustering via a fuzzyapproach. We present a method for obtaining accurate positional data from DotA 2. Weinvestigate how behaviour varies across these measures as a function of the skill level ofteams; using four tiers from novice to professional players. Results from three analysesindicate that spatio-temporal behaviour of MOBA teams is highly related to team skill.,Games media entertainment (GEM); 2014 IEEE,2014,32
Optimizing all-nearest-neighbor queries with trigonometric pruning,Tobias Emrich; Franz Graf; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Schubert; Marisa Thoma,Abstract Many applications require to determine the k-nearest neighbors for multiple querypoints simultaneously. This task is known as all-(k)-nearest-neighbor (A k NN) query. In thispaper; we suggest a new method for efficient A k NN query processing which is based onspherical approximations for indexing and query set representation. In this setting; wepropose trigonometric pruning which enables a significant decrease of the remaining searchspace for a query. Employing this new pruning method; we considerably speed up A k NNqueries.,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2010,32
Using support vector machines for classifying large sets of multi-represented objects,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peer Kröger; Alexey Pryakhin; Matthias Schubert,Abstract Databases are a key technology for molecular biology which is a very dataintensive discipline. Since molecular biological databases are rather heterogeneous;unification and data integration is mandatory to make use of the huge amount of availableinformation. Currently; the most promising approach for integration is the use of ontologies.Since mapping biological entities into ontologies is usually achieved manually or semi-automatically; a system for automatic classification of biological entities into ontologiessaves time and effort. Therefore; we present a support vector machine based approach thatautomatically classifies biological entities into a given ontology. To solve this difficult task;our method copes with the following aspects. Biological entities might belong to more thanone class or may be placed in classes on varying abstraction levels.

Efficient similarity search in digital libraries,Christian Bohm; Bernhard Braunmuller; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Schubert,Digital libraries are a core information technology. When the stored data is complex; eg high-resolution images or molecular protein structures; simple query types such as exact matchquery are hardly applicable. In such environments similarity queries; particularly rangequeries and k-nearest neighbor queries; are important query types. Numerous approacheshave been proposed for the processing of similarity queries which mainly concentrate onhighly dynamic data sets where insertion; update; and deletion operations occur. However;only little effort has been devoted to the case of rather static data sets-frequently; occurring indigital libraries. In this paper we introduce a novel technique for efficient similarity search ontop of static or rarely changing data sets. In particularly we propose a special sorting orderon the data objects which can be effectively exploited to substantially reduce the total …,Advances in Digital Libraries; 2000. Proceedings.

Prover: Probabilistic video retrieval using the gauss-tree,Christian Bohm; Michael Gruber; Peter Kunath; Alexey Pryakhin; Matthias Schubert,Modeling objects by probability density functions (pdf) is a new powerful method torepresent complex objects in databases. By representing an object as a pdf eg a Gaussian;it is possible to represent very large and complex objects in a compact and still descriptiveway. In this contribution; we propose ProVeR a prototype search engine for content-basedvideo retrieval which represents a video as a set of Gaussians. The Gaussians are managedby the Gauss-tree; an index structure allowing the efficient processing of probabilisticqueries.

CT slice localization via instance-based regression,Tobias Emrich; Franz Graf; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Schubert; Marisa Thoma; Alexander Cavallaro,Automatically determining the relative position of a single CT slice within a full body scanprovides several useful functionalities. For example; it is possible to validate DICOM meta-data information. Furthermore; knowing the relative position in a scan allows the efficientretrieval of similar slices from the same body region in other volume scans. Finally; therelative position is often an important information for a non-expert user having only access toa single CT slice of a scan. In this paper; we determine the relative position of single CTslices via instance-based regression without using any meta data. Each slice of a volume setis represented by several types of feature information that is computed from a sequence ofimage conversions and edge detection routines on rectangular subregions of the slices.

An EM-approach for clustering multi-instance objects,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Alexey Pryakhin; Matthias Schubert,Abstract In many data mining applications the data objects are modeled as sets of featurevectors or multi-instance objects. In this paper; we present an expectation maximizationapproach for clustering multi-instance objects. We therefore present a statistical process thatmodels multi-instance objects. Furthermore; we present M-steps and E-steps for EMclustering and a method for finding a good initial model. In our experimental evaluation; wedemonstrate that the new EM algorithm is capable to increase the cluster quality for threereal world data sets compared to ak-medoid clustering.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2006,26
Efficient query processing in arbitrary subspaces using vector approximations,H-P Kriegel; Peer Kroger; Matthias Schubert; Ziyue Zhu,In this paper; we introduce the partial vector approximation file; an extension of the wellknown vector approximation file that is constructed to efficiently answer partial similarityqueries in any possible subspace which is not known beforehand. The idea of the partial VA-file is to divide the VA-file into a separate file for each dimension and only load thedimensions that are necessary to answer the query. Thus; the partial VA-file is constructed toimprove the query performance for systems that have to cope with a wide variety ofpreviously unknown query subspaces. We propose novel algorithms for partial kNN andepsiv-range queries based on the new partial VA-file. In our experiments; we demonstratethat our proposed partial VA-file with the novel algorithms improves the average queryperformance in comparison to the original VA-file when answering partial similarity queries,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2006. 18th International Conference on,2006,22
Spatial game analytics,Anders Drachen; Matthias Schubert,Abstract Perhaps the most beloved visualization of player behavior is the heatmap; whichoffers clear and intuitive feedback about the spatial behavior of players. Heatmaps are;however; only the tip of a very deep iceberg of the area–we here will refer to as spatial gameanalytics–and it has a lot more to offer than heatmaps; not the least a strong explanatorypower for deciphering and understanding player behavior. Here we take a plunge into thesedeep waters; exploring what is already being done and what can be done within this areaand to a lesser degree visualization–which is further explored in the following chapters(Chaps. 18 and 19).,*,2013,21
Hierarchical density-based clustering for multi-represented objects,Elke Achtert; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Alexey Pryakhin; Matthias Schubert,Abstract In recent years; the complexity of data objects in data mining applications hasincreased as well as their plain numbers. As a result; there exist various featuretransformations and thus multiple object representations. For example; an image can bedescribed by a text annotation; a color histogram and some texture features. To cluster thesemulti-represented objects; dedicated data mining algorithms have been shown to achieveimproved results. In this paper; we will therefore introduce a method for hierarchical density-based clustering of multi-represented objects which is insensitive wrt the choice ofparameters. Furthermore; we will introduce a theoretical model that allows us to drawconclusions about the interaction of representations. Additionally; we will show how theseconclusions can be used for defining a suitable combination method for multiple …,Workshop on Mining Complex Data (MCD’05); ICDM; Houston; TX.

On the impact of flash SSDs on spatial indexing,Tobias Emrich; Franz Graf; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Schubert; Marisa Thoma,Abstract Similarity queries are an important query type in multimedia databases. Toimplement these types of queries; database systems often use spatial index structures likethe R*-Tree. However; the majority of performance evaluations for spatial index structuresrely on a conventional background storage layer based on conventional hard drives. Sincenewer devices like solid-state-disks (SSD) have a completely different performancecharacteristic; it is an interesting question how far existing index structures profit from thesemodern storage devices. In this paper; we therefore examine the performance behaviour ofthe R*-Tree on an SSD compared to a conventional hard drive.

Linear path skyline computation in bicriteria networks,Michael Shekelyan; Gregor Jossé; Matthias Schubert; Hans-Peter Kriegel,Abstract A bicriteria network is an interlinked data set where edges are labeled with two costattributes. An example is a road network where edges represent road segments beinglabeled with traversal time and energy consumption. To measure the proximity of two nodesin network data; the common method is to compute a cost optimal path between the nodes.In a bicriteria network; there often is no unique path being optimal wrt both types of cost.Instead; a path skyline describes the set of non-dominated paths that are optimal undervarying preference functions. In this paper; we examine the subset of the path skyline whichis optimal under the most common type of preference function; the weighted sum. We willexamine characteristics of this more strict domination relation. Furthermore; we introducetechniques to efficiently maintain the set of linearly non-dominated paths.

Besides their sheer amount; the stored data objects are alsomore and more complex. Therefore; classification of these complex objects is an importantdata mining task that yields several new challenges. In many applications; the data objectsprovide multiple representations. Eg proteins can be described by text; amino acidsequences or 3D structures. Additionally; many real-world applications need to distinguishthousands of classes.

Mario: Multi-attribute routing in open street map,Franz Graf; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Renz; Matthias Schubert,Abstract In recent years; the Open Street Map (OSM) project collected a large repository ofspatial network data containing a rich variety of information about traffic lights; road types;points of interest etc.. Formally; this network can be described as a multi-attribute graph; ie agraph considering multiple attributes when describing the traversal of an edge. In this demo;we present our framework for Multi-Attribute Routing in Open Street Map (MARiO). MARiOincludes methods for preprocessing OSM data by deriving attribute information andintegrating additional data from external sources. There are several routing algorithmsalready available and additional methods can be easily added by using a pluginmechanism.

Mining driving preferences in multi-cost networks,Adrian Balteanu; Gregor Jossé; Matthias Schubert,Abstract When analyzing the trajectories of cars; it often occurs that the selected route differsfrom the route a navigation system would propose. Thus; to predict routes actually beingselected by real drivers; trajectory mining techniques predict routes based on observationsrather than calculated paths. Most approaches to this task build statistical models for thelikelihood that a user travels along certain segments of a road network. However; thesemodels neglect the motivation of a user to prefer one route over its alternatives. Anothershortcoming is that these models are only applicable if there is sufficient data for the givenarea and driver. In this paper; we propose a novel approach which models the motivation ofa driver as a preference distribution in a multi-dimensional space of traversal costs; such asdistance; traffic lights; left turns; congestion probability etc..

With the aid of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI); ie; geo-spatial information contained in user generated content; we aim at obtaining paths that donot only minimize distance but also lead through more popular areas. Based on theimportance of landmarks in Geographic Information Science and in human cognition; weextract a certain kind of VGI; namely spatial relations that define closeness (nearby; next to)between pairs of points of interest (POIs); and quantify them following a probabilisticframework. Subsequently; using Bayesian inference we obtain a crowd-based closenessconfidence score between pairs of POIs.

Linear path skylines in multicriteria networks,Michael Shekelyan; Gregor Jossé; Matthias Schubert,In many graph applications; computing cost-optimal paths between two locations is animportant task for routing and distance computation. Depending on the network multiple costcriteria might be of interest. Examples are travel time; energy consumption and toll fees inroad networks. Path skyline queries compute the set of pareto optimal paths between twogiven locations. However; the number of skyline paths increases exponentially with thedistance between the locations and the number of cost criteria. Thus; the result set might betoo big to be of any use. In this paper; we introduce multicriteria linear path skyline queries.A linear path skyline is the subset of the conventional path skyline where the paths areoptimal under a linear combination of their cost values. We argue that cost vectors beingoptimal with respect to a weighted sum are intuitive to understand and therefore; more …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,10
Region of interest queries in CT scans,Alexander Cavallaro; Franz Graf; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Schubert; Marisa Thoma,Abstract Medical image repositories contain very large amounts of computer tomography(CT) scans. When querying a particular CT scan; the user is often not interested in thecomplete scan but in a certain region of interest (ROI). Unfortunately; specifying the ROI interms of scan coordinates is usually not an option because an ROI is usually specified wrtthe scan content; eg an example region in another scan. Thus; the system usually retrievesthe complete scan and the user has to navigate to the ROI manually. In addition to the timeto navigate; there is a large overhead for loading and transferring the irrelevant parts of thescan. In this paper; we propose a method for answering ROI queries which are specified byan example ROI in another scan. An important feature of our new approach is that it is notnecessary to annotate the query or the result scan before query processing.

Inthis demo; we show how the concept of skyline queries can be successfully adapted torouting problems considering multiple road attributes. In particular; we demonstrate how tocompute several pareto-optimal paths which contain optimal results for a variety of userpreferences. The PAROS-system has two main purposes. The first is to calculate the routeskyline for a starting point and a destination. Our demonstrator visualizes the result set for upto three road attributes. Therefore; we provide a dual view on the computed skyline paths.The first view displays the result paths on the road map itself.

Querying objects modeled by arbitrary probability distributions,Christian Böhm; Peter Kunath; Alexey Pryakhin; Matthias Schubert,Abstract In many modern applications such as biometric identification systems; sensornetworks; medical imaging; geology; and multimedia databases; the data objects are notdescribed exactly. Therefore; recent solutions propose to model data objects by probabilitydensity functions (pdf). Since a pdf describing an uncertain object is often not explicitlyknown; approximation techniques like Gaussian mixture models (GMM) need to beemployed. In this paper; we introduce a method for efficiently indexing and querying GMMsallowing fast object retrieval for arbitrary shaped pdf. We consider probability rankingqueries which are very important for probabilistic similarity search. Our method stores thecomponents and weighting functions of each GMM in an index structure. During queryprocessing the mixture models are dynamically reconstructed whenever necessary. In an …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2007,10
Multi-represented classification based on confidence estimation,Johannes Aßfalg; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Alexey Pryakhin; Matthias Schubert,Abstract Complex objects are often described by multiple representations modeling variousaspects and using various feature transformations. To integrate all information intoclassification; the common way is to train a classifier on each representation and combinethe results based on the local class probabilities. In this paper; we derive so-calledconfidence estimates for each of the classifiers reflecting the correctness of the local classprediction and use the prediction having the maximum confidence value. The confidenceestimates are based on the distance to the class border and can be derived for various typesof classifiers like support vector machines; k-nearest neighbor classifiers; Bayes classifiers;and decision trees.

Probabilistic Resource Route Queries with Reappearance.,Gregor Jossé; Klaus Arthur Schmid; Matthias Schubert,ABSTRACT In many routing applications; it is unclear whether driving to a certaindestination yields the wanted success. For example; consider driving to an appointment andlooking for a parking spot. If there are generally few parking spots in the area or if occupancyof spots is currently high; the search may not be successful. In this case; the search iscontinued; possibly into a different area; where chances of success are higher. Wegeneralize this problem and introduce a probabilistic formalization to model the availabilityof resources at certain locations. Our probabilistic model considers short term observations(eg; vacant parking spots) as well as long term observations (eg; average occupancy time)to adapt to the level of information currently available. In contrast to previous models; weallow resources to reappear after a probabilistically modeled amount of time (eg; a car …,EDBT,2015,8
Probabilistic parking queries using aging functions,Gregor Jossé; Matthias Schubert; Hans-Peter Kriegel,Abstract Ordinary navigation systems compute the cost-optimal way to a given destination.However; it is often not possible to directly park the car at the destination of a route. Sinceparking possibilities are often limited; drivers have to locate a free parking spot when gettingclose to their destination. This often proves rather problematic in unknown environments.Recent advances in car sensoring techniques and vehicle ad-hoc networks allow theconstruction of real-time maps of currently unoccupied parking spots. In this paper; weexamine the problem of guiding a driver to an unoccupied parking spot given such an ad-hoc map. The major problem of this task is the volatility of parking spot vacancy; especially inurban residential areas. Thus; we model the availability as a probability distributiondecreasing over time and compute routes maximizing the likelihood of finding a parking …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2013,8
Position prediction in ct volume scans,Franz Graf; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Sebastian Pölsterl; Matthias Schubert; Alexander Cavallaro,Abstract In their daily work; radiologists often need to localize and align parts of CT volumescans to perform among others differential diagnosis. In these cases; it is desired to loadonly the relevant sub volume of the scan and to align the sub volume automatically to thecorrect position of the query scan. Common techniques employ landmark detectors andinterpolation to solve this problem. Yet; these techniques are are not applicable in case ofvery small volume scans where the query scan comprises only a small amount of images. Inthis paper; we propose a method to use small sub volumes in CT volume scans foridentifying and aligning CT Scans. Our solution employs combinations of weighted imagedescriptors and instance-based regression and thus demonstrates the need for machinelearning techniques in the case of position prediction. The experiments show that the new …,Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) Workshop on Learning for Global Challenges; Bellevue; Washington; WA,2011,8
Clustering multi-represented objects using combination trees,Elke Achtert; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Alexey Pryakhin; Matthias Schubert,Abstract When clustering complex objects; there often exist various feature transformationsand thus multiple object representations. To cluster multi-represented objects; dedicateddata mining algorithms have been shown to achieve improved results. In this paper; we willintroduce combination trees for describing arbitrary semantic relationships which can beused to extend the hierarchical clustering algorithm OPTICS to handle multi-representeddata objects.

Paretoprep: Efficient lower bounds for path skylines and fast path computation,Michael Shekelyan; Gregor Jossé; Matthias Schubert,Abstract Computing cost-optimal paths in network data is an important task in manyapplication areas like transportation networks; computer networks; or social graphs. In manycases; the cost of an edge can be described by various cost criteria. For example; in a roadnetwork possible cost criteria are distance; time; ascent; energy consumption or toll fees. Insuch a multicriteria network; path optimality can be defined in various ways. In particular;optimality might be defined as a combination of the given cost factors. To avoid finding asuitable combination function; methods like path skyline queries return all potentially optimalpaths. To compute alternative paths in larger networks; most efficient algorithms rely onlower bound cost estimations to approximate the remaining costs from an arbitrary node tothe specified target. In this paper; we introduce ParetoPrep; a new method for efficient …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2015,7

Fully automatic detection of the vertebrae in 2D CT images,Franz Graf; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Schubert; Michael Strukelj; Alexander Cavallaro,Knowledge about the vertebrae is a valuable source of information for several annotationtasks. In recent years; the research community spent a considerable effort for detecting;segmenting and analyzing the vertebrae and the spine in various image modalities like CTor MR. Most of these methods rely on prior knowledge like the location of the vertebrae orother initial information like the manual detection of the spine. Furthermore; the majority ofthese methods require a complete volume scan. With the existence of use cases where onlya single slice is available; there arises a demand for methods allowing the detection of thevertebrae in 2D images. In this paper; we propose a fully automatic and parameterlessalgorithm for detecting the vertebrae in 2D CT images. Our algorithm starts with detectingcandidate locations by taking the density of bone-like structures into account. Afterwards …,Medical Imaging 2011: Image Processing,2011,6

In this paper; we present a novel technique for multi-represented similarityestimation. We transform the distance between two objects in each representation into so-called similarity and dissimilarity estimates which are used to derive a meaningful similarityscore.

Managing and mining multiplayer online games,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Schubert; Andreas Züfle,Abstract Modern massive-multiplayer-online games (MMOs) allow thousands of users tosimultaneously interact within a virtual spatial environment. Developing an MMO serversyields a lot of new challenges in managing and mining spatial temporal data. In this paper;we describe problems of handling spatial data in an MMO and outline why analyzing spatialpatterns is an important task for keeping an MMO successful over a long period of time.Though many of these problems share a close connection to well-known tasks in temporaland spatial databases; there are many significant differences as well. Thus; we will describethe similarities to established problems and outline new challenges for managing andmining spatial temporal data in MMOs.,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2011,5
Skill-based differences in spatio-temporal team behavior in defence of the ancients 2,Anders Drachen; Matthew Yancey; John Maguire; Derrek Chu; Iris Yuhui Wang; Tobias Mahlmann; Matthias Schubert; Diego Klabjan,Abstract: Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games are among the most played digitalgames in the world. In these games; teams of players fight against each other in arenaenvironments; and the gameplay is focused on tactical combat. Mastering MOBAs requiresextensive practice; as is exemplified in the popular MOBA Defence of the Ancients 2 (DotA2). In this paper; we present three data-driven measures of spatio-temporal behavior in DotA2: 1) Zone changes; 2) Distribution of team members and: 3) Time series clustering via afuzzy approach. We present a method for obtaining accurate positional data from DotA 2. Weinvestigate how behavior varies across these measures as a function of the skill level ofteams; using four tiers from novice to professional players.

Tourismo: A user-preference tourist trip search engine,Gregor Jossé; Klaus Arthur Schmid; Andreas Züfle; Georgios Skoumas; Matthias Schubert; Dieter Pfoser,Abstract In this demonstration we re-visit the problem of finding an optimal route fromlocation A to B. Currently; navigation systems compute shortest; fastest; most economicroutes or any combination thereof. More often than not users want to consider “soft”qualitative metrics such as popularity; scenic value; and general appeal of a route. Routingalgorithms have not (yet) been able to appreciate; measure; and evaluate such qualitativemeasures. Given the emergence of user-generated content; data exists that records userpreference. This work exploits user-generated data; including image data; text data andtrajectory data; to estimate the attractiveness of parts of the spatial network in relation to aparticular user. We enrich the spatial network dataset by quantitative scores reflectingqualitative attractiveness. These scores are derived from a user-specific self-assessment …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2015,4

Memory-efficient A*-search using sparse embeddings,Franz Graf; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Renz; Matthias Schubert,Abstract When searching for optimal paths in a network; algorithms like A*-search need anapproximation of the minimal costs between the current node and a target node. A referencenode embedding is a universal method for making such an approximation working for anytype of positive edge weights. A drawback of the approach is that the memory consumptionof the embedding is linearly increasing with the number of attributes and landmarks. In thispaper; we propose methods for significantly decreasing the memory consumption ofembedded graphs and examine the impact of the landmark selection.,Proceedings of the 18th SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2010,4
Geodata supported classification of patent applications,Jan Stutzki; Matthias Schubert,Abstract The automatic classification of patent applications into a particular patentclassification system remains a challenge with many practical applications. From a computerscience point of view; the task is a multi-label hierarchical classification problem; ie eachpatent application might belong to multiple classes within the class hierarchy. The problemis still especially difficult for purely text-based classifiers because patents and patentapplications are often formulated in a rather generic way. Thus; additional sources ofinformation should be used to improve class prediction. In our approach; we propose theuse of location information contained in the meta data of a patent application in combinationwith text-based patent classification. We argue that certain technological areas often clusterin geographic regions. For example; space travel technology is often collocated at …,Proceedings of the Third International ACM SIGMOD Workshop on Managing and Mining Enriched Geo-Spatial Data,2016,3
Semantic localization-driven partial image retrieval in CT series,A Cavallaro; H-P Kriegel; M Petri; M Schubert,Summary Background: Picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) contain verylarge amounts of computed tomography (CT) data. When querying a PACS for a particularseries; the user is often not interested in the complete series but in a certain region ofinterest (ROI); described eg by an example view in another series or an anatomical concept.Objectives: Restricting a retrieval query to such an ROI saves both loading time andnavigational effort.

Enhanced detection of the vertebrae in 2D CT-images,Franz Graf; Robert Greil; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Schubert; Alexander Cavallaro,In recent years; a considerable amount of methods have been proposed for detecting andreconstructing the spine and the vertebrae from CT and MR scans. The results are eitherused for examining the vertebrae or serve as a preprocessing step for further detection andannotation tasks. In this paper; we propose a method for reliably detecting the position of thevertebrae on a single slice of a transversal body CT scan. Thus; our method is not restrictedby the available portion of the 3D scan; but even suffices with a single 2D image. A furtheradvantage of our method is that detection does not require adjusting parameters or directuser interaction. Technically; our method is based on an imaging pipeline comprising fivesteps: The input image is preprocessed. The relevant region of the image is extracted. Then;a set of candidate locations is selected based on bone density. In the next step; image …,Medical Imaging 2012: Image Processing,2012,3
COSMIC: conceptually specified multi-instance clusters,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Alexey Pryakhin; Matthias Schubert; Arthur Zimek,Recently; more and more applications represent data objects as sets of feature vectors ormulti-instance objects. In this paper; we propose COSMIC; a method for deriving conceptlattices from multi-instance data based on hierarchical density-based clustering. The foundconcepts correspond to groups or clusters of multi-instance objects having similar instancesin common. We demonstrate that COSMIC outperforms compared methods with respect toefficiency and cluster quality and is capable to extract interesting patterns in multi-instancedata sets.,Data Mining; 2006.

Hierarchy-regularized latent semantic indexing,Yi Huang; Kai Yu; Matthias Schubert; Shipeng Yu; Volker Tresp; Hans-Peter Kriegel,Organizing textual documents into a hierarchical taxonomy is a common practice inknowledge management. Beside textual features; the hierarchical structure of directoriesreflect additional and important knowledge annotated by experts. It is generally desired toincorporate this information into text mining processes. In this paper; we propose hierarchy-regularized latent semantic indexing; which encodes the hierarchy into a similarity graph ofdocuments and then formulates an optimization problem mapping each document into a lowdimensional vector space. The new feature space preserves the intrinsic structure of theoriginal taxonomy and thus provides a meaningful basis for various learning tasks likevisualization and classification.

Advanced Data Mining techniques for compound objects,Matthias Schubert,Abstract Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) is the non-trivial process of identifyingvalid; novel; potentially useful; and ultimately understandable patterns in large datacollections. The most important step within the process of KDD is data mining which isconcerned with the extraction of the valid patterns. KDD is necessary to analyze the steadygrowing amount of data caused by the enhanced performance of modern computer systems.However; with the growing amount of data the complexity of data objects increases as well.Modern methods of KDD should therefore examine more complex objects than simplefeature vectors to solve real-world KDD applications adequately. Multi-instance and multi-represented objects are two important types of object representations for complex objects.Multi-instance objects consist of a set of object representations that all belong to the same …,*,2004,3

Scenic routes now: Efficiently solving the time-dependent arc orienteering problem,Gregor Jossé; Ying Lu; Tobias Emrich; Matthias Renz; Cyrus Shahabi; Ugur Demiryurek; Matthias Schubert,Abstract: This paper extends the Arc Orienteering Problem (AOP) to large road networks withtime-dependent travel times and time-dependent value gain; termed Twofold Time-Dependent AOP or 2TD-AOP for short. In its original definition; the NP-hard OrienteeringProblem (OP) asks to find a path from a source to a destination maximizing the accumulatedvalue while not exceeding a cost budget. Variations of the OP and AOP have many practicalapplications such as mobile crowdsourcing tasks (eg; repairing and maintenance ordispatching field workers); diverse logistics problems (eg; crowd control or controllingwildfires) as well as several tourist guidance problems (eg; generating trip recommendationsor navigating through theme parks). In the proposed 2TD-AOP; travel times and valuefunctions are assumed to be time-dependent. The dynamic values model; for instance …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.08484,2016,2
Easyev: Monitoring and querying system for electric vehicle fleets using smart car data,Gregor Jossé; Matthias Schubert; Ludwig Zellner,Abstract Electric vehicles (EVs) have great potential as a modern mobility concept. Electricityalready relies on a broad infrastructure and is available anywhere in developed countries.Furthermore; EVs are emmission-free which makes them the preferable form of individualtransportation in urban areas where air pollution is often alarmingly high. However;operating EVs has several drawbacks compared to common combustion engine cars. Therange of most EVs is rarely above 150 km; and when running out of energy; recharging anEV usually takes up to several hours. In order to benefit from the advantages of EVs withoutbeing afflicted with the disadvantages; it is advisable to rely on the support from smartsystems for trip and charge planning. In the project Shared E-Fleet; the shared use of a fleetof electric cars by a heterogeneous group of drivers is examined.

Efficient traffic density prediction in road networks using suffix trees,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Renz; Matthias Schubert; Andreas Züfle,Abstract Recently; modern tracking methods started to allow capturing the position ofmassive numbers of moving objects. Given this information; it is possible to analyze andpredict the traffic density in a network which offers valuable information for traffic control;congestion prediction and prevention. In this paper; we propose a statistical approach topredict the density on any edge in such a network at a future point of time. Our methodcombines long-term and short-term observations of a traffic network in order to predict trafficdensity for the near future. In our experiments; we show the capability of our approach tomake useful predictions about the traffic density and illustrate the efficiency of our newalgorithm when calculating these predictions.,KI-Künstliche Intelligenz,2012,2
Distribution-based similarity for multi-represented multimedia objects,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peter Kunath; Alexey Pryakhin; Matthias Schubert,Abstract In modern multimedia databases; objects can be represented by a large variety offeature representations. In order to employ all available information in a best possible way; ajoint statement about object similarity must be derived. In this paper; we present a noveltechnique for multi-represented similarity estimation which is based on probabilitydistributions modeling the connection between the distance value and object similarity. Totune these distribution functions to model the similarity in each representation; we propose abootstrapping approach maximizing the agreement between the distributions. Thus; wecapture the general notion of similarity which is implicitly given by the distance relationshipsin the available feature representations. Thus; our approach does not need any trainingexamples. In our experimental evaluation; we demonstrate that our new approach offers …,International Conference on Multimedia Modeling,2008,2
Effective and Efficient Indexing for Large Video Databases.,Christian Böhm; Peter Kunath; Alexey Pryakhin; Matthias Schubert,Abstract: Content based multimedia retrieval is an important topic in database systems. Anemerging and challenging topic in this area is the content based search in video data. Avideo clip can be considered as a sequence of images or frames. Since this representationis too complex to facilitate efficient video retrieval; a video clip is often summarized by amore concise feature representation. In this paper; we transform a video clip into a set ofprobabilistic feature vectors (pfvs). In our case; a pfv corresponds to a Gaussian in thefeature space of frames. We demonstrate that this representation is well suited for accuratevideo retrieval. The use of pfvs allows us to calculate confidence values for frames or sets offrames for being contained within a given video in the database. These confidence valuescan be employed to specify two types of queries. The first type of query retrieves the …,BTW,2007,2
Knowledge extraction from crowdsourced data for the enrichment of road networks,Gregor Jossé; Klaus Arthur Schmid; Andreas Züfle; Georgios Skoumas; Matthias Schubert; Matthias Renz; Dieter Pfoser; Mario A Nascimento,Abstract In current navigation systems quantitative metrics such as distance; time andenergy are used to determine optimal paths. Yet; a “best path”; as judged by users; mighttake qualitative features into account; for instance the scenery or the touristic attractivenessof a path. Machines are unable to quantify such “soft” properties. Crowdsourced dataprovides us with a means to record user choices and opinions. In this work; we surveyheterogeneous sources of spatial; spatio-temporal and textual crowdsourced data as aproxy for qualitative information of users in movement. We (i) explore the process ofextracting qualitative information from uncertain crowdsourced data sets employing differenttechniques;(ii) investigate the enrichment of road networks with the extracted information byadjusting its properties and by building a meta-network; and (iii) show how to use the …,Geoinformatica,2017,1
Extracting visited points of interest from vehicle trajectories,Ilkcan Keles; Matthias Schubert; Peer Kröger; Simonas Šaltenis; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Identifying visited points of interest (PoIs) from vehicle trajectories remains an openproblem that is difficult due to vehicles parking often at some distance from the visited PoIand due to some regions having a high PoI density. We propose a visited PoI extraction(VPE) method that identifies visited PoIs using a Bayesian network. The method considersstay duration; weekday; arrival time; and PoI category to compute the probability that a PoI isvisited. We also provide a method to generate labeled data from unlabeled GPS trajectories.An experimental evaluation shows that VPE achieves a precision@ 3 value of 0.8; indicatingthat VPE is able to model the relationship between the temporal features of a stop and thecategory of the visited PoI.,Proceedings of the Fourth International ACM Workshop on Managing and Mining Enriched Geo-Spatial Data,2017,1
Towards resource route queries with reappearance,Gregor Jossé; Matthias Schubert,Abstract In many routing applications; it is unclear whether driving to a certain destinationyields the wanted success. For example; consider driving to an appointment and looking fora parking spot. If there are generally few parking spots in the area or if occupancy of spots iscurrently high; the search may not be successful. In this case; it is continued; possibly into adifferent area; where chances of success are higher. We generalize this problem andpropose a probabilistic formalization to model the availability of resources (eg; vacantparking spots) at locations in a road network we refer to as resource locations. Ourprobabilistic model considers short term observations (observing currently vacant spots) aswell as long term observations (average period of vacancy) to adapt to the currentlyavailable level of information. Based on this model; we propose a query which is related …,Proceedings of the 1st ACM SIGSPATIAL PhD Workshop,2014,1
Optimal Distance Bounds for the Mahalanobis Distance,Tobias Emrich; Gregor Jossé; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Markus Mauder; Johannes Niedermayer; Matthias Renz; Matthias Schubert; Andreas Züfle,Abstract The Mahalanobis distance; or quadratic form distance; is a distance measurecommonly used for feature-based similarity search in scenarios where features arecorrelated. For efficient query processing on such data effective distance-based spatialpruning techniques are required. In this work we investigate such pruning techniques bymeans of distance bounds of the Mahalanobis distance in the presence of rectangularspatial approximations. Specifically we discuss how to transform the problem of computingminimum and maximum distance approximations between two minimum boundingrectangles (MBRs) into a quadratic optimization problem. Furthermore; we show how therecently developed concept of spatial domination can be solved under the Mahalanobisdistance by a quadratic programming approach.,International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications,2013,1
Co-RCA: unsupervised distance-learning for multi-view clustering,HP Kriegel; M Schubert,Abstract There has been a considerable effort on tuning distance metrics for supervisedproblems such as kNN classification. Most methods in metric learning aim at deriving anoptimized matrix for the Mahanalobis distance. However; these methods cannot be appliedfor clustering methods because there is no training set indicating which instances are similarand which are not. In this paper; we will show that the lack of training data can be overcomeby using multiple views. Our new method Co-RCA combines the idea of co-learning withrelevant component analysis (RCA). Based on the assumption that the closest pairs in anyuseful feature space are semantically similar as well; it is possible to improve distancemeasures in unsupervised learning tasks such as clustering. Our experiments demonstratethat Co-RCA can improve the semantic meaning of the distances for two image data sets.,3rd MultiClust workshop: discovering; summarizing and using multiple clusterings held in conjunction with SIAM data mining 2012,2012,1
Efficient similarity search on 3D bounding box annotations,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Marisa Petri; Matthias Schubert; Michael Shekelyan; Michael Stockerl,Searching for similar image regions in medical databases yields valuable information fordiagnosis. However; most of the current approaches are restricted to special cases or theyare only available for rather small data stores. In this paper; we propose a fast query pipelinefor 3D similarity queries on large databases of computed tomography (CT) scans consistingof minimum bounding box annotations. As these box annotations also contain backgroundinformation which is not part of the item that was actually annotated; we employ approximatesegmentation approaches for distinguishing between within-object texture and backgroundtexture in order to correctly describe the annotated objects. Our method allows a compactform of object description. In our framework; we exploit this advantage for enabling very fastquery times.

Similarity estimation using Bayes ensembles,Tobias Emrich; Franz Graf; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Schubert; Marisa Thoma,Abstract Similarity search and data mining often rely on distance or similarity functions inorder to provide meaningful results and semantically meaningful patterns. However;standard distance measures like L p-norms are often not capable to accurately mirror theexpected similarity between two objects. To bridge the so-called semantic gap betweenfeature representation and object similarity; the distance function has to be adjusted to thecurrent application context or user. In this paper; we propose a new probabilistic frameworkfor estimating a similarity value based on a Bayesian setting. In our framework; distancecomparisons are modeled based on distribution functions on the difference vectors. Tocombine these functions; a similarity score is computed by an Ensemble of weak Bayesianlearners for each dimension in the feature space.

Thus; APMs offer a method to analyze class models; feature spaces andparticular classification scenarios. To derive the prototypes; we introduce “Push and Grow”;a classification algorithm which is based on a quality measure favoring maximal marginsbetween classes. To explore the derived prototypes; we propose a visualization suite thatadapts interactive multi-dimensional scaling to prototype models. The idea of this tool is todisplay the distance relationships between the prototypes and the objects to be classified.We distinguish three visualization tasks deriving different kinds of information.

VICO: visualizing connected object orderings,Stefan Brecheisen; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Schubert; Michael Gruber,Abstract In modern databases; complex objects like multimedia data; proteins or text objectscan be modeled in a variety of representations and can be decomposed into multipleinstances of simpler sub-objects. The similarity of such complex objects can be measured bya variety of distance functions. Thus; it quite often occurs that we have multiple views on thesame set of data objects and do not have any intuition about how the different views agreeor disagree about the similarity of objects. VICO is a tool that allows a user to interactivelycompare these different views on the same set of data objects. Our system is based onOPTICS; a density-based hierarchical clustering algorithm which is quite insensitive to thechoice of parameters. OPTICS describes a clustering as a so-called cluster order on a dataset which can be considered as an image of the data distribution.

Semi-Supervised Learning on Graphs Based on Local Label Distributions,Evgeniy Faerman; Felix Borutta; Julian Busch; Matthias Schubert,Abstract: In this work; we propose a novel approach for the semi-supervised nodeclassification. Precisely; we propose a method which takes labels in the local neighborhoodof different locality levels into consideration. Most previous approaches that tackle theproblem of node classification consider nodes to be similar; if they have shared neighbors orare close to each other in the graph. Recent methods for attributed graphs additionally takeattributes of the neighboring nodes into account. We argue that the labels of the neighborsbear important information and considering them helps to improve classification quality. Twonodes which are similar based on labels in their neighborhood do not need to lie close-by inthe graph and may even belong to different connected components. Considering labels canimprove node classification for graphs with and without node attributes. However; as we …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.05563,2018,*

In thiswork; we propose a template extraction method over a stream of incoming documents and atemplate allocation method for assigning new instances from the stream to the most suitabletemplates. Our method employs text augmented by layout information to represent the digitalimage of the paper document. Document similarity is assessed with respect to both textualand layout parts of the document; the matching terms contribute accordingly to their …,Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2015,*
LOCAR: local compression of alternative routes,Matthias Schubert; Hans-Peter Kriegel,Abstract Various routing algorithms compute sets of alternative routes to allow users toselect the route appearing to be most attractive. A problem with the result set of this type ofsolution is that the number of retrieved routes might exceed the number of choices beingmanageable by a user. In this paper; we address the problem of selecting small sets ofroutes which still represent the general alternatives. To decide which routes to prune; weemploy an error bound on the total cost of two alternatives. Since two routes havingapproximately the same cost might visit disjunctive parts of the network; pure cost-basedpruning might discard important choices. To prevent loosing these alternatives; we define asecond criterion based on local invariance. In our experimental setting; we examine runtimes and compression rates for the case of route skylines in Open Street Map data.,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2011,*
Maximum Gain Round Trips with Cost Constraints,Franz Graf; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Schubert,Abstract: Searching for optimal ways in a network is an important task in multiple applicationareas such as social networks; co-citation graphs or road networks. In the majority ofapplications; each edge in a network is associated with a certain cost and an optimal wayminimizes the cost while fulfilling a certain property; eg connecting a start and a destinationnode. In this paper; we want to extend pure cost networks to so-called cost-gain networks. Inthis type of network; each edge is additionally associated with a certain gain. Thus; a wayhaving a certain cost additionally provides a certain gain. In the following; we will discuss theproblem of finding ways providing maximal gain while costing less than a certain budget. Anapplication for this type of problem is the round trip problem of a traveler: Given a certainamount of time; which is the best round trip traversing the most scenic landscape or …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1105.0830,2011,*
KDD Pipeline,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Schubert,If; for a given k; k-anonymity is assumed to be sufficient protection; one can concentrate onminimizing information loss with the only constraint that k-anonymity should be satisfied.This is a clean way of solving the tension between data protection and data utility. Since k-anonymity is usually achieved via generalization (equivalent to global recoding; as saidabove) and local suppression; minimizing information loss usually translates to reducing thenumber and/or the magnitude of suppressions. k-Anonymity bears some resemblance to theunderlying principle of microaggregation and is a useful concept because quasi-identifiersare usually categorical or can be categorized; ie; they take values in a finite (and ideallyreduced) range. However; re-identification is not necessarily based on categorical keyattributes: sometimes; numerical outcome attributes (which are continuous and often …,*,2009,*

Similarity Search for Voxelized CAD Objects,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peer Kröger; Martin Pfeifle; Stefan Brecheisen; Marco Pötke; Matthias Schubert; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Similarity search in database systems is becoming an increasingly important task inmodern application domains such as multimedia; molecular biology; medical imaging; andmany others. Especially for CAD (Computer-Aided Design); suitable similarity models and aclear representation of the results can help to reduce the cost of developing and producingnew parts by maximizing the reuse of existing parts. In this chapter; we present differentsimilarity models for voxelized CAD data based on space partitioning and data partitioning.Based on these similarity models; we introduce anindustrial prototype; called BOSS; whichhelps the user to get an overview over a set of CAD objects. BOSS allows the user to easilybrowse large data collections by graphically displaying the results of a hierarchicalclustering algorithm. This representation is well suited for the evaluation of similarity …,*,2006,*
Komplexe Objektbeschreibungen zur Suche in Multimedia-Datenbanken.,Elke Achtert; Christian Böhm; Stefan Brecheisen; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peter Kunath; Alexey Pryakhin; Matthias Renz; Matthias Schubert,Multiinstanz-Daten sind die Summe minimaler Distanzen; die Surjektionsdistanz sowie dieLink-Distanz [Eiter & Mannila 1997]. Diese Distanzfunktionen eignen sich zwar zurÄhnlichkeitsmodellierung; sind aber keine Metriken; weil sie die Dreiecksungleichung nichterfüllen. Dieser Umstand macht ihre Anwendung zur Ähnlichkeitssuche in umfangreichenMultimedia-Datenbanken unattraktiv; da es sehr aufwendig ist; Ähnlichkeitsanfragen auf derBasis eines nicht metrischen Distanzmaßes effizient zu bearbeiten. In [Eiter & Mannila 1997]wird zwar gezeigt; wie die genannten Distanzmaße zu Metriken erweitert werden können;jedoch führt dieses Verfahren zu einer exponentiellen Berechnungskomplexität.

COSMIC: Conceptually Specified Multi-Instance Clusters,Hans-Peter Kriegel Alexey Pryakhin Matthias; Schubert Arthur Zimek,Abstract Recently; more and more applications represent data objects as sets of featurevectors or multi-instance objects. In this paper; we propose COSMIC; a method for derivingconcept lattices from multi-instance data based on hierarchical density-based clustering.The found concepts correspond to groups or clusters of multi-instance objects having similarinstances in common. We demonstrate that COSMIC outperforms compared methods withrespect to efficiency and cluster quality and is capable to extract interesting patterns in multi-instance data sets.,*,*,*
Tourismo: A User-Preference Tourist Trip Search Engine,Klaus Arthur Schmid; Gregor Jossé; Andreas Züfle; Georgios Skoumas; Matthias Schubert; Dieter Pfoser,Abstract. In this demonstration we re-visit the problem of finding an optimal route fromlocation A to B. Currently; navigation systems compute shortest; fastest; most economicroutes or any combination thereof. More often than not users want to consider “soft”qualitative metrics such as popularity; scenic value; and general appeal of a route. Routingalgorithms have not (yet) been able to appreciate; measure; and evaluate such qualitativemeasures. Given the emergence of user-generated content; data exists that records userpreference. This work exploits user-generated data; including image data; text data andtrajectory data; to estimate the attractiveness of parts of the spatial network in relation to aparticular user. We enrich the spatial network dataset by quantitative scores reflectingqualitative attractiveness. These scores are derived from a user-specific selfassessment (“ …,*,*,*

Invited Talk: Comparability and Semantics in Mining Multi-Represented Objects,Matthias Schubert,Abstract In recent years; the complexity of data objects in data mining applications hasincreased as well as their plain numbers. As a result the characteristics that are used todescribe a data object are very heterogenous and often model different aspects of the sameobject. These different views on a certain data object has led to the development for variousfeature transformations and thus to multiple object representations. For example; a proteincan be described by a text annotation; its amino acid sequence and its three dimensionalstructure. Thus; each protein can be described by three different feature vectors belonging tothree different feature spaces. Another example are earth observation satellites takingimages of the same area in multiple color spectra. To exploit these multiple representationfor data mining; the solutions have to cope with two problems: Comparability and …,Learning With Multiple Views,*,*
