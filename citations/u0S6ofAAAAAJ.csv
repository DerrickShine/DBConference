Keys for XML,Peter Buneman; Susan Davidson; Wenfei Fan; Carmem Hara; Wang-Chiew Tan,Keys are an essential part of database design [2;19]: they are fundamental to data models andconceptual design; they provide the means by which one tuple in a relational database mayrefer to another tuple; and they are important in update; for they enable us to guarantee that anupdate will affect precisely one tuple. More philosophically; if we think of a tuple as representingsome real-world entity; the key provides an invariant connection between the tuple andentity … If XML documents are to do double duty as databases; then we shall need keys forthem. In fact; a cursory examination 3 of existing document type definitions (DTDs) reveals anumber of cases in which some element or attribute is specified––in comments––as a “uniqueidentifier”. Moreover a number of scientific databases; which are typically stored in somespecial-purpose hierarchical data format ripe for conversion to XML; have a …,Computer networks,2002,467
On XML integrity constraints in the presence of DTDs,Wenfei Fan; Leonid Libkin,Abstract The article investigates XML document specifications with DTDs and integrityconstraints; such as keys and foreign keys. We study the consistency problem of checkingwhether a given specification is meaningful: that is; whether there exists an XML documentthat both conforms to the DTD and satisfies the constraints. We show that DTDs interact withconstraints in a highly intricate way and as a result; the consistency problem in general isundecidable. When it comes to unary keys and foreign keys; the consistency problem isshown to be NP-complete. This is done by coding DTDs and integrity constraints with linearconstraints on the integers. We consider the variations of the problem (by both restrictingand enlarging the class of constraints); and identify a number of tractable cases; as well as anumber of additional NP-complete ones. By incorporating negations of constraints; we …,Journal of the ACM (JACM),2002,348
Secure XML querying with security views,Wenfei Fan; Chee-Yong Chan; Minos Garofalakis,Abstract The prevalent use of XML highlights the need for a generic; flexible access-controlmechanism for XML documents that supports efficient and secure query access; withoutrevealing sensitive information unauthorized users. This paper introduces a novel paradigmfor specifying XML security constraints and investigates the enforcement of such constraintsduring XML query evaluation. Our approach is based on the novel concept of security views;which provide for each user group (a) an XML view consisting of all and only the informationthat the users are authorized to access; and (b) a view DTD that the XML view conforms to.Security views effectively protect sensitive data from access and potential inferences byunauthorized user; and provide authorized users with necessary schema information tofacilitate effective query formulation and optimization. We propose an efficient algorithm …,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2004,344
A cost-based model and effective heuristic for repairing constraints by value modification,Philip Bohannon; Wenfei Fan; Michael Flaster; Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract Data integrated from multiple sources may contain inconsistencies that violateintegrity constraints. The constraint repair problem attempts to find" low cost" changes that;when applied; will cause the constraints to be satisfied. While in most previous work repaircost is stated in terms of tuple insertions and deletions; we follow recent work to define adatabase repair as a set of value modifications. In this context; we introduce a novel costframework that allows for the application of techniques from record-linkage to the search forgood repairs. We prove that finding minimal-cost repairs in this model is NP-complete in thesize of the database; and introduce an approach to heuristic repair-construction based onequivalence classes of attribute values. Following this approach; we define two greedyalgorithms. While these simple algorithms take time cubic in the size of the database; we …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,317
Conditional functional dependencies for data cleaning,Philip Bohannon; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Xibei Jia; Anastasios Kementsietsidis,We propose a class of constraints; referred to as conditional functional dependencies(CFDs); and study their applications in data cleaning. In contrast to traditional functionaldependencies (FDs) that were developed mainly for schema design; CFDs aim at capturingthe consistency of data by incorporating bindings of semantic ally related values. For CFDswe provide an inference system analogous to Armstrong's axioms for FDs; as well asconsistency analysis. Since CFDs allow data bindings; a large number of individualconstraints may hold on a table; complicating detection of constraint violations. We developtechniques for detecting CFD violations in SQL as well as novel techniques for checkingmultiple constraints in a single query. We experimentally evaluate the performance of ourCFD-based methods for inconsistency detection. This not only yields a constraint theory …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007.

Improving data quality: Consistency and accuracy,Gao Cong; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Xibei Jia; Shuai Ma,Abstract Two central criteria for data quality are consistency and accuracy. Inconsistenciesand errors in a database often emerge as violations of integrity constraints. Given a dirtydatabase D; one needs automated methods to make it consistent; ie; find a repair D'thatsatisfies the constraints and" minimally" differs from D. Equally important is to ensure that theautomatically-generated repair D'is accurate; or makes sense; ie; D'differs from the" correct"data within a predefined bound. This paper studies effective methods for improving bothdata consistency and accuracy. We employ a class of conditional functional dependencies(CFDs) proposed in [6] to specify the consistency of the data; which are able to captureinconsistencies and errors beyond what their traditional counterparts can catch. To improvethe consistency of the data; we propose two algorithms: one for automatically computing a …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,305
XPath satisfiability in the presence of DTDs,Michael Benedikt; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts,Abstract We study the satisfiability problem associated with XPath in the presence of DTDs.This is the problem of determining; given a query p in an XPath fragment and a DTD D;whether or not there exists an XML document T such that T conforms to D and the answer ofp on T is nonempty. We consider a variety of XPath fragments widely used in practice; andinvestigate the impact of different XPath operators on the satisfiability analysis. We first studythe problem for negation-free XPath fragments with and without upward axes; recursion anddata-value joins; identifying which factors lead to tractability and which to NP-completeness.We then turn to fragments with negation but without data values; establishing lower andupper bounds in the absence and in the presence of upward modalities and recursion. Weshow that with negation the complexity ranges from PSPACE to EXPTIME. Moreover …,Journal of the ACM (JACM),2008,288
Reasoning about keys for XML,Peter Buneman; Susan Davidson; Wenfei Fan; Carmem Hara; Wang-Chiew Tan,Abstract We study absolute and relative keys for XML; and investigate their associateddecision problems. We argue that these keys are important to many forms of hierarchicallystructured data including XML documents. In contrast to other proposals of keys for XML; weshow that these keys are always (finitely) satisfiable; and their (finite) implication problem isfinitely axiomatizable. Furthermore; we provide a polynomial time algorithm for determining(finite) implication in the size of keys. Our results also demonstrate; among other things; thatthe analysis of XML keys is far more intricate than its relational counterpart.,Information Systems,2003,286
Integrity constraints for XML,Wenfei Fan; Jérôme Siméon,Abstract Integrity constraints have proved fundamentally important in databasemanagement. The ID/IDREF mechanism provided by XML DTDs relies on a simple form ofconstraints to describe references. Yet; this mechanism is sufficient neither for specifyingreferences in XML documents; nor for expressing semantic constraints commonly found indatabases. In this paper; we extend XML DTDs with several classes of integrity constraintsand investigate the complexity of reasoning about these constraints. The constraints rangeover keys; foreign keys; inverse constraints as well as ID constraints for capturing thesemantics of object identities. They improve semantic specifications and provide a betterreference mechanism for native XML applications. They are also useful in informationexchange and data integration for preserving the semantics of data originating in …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2003,285
Conditional functional dependencies for capturing data inconsistencies,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Xibei Jia; Anastasios Kementsietsidis,Abstract We propose a class of integrity constraints for relational databases; referred to asconditional functional dependencies (CFDs); and study their applications in data cleaning. Incontrast to traditional functional dependencies (FDs) that were developed mainly for schemadesign; CFDs aim at capturing the consistency of data by enforcing bindings of semanticallyrelated values. For static analysis of CFDs we investigate the consistency problem; which isto determine whether or not there exists a nonempty database satisfying a given set ofCFDs; and the implication problem; which is to decide whether or not a set of CFDs entailsanother CFD. We show that while any set of transitional FDs is trivially consistent; theconsistency problem is NP-complete for CFDs; but it is in PTIME when either the databaseschema is predefined or no attributes involved in the CFDs have a finite domain.

Discovering conditional functional dependencies,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Jianzhong Li; Ming Xiong,This paper investigates the discovery of conditional functional dependencies (CFDs). CFDsare a recent extension of functional dependencies (FDs) by supporting patterns ofsemantically related constants; and can be used as rules for cleaning relational data.However; finding quality CFDs is an expensive process that involves intensive manual effort.To effectively identify data cleaning rules; we develop techniques for discovering CFDs fromrelations. Already hard for traditional FDs; the discovery problem is more difficult for CFDs.Indeed; mining patterns in CFDs introduces new challenges. We provide three methods forCFD discovery. The first; referred to as CFDMiner; is based on techniques for mining closeditem sets; and is used to discover constant CFDs; namely; CFDs with constant patterns only.Constant CFDs are particularly important for object identification; which is essential to …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,233
Dependencies revisited for improving data quality,Wenfei Fan,Abstract Dependency theory is almost as old as relational databases themselves; and hastraditionally been used to improve the quality of schema; among other things. Recently therehas been renewed interest in dependencies for improving the quality of data. The increasingdemand for data quality technology has also motivated revisions of classical dependencies;to capture more inconsistencies in real-life data; and to match; repair and query theinconsistent data. This paper aims to provide an overview of recent advances in revisingclassical dependencies for improving data quality.,Proceedings of the twenty-seventh ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2008,211
Graph pattern matching: from intractable to polynomial time,Wenfei Fan; Jianzhong Li; Shuai Ma; Nan Tang; Yinghui Wu; Yunpeng Wu,Abstract Graph pattern matching is typically defined in terms of subgraph isomorphism;which makes it an np-complete problem. Moreover; it requires bijective functions; which areoften too restrictive to characterize patterns in emerging applications. We propose a class ofgraph patterns; in which an edge denotes the connectivity in a data graph within apredefined number of hops. In addition; we define matching based on a notion of boundedsimulation; an extension of graph simulation. We show that with this revision; graph patternmatching can be performed in cubic-time; by providing such an algorithm. We also developalgorithms for incrementally finding matches when data graphs are updated; withperformance guarantees for dag patterns. We experimentally verify that these algorithmsscale well; and that the revised notion of graph pattern matching allows us to identify …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,204
Structural properties of XPath fragments,Michael Benedikt; Wenfei Fan; Gabriel Kuper,Abstract We study structural properties of each of the main sublanguages of navigationalXPath (W3c Recommendation) commonly used in practice. First; we characterize theexpressive power of these language fragments in terms of both logics and tree patterns.Second; we investigate closure properties; focusing on the ability to perform basic Booleanoperations while remaining within the fragment. We give a complete picture of the closureproperties of these fragments; treating XPath expressions both as functions of arbitrarynodes in a document tree; and as functions that are applied only at the root of the tree.Finally; we provide sound and complete axiom systems and normal forms for several ofthese fragments. These results are useful for simplification of XPath expressions andoptimization of XML queries.,Theoretical Computer Science,2005,194

Foundations of data quality management,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts,Abstract Data quality is one of the most important problems in data management. Adatabase system typically aims to support the creation; maintenance; and use of largeamount of data; focusing on the quantity of data. However; real-life data are often dirty:inconsistent; duplicated; inaccurate; incomplete; or stale. Dirty data in a database routinelygenerate misleading or biased analytical results and decisions; and lead to loss ofrevenues; credibility and customers. With this comes the need for data quality management.In contrast to traditional data management tasks; data quality management enables thedetection and correction of errors in the data; syntactic or semantic; in order to improve thequality of the data and hence; add value to business processes. While data quality has beena longstanding problem for decades; the prevalent use of the Web has increased the risks …,Synthesis Lectures on Data Management,2012,149
Towards certain fixes with editing rules and master data,Wenfei Fan; Jianzhong Li; Shuai Ma; Nan Tang; Wenyuan Yu,Abstract A variety of integrity constraints have been studied for data cleaning. While theseconstraints can detect the presence of errors; they fall short of guiding us to correct theerrors. Indeed; data repairing based on these constraints may not find certain fixes that areabsolutely correct; and worse; may introduce new errors when repairing the data. Wepropose a method for finding certain fixes; based on master data; a notion of certain regions;and a class of editing rules. A certain region is a set of attributes that are assured correct bythe users. Given a certain region and master data; editing rules tell us what attributes to fixand how to update them. We show how the method can be used in data monitoring andenrichment. We develop techniques for reasoning about editing rules; to decide whetherthey lead to a unique fix and whether they are able to fix all the attributes in a tuple …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,138
Path constraints on semistructured and structured data,Peter Buneman; Wenfei Fan; Scott Weinstein,We present a class of path constraints of interest in connection with both structured andsemistructured databases; and investigate their associated implication problems. Thesepath constraints are capable of expressing natural integrity constraints that are not only afundamental part of the semantics of the data; but are also important in query optimization.We show that in semistructured databases; despite the simple syntax of the constraints; theirassociated Implication problem is re complete and finite implication problem is co-POcomplete. However; we establish the decidabllity of the implication probIems for severaIfragments of the path constraint language; and demonstrate that these fragments suffice toexpress important semantic information such as inverse relationships and local databaseconstraints commonly found in object-oriented databases. We also show that in the …,Proceedings of the seventeenth ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1998,132
Reasoning about record matching rules,Wenfei Fan; Xibei Jia; Jianzhong Li; Shuai Ma,Abstract To accurately match records it is often necessary to utilize the semantics of the data.Functional dependencies (FDs) have proven useful in identifying tuples in a clean relation;based on the semantics of the data. For all the reasons that FDs and their inference areneeded; it is also important to develop dependencies and their reasoning techniques formatching tuples from unreliable data sources. This paper investigates dependencies andtheir reasoning for record matching.(a) We introduce a class of matching dependencies(MDs) for specifying the semantics of data in unreliable relations; defined in terms ofsimilarity metrics and a dynamic semantics.(b) We identify a special case of MDs; referred toas relative candidate keys (RCKs); to determine what attributes to compare and how tocompare them when matching records across possibly different relations.(c) We propose …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,131
Incremental graph pattern matching,Wenfei Fan; Xin Wang; Yinghui Wu,Abstract Graph pattern matching is commonly used in a variety of emerging applicationssuch as social network analysis. These applications highlight the need for studying thefollowing two issues. First; graph pattern matching is traditionally defined in terms ofsubgraph isomorphism or graph simulation. These notions; however; often impose toostrong a topological constraint on graphs to identify meaningful matches. Second; in practicea graph is typically large; and is frequently updated with small changes. It is oftenprohibitively expensive to recompute matches starting from scratch via batch algorithmswhen the graph is updated. This article studies these two issues.(1) We propose to definegraph pattern matching based on a notion of bounded simulation; which extends graphsimulation by specifying the connectivity of nodes in a graph within a predefined number …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2013,124
Extending dependencies with conditions,Loreto Bravo; Wenfei Fan; Shuai Ma,Abstract This paper introduces a class of conditional inclusion dependencies (CINDs); whichextends traditional inclusion dependencies (INDs) by enforcing bindings of semanticallyrelated data values. We show that CINDs are useful not only in data cleaning; but are also incontextual schema matching [7]. To make effective use of CINDs in practice; it is oftennecessary to reason about them. The most important static analysis issue concernsconsistency; to determine whether or not a given set of CINDs has conflicts. Another issueconcerns implication; ie; deciding whether a set of CINDs entails another CIND. We give afull treatment of the static analyses of CINDs; and show that CINDs retain most niceproperties of traditional INDs:(a) CINDs are always consistent;(b) CINDs are finitelyaxiomatizable; ie; there exists a sound and complete inference system for implication of …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,114
Adding regular expressions to graph reachability and pattern queries,Wenfei Fan; Jianzhong Li; Shuai Ma; Nan Tang; Yinghui Wu,It is increasingly common to find graphs in which edges bear different types; indicating avariety of relationships. For such graphs we propose a class of reachability queries and aclass of graph patterns; in which an edge is specified with a regular expression of a certainform; expressing the connectivity in a data graph via edges of various types. In addition; wedefine graph pattern matching based on a revised notion of graph simulation. On graphs inemerging applications such as social networks; we show that these queries are capable offinding more sensible information than their traditional counterparts. Better still; theirincreased expressive power does not come with extra complexity. Indeed;(1) we investigatetheir containment and minimization problems; and show that these fundamental problemsare in quadratic time for reachability queries and are in cubic time for pattern queries.(2) …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,112
Query preserving graph compression,Wenfei Fan; Jianzhong Li; Xin Wang; Yinghui Wu,Abstract It is common to find graphs with millions of nodes and billions of edges in; eg; socialnetworks. Queries on such graphs are often prohibitively expensive. These motivate us topropose query preserving graph compression; to compress graphs relative to a class Λ ofqueries of users' choice. We compute a small G r from a graph G such that (a) for any queryQ Ε Λ Q; Q (G)= Q'(G r); where Q'Ε Λ can be efficiently computed from Q; and (b) anyalgorithm for computing Q (G) can be directly applied to evaluating Q'on G r as is. That is;while we cannot lower the complexity of evaluating graph queries; we reduce data graphswhile preserving the answers to all the queries in Λ. To verify the effectiveness of thisapproach;(1) we develop compression strategies for two classes of queries: reachability andgraph pattern queries via (bounded) simulation. We show that graphs can be efficiently …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,110
Interaction between record matching and data repairing,Wenfei Fan; Shuai Ma; Nan Tang; Wenyuan Yu,Abstract Central to a data cleaning system are record matching and data repairing. Matchingaims to identify tuples that refer to the same real-world object; and repairing is to make adatabase consistent by fixing errors in the data by using integrity constraints. These aretypically treated as separate processes in current data cleaning systems; based on heuristicsolutions. This article studies a new problem in connection with data cleaning; namely theinteraction between record matching and data repairing. We show that repairing caneffectively help us identify matches; and vice versa. To capture the interaction; we provide auniform framework that seamlessly unifies repairing and matching operations to clean adatabase based on integrity constraints; matching rules; and master data. We give a fulltreatment of fundamental problems associated with data cleaning via matching and …,Journal of Data and Information Quality (JDIQ),2014,107
Propagating XML constraints to relations,Susan Davidson; Wenfei Fan; Carmem Hara,Abstract We present a technique for refining the design of relational storage for XML data.The technique is based on XML key propagation: given a set of keys on XML data and amapping (transformation) from the XML data to relations; what functional dependencies musthold on the relations produced by the mapping? With the functional dependencies one canthen convert the relational design into; eg 3NF; BCNF; and thus develop efficient relationalstorage for XML data. We provide several algorithms for computing XML key propagation.One algorithm is to check whether a functional dependency is propagated from a set of XMLkeys via a predefined mapping; this allows one to determine whether or not the relationaldesign is in a normal form. The others are to compute a minimum cover for all functionaldependencies that are propagated from a set of XML keys and hold on a universal …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2007,107
XML Constraints: Specification; Analysis; and Applications.,Wenfei Fan,XML data [11]; just like traditional databases; may be specified by both type constraints and integrityconstraints. XML Schema [31]; for example; supports types and integrity constraints (eg; keysand foreign keys). The distinction be- tween types and integrity constraints is rather arbitrary[14]. A “type” in XML; such as a DTD [11] considered as an ex- tended context-free grammar;typically means a restriction on the element structure of a document; and does not relate datavalues across elements. The term “integrity constraint” in XML is often used to mean extensionsof relational in- tegrity constraints such as keys; foreign keys; and func- tional dependencies;which depend primarily on the equal- ity of data values. We follow this convention and focuson integrity constraints for XML; subsequently referred to as XML constraints in this paper. Therehas also been a host of work on XML types and typechecking (see; eg; [3; 25; 32]) …,DEXA Workshops,2005,102
On verifying consistency of XML specifications,Marcelo Arenas; Wenfei Fan; Leonid Libkin,Abstract XML specifications often consist of a type definition (typically; a DTD) and a set ofintegrity constraints. It has been shown previously that such specifications can beinconsistent; and thus it is often desirable to check consistency at compile-time. It is knownthat for general keys and foreign keys; and DTDs; the consistency problem is undecidable;however; it becomes NP-complete when all keys are one-attribute (unary); and tractable; ifno foreign keys are used. In this paper; we consider a variety of constraints for XML data;and study the complexity of the consistency problem. Our main conclusion is that in thepresence of foreign keys; compile-time verification of consistency is usually infeasible. Welook at two types of constraints: absolute (that hold in the entire document); and relative (thatonly hold in a part of the document). For absolute constraints; we extend earlier …,Proceedings of the twenty-first ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2002,94
Tree pattern aggregation for scalable XML data dissemination,Chee-Yong Chan; Wenfei Fan; Pascal Felber; Minos Garofalakis; Rajeev Rastogi,Summary With the rapid growth of XML-document traffic on the Internet; scalable content-based dissemination of XML documents to a large; dynamic group of consumers hasbecome an important research challenge. To indicate the type of content that they areinterested in; data consumers typically specify their subscriptions using some XML patternspecification language (eg; XPath). Given the large volume of subscribers; system scalabilityand efficiency mandate the ability to aggregate the set of consumer subscriptions to asmaller set of content specifications; so as to both reduce their storage-space requirementsas well as speed up the document-subscription matching process. In this paper; we providethe first systematic study of subscription aggregation where subscriptions are specified withtree patterns (an important subclass of XPath expressions). The main challenge is to …,*,2002,92
Graph pattern matching revised for social network analysis,Wenfei Fan,Abstract Graph pattern matching is fundamental to social network analysis. Traditionaltechniques are subgraph isomorphism and graph simulation. However; these notions oftenimpose too strong a topological constraint on graphs to find meaningful matches. Worse still;graphs in the real world are typically large; with millions of nodes and billions of edges. It isoften prohibitively expensive to compute matches in such graphs. With these comes theneed for revising the notions of graph pattern matching and for developing techniques ofquerying large graphs; to effectively and efficiently identify social communities or groups.This paper aims to provide an overview of recent advances in the study of graph patternmatching in social networks.(1) We present several revisions of the traditional notions ofgraph pattern matching to find sensible matches in social networks.(2) We provide …,Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Database Theory,2012,90
Capturing topology in graph pattern matching,Shuai Ma; Yang Cao; Wenfei Fan; Jinpeng Huai; Tianyu Wo,Abstract Graph pattern matching is often defined in terms of subgraph isomorphism; an np-complete problem. To lower its complexity; various extensions of graph simulation havebeen considered instead. These extensions allow pattern matching to be conducted in cubic-time. However; they fall short of capturing the topology of data graphs; ie; graphs may have astructure drastically different from pattern graphs they match; and the matches found areoften too large to understand and analyze. To rectify these problems; this paper proposes anotion of strong simulation; a revision of graph simulation; for graph pattern matching.(1) Weidentify a set of criteria for preserving the topology of graphs matched. We show that strongsimulation preserves the topology of data graphs and finds a bounded number ofmatches.(2) We show that strong simulation retains the same complexity as earlier …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,90
Graph homomorphism revisited for graph matching,Wenfei Fan; Jianzhong Li; Shuai Ma; Hongzhi Wang; Yinghui Wu,Abstract In a variety of emerging applications one needs to decide whether a graph Gmatches another G p; ie; whether G has a topological structure similar to that of G p. Thetraditional notions of graph homomorphism and isomorphism often fall short of capturing thestructural similarity in these applications. This paper studies revisions of these notions;providing a full treatment from complexity to algorithms.(1) We propose p-homomorphism (p-hom) and 1-1 p-hom; which extend graph homomorphism and subgraph isomorphism;respectively; by mapping edges from one graph to paths in another; and by measuring thesimilarity of nodes.(2) We introduce metrics to measure graph similarity; and severaloptimization problems for p-hom and 1-1 p-hom.(3) We show that the decision problems forp-hom and 1-1 p-hom are NP-complete even for DAGs; and that the optimization …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,89
Putting context into schema matching,Philip Bohannon; Eiman Elnahrawy; Wenfei Fan; Michael Flaster,Abstract Attribute-level schema matching has proven to be an important first step indeveloping mappings for data exchange; integration; restructuring and schema evolution. Inthis paper we investigate contextual schema matching; in which selection conditions areassociated with matches by the schema matching process in order to improve overall matchquality. We define a general space of matching techniques; and within this framework weidentify a variety of novel; concrete algorithms for contextual schema matching. Furthermore;we show how common schema mapping techniques can be generalized to take moreeffective advantage of contextual matches; enabling automatic construction of mappingsacross certain forms of schema heterogeneity. An experimental study examines a widevariety of quality and performance issues. In addition; it demonstrates that contextual …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,89
Rewriting regular XPath queries on XML views,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Xibei Jia; Anastasios Kementsietsidis,We study the problem of answering queries posed on virtual views of XML documents; aproblem commonly encountered when enforcing XML access control and integrating data.We approach the problem by rewriting queries on views into equivalent queries on theunderlying document; and thus avoid the overhead of view materialization andmaintenance. We consider possibly recursively defined XML views and study the rewriting ofboth XPath and regular XPath queries. We show that while rewriting is not always possiblefor XPath over recursive views; it is for regular XPath; however; the rewritten query may be ofexponential size. To avoid this prohibitive cost we propose a rewriting algorithm thatcharacterizes rewritten queries as a new form of automata; and an efficient algorithm toevaluate the automaton-represented queries. These allow us to answer queries on views …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007. IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,88
DTD-directed publishing with attribute translation grammars,Michael Benedikt; Chee Yong Chan; Wenfei Fan; Rajeev Rastogi; Shihui Zheng; Aoying Zhou,This chapter presents formalism and ATGs; for publishing relational data in XML with respectto a predefined DTD; and gives efficient algorithms for evaluating ATGs. There are keydifferences between ATGs and traditional attribute grammars. A traditional AG is definedwith a context free grammar and more complicated attributes (synthesized and inherited). Ittakes a string as an input; parses the string with the grammar; and computes attributes. Incontrast; it is not possible to “parse” a relational database with a DTD; thus; an ATG extractsrelevant data from the database via queries; and then constructs a parse tree of the DTDusing the data. There have also been applications of AGs to databases; for example; forconstructing query automata and for querying text files. These are mild variations oftraditional AGs and are quite different from ATGs.DTD-Directed Publishing with Attribute …,*,2002,77
Capturing both types and constraints in data integration,Michael Benedikt; Chee-Yong Chan; Wenfei Fan; Juliana Freire; Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract We propose a framework for integrating data from multiple relational sources intoan XML document that both conforms to a given DTD and satisfies predefined XMLconstraints. The framework is based on a specification language; AIG; that extends a DTD by(1) associating element types with semantic attributes (inherited and synthesized; inspiredby the corresponding notions from Attribute Grammars);(2) computing these attributes viaparameterized SQL queries over multiple data sources; and (3) incorporating XML keys andinclusion constraints. The novelty of AIG consists in semantic attributes and theirdependency relations for controlling context-dependent; DTD-directed construction of XMLdocuments; as well as for checking XML constraints in parallel with document-generation.We also present cost-based optimization techniques for efficiently evaluating AIGs …,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2003,74
What’s hard about xml schema constraints?,Marcelo Arenas; Wenfei Fan; Leonid Libkin,Abstract Data description for XML usually comes in the form of a type specification (eg; aDTD) together with integrity constraints. XML Schema allows one to mix DTD features withsemantic information; such as keys and foreign keys. It was shown recently [[2];[7]] that theinteraction of DTDs with constraints may be rather nontrivial. In particular; testing if a generalspecification is consistent is undecidable; but for the most common case of single-attributeconstraints it is NP-complete; and linear time if no foreign keys are present. However; XMLSchema design did not adopt the form of constraints prevalent in the database literature; andslightly changed the semantics of keys; foreign keys; and unique constraints. In this paperwe demonstrate the very costly effect of this slight change on the feasibility of consistencychecking. In particular; all the known hardness results extend to the XML Schema case …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2002,74
Using partial evaluation in distributed query evaluation,Peter Buneman; Gao Cong; Wenfei Fan; Anastasios Kementsietsidis,Abstract A basic idea in parallel query processing is that one is prepared to do morecomputation than strictly necessary at individual sites in order to reduce the elapsed time;the network traffic; or both in the evaluation of the query. We develop this idea for theevaluation of boolean XPath queries over a tree that is fragmented; both horizontally andvertically over a number of sites. The key idea is to send the whole query to each site whichpartially evaluates; in parallel; the query and sends the results as compact boolean functionsto a coordinator which combines these to obtain the result. This approach has severaladvantages. First; each site is visited only once; even if several fragments of the tree arestored at that site. Second; no prior constraints on how the tree is decomposed are needed;nor is any structural information about the tree required; such as a DTD. Third; there is a …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,71
Determining the currency of data,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Jef Wijsen,Abstract Data in real-life databases become obsolete rapidly. One often finds that multiplevalues of the same entity reside in a database. While all of these values were once correct;most of them may have become stale and inaccurate. Worse still; the values often do notcarry reliable timestamps. With this comes the need for studying data currency; to identify thecurrent value of an entity in a database and to answer queries with the current values; in theabsence of reliable timestamps. This article investigates the currency of data.(1) We proposea model that specifies partial currency orders in terms of simple constraints. The model alsoallows us to express what values are copied from other data sources; bearing currencyorders in those sources; in terms of copy functions defined on correlated attributes.(2) Westudy fundamental problems for data currency; to determine whether a specification is …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2012,69
Vectorizing and querying large XML repositories,Peter Buneman; Byron Choi; Wenfei Fan; Robert Hutchison; Robert Mann; Stratis D Viglas,Vertical partitioning is a well-known technique for optimizing query performance in relationaldatabases. An extreme form of this technique; which we call vectorization; is to store eachcolumn separately. We use a generalization of vectorization as the basis for a native XMLstore. The idea is to decompose an XML document into a set of vectors that contain the datavalues and a compressed skeleton that describes the structure. In order to query thisrepresentation and produce results in the same vectorized format; we consider a practicalfragment of XQuery and introduce the notion of query graphs and a novel graph reductionalgorithm that allows us to leverage relational optimization techniques as well as to reducethe unnecessary loading of data vectors and decompression of skeletons. A preliminaryexperimental study based on some scientific and synthetic XML data repositories in the …,Data Engineering; 2005. ICDE 2005. Proceedings. 21st International Conference on,2005,68
Path constraints in semistructured databases,Peter Buneman; Wenfei Fan; Scott Weinstein,Abstract We investigate a class of path constraints that is of interest in connection with bothsemistructured and structured data. In standard database systems; constraints are typicallyexpressed as part of the schema; but in semistructured data there is no explicit schema andpath constraints provide a natural alternative. As with structured data; path constraints onsemistructured data express integrity constraints associated with the semantics of data andare important in query optimization. We show that in semistructured databases; despite thesimple syntax of the constraints; their associated implication problem is re complete andfinite implication problem is co-re complete. However; we establish the decidability of theimplication and finite implication problems for several fragments of the path constraintlanguage and demonstrate that these fragments suffice to express important semantic …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2000,68
Increasing the expressivity of conditional functional dependencies without extra complexity,Loreto Bravo; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Shuai Ma,The paper proposes an extension of CFDs [1]; referred to as extended ConditionalFunctional Dependencies (eCFDs). In contrast to CFDs; eCFDs specify patterns ofsemantically related values in terms of disjunction and inequality; and are capable ofcatching inconsistencies that arise in practice but cannot be detected by CFDs. The increasein expressive power does not incur extra complexity: we show that the satisfiability andimplication analyses of eCFDs remain NP-complete and coNP-complete; respectively; thesame as their CFDs counterparts. In light of the intractability; we present an algorithm thatapproximates the maximum number of eCFDs that are satisfiable. In addition; we revise SQLtechniques for detecting CFD violations; and show that violations of multiple eCFDs can becaptured via a single pair of SQL queries. We also introduce an incremental SQL …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,63
A unified constraint model for XML,Wenfei Fan; Gabriel M Kuper; Jérôme Siméon,ABSTRACT Integrity constraints are an essential part of modern schema definitionlanguages. They are useful for semantic specification; update consistency control; queryoptimization; information preservation; etc. In this paper; we propose UCM; a model ofintegrity constraints for XML that is both simple and expressive. Because it relies on a singlenotion of keys and foreign keys; the UCM model is easy to use and makes formal reasoningpossible. Because it relies on a powerful type system; the UCM model is expressive;capturing in a single framework the constraints found in relational databases; objectorientedschemas and XML DTDs. We study the problem of consistency of UCM constraints; theinteraction between constraints and subtyping; and algorithms for implementing theseconstraints.,Proceedings of the 10th international conference on World Wide Web,2001,61
Dynamic constraints for record matching,Wenfei Fan; Hong Gao; Xibei Jia; Jianzhong Li; Shuai Ma,Abstract This paper investigates constraints for matching records from unreliable datasources.(a) We introduce a class of matching dependencies (mds) for specifying thesemantics of unreliable data. As opposed to static constraints for schema design; mds aredeveloped for record matching; and are defined in terms of similarity predicates and adynamic semantics.(b) We identify a special case of mds; referred to as relative candidatekeys (rcks); to determine what attributes to compare and how to compare them whenmatching records across possibly different relations.(c) We propose a mechanism forinferring mds; a departure from traditional implication analysis; such that when we cannotmatch records by comparing attributes that contain errors; we may still find matches by usingother; more reliable attributes. Moreover; we develop a sound and complete system for …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2011,59
Distributed query evaluation with performance guarantees,Gao Cong; Wenfei Fan; Anastasios Kementsietsidis,Abstract Partial evaluation has recently proven an effective technique for evaluating BooleanXPath queries over a fragmented tree that is distributed over a number of sites. What leftopen is whether or not the technique is applicable to generic data-selecting XPath queries.In contrast to Boolean queries that return a single truth value; a generic XPath query returnsa set of elements; and its evaluation introduces difficulties to avoiding excessive datashipping. This paper settles this question in positive by providing evaluation algorithms andoptimizations for generic XPath queries in the same distributed and fragmented setting.These algorithms explore parallelism and retain the performance guarantees of theircounterpart for Boolean queries; regardless of how the tree is fragmented and distributed.First; each site is visited at most three times; and down to at most twice when …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,55
Interaction between path and type constraints,Peter Buneman; Wenfie Fan; Scott Weinstein,Abstract XML [7]; which is emerging as an important standard for data exchange on theWorld-Wide Web; highlights the importance of semistructured data. Although the XMLstandard itself does not: require any schema or type system; a number of proposals [6; 17;191 have been developed that roughly correspond to data definition languages. Theseallow one to constrain t. he structure of XML data by imposing a schema on it. These andother proposals also advocate the need for integrity co: nstraints; another form of constraintsthat should; for example; be capable of expressing inclusion constraints and inverserelationships. The latter have recently been studiedi as path constraints in the context ofsemistructured data [4; 91. It is likely that future XML proposals will involve both forms ofconstraints; and it is therefore appropriate to understand the interaction between them …,Proceedings of the eighteenth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1999,54

Satisfiability of XPath queries with sibling axes,Floris Geerts; Wenfei Fan,Abstract We study the satisfiability problem for XPath fragments supporting the following-sibling and preceding-sibling axes. Although this problem was recently studied for XPathfragments without sibling axes; little is known about the impact of the sibling axes on thesatisfiability analysis. To this end we revisit the satisfiability problem for a variety of XPathfragments with sibling axes; in the presence of DTDs; in the absence of DTDs; and undervarious restricted DTDs. In these settings we establish complexity bounds ranging fromNLOGSPACE to undecidable. Our main conclusion is that in many cases; the presence ofsibling axes complicates the satisfiability analysis. Indeed; we show that there are XPathsatisfiability problems that are in PTIME and PSPACE in the absence of sibling axes; but thatbecome NP-hard and EXPTIME-hard; respectively; when sibling axes are used instead of …,International Workshop on Database Programming Languages,2005,53
On the complexity of verifying consistency of XML specifications,Marcelo Arenas; Wenfei Fan; Leonid Libkin,XML specifications often consist of a type definition (typically; a document type definition(DTD)) and a set of integrity constraints. It has been shown previously that suchspecifications can be inconsistent; and thus it is often desirable to check consistency atcompile time. It is known [W. Fan and L. Libkin; J. ACM; 49 (2002); pp. 368–406] that forgeneral keys; foreign keys; and DTDs the consistency problem is undecidable; however; itbecomes NP-complete when all keys are one-attribute (unary) and tractable; if no foreignkeys are used. In this paper; we consider a variety of previously studied constraints for XMLdata and investigate the complexity of the consistency problem. Our main conclusion is that;in the presence of foreign key constraints; compile-time verification of consistency isinfeasible. We look at absolute constraints that hold in the entire document and relative …,SIAM Journal on Computing,2008,52
Diversified top-k graph pattern matching,Wenfei Fan; Xin Wang; Yinghui Wu,Abstract Graph pattern matching has been widely used in eg; social data analysis. A numberof matching algorithms have been developed that; given a graph pattern Q and a graph G;compute the set M (Q; G) of matches of Q in G. However; these algorithms often return anexcessive number of matches; and are expensive on large real-life social graphs. Moreover;in practice many social queries are to find matches of a specific pattern node; rather than theentire M (Q; G). This paper studies top-k graph pattern matching.(1) We revise graph patternmatching defined in terms of simulation; by supporting a designated output node u o. GivenG and Q; it is to find those nodes in M (Q; G) that match uo; instead of the large set M (Q;G).(2) We study two classes of functions for ranking the matches: relevance functions δ r ()based on; eg; social impact; and distance functions δ d () to cover diverse elements.(3) …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,48

Data quality: From theory to practice,Wenfei Fan,Abstract Data quantity and data quality; like two sides of a coin; are equally important to datamanagement.

Taming XPath queries by minimizing wildcard steps,Chee-Yong Chan; Wenfei Fan; Yiming Zeng,Abstract This paper presents a novel and complementary technique to optimize an XPathquery by minimizing its wildcard steps. Our approach is based on using a general compositeaxis called the layer axis; to rewrite a sequence of XPath steps (all of which are wildcardsteps except for possibly the last) into a single layer-axis step. We describe an efficientimplementation of the layer axis and present a novel and efficient rewriting algorithm tominimize both non-branching as well as branching wildcard steps in XPath queries. We alsodemonstrate the usefulness of wildcard-step elimination by proposing an optimizedevaluation strategy for wildcard-free XPath queries that enables selective loading of only therelevant input XML data for query evaluation. Our experimental results not only validate thescalability and efficiency of our optimized evaluation strategy; but also demonstrate the …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,46
Detecting inconsistencies in distributed data,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Shuai Ma; Heiko Müller,One of the central problems for data quality is inconsistency detection. Given a database Dand a set¿ of dependencies as data quality rules; we want to identify tuples in D that violatesome rules in¿. When D is a centralized database; there have been effective SQL-basedtechniques for finding violations. It is; however; far more challenging when data in D isdistributed; in which inconsistency detection often necessarily requires shipping data fromone site to another. This paper develops techniques for detecting violations of conditionalfunctional dependencies (CFDs) in relations that are fragmented and distributed acrossdifferent sites.(1) We formulate the detection problem in various distributed settings asoptimization problems; measured by either network traffic or response time.(2) We show thatit is beyond reach in practice to find optimal detection methods: the detection problem is …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,45
Incremental detection of inconsistencies in distributed data,Wenfei Fan; Jianzhong Li; Nan Tang,This paper investigates incremental detection of errors in distributed data. Given adistributed database D; a set Σ of conditional functional dependencies (CFDs); the set V ofviolations of the CFDs in D; and updates ΔD to D; it is to find; with minimum data shipment;changes ΔV to V in response to ΔD. The need for the study is evident since real-life data isoften dirty; distributed and frequently updated. It is often prohibitively expensive torecompute the entire set of violations when D is updated. We show that the incrementaldetection problem is NP-complete for database D that is partitioned either vertically orhorizontally; even when Σ and D are fixed. Nevertheless; we show that it is bounded: thereexist algorithms to detect errors such that their computational cost and data shipment areboth linear in the size of ΔD and ΔV; independent of the size of the database D.

A revival of integrity constraints for data cleaning,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Xibei Jia,Abstract Integrity constraints; aka. data dependencies; are being widely used for improvingthe quality of schema.

Annotation propagation revisited for key preserving views,Gao Cong; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts,Abstract This paper revisits the analysis of annotation propagation from source databases toviews defined in terms of conjunctive (SPJ) queries. Given a source database D; an SPJquery Q; the view Q (D) and a tuple ΔV in the view; the view (resp. source) side-effectproblem is to find a minimal set ΔD of tuples such that the deletion of ΔD from D results in thedeletion of ΔV from Q (D) while minimizing the side effects on the view (resp. the source). Athird problem; referred to as the annotation placement problem; is to find a single base tupleΔD such that annotation in a field of ΔD propagates to ΔV while minimizing the propagationto other fields in the view Q (D). These are important for data provenance and themanagement of view updates. However important; these problems are unfortunately NP-hard for most subclasses of SPJ views [5].

Propagating functional dependencies with conditions,Wenfei Fan; Shuai Ma; Yanli Hu; Jie Liu; Yinghui Wu,Abstract The dependency propagation problem is to determine; given a view defined ondata sources and a set of dependencies on the sources; whether another dependency isguaranteed to hold on the view. This paper investigates dependency propagation forrecently proposed conditional functional dependencies (CFDs). The need for this study isevident in data integration; exchange and cleaning since dependencies on data sourcesoften only hold conditionally on the view. We investigate dependency propagation for viewsdefined in various fragments of relational algebra; CFDs as view dependencies; and forsource dependencies given as either CFDs or traditional functional dependencies (FDs).(a)We establish lower and upper bounds; all matching; ranging from PTIME to undecidable.These not only provide the first results for CFD propagation; but also extend the classical …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,43
Relative information completeness,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts,Abstract This article investigates the question of whether a partially closed database hascomplete information to answer a query. In practice an enterprise often maintains masterdata D m; a closed-world database. We say that a database D is partially closed if it satisfiesa set V of containment constraints of the form q (D) &subse; p (D m); where q is a query in alanguage LC and p is a projection query. The part of D not constrained by (D m; V) is open;from which some tuples may be missing. The database D is said to be complete for a queryQ relative to (D m; V) if for all partially closed extensions D'of D; Q (D') &equals; Q (D); ie;adding tuples to D either violates some constraints in V or does not change the answer to Q.We first show that the proposed model can also capture the consistency of data; in additionto its relative completeness. Indeed; integrity constraints studied for data consistency can …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2010,42
Query optimization for semistructured data using path constraints in a deterministic data model,Peter Buneman; Wenfei Fan; Scott Weinstein,Abstract Path constraints have been studied for semistructured data modeled as a rootededge-labeled directed graph [4];[11]-[13]. In this model; the implication problems associatedwith many natural path constraints are undecidable [11];[13]. A variant of the graph model;called the deter-ministic data model; was recently proposed in [10]. In this model; data isrepresented as a graph with deterministic edge relations; ie; the edges emanating from anynode in the graph have distinct labels. This model is more appropriate for representing; eg;ACeDB [27] databases and Web sites. This paper investigates path constraints for thedeterministic data model. It demonstrates the application of path constraints to; amongothers; query optimization. Three classes of path constraints are consid-ered: the languageP c introduced in [11]; an extension of P c; denoted by P cw; by including wildcards in …,International Symposium on Database Programming Languages,1999,42
Semandaq: a data quality system based on conditional functional dependencies,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Xibei Jia,Abstract We present Semandaq; a prototype system for improving the quality of relationaldata. Based on the recently proposed conditional functional dependencies (CFDs); it detectsand repairs errors and inconsistencies that emerge as violations of these constraints. Wedemonstrate the following functionalities supported by Semandaq:(a) an interface forspecifying CFDs;(b) a visual tool for automated detection of CFD violations in relational data;leveraging efficient SQL-based techniques;(c) extensive visual data exploration capabilitiesthat provide the user with various measures of the quality of the data;(d) repair (cleaning)functionality without excess human interaction; built upon CFD-based cleaning algorithms;we show how Semandaq allows for a natural exploration of the quality of the obtainedrepairs.

Capturing missing tuples and missing values,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts,Abstract Databases in real life are often neither entirely closed-world nor entirely open-world. Indeed; databases in an enterprise are typically partially closed; in which a part of thedata is constrained by master data that contains complete information about the enterprise incertain aspects [21]. It has been shown that despite missing tuples; such a database mayturn out to have complete information for answering a query [9]. This paper studies partiallyclosed databases from which both tuples and values may be missing. We specify such adatabase in terms of conditional tables constrained by master data; referred to as c-instances. We first propose three models to characterize whether a c-instance T is completefor a query Q relative to master data. That is; depending on how missing values in T areinstantiated; the answer to Q in T remains unchanged when new tuples are added.

Query translation from XPath to SQL in the presence of recursive DTDs,Wenfei Fan; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Hongjun Lu; Jianhua Lu; Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract The interaction between recursion in XPATH and recursion in DTDS makes itchallenging to answer XPATH queries on XML data that is stored in an RDBMS via schema-based shredding. We present a new approach to translating XPATH queries into SQLqueries with a simple least fixpoint (LFP) operator; which is already supported by mostcommercial RDBMS. The approach is based on our algorithm for rewriting XPATH queriesinto regular XPATH expressions; which are capable of capturing both DTD recursion andXPATH queries in a uniform framework. Furthermore; we provide an algorithm for translatingregular XPATH queries to SQL queries with LFP; and optimization techniques for minimizingthe use of the LFP operator. The novelty of our approach consists in its capability to answera large class of XPATH queries by means of only low-end RDBMS features already …,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,37
Performance guarantees for distributed reachability queries,Wenfei Fan; Xin Wang; Yinghui Wu,Abstract In the real world a graph is often fragmented and distributed across different sites.This highlights the need for evaluating queries on distributed graphs. This paper proposesdistributed evaluation algorithms for three classes of queries: reachability for determiningwhether one node can reach another; bounded reachability for deciding whether thereexists a path of a bounded length between a pair of nodes; and regular reachability forchecking whether there exists a path connecting two nodes such that the node labels on thepath form a string in a given regular expression. We develop these algorithms based onpartial evaluation; to explore parallel computation. When evaluating a query Q on adistributed graph G; we show that these algorithms possess the following performanceguarantees; no matter how G is fragmented and distributed:(1) each site is visited only …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,35
Incremental evaluation of schema-directed XML publishing,Philip Bohannon; Byron Choi; Wenfei Fan,Abstract When large XML documents published from a database are maintained externally;it is inefficient to repeatedly recompute them when the database is updated. Vastlypreferable is incremental update; as common for views stored in a data warehouse.However; to support schema-directed publishing; there may be no simple query that definesthe mapping from the database to the external document. To meet the need for efficientincremental update; this paper studies two approaches for incremental evaluation of ATGs[4]; a formalism for schema-directed XML publishing. The reduction approach seeks to pushas much work as possible to the underlying DBMS. It is based on a relational encoding ofXML trees and a nontrivial translation of ATGs to SQL 99 queries with recursion. However; aweakness of this approach is that it relies on high-end DBMS features rather than the …,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2004,35
Determining the relative accuracy of attributes,Yang Cao; Wenfei Fan; Wenyuan Yu,Abstract The relative accuracy problem is to determine; given tuples t 1 and t 2 that refer tothe same entity e; whether t 1 [A] is more accurate than t 2 A; ie; t 1 A is closer to the truevalue of the A attribute of e than t 2 A. This has been a longstanding issue for data quality;and is challenging when the true values of e are unknown. This paper proposes a model fordetermining relative accuracy.(1) We introduce a class of accuracy rules and an inferencesystem with a chase procedure; to deduce relative accuracy.(2) We identify and studyseveral fundamental problems for relative accuracy. Given a set I e of tuples pertaining to thesame entity e and a set of accuracy rules; these problems are to decide whether the chaseprocess terminates; is Church-Rosser; and leads to a unique target tuple te composed of themost accurate values from I e for all the attributes of e.(3) We propose a framework for …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,34
Complexity and composition of synthesized web services,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Wouter Gelade; Frank Neven; Antonella Poggi,Abstract The paper investigates fundamental decision problems and composition synthesisfor Web services commonly found in practice. We propose a notion of synthesized Webservices (ASTs) to specify the behaviors of the services. Upon receiving a sequence of inputmessages; an AST issues multiple queries to a database and generates actions; in parallel;it produces external messages and database updates by synthesizing the actions parallellygenerated. In contrast to previous models for Web services; ASTs advocate parallelprocessing and (deterministic) synthesis of actions. We classify ASTs based on what queriesan AST can issue; how the synthesis of actions is expressed; and whether unbounded inputsequences are allowed in a single interaction session. We show that the behaviors of Webservices supported by various prior models; data-driven or not; can be specified by …,Proceedings of the twenty-seventh ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2008,34
Distributed graph simulation: Impossibility and possibility,Wenfei Fan; Xin Wang; Yinghui Wu; Dong Deng,Abstract This paper studies fundamental problems for distributed graph simulation. Given apattern query Q and a graph G that is fragmented and distributed; a graph simulationalgorithm A is to compute the matches Q (G) of Q in G. We say that A is parallel scalable in(a) response time if its parallel computational cost is determined by the largest fragment F mof G and the size| Q| of query Q; and (b) data shipment if its total amount of data shipped isdetermined by| Q| and the number of fragments of G; independent of the size of graph G.(1)We prove an impossibility theorem: there exists no distributed graph simulation algorithmthat is parallel scalable in either response time or data shipment.(2) However; we show thatdistributed graph simulation is partition bounded; ie; its response time depends only on| Q|;|F m| and the number| V f| of nodes in G with edges across different fragments; and its data …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,33
Inferring data currency and consistency for conflict resolution,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Nan Tang; Wenyuan Yu,This paper introduces a new approach for conflict resolution: given a set of tuples pertainingto the same entity; it is to identify a single tuple in which each attribute has the latest andconsistent value in the set. This problem is important in data integration; data cleaning andquery answering. It is; however; challenging since in practice; reliable timestamps are oftenabsent; among other things. We propose a model for conflict resolution; by specifying datacurrency in terms of partial currency orders and currency constraints; and by enforcing dataconsistency with constant conditional functional dependencies. We show that identifyingdata currency orders helps us repair inconsistent data; and vice versa. We investigate anumber of fundamental problems associated with conflict resolution; and establish theircomplexity. In addition; we introduce a framework and develop algorithms for conflict …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,33
SMOQE: A system for providing secure access to XML,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Xibei Jia; Anastasios Kementsietsidis,Abstract XML views have been widely used to enforce access control; support dataintegration; and speed up query answering. In many applications; eg; XML securityenforcement; it is prohibitively expensive to materialize and maintain a large number ofviews. Therefore; views are necessarily virtual. An immediate question then is how toanswer queries on XML virtual views. A common approach is to rewrite a query on the viewto an equivalent one on the underlying document; and evaluate the rewritten query. This isthe approach used in the Secure MOdular Query Engine (SMOQE). The demo presentsSMOQE; the first system to provide efficient support for answering queries over virtual andpossibly recursively defined XML views. We demonstrate a set of novel techniques for thespecification of views; the rewriting; evaluation and optimization of XML queries …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,33
On scale independence for querying big data,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Leonid Libkin,Abstract To make query answering feasible in big datasets; practitioners have been lookinginto the notion of scale independence of queries. Intuitively; such queries require only arelatively small subset of the data; whose size is determined by the query and accessmethods rather than the size of the dataset itself. This paper aims to formalize this notion andstudy its properties. We start by defining what it means to be scale-independent; and providematching upper and lower bounds for checking scale independence; for queries in variouslanguages; and for combined and data complexity. Since the complexity turns out to berather high; and since scale-independent queries cannot be captured syntactically; wedevelop sufficient conditions for scale independence. We formulate them based on accessschemas; which combine indexing and constraints together with bounds on the sizes of …,Proceedings of the 33rd ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2014,32
Partial evaluation for distributed XPath query processing and beyond,Gao Cong; Wenfei Fan; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Jianzhong Li; Xianmin Liu,Abstract This article proposes algorithms for evaluating XPath queries over an XML tree thatis partitioned horizontally and vertically; and is distributed across a number of sites. The keyidea is based on partial evaluation: it is to send the whole query to each site that partiallyevaluates the query; in parallel; and sends the results as compact (Boolean) functions to acoordinator that combines these to obtain the result. This approach possesses the followingperformance guarantees. First; each site is visited at most twice for data-selecting XPathqueries; and only once for Boolean XPath queries. Second; the network traffic is determinedby the answer to the query; rather than the size of the tree. Third; the total computation iscomparable to that of centralized algorithms on the tree stored in a single site; regardless ofhow the tree is fragmented and distributed. We also present a MapReduce algorithm for …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2012,31
Strong simulation: Capturing topology in graph pattern matching,Shuai Ma; Yang Cao; Wenfei Fan; Jinpeng Huai; Tianyu Wo,Abstract Graph pattern matching is finding all matches in a data graph for a given patterngraph and is often defined in terms of subgraph isomorphism; an NP-complete problem. Tolower its complexity; various extensions of graph simulation have been considered instead.These extensions allow graph pattern matching to be conducted in cubic time. However;they fall short of capturing the topology of data graphs; that is; graphs may have a structuredrastically different from pattern graphs they match; and the matches found are often toolarge to understand and analyze. To rectify these problems; this article proposes a notion ofstrong simulation; a revision of graph simulation for graph pattern matching.(1) We identify aset of criteria for preserving the topology of graphs matched.

Consistency of XML specifications,Marcelo Arenas; Wenfei Fan; Leonid Libkin,Abstract Specifications of XML documents typically consist of typing information (forexample; a DTD); and integrity constraints (for example; keys and foreign keys). We showthat combining the two may lead to seemingly reasonable specifications that arenevertheless inconsistent: there is no XML document that both conforms to the DTD andsatisfies the constraints. We then survey results on the complexity of consistency checking;and show that; depending on the classes of DTDs and constraints involved; it ranges fromlinear time to undecidable. Furthermore; we show that for some of the most common classesof specifications checking consistency is intractable.,*,2005,30
Querying big graphs within bounded resources,Wenfei Fan; Xin Wang; Yinghui Wu,Abstract This paper studies the problem of querying graphs within bounded resources.Given a query Q; a graph G and a small ratio α; it aims to answer Q in G by accessing only afraction GQ of G of size| GQ|≤ α| G|. The need for this is evident when G is big while ouravailable resources are limited; as indicated by α. We propose resource-bounded queryanswering via a dynamic scheme that reduces big G to G Q. We investigate when we canfind the exact answers Q (G) from GQ; and if GQ cannot accommodate enough information;how accurate the approximate answers Q (GQ) are. To verify the effectiveness of theapproach; we study two types of queries. One consists of pattern queries that have datalocality; such as subgraph isomorphism and strong simulation. The other is the class ofreachability queries; without data locality. We show that it is hard to get resource-bounded …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,29
On the complexity of view update analysis and its application to annotation propagation,Gao Cong; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Jianzhong Li; Jizhou Luo,This paper investigates three problems identified in [1] for annotation propagation; namely;the view side-effect; source side-effect; and annotation placement problems. Givenannotations entered for a tuple or an attribute in a view; these problems ask what tuples orattributes in the source have to be annotated to produce the view annotations. As observedin [1]; these problems are fundamental not only for data provenance but also for themanagement of view updates. For an annotation attached to a single existing tuple in a view;it has been shown that these problems are often intractable even for views defined in termsof simple SPJU queries [1]. We revisit these problems by considering severaldichotomies:(1) views defined in various subclasses of SPJU; versus SPJU views under apractical key preserving condition;(2) annotations attached to existing tuples in a view …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,28
Answering graph pattern queries using views,Wenfei Fan; Xin Wang; Yinghui Wu,Answering queries using views has proven an effective technique for querying relationaland semistructured data. This paper investigates this issue for graph pattern queries basedon (bounded) simulation; which have been increasingly used in; eg; social network analysis.We propose a notion of pattern containment to characterize graph pattern matching usinggraph pattern views. We show that a graph pattern query can be answered using a set ofviews if and only if the query is contained in the views. Based on this characterization wedevelop efficient algorithms to answer graph pattern queries. In addition; we identify threeproblems associated with graph pattern containment. We show that these problems rangefrom quadratic-time to NP-complete; and provide efficient algorithms for containmentchecking (approximation when the problem is intractable).

Making queries tractable on big data with preprocessing: through the eyes of complexity theory,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Frank Neven,Abstract A query class is traditionally considered tractable if there exists a polynomial-time(PTIME) algorithm to answer its queries. When it comes to big data; however; PTIMEalgorithms often become infeasible in practice. A traditional and effective approach to copingwith this is to preprocess data off-line; so that queries in the class can be subsequentlyevaluated on the data efficiently. This paper aims to provide a formal foundation for thisapproach in terms of computational complexity.(1) We propose a set of Π-tractable queries;denoted by ΠT Q 0; to characterize classes of queries that can be answered in parallel poly-logarithmic time (NC) after PTIME preprocessing.(2) We show that several natural queryclasses are Π-tractable and are feasible on big data.(3) We also study a set ΠT Q of queryclasses that can be effectively converted to Π-tractable queries by refactorizing its data …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,27
On the complexity of package recommendation problems,Ting Deng; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts,Recommendation systems aim to recommend items that are likely to be of interest to users.This paper investigates several issues fundamental to such systems:(1) We modelrecommendation systems for packages (sets) of items. We use queries to specifymulticriteria for item selections and express compatibility constraints on items in a package;and use functions to compute the cost and usefulness of items to a user.(2) We studyrecommendations of points of interest to suggest top-k packages. We also investigaterecommendations of top-k items as a special case.(3) We identify several problems todecide whether a set of packages makes a top-k recommendation and whether a ratingbound is maximum for selecting top-k packages. We also study function problems forcomputing top-k packages; and counting problems to find how many packages meet the …,SIAM Journal on Computing,2013,26
Composable XML integration grammars,Wenfei Fan; Minos Garofalakis; Ming Xiong; Xibei Jia,Abstract The proliferation of XML as a standard for data representation and exchange indiverse; next-generation Web applications has created an emphatic need for effective XMLdata-integration tools. For several real-life scenarios; such XML data integration needs tobe< i> DTD-directed</i>--in other words; the target; integrated XML database must conformto a prespecified; user-or application-defined DTD.

Conditional dependencies: A principled approach to improving data quality,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Xibei Jia,Abstract Real-life data is often dirty and costs billions of pounds to businesses worldwideeach year. This paper presents a promising approach to improving data quality. It effectivelydetects and fixes inconsistencies in real-life data based on conditional dependencies; anextension of database dependencies by enforcing bindings of semantically related datavalues. It accurately identifies records from unreliable data sources by leveraging relativecandidate keys; an extension of keys for relations by supporting similarity and matchingoperators across relations. In contrast to traditional dependencies that were developed forimproving the quality of schema; the revised constraints are proposed to improve the qualityof data. These constraints yield practical techniques for data repairing and record matchingin a uniform framework.,British National Conference on Databases,2009,24
Analyses and validation of conditional dependencies with built-in predicates,Wenguang Chen; Wenfei Fan; Shuai Ma,Abstract This paper proposes a natural extension of conditional functional dependencies(cfd s 14) and conditional inclusion dependencies (cind s 8); denoted by cfd ps and cind ps;respectively; by specifying patterns of data values with≠;<;≤;> and≥ predicates. As dataquality rules; cfd ps and cind ps are able to capture errors that commonly arise in practicebut cannot be detected by cfd s and cind s. We establish two sets of results for centraltechnical problems associated with cfd ps and cind p s.(a) One concerns the satisfiabilityand implication problems for cfd ps and cind ps; taken separately or together. These areimportant for; eg; deciding whether data quality rules are dirty themselves; and for removingredundant rules. We show that despite the increased expressive power; the static analysesof cfd ps and cind ps retain the same complexity as their cfd s and cind s counterparts.(b) …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2009,23
Updating recursive XML views of relations,Byron Choi; Gao Cong; Wenfei Fan; Stratis D Viglas,This paper investigates the view update problem for XML views published from relationaldata. We consider (possibly) recursively defined XML views; compressed into DAGs andstored in relations. We provide new techniques to efficiently support XML view updatesspecified in terms of XFath expressions with recursion and complex filters. The interactionbetween XFath recursion and DAG compression of XML views makes the analysis of XMLview updates intriguing. Furthermore; many issues are still open even for relational viewupdates; and need to be explored. In response to these; we revise the update semantics toaccommodate XML side effects based on the semantics of XML views; and present efficientalgorithms to translate XML updates to relational view updates. Moreover; we propose amild condition on SPJ views; and show that under this condition the analysis of deletions …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007. IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,22
System and method for XML data integration,*,A framework is provided for integrating data from multiple relational sources into an XMLdocument that both conforms to a given DTD and satisfies predefined XML constraints. Theframework is based on a specification language; designated Attribute Integration Grammar(AIG); that extends a DTD by (1) associating element types with semantic attributes;(2)computing these attributes via parameterized SQL queries over multiple data sources; and(3) incorporating XML keys and inclusion constraints. The AIG uniquely operates onsemantic attributes and their dependency relations for controlling context-dependent; DTD-directed construction of XML documents; and; as well as checks XML constraints in parallelwith document-generation.,*,2005,22
Querying big data by accessing small data,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Yang Cao; Ting Deng; Ping Lu,Abstract This paper investigates the feasibility of querying big data by accessing a boundedamount of the data. We study boundedly evaluable queries under a form of accessconstraints; when their evaluation cost is determined by the queries and constraints only.While it is undecidable to determine whether FO queries are boundedly evaluable; we showthat for several classes of FO queries; the bounded evaluability problem is decidable. Wealso provide characterization and effective syntax for their boundedly evaluable queries.When a query Q is not boundedly evaluable; we study two approaches to approximatelyanswering Q under access constraints.(1) We search for upper and lower envelopes of Qthat are boundedly evaluable and warrant a constant accuracy bound.(2) We instantiate aminimum set of variables (parameters) in Q such that the specialized query is boundedly …,Proceedings of the 34th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems,2015,21
Querying XML with update syntax,Wenfei Fan; Gao Cong; Philip Bohannon,Abstract This paper investigates a class of transform queries proposed by XQuery Update[6]. A transform query is defined in terms of XML update syntax. When posed on an XML treeT; it returns another XML tree that would be produced by executing its embedded update onT; without destructive impact on T. Transform queries support a variety of applicationsincluding XML hypothetical queries; the simulation of updates on virtual views; and theenforcement of XML access control. In light of the wide-range of applications for transformqueries; we develop automaton-based techniques for efficiently evaluating transformqueries and for computing their compositions with user queries in standard XQuery. Weprovide (a) three algorithms to implement transform queries without change to existingXQuery processors;(b) a linear-time algorithm; based on a seamless integration of …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,20
Interaction between path and type constraints,Peter Buneman; Wenfei Fan; Scott Weinstein,Abstract Path constraints are capable of expressing inclusion and inverse relationships andhave proved useful in modeling and querying semistructured data [Abiteboul and Vianu1999; Buneman et al. 2000]. Types also constrain the structure of data and are commonlyfound in traditional databases. There has also been work on imposing structure or a typesystem on semistructured data for storing and querying semistructured data in a traditionaldatabase system [Alon et al. 2001; Deutsch et al. 1999a; Florescu and Kossmann 1999;Shanmugasundaram et al. 1999]. One wants to know whether complexity results forreasoning about path constraints established in the untyped (semistructured) context couldcarry over to traditional databases; and vice versa. It is therefore appropriate to understandthe interaction between types and path constraints. In addition; XML [Bray et al. 1998] …,ACM Transactions on Computational Logic (TOCL),2003,20
Keys with upward wildcards for XML,Wenfei Fan; Peter Schwenzer; Kun Wu,Abstract The paper proposes a key constraint language for XML and investigates itsassociated decision problems. The language is defined in terms of regular path expressionsextended with downward and upward wildcards; which can not only move down XMLdocument trees; but also upwards. In a uniform syntax it is capable of expressing bothabsolute keys and relative keys; which are important to hierarchically structured data. Inaddition; keys defined in the language can be reasoned about efficiently. The paperprovides a sound and complete set of inference rules and a cubic time algorithm fordetermining implication of the keys.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2001,20
Association rules with graph patterns,Wenfei Fan; Xin Wang; Yinghui Wu; Jingbo Xu,Abstract We propose graph-pattern association rules (GPARs) for social media marketing.Extending association rules for item-sets; GPARs help us discover regularities betweenentities in social graphs; and identify potential customers by exploring social influence. Westudy the problem of discovering top-k diversified GPARs. While this problem is NP-hard; wedevelop a parallel algorithm with accuracy bound. We also study the problem of identifyingpotential customers with GPARs. While it is also NP-hard; we provide a parallel scalablealgorithm that guarantees a polynomial speedup over sequential algorithms with theincrease of processors.

Extending inclusion dependencies with conditions,Shuai Ma; Wenfei Fan; Loreto Bravo,Abstract This paper introduces a class of conditional inclusion dependencies (CINDs); whichextends inclusion dependencies (INDs) by enforcing patterns of semantically related datavalues. We show that CINDs are useful not only in data cleaning; but also in contextualschema matching. We give a full treatment of the static analysis of CINDs; and show thatCINDs retain most desired properties of traditional INDs:(a) CINDs are always satisfiable;(b)CINDs are finitely axiomatizable; ie; there exists a sound and complete inference system forthe implication analysis of CINDs; and (c) the implication problem for CINDs has the samecomplexity as its traditional counterpart; namely; PSPACE-complete; in the absence ofattributes with a finite domain; but it is EXPTIME-complete in the general setting. In addition;we investigate the interaction between CINDs and conditional functional dependencies …,Theoretical Computer Science,2014,19
Query translation from XPath to SQL in the presence of recursive DTDs,Wenfei Fan; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Jianzhong Li; Bolin Ding; Lu Qin,Abstract We study the problem of evaluating xp ath queries over xml data that is stored in anrdbms via schema-based shredding. The interaction between recursion (descendants-axis)in xp ath queries and recursion in dtd s makes it challenging to answer xp ath queries usingrdbms. We present a new approach to translating xp ath queries into sql queries based on anotion of extended XP ath expressions and a simple least fixpoint (lfp) operator. Extended xpath expressions are a mild extension of xp ath; and the lfp operator takes a single inputrelation and is already supported by most commercial rdbms. We show that extended xp athexpressions are capable of capturing both dtd recursion and xp ath queries in a uniformframework. Furthermore; they can be translated into an equivalent sequence of sql querieswith the lfp operator. We present algorithms for rewriting xp ath queries over a (possibly …,The VLDB Journal,2009,19
View determinacy for preserving selected information in data transformations,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Lixiao Zheng,Abstract When transforming data one often wants certain information in the data source to bepreserved; ie; we identify parts of the source data and require these parts to be transformedwithout loss of information. We characterize the preservation of selected information in termsof the notions of invertibility and query preservation; in a setting when transformations arespecified as a view V (a set of queries); and source information is selected by a query Q. Weinvestigate the problem for determining whether transformations V preserve the informationselected by Q.(1) We show that the notion of invertibility coincides with view determinacystudied for query rewriting.(2) We establish the undecidability of the problem when either Qor V is in DATALOG or first-order logic; for invertibility and query preservation.(3) When Qand V are conjunctive queries (CQ); the problem is as hard as view determinacy for CQ …,Information Systems,2012,18
TREX: DTD-conforming XML to XML transformations,Aoying Zhou; Qing Wang; Zhimao Guo; Xueqing Gong; Shihui Zheng; Hongwei Wu; Jianchang Xiao; Kun Yue; Wenfei Fan,There have been increasing demands for a system to support DTD-conforming XML to XMLtransformations: given any target DTD D and a source XML document S; extract data from Sand construct a target XML document T such that T conforms to the predefined D. The needfor this is evident in; eg; data exchange; security views; and data integration. Popular XMLquery languages (eg; XQuery; XSLT) cannot guarantee DTD conformance in XML to XMLtransformations. Type inference and (static) checking are too expensive to be used inpractice; worse still; they provide no guidance for how to ensure DTD-conformance. Inresponse to the need we propose TREX (TRansformation Engine for XML); a middlewaresystem for DTD-conforming XML to XML transformations. TREX is based on the novel notionof XTG (XML Transformation Grammar); which extends a DTD by incorporating XML …,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2003,18
Conflict resolution with data currency and consistency,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Nan Tang; Wenyuan Yu,Abstract This article introduces a new approach for conflict resolution: given a set of tuplespertaining to the same entity; it identifies a single tuple in which each attribute has the latestand consistent value in the set. This problem is important in data integration; data cleaning;and query answering. It is; however; challenging since in practice; reliable time stamps areoften absent; among other things. We propose a model for conflict resolution by specifyingdata currency in terms of partial currency orders and currency constraints and by enforcingdata consistency with constant conditional functional dependencies. We show thatidentifying data currency orders helps us repair inconsistent data; and vice versa. Weinvestigate a number of fundamental problems associated with conflict resolution andestablish their complexity. In addition; we introduce a framework and develop algorithms …,Journal of Data and Information Quality (JDIQ),2014,16
Querying big data: bridging theory and practice,Wenfei Fan; Jin-Peng Huai,Abstract Big data introduces challenges to query answering; from theory to practice. Anumber of questions arise. What queries are" tractable" on big data? How can we make bigdata" small" so that it is feasible to find exact query answers? When exact answers arebeyond reach in practice; what approximation theory can help us strike a balance betweenthe quality of approximate query answers and the costs of computing such answers? To getsensible query answers in big data; what else do we necessarily do in addition to copingwith the size of the data? This position paper aims to provide an overview of recentadvances in the study of querying big data. We propose approaches to tackling thesechallenging issues; and identify open problems for future research.,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2014,15
Bounded conjunctive queries,Yang Cao; Wenfei Fan; Tianyu Wo; Wenyuan Yu,Abstract A query Q is said to be effectively bounded if for all datasets D; there exists a subsetDQ of D such that Q (D)= Q (DQ); and the size of DQ and time for fetching DQ areindependent of the size of D. The need for studying such queries is evident; since it allowsus to compute Q (D) by accessing a bounded dataset DQ; regardless of how big D is. Thispaper investigates effectively bounded conjunctive queries (SPC) under an access schemaA; which specifies indices and cardinality constraints commonly used. We providecharacterizations (sufficient and necessary conditions) for determining whether an SPCquery Q is effectively bounded under A. We study several problems for deciding whether Qis bounded; and if not; for identifying a minimum set of parameters of Q to instantiate andmake Q bounded. We show that these problems range from quadratic-time to NP …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,15

Keys for graphs,Wenfei Fan; Zhe Fan; Chao Tian; Xin Luna Dong,Abstract Keys for graphs aim to uniquely identify entities represented by vertices in a graph.We propose a class of keys that are recursively defined in terms of graph patterns; and areinterpreted with subgraph isomorphism. Extending conventional keys for relations and XML;these keys find applications in object identification; knowledge fusion and social networkreconciliation. As an application; we study the entity matching problem that; given a graph Gand a set Σ of keys; is to find all pairs of entities (vertices) in G that are identified by keys in Σ.We show that the problem is intractable; and cannot be parallelized in logarithmic rounds.Nonetheless; we provide two parallel scalable algorithms for entity matching; in MapReduceand a vertex-centric asynchronous model.

On the complexity of query result diversification,Ting Deng; Wenfei Fan,Abstract Query result diversification is a bi-criteria optimization problem for ranking queryresults. Given a database D; a query Q and a positive integer k; it is to find a set of k tuplesfrom Q (D) such that the tuples are as relevant as possible to the query; and at the sametime; as diverse as possible to each other. Subsets of Q (D) are ranked by an objectivefunction defined in terms of relevance and diversity. Query result diversification has found avariety of applications in databases; information retrieval and operations research. Thispaper studies the complexity of result diversification for relational queries.

Making pattern queries bounded in big graphs,Yang Cao; Wenfei Fan; Jinpeng Huai; Ruizhe Huang,It is cost-prohibitive to find matches Q (G) of a pattern query Q in a big graph G. We approachthis by fetching a small subgraph GQ of G such that Q (GQ)= Q (G). We show that manypractical patterns are effectively bounded under access constraints A commonly found inreal life; such that GQ can be identified in time determined by Q and A only; independent ofthe size| G| of G. This holds no matter whether pattern queries are localized (eg; viasubgraph isomorphism) or non-localized (graph simulation). We provide algorithms todecide whether a pattern Q is effectively bounded; and if so; to generate a query plan thatcomputes Q (G) by accessing GQ; in time independent of| G|. When Q is not effectivelybounded; we give an algorithm to extend access constraints and make Q bounded in G.Using real-life data; we experimentally verify the effectiveness of the approach; eg; about …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,13

In this paper; we present a novel XML securityframework developed to enforce a generic; flexible access-control mechanism for XML datamanagement; which supports efficient and secure query access; without revealing sensitiveinformation to unauthorized users. Major components underlying the framework arediscussed and the current status of a reference implemenation is reported. 1,*,2006,13
Beyond XML query languages,Peter Buneman; Alin Deutsch; Wenfei Fan; Hartmut Liefke; Arnaud Sahuguet; Wang-Chiew Tan,Abstract A query language is essential; if XML is to serve effectively as an exchange mediumfor large data sets. The design of query languages for XML is in its infancy; and the choice ofa standard may be governed more by user acceptance than by any understanding ofunderlying principles. One would hope that expressive power; performance; andcompatibility with other languages will be considered in choosing among alternatives; but itis likely that several contenders will co-exist for some time. It is worth observing that; duringthe 20-year development of relational query languages; several competing languages weredeveloped; and even today there are several relational query language standards. In spiteof this; a great deal of technology was developed that was independent of the surface syntaxof a query language. This included technology" below" the language such as efficient …,Database Research Group (CIS),1998,13
Functional dependencies for graphs,Wenfei Fan; Yinghui Wu; Jingbo Xu,Abstract We propose a class of functional dependencies for graphs; referred to as GFDs.GFDs capture both attribute-value dependencies and topological structures of entities; andsubsume conditional functional dependencies (CFDs) as a special case. We show that thesatisfiability and implication problems for GFDs are coNP-complete and NP-complete;respectively; no worse than their CFD counterparts. We also show that the validationproblem for GFDs is coNP-complete. Despite the intractability; we develop parallel scalablealgorithms for catching violations of GFDs in large-scale graphs. Using real-life and syntheticdata; we experimentally verify that GFDs provide an effective approach to detectinginconsistencies in knowledge and social graphs.,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,12
Methods and apparatus for processing XML updates as queries,*,Methods and apparatus are provided for processing updates to an XML document. Updatesare converted into one or more complement queries that can be performed on the XMLdocument. The complement queries provided by the present invention allow (i) virtual viewsof XML data to be updated;(ii) updates and queries to be composed; and (iii) the XMLdocument to be updated using an XML query engine.

A uniform system for publishing and maintaining XML data,Byron Choi; Wenfei Fan; Xibei Jia; Arek Kasprzyk,XML has become the prime standard for data exchange on the Web. To exchange datacurrently residing in databases; one needs to publish it in XML; ie; to extract data from thedatabase and transform the data into an XML format. In practice; data publishing is oftendone with a predefined “schema”. A community agrees on a certain schema; andsubsequently all members of the community exchange their data wrt the predefined schema;by ensuring their published (target) XML data to conform to the fixed schema. This is calledschema-directed XML publishing. The need for this is particularly evident in biological dataexchange and services. However; it is nontrivial to ensure that the target XML data conformsto a given schema. The difficulty is introduced by; among others; recursion in a targetschema; which is common in; eg; biological ontologies [7].

Methods and apparatus for contextual schema mapping of source documents to target documents,*,Methods and apparatus are provided for improved schema mapping of source documents totarget documents. A list of matches are generated between at least one source table and atleast one target table. One or more of the matches are annotated with a logical conditionproviding a context in which the match applies. Matches can be annotated with a logicalcondition; for example; by generating a set of candidate view conditions; C; to be applied tothe one or more source tables. A schema match algorithm can generate the list of matches.Candidate logical conditions can be identified; for example; by (i) creating a set of views forcategorical attributes in the tables and adding a view for each partitioning of the attributevalues;(ii) using a classifier built on target attribute values; or (iii) evaluating internal featuresof a source table.,*,2008,11
XML publishing: Bridging theory and practice,Wenfei Fan,Abstract Transforming relational data into XML; as known as XML publishing; is oftennecessary when one wants to exchange data residing in databases or to create an XMLinterface of a traditional database. This paper aims to provide an overview of recentadvances in XML publishing. We present a notion of publishing transducers recentlydeveloped for studying the expressive power and complexity of XML publishing languages.In terms of publishing transducers we then characterize XML publishing languages beingused in practice. In addition; we address dynamic aspects of XML publishing; namely;incremental maintenance and update management of XML views published from relationaldata.,International Symposium on Database Programming Languages,2007,11
CerFix: A system for cleaning data with certain fixes,Wenfei Fan; Jianzhong Li; Shuai Ma; Nan Tang; Wenyuan Yu,Abstract We present CerFix; a data cleaning system that finds certain fixes for tuples at thepoint of data entry; ie; fixes that are guaranteed correct. It is based on master data; editingrules and certain regions. Given some attributes of an input tuple that are validated (assuredcorrect); editing rules tell us what other attributes to fix and how to correct them with masterdata. A certain region is a set of attributes that; if validated; warrant a certain fix for the entiretuple. We demonstrate the following facilities provided by Cer-Fix:(1) a region finder toidentify certain regions;(2) a data monitor to find certain fixes for input tuples; by guidingusers to validate a minimal number of attributes; and (3) an auditing module to show whatattributes are fixed and where the correct values come from.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,10
Expressiveness and complexity of XML publishing transducers,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Frank Neven,Abstract A number of languages have been developed for specifying XML publishing; that is;transformations of relational data into XML trees. These languages generally describe thebehaviors of a middleware controller that builds an output tree iteratively; issuing queries toa relational source and expanding the tree with the query results at each step. To study thecomplexity and expressive power of XML publishing languages; this article proposes anotion of publishing transducers; which generate XML trees from relational data. We study avariety of publishing transducers based on what relational queries a transducer can issue;what temporary stores a transducer can use during tree generation; and whether or notsome tree nodes are allowed to be virtual; that is; excluded from the output tree. We firstshow how existing XML publishing languages can be characterized by such transducers …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2008,10
An effective syntax for bounded relational queries,Yang Cao; Wenfei Fan,Abstract A query Q is boundedly evaluable under a set A of access constraints if for alldatasets D that satisfy A; there exists a fraction DQ of D such that Q (D)= Q (DQ); and the sizeof DQ and time for identifying DQ are both independent of the size of D. That is; we cancompute Q (D) by accessing a bounded amount of data no matter how big D grows.However; while desirable; it is undecidable to determine whether a query in relationalalgebra (RA) is bounded under A. In light of the undecidability; this paper develops aneffective syntax for bounded RA queries. We identify a class of covered RA queries such thatunder A;(a) every boundedly evaluable RA query is equivalent to a covered query;(b) everycovered RA query is boundedly evaluable; and (c) it takes PTIME in| Q| and| A| to checkwhether Q is covered by A.

Querying big social data,Wenfei Fan,Abstract Big data poses new challenges to query answering; from computational complexitytheory to query evaluation techniques. Several questions arise. What query classes can beconsidered tractable in the context of big data? How can we make query answering feasibleon big data? What should we do about the quality of the data; the other side of big data?This paper aims to provide an overview of recent advances in tackling these questions;using social network analysis as an example.,British National Conference on Databases,2013,9
Data quality problems beyond consistency and deduplication,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Shuai Ma; Nan Tang; Wenyuan Yu,Abstract Recent work on data quality has primarily focused on data repairing algorithms forimproving data consistency and record matching methods for data deduplication. This paperaccentuates several other challenging issues that are essential to developing data cleaningsystems; namely; error correction with performance guarantees; unification of data repairingand record matching; relative information completeness; and data currency. We provide anoverview of recent advances in the study of these issues; and advocate the need fordeveloping a logical framework for a uniform treatment of these issues.,*,2013,9
Parallelizing sequential graph computations,Wenfei Fan; Jingbo Xu; Yinghui Wu; Wenyuan Yu; Jiaxin Jiang; Zeyu Zheng; Bohan Zhang; Yang Cao; Chao Tian,Abstract This paper presents GRAPE; a parallel system for graph computations. GRAPEdiffers from prior systems in its ability to parallelize existing sequential graph algorithms as awhole. Underlying GRAPE are a simple programming model and a principled approach;based on partial evaluation and incremental computation. We show that sequential graphalgorithms can be" plugged into" GRAPE with minor changes; and get parallelized. As longas the sequential algorithms are correct; their GRAPE parallelization guarantees toterminate with correct answers under a monotonic condition. Moreover; we show thatalgorithms in MapReduce; BSP and PRAM can be optimally simulated on GRAPE.

According to one aspect of the invention; methods are provided forprocessing a view query on a database view. The method comprises the steps of translatingthe view query to a mixed finite state automata representation of a document query on oneor more documents underlying the database view; and evaluating the document query onthe one or more documents to obtain a result to the view query.

Answering pattern queries using views,Wenfei Fan; Xin Wang; Yinghui Wu,Answering queries using views has proven effective for querying relational andsemistructured data. This paper investigates this issue for graph pattern queries based ongraph simulation. We propose a notion of pattern containment to characterize graph patternmatching using graph pattern views. We show that a pattern query can be answered using aset of views if and only if it is contained in the views. Based on this characterization; wedevelop efficient algorithms to answer graph pattern queries. We also study problems fordetermining (minimal; minimum) containment of pattern queries. We establish theircomplexity (from cubic-time to NP-complete) and provide efficient checking algorithms(approximation when the problem is intractable). In addition; when a pattern query is notcontained in the views; we study maximally contained rewriting to find approximate …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,7
On the aggregation problem for synthesized web services,Ting Deng; Wenfei Fan; Leonid Libkin; Yinghui Wu,Abstract The paper introduces and investigates the aggregation problem for synthesizedmediators of Web services (SWMs). An SWM is a deterministic finite-state transducer definedin terms of templates for component services. Upon receiving an artifact; an SWM selects aset of available services from a library to realize its templates; and invokes those services tooperate on the artifact; in parallel; it produces a numeric value as output (eg; the total price ofa package) by applying synthesis rules. Given an SWM; a library and an input artifact; theaggregation problem is to find a mapping from the component templates of the SWM toavailable services in the library that maximizes (or minimizes) the output. As opposed to thecomposition syntheses of Web services; the aggregation problem aims to optimize therealization of a given mediator; to best serve the usersʼ need.

Bounded query rewriting using views,Yang Cao; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Ping Lu,Abstract A query Q has a bounded rewriting using a set of views if there exists a queryQ'expressed in the same language as Q; such that given a dataset D; Q (D) can becomputed by Q'that accesses only cached views and a small fraction DQ of D. We considerdatasets D that satisfy a set of access constraints; a combination of cardinality constraintsand associated indices; such that the size| DQ| of DQ and the time to identify DQ areindependent of| D|; no matter how big D is. This paper studies the problem for decidingwhether a query has a bounded rewriting given a set V of views and a set A of accessconstraints. We establish the complexity of the problem for various query languages; from Σ3 p-complete for conjunctive queries (CQ); to undecidable for relational algebra (FO).

Uniform Dependency Language for Improving Data Quality.,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts,Abstract A variety of dependency formalisms have been studied for improving data quality.To treat these dependencies in a uniform framework; we propose a simple language; QualityImproving Dependencies (QIDs). We show that previous dependencies considered for dataquality can be naturally expressed as QIDs; and that different enforcement mechanisms ofQIDs yield various data repairing strategies.,IEEE Data Eng.

Specifying and reasoning about workflows with path constraints,Wenfei Fan; Scott Weinstein,Abstract One of the most common frameworks for specifying workflows is control flow graph[3; 11; 13; 22]. Although a control flow graph can depict local execution dependencies of thetasks in a workflow; it is not capable of expressing global dependencies and is not helpful inreasoning about workflow properties. Recently; a path constraint theory has been developedfor semistructured data [2; 7; 8; 9; 10]. It has proven useful for semantic specification andquery optimization in the database context. To overcome the limitations of flow controlgraphs; this paper generalizes the path constraint theory to specify and analyze workflows.More specifically; it proposes a path constraint language and shows that both local andglobal dependencies; as well as sub-workflows; can be naturally expressed in the language.This allows one to reason about workflows in the traditional logic framework.

Path constraints on deterministic graphs,Peter Buneman; Wenfei Fan; Scott Weinstein,Abstract Path constraints have been studied in [4; 10; 11] for semistructured data modeledas a rooted edge-labeled directed graph. They have proven useful in the optimization ofpath queries. However; in this graph model; the implication problems associated with manynatural path constraints are undecidable [10]. A variant of the graph model; called thedeterministic data model; was recently proposed in [9]. In this model; data is represented asa graph with deterministic edge relations; ie; the edges emanating from any node in thegraph have distinct labels. The deterministic graph model is more appropriate forrepresenting; for example; ACeDB [25] databases and Web pages.,*,1998,6
Incremental graph computations: Doable and undoable,Wenfei Fan; Chunming Hu; Chao Tian,Abstract The incremental problem for a class Q of graph queries aims to compute; given aquery Q in'Q; graph G; output Q (G) and updates Δ G to G as input; changes Δ O to Q (G)such that Q (G⊕ Δ G)= Q (G)⊕ Δ O. It is called bounded if its cost can be expressed as apolynomial function in the sizes of Q; Δ G and Δ O. It is to reduce computations on possiblybig G to small Δ G and Δ O. No matter how desirable; however; our first results are negative:for common graph queries such as graph traversal; connectivity; keyword search and patternmatching; their incremental problems are unbounded. In light of the negative results; wepropose two characterizations for the effectiveness of incremental computation:(a)localizable; if its cost is decided by small neighbors of nodes in Δ G instead of the entire G;and (b) bounded relative to a batch algorithm T; if the cost is determined by the sizes of Δ …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data,2017,5
Adding counting quantifiers to graph patterns,Wenfei Fan; Yinghui Wu; Jingbo Xu,Abstract This paper proposes quantified graph patterns (QGPs); an extension of graphpatterns by supporting simple counting quantifiers on edges. We show that QGPs naturallyexpress universal and existential quantification; numeric and ratio aggregates; as well asnegation. Better still; the increased expressivity does not come with a much higher price. Weshow that quantified matching; ie; graph pattern matching with QGPs; remains NP-completein the absence of negation; and is DP-complete for general QGPs. We show how quantifiedmatching can be conducted by incorporating quantifier checking into conventional subgraphisomorphism methods. We also develop parallel scalable algorithms for quantified matching.As an application of QGPs; we introduce quantified graph association rules defined withQGPs; to identify potential customers in social media marketing.

On the complexity of query result diversification,Ting Deng; Wenfei Fan,Abstract Query result diversification is a bi-criteria optimization problem for ranking queryresults. Given a database D; a query Q; and a positive integer k; it is to find a set of k tuplesfrom Q (D) such that the tuples are as relevant as possible to the query; and at the sametime; as diverse as possible to each other. Subsets of Q (D) are ranked by an objectivefunction defined in terms of relevance and diversity. Query result diversification has found avariety of applications in databases; information retrieval; and operations research. Thisarticle investigates the complexity of result diversification for relational queries.(1) Weidentify three problems in connection with query result diversification; to determine whetherthere exists a set of k tuples that is ranked above a bound with respect to relevance anddiversity; to assess the rank of a given k-element set; and to count how many k-element …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2014,5

Extending online travel agency with adaptive reservations,Yu Zhang; Wenfei Fan; Huajun Chen; Hao Sheng; Zhaohui Wu,Abstract Current online ticket booking systems either do not allow customers to reserve aticket with a locked price; or grant a fixed reservation timespan; typically 24 hours. Theformer often leads to false availability: when a customer decides to purchase a ticket after afew queries; she finds that either the ticket is no longer available or the price has hiked up.The latter; on the other hand; may result in unnecessary holdback: a customer cannotpurchase a ticket because someone else is holding it; who then cancels the reservation afteran excessively long period of time. False availability and holdback routinely lead to loss ofrevenues; credibility and above all; customers. To rectify these problems; this paperintroduces a transaction model for e-ticket systems to support a reservation functionality:customers can reserve tickets with a locked price; for a timespan that is determined by the …,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2007,5

We introduce a theory of boundedevaluability; to query big graphs by accessing a bounded amount of the data. Based on this;we propose a framework to query big graphs with constrained resources. Beyond queries;we propose functional dependencies for graphs; to detect inconsistencies in knowledgebases and catch spams in social networks.

On the data complexity of relative information completeness,Yang Cao; Ting Deng; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts,Abstract Databases in an enterprise are often partially closed: parts of their data must becontained in master data; which has complete information about the core business entities ofthe enterprise. With this comes the need for studying relative information completeness: apartially closed database is said to be complete for a query relative to master data if it hascomplete information to answer the query; ie; extending the database by adding more tupleseither does not change its answer to the query or makes it no longer partially closed wrt themaster data. This paper investigates three problems associated with relative informationcompleteness. Given a query Q and a partially closed database D wrt master data D m;(1)the relative completeness problem is to decide whether D is complete for Q relative to Dm;(2) the minimal completeness problem is to determine whether D is a minimal database …,Information Systems,2014,4
Detecting errors in numeric attributes,Grace Fan; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts,Abstract To detect errors in numeric data; this paper proposes numeric functionaldependencies (NFDs); a class of dependencies that allow us to specify arithmeticrelationships among numeric attributes. We show that NFDs subsume conditional functionaldependencies (CFDs); hence; we can catch data inconsistencies; numeric or not; in auniform logic framework by using NFDs as data quality rules. Better still; NFDs do notincrease the complexity of reasoning about data quality rules. We show that the satisfiabilityand implication problems for NFDs remain NP-complete and coNP-complete; respectively;the same as their counterparts for CFDs. Moreover; NFDs can be implemented in SQL andhence; error detection can be readily supported by DBMS. In addition; we show that NFDsand CFDs can be extended across multiple tables; without increasing the complexity of …,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2014,4
Constraint-driven database repair,Wenfei Fan,Query processing algorithms are designed to efficiently exploit the available cache units inthe memory hierarchy.

Selectively storing XML data in relations,Wenfei Fan; Lisha Ma,Abstract This paper presents a new framework for users to select relevant data from an xmldocument and store it in an existing relational database; as opposed to previousapproaches that shred the entire xml document into a newly created database of a newlydesigned schema. The framework is based on a notion of xml2db mappings. An xml2dbmapping extends a (possibly recursive) dtd by associating element types with semanticattributes and rules. It extracts either part or all of the data from an xml document; andgenerates sql updates to increment an existing database using the xml data. We alsoprovide an efficient technique to evaluate xml2db mappings in parallel with sax parsing.These yield a systematic method to store xml data selectively in an existing database.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2006,4

Data driven approximation with bounded resources,Yang Cao; Wenfei Fan,Abstract This paper proposes BEAS; a resource-bounded scheme for querying relations. It isparameterized with a resource ratio α∈(0; 1]; indicating that given a big dataset D; we canonly afford to access an α-fraction of D with limited resources. For a query Q posed on D;BEAS computes exact answers Q (D) if doable and otherwise approximate answers; byaccessing at most α| D| amount of data in the entire process.

BEAS advocates an unconventional query evaluation paradigm under an accessschema A; which is a combination of cardinality constraints and associated indices. Givenan SQL query Q and a dataset D; BEAS computes Q (D) by accessing a bounded fractionDQ of D; such that Q (DQ)= Q (D) and DQ is determined by A and Q only; no matter how bigD grows. It identifies DQ by reasoning about the cardinality constraints of A; and fetches DQusing the indices of A. We demonstrate the feasibility of bounded evaluation by walkingthrough each functional component of BEAS. As a proof of concept; we demonstrate howBEAS conducts CDR analyses in telecommunication industry; compared with commercialdatabase systems.,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data,2017,2

It differs from prior systems in its ability toparallelize existing sequential graph algorithms as a whole; without the need for recastingthe entire algorithms into a new model. One of its unique features is that under a monotoniccondition; GRAPE parallelization guarantees to terminate with correct answers as long asthe sequential algorithms" plugged in" are correct. We demonstrate its parallel computations;ease-of-use and performance compared with the start-of-the-art graph systems.

Capturing Missing Tuples and Missing Values,Ting Deng; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts,Abstract Databases in real life are often neither entirely closed-world nor entirely open-world. Databases in an enterprise are typically partially closed; in which a part of the data isconstrained by master data that contains complete information about the enterprise incertain aspects. It has been shown that; despite missing tuples; such a database may turnout to have complete information for answering a query. This article studies partially closeddatabases from which both tuples and attribute values may be missing. We specify such adatabase in terms of conditional tables constrained by master data; referred to as c-instances. We first propose three models to characterize whether a c-instance T is completefor a query Q relative to master data. That is; depending on how missing values in T areinstantiated; the answer to Q in T remains unchanged when new tuples are added. We …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2016,1

On recommendation problems beyond points of interest,Ting Deng; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts,Abstract Recommendation systems aim to recommend items or packages of items that arelikely to be of interest to users.

Asopposed to prior work; this paper investigates two issues beyond POI recommendation thatare also important to recommendation systems. When there exist no sufficiently many POIthat can be recommended; we propose (1) query relaxation recommendation to help usersrevise their selection criteria; or (2) adjustment recommendation to guide recommendationsystems to modify their item collections; such that the users׳ requirements can be satisfied …,Information Systems,2015,1

On the Complexity of Annotation Propagation and View Update Analyses,Gao Cong; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Jianzhong Li; Jizhou Luo,Abstract—This paper investigates three problems identified in [1] for annotation propagation;namely; the view side-effect; source side-effect and annotation placement problems. Givenannotations entered for a tuple or an attribute in a view; these problems ask what tuples orattributes in the source have to be annotated to produce the view annotations. As observedin [1]; these problems are fundamental not only for data provenance but also for themanagement of view updates. For an annotation attached to a single existing tuple in a view;it has been shown that these problems are often intractable even for views defined in termsof simple SPJU queries [1]. We revisit these problems by considering severaldichotomies:(a) views defined in various subclasses of SPJU; versus SPJU views under apractical key preserving condition;(b) annotations attached to existing tuples in a view …,IEEE TKDE,2012,1
A unified constraint model for XML (full version),Wenfei Fan; Gabriel M Kuper; Jérôme Siméon,Abstract Integrity constraints are an essential part of a modern schema definition language.They are useful for semantic specification; update consistency control; query optimization;information preservation; etc. In this paper; we propose UCM; a model of integrity constraintsfor XML that is both simple and expressive. Because it relies on a single notion of keys andforeign keys; the UCM model is easy to use and makes formal reasoning possible. Becauseit relies on a powerful type system; the UCM model is expressive; capturing in a singleframework the constraints found in relational databases; object-oriented schemas and XMLDTDs. We study the problem of consistency of UCM constraints; look at the interactionbetween constraints and subtyping; and discuss algorithms for implementing theseconstraints.,*,2001,1
Making graph pattern queries bounded in big graphs,*,A processor executes instructions stored in non-transitory memory storage to receive apattern query for a graph and determine a set of access constraints corresponding to thepattern query. A determination is made whether the pattern query is effectively boundedunder the set of access constraints.

Querying big data by accessing small data,*,A processor executes instructions stored in non-transitory memory to determine whether aquery to big data is bounded evaluable; or may be rewritten to access a bounded amount ofdata or information in a dataset. A query plan may retrieve the information by using indicesin access constraints of the query. The cost associated with obtaining the information byusing the query plan may be dependent on the query and access constraints and not thesize of the dataset. A query plan to obtain the information may be formed for different typesor classes of queries; such as conjunctive queries (CQ); unions of conjunctive queries(UCQ) and positive existential FO (first order) conjunctive queries (∃ FO+). When a query isnot bounded evaluable; a determination is made whether an approximation to theinformation may be retrieved. An approximation may be obtained by using upper and …,*,2017,*

Dependencies for Graphs,Wenfei Fan; Ping Lu,Abstract This paper proposes a class of dependencies for graphs; referred to as graph entitydependencies (GEDs). A GED is a combination of a graph pattern and an attributedependency. In a uniform format; GEDs express graph functional dependencies withconstant literals to catch inconsistencies; and keys carrying id literals to identify entities in agraph. We revise the chase for GEDs and prove its Church-Rosser property. Wecharacterize GED satisfiability and implication; and establish the complexity of theseproblems and the validation problem for GEDs; in the presence and absence of constantliterals and id literals. We also develop a sound and complete axiom system for finiteimplication of GEDs. In addition; we extend GEDs with built-in predicates or disjunctions; tostrike a balance between the expressive power and complexity. We settle the complexity …,Proceedings of the 36th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems,2017,*
GRAPE: Conducting Parallel Graph Computations without Developing Parallel Algorithms,Wenfei Fan; Jingbo Xu; Xiaojian Luo; Yinghui Wu; Wenyuan Yu; Ruiqi Xu,Abstract Developing parallel graph algorithms with correctness guarantees is nontrivial evenfor experienced programmers. Is it possible to parallelize existing sequential graphalgorithms; without recasting the algorithms into a parallel model? Better yet; can theparallelization guarantee to converge at correct answers as long as the sequentialalgorithms provided are correct? GRAPE tackles these questions; to make parallel graphcomputations accessible to a large group of users. This paper presents (a) the parallelmodel of GRAPE; based on partial evaluation and incremental computation; and (b) aperformance study; showing that GRAPE achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art systems.,*,2017,*

Polymorphic queries for P2P systems,Jie Liu; Wenfei Fan,Abstract When a query is posed on a centralized database; if it refers to attributes that arenot defined in the database; the user is warranted to get either an error or an empty set. Incontrast; when a query is posed on a peer in a P2P system and refers to attributes not foundin the local database; the query should not be simply rejected if the relevant information isavailable at other peers. This paper proposes a query model for unstructured P2P systemsto answer such queries.(a) We introduce a class of polymorphic queries; a revision ofconjunctive queries by incorporating type variables to accommodate attributes not defined inthe local database.(b) We define the semantics of polymorphic queries in terms of horizontaland vertical object expansions; to find attributes and tuples; respectively; missing from thelocal database. We show that both expansions can be conducted in a uniform framework …,Information Systems,2011,*

Improving data quality: consistency and accuracy,Wenfei Fan; Floris GEERTS; Xibei Jia,Two central criteria for data quality are consistency and accuracy. Inconsistencies and errorsin a database often emerge as violations of integrity constraints. Given a dirty database D;one needs automated methods to make it consistent; ie; find a repair D0 that satisfies theconstraints and “minimally” differs from D. Equally important is to ensure that theautomatically-generated repair D0 is accurate; or makes sense; ie; D0 differs from the“correct” data within a predefined bound. This paper studies effective methods for improvingboth data consistency and accuracy. We employ a class of conditional functionaldependencies (CFDs) to specify the consistency of the data; which are able to captureinconsistencies and errors beyond what their traditional counterparts can catch. To improvethe consistency of the data; we propose two algorithms: one for automatically computing a …,*,2007,*

REASONING ABOUT KEYS FOR XML,PEtEr BunEman½; Susan Davidson¾; WEnFEi Fan; CarmEm Hara; Wang-ChiEw Tan,Abstract—We study absolute and relative keys for XML; and investigate their associateddecision problems. We argue that these keys are important to many forms of hierarchicallystructured data including XML documents. In contrast to other proposals of keys for XML; weshow that these keys are always (finitely) satisfiable; and their (finite) implication problem isfinitely axiomatizable. Furthermore; we provide a polynomial time algorithm for determining(finite) implication in the size of keys. Our results also demonstrate; among other things; thatthe analysis of XML keys is far more intricate than its relational counterpart.,*,2003,*

TREX: DTD-Conforming XML to XML Transformations,Aoying Zhou Qing Wang Zhimao Guo; Xueqing Gong Shihui Zheng; Hongwei Wu Jianchang Xiao Kun Yue; Wenfei Fan,With the popularity of XML; it is increasingly common to find data in the XML format. Thishighlights an important question: given an XML document S and a DTD D; how to extractdata from S and construct another XML document T such that T conforms to the fixed D? Letus refer to this as DTD-conforming XML to XML transformation. The need for this is evidentin; eg; data exchange: enterprises exchange their XML documents with respect to a certainpredefined DTD. Although a number of XML query languages (eg; XQuery; XSLT) arecurrently being used to transform XML data; they cannot guarantee DTD conformance. Typeinference and (static) checking for XML transformations are too expensive [1] to be used inpractice; worse; they provide no guidance for how to specify a DTD-conforming XML to XMLtransformation.
