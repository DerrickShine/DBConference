Stackguard: Automatic adaptive detection and prevention of buffer-overflow attacks.,Crispan Cowan; Calton Pu; Dave Maier; Jonathan Walpole; Peat Bakke; Steve Beattie; Aaron Grier; Perry Wagle; Qian Zhang; Heather Hinton,Abstract This paper presents a systematic solution to the persistent problem of bufferoverflow attacks. Buffer overflow attacks gained notoriety in 1988 as part of the Morris Wormincident on the Internet. While it is fairly simple to fix individual buffer overflow vulnerabilities;buffer overflow attacks continue to this day. Hundreds of attacks have been discovered; andwhile most of the obvious vulnerabilities have now been patched; more sophisticated bufferoverflow attacks continue to emerge. We describe StackGuard: a simple compiler techniquethat virtually eliminates buffer overflow vulnerabilities with only modest performancepenalties. Privileged programs that are recompiled with the StackGuard compiler extensionno longer yield control to the attacker; but rather enter a fail-safe state. These programsrequire no source code changes at all; and are binary-compatible with existing operating …,USENIX Security Symposium,1998,1698
Magic sets and other strange ways to implement logic programs,Francois Bancilhon; David Maier; Yehoshua Sagiv; Jeffrey D Ullman,ABSTRACT Several methods for implementing database queries expressed as logical rulesare given and they are compared for efficiency. One method; called “magic sets;” is ageneral algorithm for rewriting logical rules so that they may be implemented bottom-UP (=forward chaining) in a way that cuts down on the irrelevant facts that are generated. Theadvantage of this scheme is that by working bottom-up; we can take advantage of efficientmethods for doing massive joins. Two other methods are ad hoc ways of implementing“linear” rules; ie; rules where at most one predicate in any body is recursive. These methodsare,Proceedings of the fifth ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD symposium on Principles of database systems,1985,1026
On the desirability of acyclic database schemes,Catriel Beeri; Ronald Fagin; David Maier; Mihalis Yannakakis,Abstract. A class of database schemes; called acychc; was recently introduced. It is shownthat this class has a number of desirable properties. In particular; several desirableproperties that have been studied by other researchers m very different terms are all shownto be eqmvalent to acydicity. In addition; several equivalent charactenzauons of the class mterms of graphs and hypergraphs are given; and a smaple algorithm for determiningacychclty is presented. Also given are several eqmvalent characterizations of those sets M ofmultivalued dependencies such that M is the set of muRlvalued dependencies that are theconsequences of a given join dependency. Several characterizations for a conflict-free (inthe sense of Lien) set of muluvalued dependencies are provided.,Journal of the ACM (JACM),1983,853
From databases to dataspaces: a new abstraction for information management,Michael Franklin; Alon Halevy; David Maier,Abstract The development of relational database management systems served to focus thedata management community for decades; with spectacular results. In recent years;however; the rapidly-expanding demands of" data everywhere" have led to a field comprisedof interesting and productive efforts; but without a central focus or coordinated agenda. Themost acute information management challenges today stem from organizations (eg;enterprises; government agencies; libraries;" smart" homes) relying on a large number ofdiverse; interrelated data sources; but having no way to manage their dataspaces in aconvenient; integrated; or principled fashion. This paper proposes dataspaces and theirsupport systems as a new agenda for data management.

Development of an object-oriented DBMS,David Maier; Jacob Stein; Allen Otis; Alan Purdy,Abstract We describe the results of developing the GemStone object-oriented databaseserver; which supports a model of objects similar to that of Smalltalk-80. We begin with asummary of the goals and requirements for the system: an extensible data model thatcaptures behavioral semantics; no artificial bounds on the number or size of databaseobjects; database amenities (concurrency; transactions; recovery; associative access;authorization) and an interactive development environment. Object-oriented languages;Smalltalk in particular; answer some of these requirements. We discuss satisfying theremaining requirements in an object oriented context; and report briefly on the status of thedevelopment efforts.

Testing implications of data dependencies,David Maier; Alberto O Mendelzon; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract Presented is a computation method—the chase—for testing implication of datadependencies by a set of data dependencies. The chase operates on tableaux similar tothose of Aho; Sagiv; and Ullman. The chase includes previous tableau computation methodsas special cases. By interpreting tableaux alternately as mappings or as templates forrelations; it is possible to test implication of join dependencies (including multivalueddependencies) and functional dependencies by a set of dependencies.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1979,555

Linear road: a stream data management benchmark,Arvind Arasu; Mitch Cherniack; Eduardo Galvez; David Maier; Anurag S Maskey; Esther Ryvkina; Michael Stonebraker; Richard Tibbetts,Abstract This paper specifies the Linear Road Benchmark for Stream Data ManagementSystems (SDMS). Stream Data Management Systems process streaming data by executingcontinuous and historical queries while producing query results in real-time. This benchmarkmakes it possible to compare the performance characteristics of SDMS'relative to each otherand to alternative (eg; Relational Database) systems. Linear Road has been endorsed as anSDMS benchmark by the developers of both the Aurora [1](out of Brandeis University; BrownUniversity and MIT) and STREAM [8](out of Stanford University) stream systems.

Principles of dataspace systems,Alon Halevy; Michael Franklin; David Maier,Abstract The most acute information management challenges today stem from organizationsrelying on a large number of diverse; interrelated data sources; but having no means ofmanaging them in a convenient; integrated; or principled fashion. These challenges arise inenterprise and government data management; digital libraries;" smart" homes and personalinformation management. We have proposed dataspaces as a data managementabstraction for these diverse applications and DataSpace Support Platforms (DSSPs) assystems that should be built to provide the required services over dataspaces. Unlike dataintegration systems; DSSPs do not require full semantic integration of the sources in order toprovide useful services.

A study of three alternative workstation-server architectures for object oriented database systems,David J DeWitt; Philippe Futtersack; David Maier; Fernando Velez,ABSTRACT In the engineering and scientiﬁc marketplaces; the workstation-server model ofcomputing is emerging as the standard of the 1990s. Implementing an object-orienteddatabase system in this environment immediately presents the design choice of how topartition database functionality between the server and workstation processors. To betterunderstand the alternatives to this fundamental design decision; we analyze three differentworkstation-server architectures; evaluating them both qualitatively and throughbenchmarking of prototypes. The three approaches are labeled object server; in whichindividual objects pass between the server and workstation; page server; in which a diskpage is the unit of transport and the server buffers pages; and ﬁle server; where wholepages are transferred as well; but they are accessed directly by the workstation process …,VLDB,1990,327
Exploiting punctuation semantics in continuous data streams,Peter A.  Tucker; David Maier; Tim Sheard; Leonidas Fegaras,As most current query processing architectures are already pipelined; it seems logical toapply them to data streams. However; two classes of query operators are impractical forprocessing long or infinite data streams. Unbounded stateful operators maintain state withno upper bound in size and; so; run out of memory. Blocking operators read an entire inputbefore emitting a single output and; so; might never produce a result. We believe that a prioriknowledge of a data stream can permit the use of such operators in some cases. We discussa kind of stream semantics called punctuated streams. Punctuations in a stream mark theend of substreams allowing us to view an infinite stream as a mixture of finite streams. Weintroduce three kinds of invariants to specify the proper behavior of operators in thepresence of punctuation. Pass invariants define when results can be passed on.

On the foundations of the universal relation model,David Maier; Jeffrey D Ullman; Moshe Y Vardi,Abstract The universal relation model aims at achieving complete access-pathindependence in relational databases by relieving the user of the need for logical navigationamong relations. We clarify the assumptions underlying it and explore the approachessuggested for implementing it. The essential idea of the universal relation model is thataccess paths are embedded in attribute names. Thus attribute names must play unique“roles.” Furthermore; it assumes that for every set of attributes there is a basic relationshipthat the user has in mind. The user's queries refer to these basic relationships rather than tothe underlying database. Two fundamentally different approaches to the universal relationmodel have been taken. According to the first approach; the user's view of the database is auniversal relation or many universal relations; about which the user poses queries.

On finding minimal length superstrings,John Gallant; David Maier; James A. Storer,Abstract A superstring of a set of strings {s 1;…; sn} is a string s containing each si; 1⩽ i⩽ n;as a substring. The superstring problem is: Given a set S of strings and a positive integer K;does S have a superstring of length K? The superstring problem has applications to datastorage; specifically; data compression. We consider the complexity of the superstringproblem. NP-completeness results dealing with sets of strings over both finite and infinitealphabets are presented. Also; for a restricted version of the superstring problem; a lineartime algorithm is given.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,1980,258

However; merely being anXML query-processing engine does not render a system suitable for querying the Internet. Auseful system must provide mechanisms to (a) find the XML files that are relevant to a givenquery; and (b) deal with remote data sources that either provide unpredictable data accessand transfer rates; or are infinite streams; or both. The Niagara Internet Query System wasdesigned from the bottom-up to provide these mechanisms. In this article we describe theoverall Niagara architecture; and how Niagara finds relevant XML documents by using acollaboration between the Niagara XML-QL query processor and the Niagara “text-in-context” XML search engine.

Indexing in an object-oriented DBMS,David Maier; Jacob Stein,Abstract We describe indexing in the GemStone object-oriented database server; whichsupports a model of objects similar to that of Smalltalk-80. We begin with a brief descriptionof the system's architecture and the role of indexing in GemStone. We then discuss theproperties of object-oriented systems; and GemStone in particular; that make indexingconsiderably different than in a more conventional data model. Various approaches toindexing in an object-oriented model are presented. We describe both the design andimplementation of indexing in GemStone.

Semantics and evaluation techniques for window aggregates in data streams,Jin Li; David Maier; Kristin Tufte; Vassilis Papadimos; Peter A Tucker,Abstract A windowed query operator breaks a data stream into possibly overlapping subsetsof data and computes a result over each. Many stream systems can evaluate windowaggregate queries. However; current stream systems suffer from a lack of an explicitdefinition of window semantics. As a result; their implementations unnecessarily confusewindow definition with physical stream properties. This confusion complicates the streamsystem; and even worse; can hurt performance both in terms of memory usage andexecution time. To address this problem; we propose a framework for defining windowsemantics; which can be used to express almost all types of windows of which we areaware; and which is easily extensible to other types of windows that may occur in the future.Based on this definition; we explore a one-pass query evaluation strategy; the Window-ID …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,234

In this paper; wepresent an approach for evaluating sliding-window aggregate queries that reduces bothspace and computation time for query execution. Our approach divides overlappingwindows into disjoint panes; computes sub-aggregates over each pane; and" rolls up" thepane-aggregates to computer window-aggregates.

Maximal objects and the semantics of universal relation databases,David Maier; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract The universal relation concept is intended to provide the database user with asimplified model in which he can compose queries without regard to the underlying structureof the relations in the database. Frequently; the lossless join criterion provides the queryinterpreter with the clue needed to interpret the query as the user intended. However; someexamples exist where interpretation by the lossless-join rule runs contrary to our intuition. Tohandle some of these cases; we propose a concept called maximal objects; which modifiesthe universal relation concept in exactly those situations where it appears to go awry—whenthe underlying relational structure has “cycles.” We offer examples of how the maximalobject concept provides intuitively correct interpretations. We also consider how one mightconstruct maximal objects mechanically from purely syntactic structural information—the …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1983,193

Further;this class has many desirable properties. Some properties make operations like updatesand the selection of joins to implement a query over a universal relation especially easy.Other properties of interest were studied by other researchers who described the same classin radically different terms; and found desirable properties in their own contexts.

Optimizing object queries using an effective calculus,Leonidas Fegaras; David Maier,Abstract Object-oriented databases (OODBs) provide powerful data abstractions andmodeling facilities; but they generally lack a suitable framework for query processing andoptimization. The development of an effective query optimizer is one of the key factors forOODB systems to successfully compete with relational systems; as well as to meet theperformance requirements of many nontraditional applications. We propose an effectiveframework with a solid theoretical basis for optimizing OODB query languages. Our calculus;called the monoid comprehension calculus; captures most features of ODMG OQL; and is agood basis for expressing various optimization algorithms concisely. This articleconcentrates on query unnesting (also known as query decorrelation); an optimization that;even though it improves performance considerably; is not treated properly (if at all) by …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2000,161
Towards an effective calculus for object query languages,Leonidas Fegaras; David Maier,Abstract We define a standard of effectiveness for a database calculus relative to a querylanguage. Effectiveness judges suitability to serve as a processing framework for the querylanguage; and comprises aspects of coverage; manipulability and efficient evaluation. Wepresent the monoid calculus; and argue its effectiveness for object-oriented querylanguages; exemplified by OQL of ODMG-93. The monoid calculus readily captures suchfeatures as multiple collection types; aggregations; arbitrary composition of type constructorsand nested query expressions. We also show how to extend the monoid calculus to dealwith vectors and arrays in more expressive ways than current query languages do; andillustrate how it can handle identity and updates.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1995,155
Rapid bushy join-order optimization with cartesian products,Bennet Vance; David Maier,Abstract Query optimizers often limit the search space for join orderings; for example byexcluding Cartesian products in subplans or by restricting plan trees to left-deep vines. Suchexclusions are widely assumed to reduce optimization effort while minimally affecting planquality. However; we show that searching the complete space of plans is more affordablethan has been previously recognized; and that the common exclusions may be of littlebenefit. We start by presenting a Cartesian product optimizer that requires at most a fewseconds of workstation time to search the space of bushy plans for products of up to 15relations. Building on this result; we present a join-order optimizer that achieves a similarlevel of performance; and retains the ability to include Cartesian products in subplanswherever appropriate.

Out-of-order processing: a new architecture for high-performance stream systems,Jin Li; Kristin Tufte; Vladislav Shkapenyuk; Vassilis Papadimos; Theodore Johnson; David Maier,Abstract Many stream-processing systems enforce an order on data streams during queryevaluation to help unblock blocking operators and purge state from stateful operators. Suchin-order processing (IOP) systems not only must enforce order on input streams; but alsorequire that query operators preserve order. This order-preserving requirement constrainsthe implementation of stream systems and incurs significant performance penalties;particularly for memory consumption. Especially for high-performance; potentially distributedstream systems; the cost of enforcing order can be prohibitive. We introduce a newarchitecture for stream systems; out-of-order processing (OOP); that avoids orderingconstraints. The OOP architecture frees stream systems from the burden of ordermaintenance by using explicit stream progress indicators; such as punctuation or …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,115
Dedalus: Datalog in time and space,Peter Alvaro; William R Marczak; Neil Conway; Joseph M Hellerstein; David Maier; Russell Sears,Abstract Recent research has explored using Datalog-based languages to express adistributed system as a set of logical invariants. Two properties of distributed systems proveddifficult to model in Datalog. First; the state of any such system evolves with its execution.Second; deductions in these systems may be arbitrarily delayed; dropped; or reordered bythe unreliable network links they must traverse. Previous efforts addressed the former byextending Datalog to include updates; key constraints; persistence and events; and the latterby assuming ordered and reliable delivery while ignoring delay. These details have asemantics outside Datalog; which increases the complexity of the language and itsinterpretation; and forces programmers to think operationally. We argue that the missingcomponent from these previous languages is a notion of time. In this paper we present …,*,2011,111

For example; digital video is commonlyencoded with lossy compression to reduce bandwidth; and frames may be skipped duringplayback to maintain synchronization. These trade-offs depend on device performance andphysical data representations that are hidden by a database system. If a multimediadatabase is to support digital video and other continuous media data types; we argue thatthe database should provide a quality-of-service (QOS) interface to allow application controlof presentation timing and information-loss trade-offs. This paper proposes a data model forcontinuous media that preserves device and physical data independence. We show how todefine formal QOS constraints from a specification of ideal presentation outputs. Our …,Multimedia Systems,1995,103
Distributed Query Processing and Catalogs for Peer-to-Peer Systems.,Vassilis Papadimos; David Maier; Kristin Tufte,Abstract Peer-to-peer (P2P) architectures are commonly used for file-sharing applications.The reasons for P2P's popularity in file sharing–fault tolerance; scalability; and ease ofdeployment–also make it a good model for distributed data management. In this paper; weintroduce a scalable P2P framework for distributed data management applications usingmutant query plans: XML serializations of algebraic query plan graphs that can includeverbatim XML data; references to resource locations (URLs); and abstract resource names(URNs). We show how we can build distributed catalogs based on multihierarchicnamespaces that can efficiently handle content indexing and query routing. We also discusshow peers can convey the currency and coverage of their data; and how queries can usethis information to manage the inherent tradeoffs between answer completeness …,CIDR,2003,102

Superimposed Information for the Internet.,David Maier; Lois ML Delcambre,It has existed for several millennia; in the form of commentaries on religious books; law andliterature. We see it today in concordances; citation indexes and genome maps. Youprobably have created some of it; as a bookmark file in your web browser. The “it” we refer tois superimposed information: data “placed over” existing information sources to helporganize; access; connect and reuse information elements in those sources. Digital forms ofsuperimposed information are now common; especially in the milieu of the World-Wide Web.Some of it has an individual focus; such as the aforementioned bookmark files; or link pageson a person's web site. Other forms are collective efforts and meant for wide audiences; forexample; web guides such as Yahoo. Examples exist outside of the web; such asrepositories for software projects that link together specifications; schemas; databases …,WebDB (Informal Proceedings),1999,92
Logic and lattices for distributed programming,Neil Conway; William R Marczak; Peter Alvaro; Joseph M Hellerstein; David Maier,Abstract In recent years there has been interest in achieving application-level consistencycriteria without the latency and availability costs of strongly consistent storage infrastructure.A standard technique is to adopt a vocabulary of commutative operations; this avoids the riskof inconsistency due to message reordering. Another approach was recently captured by theCALM theorem; which proves that logically monotonic programs are guaranteed to beeventually consistent. In logic languages such as Bloom; CALM analysis can automaticallyverify that programs achieve consistency without coordination. In this paper we presentBloom L; an extension to Bloom that takes inspiration from both of these traditions. Bloom Lgeneralizes Bloom to support lattices and extends the power of CALM analysis to wholeprograms containing arbitrary lattices. We show how the Bloom interpreter can be …,Proceedings of the Third ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing,2012,88
Why isnt there an object-oriented data model?,David Maier,Abstract The appellation" object-oriented" is affixed to a wide range of recent databasesystem prototypes and products; with no agreement on its exact meaning. This paper offersa definition for an object-oriented database system; explains why a standard for" the" object-oriented data model will be hard to come by; and examines the differences in the models ofcurrent object-oriented databases. It concludes with predictions on the effect of object-oriented databases on the commercial marketplace.,*,1989,88
Integrating an object server with other worlds,Alan Purdy; Bruce Schuchardt; David Maier,Abstract Object-oriented database servers are beginning to appear on the commercialmarket in response to a demand by application developers for increased modeling power indatabase systems. Before these new servers can enhance the productivity of applicationdesigners; systems designers must provide simple interfaces to them from both proceduraland object-oriented languages. This paper first describes a successful interface between anobject server and two procedural languages (C and Pascal). Because C and Pascal do notsupport the object-oriented paradigm application; designers using these languages mustdeal with database objects in less than natural ways. Fortunately; workstations supportingobject-oriented languages have the potential for interacting with database objects in a muchmore integrated manner. To integrate these object-oriented workstations with an object …,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),1987,82

Making database systems fast enough for CAD applications,David Maier,Why are database systems an infrequent component of CAD systems? Lack of modelingpower and performance. Record-based models aren't up to handling complex designstructures for VLSI or mechanical CAD. It's hard to design an ALU in your check register. Theencoding involved greatly complicates application programs; and leaves too much room formisinterpretation of data. For flexibility; most CAD systems perform their own datamanagement on top of the OS file system. Of course; a file system has no understanding ofthe structure of the data items in a design; and so is powerless to help with integrity orspecialized storage mappings. Also; the data management features in a file system areminimal. Those CAD systems that are built atop relational databases use them almostexclusively for selection; sometimes for projection; but perform or precompute joins in the …,*,1987,71
Connections in acyclic hypergraphs,David Maier; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract We demonstrate a sense in which the equivalence between blocks (subgraphswithout articulation points) and biconnected components (subgraphs in which there are twoedge-disjoint paths between any pair of nodes) that holds in ordinary graph theory can begeneralized to hypergraphs. The result has an interpretation for relational databases that theuniversal relations described by acyclic join dependencies are exactly those for which theconnections among attributes are defined uniquely. We also exhibit a relationship betweenthe process of Graham reduction (Graham; 1979) of hypergraphs and the process of tableaureduction (Aho; Sagiv and Ullman; 1979) that holds only for acyclic hypergraphs.,Theoretical Computer Science,1984,70
The bigdawg polystore system,Jennie Duggan; Aaron J Elmore; Michael Stonebraker; Magda Balazinska; Bill Howe; Jeremy Kepner; Sam Madden; David Maier; Tim Mattson; Stan Zdonik,Abstract This paper presents a new view of federated databases to address the growingneed for managing information that spans multiple data models. This trend is fueled by theproliferation of storage engines and query languages based on the observation that “no onesize fits all”. To address this shift; we propose a polystore architecture; it is designed to unifyquerying over multiple data models. We consider the challenges and opportunitiesassociated with polystores. Open questions in this space revolve around query optimizationand the assignment of objects to storage engines. We introduce our approach to thesetopics and discuss our prototype in the context of the Intel Science and Technology Centerfor Big Data,ACM Sigmod Record,2015,64

Architecting a network query engine for producing partial results,Jayavel Shanmugasundaram; Kristin Tufte; David DeWitt; David Maier; Jeffrey F Naughton,Abstract The growth of the Internet has made it possible to query data in all corners of theglobe. This trend is being abetted by the emergence of standards for data representation;such as XML. In face of this exciting opportunity; however; existing query engines need to bechanged in order to use them to effectively query the Internet. One of the challenges isproviding partial results of query computation; based on the initial portion of the input;because it may be undesirable to wait for all of the input. This situation is due to (a) limiteddata transfer bandwidth (b) temporary unavailability of sites and (c) intrinsically long-runningqueries (eg; continual queries or triggers). A major issue in providing partial results isdealing with non-monotonic operators; such as sort; average; negation and nest; becausethese operators need to see all of their input before they can produce the correct output …,International Workshop on the World Wide Web and Databases,2000,63
Semantics of data streams and operators,David Maier; Jin Li; Peter Tucker; Kristin Tufte; Vassilis Papadimos,Abstract What does a data stream mean? Much of the extensive work on query operatorsand query processing for data streams has proceeded without the benefit of an answer tothis question. While such imprecision may be tolerable when dealing with simple cases;such as flat data; guaranteed physical order and element-wise operations; it can lead toambiguities when dealing with nested data; disordered streams and windowed operators.We propose reconstitution functions to make the denotation and representation of datastreams more precise; and use these functions to investigate the connection betweenmonotonicity and non-blocking behavior of stream operators. We also touch on areconstitution function for XML data. Other aspects of data stream semantics we consider arethe use of punctuation to delineate finite subsets of a stream; adequacy of descriptions of …,International Conference on Database Theory,2005,62
Query optimization in object-oriented database systems: a prospectus,Goetz Graefe; David Maier,Abstract We are exploring a scheme that allows optimizing queries over object-orienteddatabases with encapsulated behavior. Objects and classes will be able to reveal theirbehavior in terms of expressions in an algebraic language interpreted by a structural object-oriented database system. An object or class can agree or refuse to reveal its behavior. Thestructural algebra is richer than relational algebra as it includes operators on complex objectcollections; and updates and traversals of individual objects. Objects may reveal to theoptimizer the structural access paths used by their procedures or cost and other statisticsuseful for query optimization. The main features of our approach is that the object-orienteduser interface language is able to perform general computation and to preserve theencapsulation envelope around classes and types.,International Workshop on Object-Oriented Database Systems,1988,62

As an illustration; we generate a mash-up thatdisplays a map of a university campus; and outline the potential benefits of using Mash-o-matic. Mash-o-matic exploits superimposed information (SI); which is new information andstructure created in reference to fragments of existing information.

Hysterical B-trees,David Maier; Sharon C Salveter,In an order d B-tree with n nodes; a single insert or delete operation may cause B (logd n)splits and merges. Moreover; since an insert operation can exactly invert the effect of adelete operation; and vice versa; a sequence of m inserts and deletes can cause 8 (m logdn) splits and merges. We. present a scheme that reduces the number of splits and mergesrequired to process m inserts and deletes to 0 (m); while only modestly increasing the depthof the tree. On the surface it may not seem advantageous to limit the number of splits andmerges. Before performing an insert or delete operation; it is generally necessary to performa tree search involving 8 (logd n) nodes. There are situations; however; where the number ofsplits and merges is the bounding factor in the time to insert and delete. If the applicationinvolves locality of reference-that is; inserts and deletes tend to occur in close proximity in …,Information Processing Letters,1981,58

Toward logical data independence: a relational query language without relations,David Maier; David Rozenshtein; S Salveter; Jacob Stein; David Scott Warren,Abstract One of the main goals of database systems; relational systems in particular; is toprovide a degree of physical data independence for users and programs. Users should notneed to know the exact physical storage structures to use the database; and should beprotected from changes in those structures. We attempt to go a step further; to logical dataindependence. We want an interface to a relational database where a user need not beconcerned with how the data has been partitioned into various relations. The natural relationschemes to be used; from a semantic point of view; may be decomposed in the database fornormalization or redundancy reasons. Our approach essentially loads all the semantics ontothe attributes. In our query language tuple variables are not bound to specific relations.Rather; the system uses the set of attributes; say X; that appear in a query with a tuple …,Proceedings of the 1982 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,1982,54
Algebraic manipulation of scientific datasets,Bill Howe; David Maier,Abstract We investigate algebraic processing strategies for large numeric datasets equippedwith a (possibly irregular) grid structure. Such datasets arise; for example; in computationalsimulations; observation networks; medical imaging; and 2-D and 3-D rendering. Existingapproaches for manipulating these datasets are incomplete: The performance of SQLqueries for manipulating large numeric datasets is not competitive with specialized tools.Database extensions for processing multidimensional discrete data can only model regular;rectilinear grids. Visualization software libraries are designed to process arbitrary griddeddatasets efficiently; but no algebra has been developed to simplify their use and affordoptimization. Further; these libraries are data dependent–physical changes to datarepresentation or organization break user programs. In this paper; we present an algebra …,The VLDB journal,2005,53

Specifying connections for a universal relation scheme database,David Maier; David S Warren,Abstract We propose a universal relation scheme database model based on the assumptionthat there is a unique connection among any set of attributes in a relational database. Weuse the notion of object ([Sc];[MU]) to give a database designer the ability to control howconnections in the database are to be made. We show how semantic considerations thatfollow naturally from the unique connection assumption constrain how objects and theunderlying base relations must be syntactically related. We illustrate and motivate ourdefinitions and constraints with several simple examples.,Proceedings of the 1982 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,1982,49

S-Store is a data management system that combines OLTPtransactions with stream processing. To create S-Store; we begin with H-Store; a main-memory transaction processing engine; and add primitives to support streaming. Thisincludes triggers and transaction workflows to implement push-based processing; windowsto provide a way to bound the computation; and tables with hidden state to implementscoping for proper isolation. This demo explores the benefits of this approach by showinghow a naïve implementation of our benchmarks using only H-Store can yield incorrectresults. We also show that by exploiting push-based semantics and our implementation oftriggers; we can achieve significant improvement in transaction throughput.

Rather than replicate the portions of interest andrecast them into a single; combined data source; we leave base information where it is andsuperimpose a conceptual model that is appropriate to the task at hand. This superimposedmodel can be distinct from the model (s) employed by the sources in the base layer.

High-performance dynamic pattern matching over disordered streams,Badrish Chandramouli; Jonathan Goldstein; David Maier,Abstract Current pattern-detection proposals for streaming data recognize the need to movebeyond a simple regular-expression model over strictly ordered input. We continue in thisdirection; relaxing restrictions present in some models; removing the requirement forordered input; and permitting stream revisions (modification of prior events). Further;recognizing that patterns of interest in modern applications may change frequently over thelifetime of a query; we support updating of a pattern specification without blocking input orrestarting the operator. Our new pattern operator (called AFA) is a streaming adaptation of anon-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) where additional schema-based user-definedinformation; called a register; is accessible to NFA transitions during execution. AFAssupport dynamic patterns; where the pattern itself can change over time. We propose …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,43

In previous work; we focused on using punctuations to improve specific queryoperators; namely blocking operators and unbounded stateful operators. We report here onour ongoing work in exploiting punctuation semantics. We discuss three applications thatillustrate how punctuations can be used. We also discuss our current focus–deciding whenpunctuations can be used to improve entire queries.

A MQP is an XML representation of a query plan that can alsoinclude verbatim XML data; references to resource locations (URLs); or abstract resourcenames (URNs). Servers work using local; possibly incomplete knowledge; partially evaluateas much of the query plan as they can; incorporate the partial results into a new; mutatedquery plan and transfer it to some other server that can continue processing. We haveimplemented an initial version of this framework; and present preliminary performanceresults.,Information and Software Technology,2002,41

QUALITY OF SERVICE SEMANTICS FOR MULTIMEDIA DATABASE SYSTEMS,Jonathan Walpole; Charles Krasic; Ling Liu; David Maier; Gallon Pu; Dylan McNamee; David Steere,Abstract Quality of service (QoS) support has been a hot research topic in multimediadatabases; and multimedia systems in general; for the past several years. However; thereremains little consensus on how QoS support should be provided. At the resource-management level; systems designers are still debating the suitability of reservation-basedversus adaptive QoS management. The design of higher system layers is less clearlyunderstood; and the specification of QoS requirements in domain-specific terms is still anopen research topic. To address these issues; we propose a QoS model for multimediadatabases. The model covers the specification of user-level QoS preferences and theirrelationship to QoS control at the resource-management level; and is applicable to adaptiveand reservation-based systems. In this paper we present the model; discuss the …,Database semantics: semantic issues in multimedia systems: IFIP TC2/WG2. 6 Eighth Working Conference on Database Semantics (DS-8); Rotorua; New Zealand; January 4-8; 1999,1998,40

Why object-oriented databases can succeed where others have failed,David Maier,Abstract Why are database systems an infrequent component of CAD systems? Most CADsystems perform their own data management on top of the OS file system. Those that arebuilt atop relational databases use them almost exclusively for selection; sometimes forprojection; but perform joins in the private program memory of the design tools. CADsystems are using a DBMS as an index package—to support associative access—whenthey are using one at all. The ubiquitous reason for foregoing the rest of the datamanipulation capabilities is “Performance! Commercial database systems aren't fast enoughto support simulators and interactive design tools.” The following paragraphs give myopinion on what conventional database systems are too slow at; why they are slow at it; andwhy object-oriented database systems could be faster at it.,Proceedings on the 1986 international workshop on Object-oriented database systems,1986,38
Windows on the world,David Maier; David Rozenshtein; David S Warren,Abstract We discuss the philosophy; history and theory of window functions. Windowfunctions (sometimes called connections) are a means to treat a relational database as asemantic whole; rather than as an arbitrary collection of relations. Simply stated; a windowfunction maps a database state and a relation scheme to a relation over the scheme.Window functions are the basis for all existing universal scheme interfaces. We present anassumption inherent in universal scheme interfaces; the unique role assumption. Windowfunctions have evolved along two paths; giving rise to computational definitions and weakinstance definitions. We examine several examples of each type of window function; withspecial attention to the association-object window function of PIQUE. We then look atproperties we feel a reasonable window function should satisfy; notably the containment …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1983,38
Adequacy of decompositions of relational databases,David Maier; Alberto O Mendelzon; Fereidoon Sadri; Jeffrey D. Ullman,Abstract We consider conditions that have appeared in the literature with the purpose ofdefining a “good” decomposition of a relation scheme. We show that these notions areequivalent in the case that all constraints in the database are functional dependencies. Thisresult solves an open problem of Rissanen. However; for arbitrary constraints the notionsare shown to differ.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,1980,38
Displaying database objects,David Maier; Peter Nordquist; Mark Grossman,Abstract We outline the requirements for features and construction of interactive displays oncomplex database objects. Few systems to date meet these requirements; as they either donot support update through the display; or are not generated automatically from aspecification. We present a system; SIG; for producing and interpreting high-level displayspecifications for complex objects. SIG supports diaplay types; which are declarativedescriptions of of interactive displays for classes of objects; and abstract views; whichdecode and implement display types; and which can dynamically change the format of adisplay to accommodate changes in the structure of an object.,*,1986,37
Dynamic pattern matching over ordered and disordered data streams,*,Architecture introduces a new pattern operator referred to as called an augmented transitionnetwork (ATN); which is a streaming adaptation of non-reentrant; fixed-state ATNs fordynamic patterns. Additional user-defined information is associated with automaton statesand is accessible to transitions during execution. ATNs are created that directly modelcomplex pattern continuous queries with arbitrary cycles in a transition graph. Thearchitecture can express the desire to ignore some events during pattern detection; and canalso detect the absence of data as part of a pattern. The architecture facilitates efficientsupport for negation; ignorable events; and state cleanup based on predicate punctuations.,*,2014,36
An efficient method for storing ancestor information in trees,David Maier,We present a space efficient method for computing ancestor information in trees; specifically;whether one node is an ancestor of another and the lowest common ancestor of two nodes.We show the method is tunable to specific applications; and compare it to other methods.Finally; we apply our procedures to the problem of finding negative cycles in sparse graphs.,SIAM Journal on Computing,1979,36
Following experts at work in their own information spaces: Using observational methods to develop tools for the digital library,Paul Gorman; Mary Lavelle; Lois Delcambre; David Maier,Abstract Digital libraries allow information access to be integrated into work processes ratherthan separated from them; but also have the potential to overwhelm users with excessive orirrelevant information; impairing their performance rather than improving it. With theopportunity to create new models of what a library is and how it can be used comes thechallenge of improving our understanding of its patrons; their work; and the circumstancesunder which they perform it. In this article we offer an overview of our experiences usingobservational methods to learn about one class of users; expert clinicians treating patients inhospital settings. We describe the evolution of our understanding of the users and theirinformational tasks; and how this evolving understanding is guiding our efforts to createdigital library technology.

Following the paths of XML data: An algebraic framework for XML query evaluation,Leonidas Galanis; Efstratios Viglas; David J DeWitt; Jeffrey F Naughton; David Maier,Abstract This paper introduces an algebraic framework for expressing and evaluatingqueries over XML data. It presents the underlying assumptions of the framework; describesthe input and output of the algebraic operators; and defines these operators and theirsemantics. It evaluates the framework with regard to other proposed XML query algebras.Examples show that this framework is flexible enough to capture queries expressed in Quilt;one of the dominant XML query languages. We have used this algebra in the context of anInternet query engine; in which it is used to formulate logical plans for XML-QL queries. Wedefine equivalence rules that provide opportunities for optimization; and give example casesthat point out the usefulness of these rules. 1,*,2001,34
Towards dynamic pricing-based collaborative optimizations for green data centers,Yang Li; David Chiu; Changbin Liu; Linh TX Phan; Tanveer Gill; Sanchit Aggarwal; Zhuoyao Zhang; Boon Thau Loo; David Maier; Bart McManus,Increased demand for cloud computing services has ushered power management schemesinto the frontlines of data center research. Meanwhile; market penetration of intermittentrenewable energy sources (eg; wind and solar) is on the rise. While clean and abundant;their intermittency is troubling for utility companies; requiring power balancing reserves to bedeployed at anytime to precisely match consumer demand with energy availability.However; a transformative redesign of our power grid is looming; calling for the use ofdynamic energy pricing to resolve this issue by possibly shaping demand. Data centers;being significant consumers with the ability to adjust power utilization in real-time (eg; bymigrating its jobs to and from other locations); are ideal candidates to participate in dynamicpricing markets.

Distributed queries without distributed state.,Vassilis Papadimos; David Maier,Abstract Traditionally; distributed queries have been optimized centrally and executedsynchronously. We outline a framework that relaxes both of these constraints using mutantquery plans: XML representations of query plans that can also include verbatim XML data;references to resource locations (URLs); or abstract resource names (URNs). Servers workusing local; possibly incomplete knowledge; partially evaluate as much of the query plan asthey can; incorporate the partial results into a new; mutated query plan and transfer it tosome other server that can continue processing. We present preliminary performanceresults; and discuss issues and strategies for mutant query optimization.,WebDB,2002,33
Blazes: Coordination analysis for distributed programs,Peter Alvaro; Neil Conway; Joseph M Hellerstein; David Maier,Distributed consistency is perhaps the most discussed topic in distributed systems today.Coordination protocols can ensure consistency; but in practice they cause undesirableperformance unless used judiciously. Scalable distributed architectures avoid coordinationwhenever possible; but undercoordinated systems can exhibit behavioral anomalies underfault; which are often extremely difficult to debug. This raises significant challenges fordistributed system architects and developers. In this paper we present BLAZES; a cross-platform program analysis framework that (a) identifies program locations that requirecoordination to ensure consistent executions; and (b) automatically synthesizes application-specific coordination code that can significantly outperform general-purpose techniques.

On-the-fly progress detection in iterative stream queries,Badrish Chandramouli; Jonathan Goldstein; David Maier,Abstract Multiple researchers have proposed cyclic query plans for evaluating iterativequeries over streams or rapidly changing input. The Declarative Networking community usescyclic plans to evaluate Datalog programs that track reachability and other graph traversalson networks. Cyclic query plans can also evaluate pattern-matching and other queriesbased on event sequences. An issue with cyclic queries over dynamic inputs is knowingwhen the query result has progressed to a certain point in the input; since the number ofiterations is data dependent. One option is a" strictly staged" computation; where the queryplan quiesces between inputs. This option introduces significant latency; and may also"underload" inter-operator buffers. An alternative is to settle for soft guarantees; such as"eventual consistency". Such imprecision can make it difficult; for example; to know when …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,32
Exploiting upper and lower bounds in top-down query optimization,Leonard Shapiro; David Maier; Paul Benninghoff; Keith Billings; Yubo Fan; Kavita Hatwal; Quan Wang; Yu Zhang; H-M Wu; Bennet Vance,System R's bottom-up query optimizer architecture forms the basis of most currentcommercial database managers. The paper compares the performance of top-down andbottom-up optimizers; using the measure of the number of plans generated duringoptimization. Top down optimizers are superior according to this measure because they canuse upper and lower bounds to avoid generating groups of plans. Early during theoptimization of a query; a top-down optimizer can derive upper bounds for the costs of theplans it generates. These bounds are not available to typical bottom-up optimizers sincesuch optimizers generate and cost all subplans before considering larger containing plans.These upper bounds can be combined with lower bounds; based solely on logicalproperties of groups of logically equivalent subqueries; to eliminate entire groups of plans …,Database Engineering and Applications; 2001 International Symposium on.,2001,32
Storage system architectures for continuous media data,David Maier; Jonathan Walpole; Richard Staehli,Abstract Data storage systems are being called on to manage continuous media data types;such as digital audio and video. There is a demand by applications for “constrained-latencystorage access”(CLSA) to such data: precisely scheduled delivery of data streams. Webelieve that anticipated quantitative improvements in processor and storage-deviceperformance will not be sufficient for current data management architectures to meet CLSArequirements. The need for high-volume (but high-latency) storage devices; high-bandwidthaccess and predictable throughput rates mean that standard latency-masking techniques;such as buffering; are inadequate for the service demands of these applications. Weexamine the ways in which storage system architectures must change in order to provideCLSA on continuous media; taking into account operating system and network support as …,International Conference on Foundations of Data Organization and Algorithms,1993,32

The mechanism we designed and implemented;dubbed" computational proxy"; is defined; and a conceptual design for it rendered. We alsodescribe the functional components of the proxy; ie the ability to start up and controlapplication invocations and to capture experimental results into the database.

Generalized mutual dependencies and the decomposition of database relations,Alberto O Mendelzon; David Maier,Mutual dependencies have been shown to provide a necessary and sufficient condition for arelation to be decomposable into three of its projections. We generalize the notion of mutualdependency by extending it to any number of sets of attributes and removing someconstraints from its original definition. We show that a generalized mutual dependency;together with a set of multivalued dependencies; provide a necessary and sufficientcondition for a relation to be decomposable in the general case.,Very Large Data Bases; 1979.

The filter browser defining interfaces graphically,Raimund K Ege; David Maiert; Alan Boming,Abstract We describe a new approach to constructing user Interfaces by declarativelyspecifying the relation-ships between objects via filters. A filter Is a package of constraintsdynamically enforced between a source object and a view object. For example; therelationship between an employee object in a database and a bitmap object represented ona display screen can be modelled as a filter. The object in the database can then bemodified by manipulating the object on the screen; and changes made to the employeeobject by other programs are Instantly reflected on the screen. This paper describes aspecification language for filters; an Implementation of filters with the aid of a constraint-satisfaction system; and a graphical Interface for designing filters. We illustrate the powerand flexibility of the filter paradigm with an Interface example and show that it stimulates …,European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming,1987,30
PROTEUS: objectifying the DBMS user interface,T Lougenia Anderson; Earl F Ecklund Jr; David Maier,Abstract Our thesis it that the external representation of all components of a database systemshould be under programmer control: objects; schemes; commands; even the representationspecifications themselves. Here we give the rationale and design for the PROTEUS interfacesystem that sits atop an object-oriented DBMS. After introducing the model; TEDM; for theDBMS; we describe the classes of objects that model components of the database of interestto PROTEUS: type definitions; representation definitions; layouts; commands; andrepresentation mappings. The advantage of “objectifying” everything is three-fold: thedatabase itself can manage all the information of interest to PROTEUS; representations canbe changed via database updates; and the representation mappings themselves can beexpressed as database commands or rules. We conclude by showing how the pieces fit …,Proceedings on the 1986 international workshop on Object-oriented database systems,1986,30
Quarrying dataspaces: Schemaless profiling of unfamiliar information sources,Bill Howe; David Maier; Nicolas Rayner; James Rucker,Traditional data integration and analysis approaches tend to assume intimate familiarity withthe structure; semantics; and capabilities of the available information sources beforeapplicable tools can be used effectively. This assumption often does not hold in practice. Weintroduce dataspace profiling as the cardinal activity when beginning a project in anunfamiliar dataspace. Dataspace profiling is an analysis of the structures and propertiesexposed by an information source; allowing 1) assessment of the utility and importance ofthe information source as a whole; 2) assessment of compatibility with the services of adataspace support platform; and 3) determination and externalization of structure inpreparation for specific data applications. In this paper; we define dataspace profiling andarticulate requirements for dataspace profilers. We then describe the Quarry system …,Data Engineering Workshop; 2008. ICDEW 2008.

Using write-once memory for database storage,David Maier,1. Introduction Databases often require large amounts of random-access storage; In some;the contents change quite slowly with time: The information stored is historical orbibliographic; hence retrieval re-quests greatly outnumber storage requests. Someexamples are an account ledger; a library catalog and a telephone directory. Laser-writtenoptical disks present a source of inexpensive; largescale; random-access storage; albeit non-rewritable We present a concept of using such write-once storage (WOS) as read-mostlystorage (RMS) by rewriting data at new locations as they change. Of course; the RMS soobtained has a smaller address space than the original WOS and has an upper limit on thenumber of rewrites. We look at the basic mechansim of optical disks; and isolate theproperties pertinent to their use for RMS. We attempt an abstract model of WOS that …,Proceedings of the 1st ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD symposium on Principles of database systems,1982,29
PIQUE: A relational query language without relations,David Maier; David Rozenshtein; Sharon Salveter; Jacob Stein; David S Warren,Abstract Relational database systems have gone far towards providing users with physicaldata independence. To use a relational database; users need not know the physical storagestructures of relations; and are protected from changes in these structures. However; a usermust still navigate among relations. In other words; if the information needed to answer aquestion spans several relations; he must explicitly specify how these relations are to becombined. Physical data independence is not enough. A user should also be afforded somedegree of structural data independence. More specifically; he should be able to posequeries without having to explicitly navigate among relations in the database. Instead; thesystem should do the navigation for him. We consider universal scheme interfaces as ameans for automatic database navigation; and introduce the concept of a generator as …,Information Systems,1987,28
Punctuated data streams,Peter Tucker,Abstract As most current query processing architectures are already pipelined; it seemslogical to apply them to data streams. However; two classes of query operators areimpractical for processing long or unbounded data streams. Unbounded stateful operatorsmaintain state with no upper bound on its size; and so eventually run out of memory.Blocking operators read the entire input before emitting a single output; and so might neverproduce a result. We believe that a priori semantic knowledge of a data stream can permitthe use of such operators in some cases. We explore a kind of stream semantics calledpunctuated streams. Punctuations in a stream mark the end of substreams; allowing us toview a non-terminating stream as a mixture of terminating streams. We introduce three kindsof invariants to specify the proper behavior of query operators in the presence of …,*,2005,27

Query from examples: An iterative; data-driven approach to query construction,Hao Li; Chee-Yong Chan; David Maier,Abstract In this paper; we propose a new approach; called Query from Examples (QFE); tohelp non-expert database users construct SQL queries. Our approach; which is designed forusers who might be unfamiliar with SQL; only requires that the user is able to determinewhether a given output table is the result of his or her intended query on a given inputdatabase. To kick-start the construction of a target query Q; the user first provides a pair ofinputs: a sample database D and an output table R which is the result of Q on D. As therewill be many candidate queries that transform D to R; QFE winnows this collection bypresenting the user with new database-result pairs that distinguish these candidates. Unlikeprevious approaches that use synthetic data for such pairs; QFE strives to make thesedistinguishing pairs as close to the original (D; R) pair as possible. By doing so; it seeks to …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,25
A first tutorial on dataspaces,Michael Franklin; Alon Halevy; David Maier,Abstract Dataspace systems offer services on data without requiring upfront semanticintegration. In sharp contrast with existing information-integration systems; dataspacessystems offer best-effort answers even before semantic mappings are provided to thesystem. Dataspaces offer a pay-as-you-go approach to data management. Users (oradministrators) of the system decide where and when it is worthwhile to invest more effort inidentifying semantic relationships. As such; dataspaces offer services on the data in place;without losing the context surrounding the data.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,25

Superimposed schematics: Introducing ER structure for in-situ information selections,Shawn Bowers; Lois Delcambre; David Maier,Abstract Considerable research exists on providing structured access to unstructuredinformation sources; primarily for search and query. Little attention has been placed on (1)keeping the by-products of the process (eg; connections between structured andunstructured data are typically forgotten and context is lost);(2) developing a rich; conceptualstructure for this new layer of information (eg; the structured data is often represented insimple relational tables); and (3) further elaborating and linking the new; structuredinformation. We propose superimposed schematics to address these issues.

Applying adaptation spaces to support quality of service and survivability,Shawn Bowers; Lois Delcambre; David Maier; Crispin Cowan; Perry Wagle; Dylan McNamee; A-F Le Meur; Heather Hinton,Adaptation is a key technique in constructing survivable information systems. Allowing asystem to continue running; albeit with reduced functionality or performance; in the face ofreduced resources; attacks; or broken components is often preferable to either completeshutdown or continued normal operation in compromised mode. However; unpredictableadaptation can sometimes be worse than the problem it seeks to cope with. In this paper weintroduce adaptation spaces; which precisely and predictably specify the adaptation of asoftware component. We then present two survivable systems that have been specified andimplemented using adaptation spaces.

QUICKTALK: a Smalltalk-80 dialect for defining primitive methods,Mark B Ballard; David Maier; Allen Wirfs-Brock,Abstract QUICKTALK is a dialect of Smalltalk-80 that can be compiled directly into nativemachine code; instead of virtual machine bytecodes. The dialect includes “hints” on theclass of method arguments; instance variables; and class variables. We designed the dialectto describe primitive Smalltalk methods. QUICKTALK achieves improved performance overbytecodes by eliminating the interpreter loop on bytecode execution; by reducing thenumber of message send/returns via binding some target methods at compilation; and byeliminating redundant class checking. We identify changes to the Smalltalk-80 system andcompiler to support the dialect; and give performance measurements.,ACM SIGPLAN Notices,1986,25

Algorithms for inserting and deleting from relations thatare composed of physical fragments are discussed; and we show when such insertions anddeletions are meaningful. We also show how to find an access set for a relation; that is; a setof fragments sufficient to produce the relation; and we apply the test to the question of howthe fragmentation of relations interacts with a query on the relation; showing that a selectionon the relation can be implemented by retrieving a set of physical fragments that forms anaccess set for another particular relation.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1983,25
Automatic high-performance reconstruction and recovery,Ashvin Goel; Wu-chang Feng; Wu-chi Feng; David Maier,Abstract Self-protecting systems require the ability to instantaneously detect maliciousactivity at run-time and prevent execution. We argue that it is impossible to perfectly self-protect systems without false positives due to the limited amount of information one mighthave at run-time and that eventually some undesirable activity will occur that will need to berolled back. As a consequence of this; it is important that self-protecting systems have theability to completely and automatically roll back malicious activity which has occurred.

Component-based end-user database design for ecologists,Judith Bayard Cushing; Nalini Nadkarni; Michael Finch; Anne Fiala; Emerson Murphy-Hill; Lois Delcambre; David Maier,Abstract To solve today's ecological problems; scientists need well documented; validated;and coherent data archives. Historically; however; ecologists have collected and stored dataidiosyncratically; making data integration even among close collaborators difficult. Further;effective ecology data warehouses and subsequent data mining require that individualdatabases be accurately described with metadata against which the data themselves havebeen validated. Using database technology would make documenting data sets forarchiving; integration; and data mining easier; but few ecologists have expertise to usedatabase technology and they cannot afford to hire programmers. In this paper; we identifythe benefits that would accrue from ecologists' use of modern information technology andthe obstacles that prevent that use.

An Algebraic Framework for Physical OODB Design.,Leonidas Fegaras; David Maier,Abstract Physical design for object-oriented databases is still in its infancy. Implementationdecisions often intrude into the conceptual design (such as inverse links and objectdecomposition). Furthermore; query optimizers do not always take full advantage of physicaldesign information. This paper proposes a formal framework for physical database designthat automates the query translation process. In this framework; the physical databasedesign is specified in a declarative manner. This specification is used for generating anefficient query transformer that translates logical queries into programs that manipulate thephysical database. Alternative access paths to physical data are captured as simple rewriterules that are used for generating alternative plans for a query.,DBPL,1995,22
Tools for template dependencies,Ronald Fagin; David Maier; Jeffrey D Ullman; Mihalis Yannakakis,Template dependencies (TD's) are a class of data dependencies that include multivaluedand join dependencies and embedded versions of these. A collection of techniques;examples and results about TD's are presented. The principal results are: 1) Finiteimplication (implication over relations with a finite number of tuples) is distinct fromunrestricted implication for TD's. 2) There are; for TD's over three or more attributes; infinitechains of increasingly weaker and increasingly stronger full TD's. 3) However; there areweakest (nontrivial) and strongest full TD's over any given set of attributes. 4) Over twoattributes; there are only three distinct TD's. 5) There is no weakest (not necessarily full) TDover any set of three or more attributes. 6) There is a finite relation that obeys every strictlypartial TD but no full TD. 7) The conjunction of each finite set of full TD's is equivalent to a …,SIAM Journal on Computing,1983,21

Using punctuation schemes to characterize strategies for querying over data streams,Peter Tucker; David Maier; Tim Sheard; Paul Stephens,Many systems and strategies have been proposed for processing nonterminating datastreams. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages; including the kinds of queriesthat can be executed. We present a framework for characterizing the kinds of queries thatcan be executed over streams based on a notion of compact sets from topology. We firstapply our framework to queries over punctuated data streams. Previous work onpunctuations focused primarily on the behavior of individual query operators. We use ourframework to determine if an entire query can benefit from punctuations available fromstream sources. We then consider other common strategies proposed in the literature forexecuting queries over streams; and we discuss how our framework can characterize thekinds of queries each strategy can answer.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2007,19
A language for spatial data manipulation,Bill Howe; David Maier; Antonio Baptista,ABSTRACT. Environmental Observation and Forecasting Systems (EOFS) create newopportunities and challenges for generation and use of environmental data products. Thenumber and diversity of these data products; however; has been artificially constrained bythe lack of a simple descriptive language for expressing them. Data products that can bedescribed simply in English take pages of obtuse scripts to generate. The scripts obfuscatethe original intent of the data product; making it difficult for users and scientists to understandthe overall product catalog. The problem is exacerbated by the evolution of modern EOFSinto data product “factories” subject to reliability requirements and daily productionschedules. New products must be developed and assimilated into the product suite asquickly as they are imagined. Reliability must be maintained despite changing hardware …,Journal of Environmental Informatics,2003,19
λ-DB: an ODMG-based object-oriented DBMS,Leonidas Fegaras; Chandrasekhar Srinivasan; Arvind Rajendran; David Maier,Abstract The &lgr;-DB project at the University of Texas at Arlington aims at developingframeworks and prototype systems that address the new query optimization challenges forobject-oriented and object-relational databases; such as query nesting; multiple collectiontypes; methods; and arbitrary nesting of collections. We have already developed atheoretical framework for query optimization based on an effective calculus; called themonoid comprehension calculus [4]. The system reported here is a fully operational ODMG2.0 [2] OODB management system; based on this framework. Our system can handle mostODL declarations and can process most OQL query forms. &lgr;-DB is not ODMG compliant.Instead it supports its own C++ binding that provides a seamless integration between OQLand C++ with low impedance mismatch. It allows C++ variables to be used in queries and …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2000,19
Treating programs as objects: The computational proxy experience,David Maier; Judith B Cushing,Abstract Migrating data to a new database model presents problems if there are existingapplication programs that must continue to access the data; bu that cannot be convertedimmediately. If the target database is object-oriented; such a legacy program can beencapsulated as an object or a message. We argue that some applications will benefit fromfurther “reification” of execution instances as database objects. We introduce a“computational proxy” mechanism and our prototype implementation of it for computationalchemistry codes. We conclude with a discussion of where declarative capabilities wouldhave been a useful adjunct to object-oriented database features.,International Conference on Deductive and Object-Oriented Databases,1993,19
Incorporating computed relations in relational databases,David Maier; David S Warren,The relational algebra of the relational model of databases is unable to express certainrelations or operations of interest(for instance; the transitive closure of a relation); as Ahoand Ullman have noted [AU]. They and others have suggested various extensions to therelational algebra or alternate query languages with more computational power (Chandraand Rare1 [CH]; Codd [Co]).'The'ultimate goal of such proposals is to incorporate more ofthe computation necessary for constructing practical databases directly into the databasemanagement system itself thus leaving less to be done externally in a host language. Inanother paper we have proposed computed B relations as a way to extend the standardrelational theory of databases so that it includes more computational power [MW]. In thatpaper we present the definitions and theorems necessary to the develop-,Proceedings of the 1981 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,1981,19
Federation in cloud data management: Challenges and opportunities,Gang Chen; HV Jagadish; Dawei Jiang; David Maier; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Wang-Chiew Tan,Companies are increasingly moving their data processing to the cloud; for reasons of cost;scalability; and convenience; among others. However; hosting multiple applications andstorage systems on the same cloud introduces resource sharing and heterogeneous dataprocessing challenges due to the variety of resource usage patterns employed; the variety ofdata types stored; and the variety of query interfaces presented by those systems.Furthermore; real clouds are never perfectly symmetric-there often are differences betweenindividual processors in their capabilities and connectivity. In this paper; we introduce afederation framework to manage such heterogeneous clouds. We then use this framework todiscuss several challenges and their potential solutions.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,18
Confluence analysis for distributed programs: A model-theoretic approach,William R Marczak; Peter Alvaro; Neil Conway; Joseph M Hellerstein; David Maier,Abstract Building on recent interest in distributed logic programming; we take a model-theoretic approach to analyzing confluence of asynchronous distributed programs. We beginwith a model-theoretic semantics for Dedalus and introduce the ultimate model; whichcaptures non-deterministic eventual outcomes of distributed programs. After showing thequestion of confluence undecidable for Dedalus; we identify restricted sub-languages thatguarantee confluence while providing adequate expressivity. We observe that thesemipositive restriction Dedalus+ guarantees confluence while capturing PTIME; but showthat its restriction of negation makes certain simple and practical programs difficult to write.To remedy this; we introduce Dedalus S; a restriction of Dedalus that allows a kind ofstratified negation; but retains the confluence of Dedalus+ and similarly captures PTIME.,*,2012,18
Querying bi-level information,Sudarshan Murthy; David Maier; Lois Delcambre,Abstract In our research on superimposed information management; we have developedapplications where information elements in the superimposed layer serve to annotate;comment; restructure; and combine selections from one or more existing documents in thebase layer. Base documents tend to be unstructured or semi-structured (HTML pages; Excelspreadsheets; and so on) with marks delimiting selections. Selections in the base layer canbe programmatically accessed via marks to retrieve content and context. The applicationswe have built to date allow creation of new marks and new superimposed elements (that usemarks); but they have been browse-oriented and tend to expose the line betweensuperimposed and base layers. Here; we present a new access capability; called bi-levelqueries; that allows an application or user to query over both layers as a whole.

Specifying rule-based query optimizers in a reflective framework,Leonidas Fegaras; David Maier; Tim Sheard,Abstract Numerous structures for database query optimizers have been proposed. Many ofthose proposals aimed at automating the construction of query optimizers from some kind ofspecification of optimizer behavior. These specification frameworks do a good job ofpartitioning and modularizing the kinds of information needed to generate a query optimizer.Most of them represent at least part of this information in a rule-like form. Nevertheless; largeportions of these specifications still take a procedural form. The contributions of this work arethreefold. We present a language for specifying optimizers that captures a larger portion ofthe necessary information in a declarative manner. This language is in turn based on amodel of query rewriting where query expressions carry annotations that are propagatedduring query transformation and planning. This framework is reminiscent of inherited and …,International Conference on Deductive and Object-Oriented Databases,1993,18

When big data leads to lost data,VM Megler; David Maier,Abstract For decades; scientists bemoaned the scarcity of observational data to analyze andagainst which to test their models. Exponential growth in data volumes from ever-cheaperenvironmental sensors has provided scientists with the answer to their prayers:" big data".Now; scientists face a new challenge: with terabytes; petabytes or exabytes of data at hand;stored in thousands of heterogeneous datasets; how can scientists find the datasets mostrelevant to their research interests? If they cannot find the data; then they may as well neverhave collected it; that data is lost to them. Our research addresses this challenge; using anexisting scientific archive as our test-bed. We approach this problem in a new way: byadapting Information Retrieval techniques; developed for searching text documents; into theworld of (primarily numeric) scientific data. We propose an approach that uses a blend of …,Proceedings of the 5th Ph. D. workshop on Information and knowledge,2012,17

More commonly; big dataimplies a big variety of data sources. For example; the Center for Coastal MarginObservation and Prediction (CMOP) has multiple kinds of sensors (salinity; temperature; pH;dissolved oxygen; chlorophyll A & B) on diverse platforms (fixed station; buoy; ship;underwater robot) coming in at different rates over various spatial scales and provided atseveral quality levels (raw; preliminary; curated).

Smoothing the ROI Curve for Scientific Data Management Applications.,Bill Howe; David Maier; Laura Bright,ABSTRACT Physical scientists increasingly use large; shared data repositories to makediscoveries. The technology to manage these repositories tends to be developed ad hoc;database technology has not significantly penetrated this market. Diverse requirements;terabyte and petabyte scale; non-standard data types; and rapid change are the norm forscientific data management applications; each pose challenges for existing technology. Inthis paper; we argue that traditional database systems are too monolithic anduncompromising to be generally successful in these extreme environments. We argue thatthese negative characteristics are reflected in the crooked shape of the Return OnInvestment curve; and that a smoother ROI can be achieved by adopting a few simplestrategies. We then describe our experiences applying these strategies to build data …,CIDR,2007,17
Dataspaces: A new abstraction for information management,Alon Y Halevy; Michael J Franklin; David Maier,Abstract Most data management scenarios today rarely have a situation in which all the datathat needs to be managed can fit nicely into a conventional relational DBMS; or into anyother single data model or system. Instead; we see a set of loosely connected data sources;typically with the following recurring challenges:–Users want be able to search the entirecollection without having knowledge of individual sources; their schemas or interfaces. Insome cases; they merely want to know where the information exists as a starting point tofurther exploration.–An organization may want to enforce certain rules; integrity constraints;or conventions (eg; on naming entities) across the entire collection; or track flow and lineagebetween systems. Furthermore; the organization needs to create a coherent external view ofthe data.–The administrators may want to impose a single “support system” in terms of …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2006,17
A dynamic tree-locking protocol,Albert Croker; David Maier,The tree-locking protocol proposed by Silberschatz and Kedem 5 guarantees transactionschedules that are both serializable and deadlock-free. The tree-locking protocol assumesthe existence of a partial order defined over all of the objects in a database. Requiring alltransactions to be tree-locked with respect to this single partial order limits the degree ofconcurrency obtainable in a database system by increasing the potential for conflict betweentransactions. In this paper we define a new locking protocol that is derived from the tree-locking protocol; but allows a changing set of partial orders to be defined over the objects ina database. We call this protocol dynamic tree-locking.,Data Engineering; 1986 IEEE Second International Conference on,1986,17
Capturing episodes: may the frame be with you,David Maier; Michael Grossniklaus; Sharmadha Moorthy; Kristin Tufte,Abstract We are interested in detecting episodes in a data stream that are characterized by aperiod of time over which a condition holds; usually with a minimum duration. For example;we might want to know whenever any router has a packet-drop rate above 0.3%continuously for more than two minutes. Such episodes can be interesting in their own rightfor monitoring purposes; but they can also specify target regions for examination over theoriginal or other stream. For instance; for each router-drop episode we detect; we might wantto count the number of control messages the router received. We assert the keyrequirements are to detect the episodes; detect them accurately; and detect them promptly.Current capabilities for data-stream management systems (DSMSs) include functionality;such as pattern-matching and windowed aggregates; that can help with detecting some …,Proceedings of the 6th ACM International Conference on Distributed Event-Based Systems,2012,16
Superimposed information architecture for digital libraries,David W Archer; Lois ML Delcambre; Fabio Corubolo; Lillian Cassel; Susan Price; Uma Murthy; David Maier; Edward A Fox; Sudarshan Murthy; John Mccall; Kiran Kuchibhotla; Rahul Suryavanshi,Abstract A variety of software tools commonly used in research and industry allow a user toselect (usually contiguous) segments of content to be annotated; referenced; or otherwisedistinguished from a containing document. However; digital libraries (DLs) often curate onlyfull documents; not these selected sub-documents. Thus; sub-documents in a DL may nothave the full complement of metadata; and they may not be visible using DL browse andsearch facilities. We are interested in explicit representation of sub-documents in a DLenvironment. In this paper; we show how sub-documents may be represented and curated.We focus on the explicit representation of what we call a mark-an encapsulated address of asub-document along with associated context. Our contributions are: a software architecturefor representing marks as first-class objects together with regular documents in a DL; and …,International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries,2008,16
Representing roles in universal scheme interfaces,David Maier; David Rozenshtein; Jacob Stein,Users of a relational database must explicitly navigate between relations in order toestablish a connection among a set of attributes spanning several relation schemes. While auniversal scheme interface to a relational database provides users with automaticnavigation; it usually imposes on the database a unique role assumption. This assumptionrequires every attribute name to represent a unique role in the database; so that connectionsamong sets of attributes are unambiguous.,IEEE transactions on software engineering,1985,16
Correcting faults in write-once memory,Danny Dolev; David Maier; Ilarry Mairson; Jeffrey Ullman,We consider codes for write-once memory in tile presence of stuck-agO and stuebat--1faults. Such fault.-tolerant codes generally require less redundancy than error-correctingcodes; as faults detected during the writing process can affect subsequent behavior of thatprocess. We present pointer codes; which use part of a codeword to point to faults in otherparts of the codeword. A pointer code can encode n-bit messages in the presence of f faultswith only f (log 2 n+ o (1)) redundancy. We derive a lower bound on the redundancy of sucha fault-tolerant code of slightly less than f log n. We also examine some models where allstuck-at inforIlmtion is known in advance; and analyze the expected redundancy of pointercodes.,Proceedings of the sixteenth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing,1984,16

Such an approach is best conducted with thebenefit of data-rich environments; where information from sensors and models is openlyaccessible within convenient timeframes.

Finding haystacks with needles: Ranked search for data using geospatial and temporal characteristics,Veronika Margaret Megler; David Maier,Abstract The past decade has seen an explosion in the number and types of environmentalsensors deployed; many of which provide a continuous stream of observations. Eachindividual observation consists of one or more sensor measurements; a geographic location;and a time. With billions of historical observations stored in diverse databases and inthousands of datasets; scientists have difficulty finding relevant observations. We present anapproach that creates consistent geospatial-temporal metadata from large repositories ofdiverse data by blending curated and automated extracts. We describe a novel querymethod over this metadata that returns ranked search results to a query with geospatial andtemporal search criteria. Lastly; we present a prototype that demonstrates the utility of theseideas in the context of an ocean and coastalmargin observatory.,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2011,15
NEXMark–A Benchmark for Queries over Data Streams (DRAFT),Pete Tucker; Kristin Tufte; Vassilis Papadimos; David Maier,A lot of research has focused recently on executing queries over data streams. This recentattention is due to the large number of data streams available; and the desire to get answersto queries on these streams in real time. There are many sources of data streams:environmental sensor networks; network routing traces; financial transactions and cellphone call records. Many systems are currently under development to execute queries overdata streams [BW01; CCC+02; MF02; NDM+00; SH98]. Further; many ideas have beenpresented to improve the execution of queries over data streams [ABB+02; MSHR02;TMSF02]. It is important to be able to measure the effectiveness of this work. To this end; wepresent the Niagara Extension to XMark benchmark (NEXMark). This is a work in progress.We are circulating it now for feedback.

Query optimization in object-oriented database systems: The REVELATION project,Goetz Graefe; David Maier,Abstract We are exploring a scheme that allows optimizing queries over object-orienteddatabases with encapsulated behavior. Objects and classes will be able to reveal theirbehavior in terms of expressions in an algebraic language interpreted by a structural object-oriented database system. An object or class can agree or refuse to reveal its behavior. Thestructural algebra is richer than relational algebra as it includes operators on complex objectcollections; and updates and traversals of individual objects. Objects may reveal to theoptimizer the structural access paths used by their procedures or cost and other statisticsuseful for query optimization. The main features of our approach is that the object-orienteduser interface language is able to perform general computation and to preserve theencapsulation envelope around classes and types.,*,1988,15
Merge as a lattice-join of xml documents,Kristin Tufte; David Maier,Abstract We explore theoretical foundations of the Merge operation. Merge functions as akind of “recursive union” over similarly structured XML documents to produce a new XMLdocument; and can be used for creating aggregates over streams of XML fragments. Wedescribe the Merge operation and show that Merge is in fact the join operation of an uppersemi-lattice of conformant documents. Our work relies on a representation of unordered XMLdocuments as sets of attributed paths. We have found this representation useful forcomparing the information content of documents; and determining when a given documentsatisfies certain key-like constraints.,28th Intl. Conf. VLDB,2002,14
Bambi meets Godzilla: Object databases for scientific computing,David Maier; David M Hansen,Object-oriented databases (OODBs) are in many ways a better match for scientific datamanagement than conventional record-oriented database systems. User-defined datatypesreduce the encoding going from a scientific domain to the database. Direct support forcomplex objects is useful for capturing hierarchical structures; such as molecules. OODBsgenerally have collection types; such as lists and arrays; that are a better basis than sets forthe dimensional data common in scientific applications. Their inherent extensibility seems agood match for handling new kinds of metadata; and having behavior definable in thedatabase permits transparent access to existing data in multiple formats via a commonobject model. We describe our experiences with using BODBs for scientific data; in thedomains of computational chemistry; and materials science.

Filtering; punctuation; windows and synopses,David Maier; Peter A Tucker; Minos Garofalakis,Abstract This chapter addresses some of the problems raised by the high-volume;nonterminating nature of many data streams. We begin by outlining challenges for queryprocessing over such streams; such as outstripping CPU or memory resources; operatorsthat wait for the end of input and unbounded query state. We then consider varioustechniques for meeting those challenges. Filtering attempts to reduce stream volume inorder to save on system resources. Punctuations incorporate semantics on the structure of astream into the stream itself; and can help unblock query operators and reduce the state theymust retain. Windowing modifies a query so that processing takes place on finite subsets offull streams. Synopses are compact; efficiently maintained summaries of data that canprovide approximate answers to particular queries.,*,2005,13
Emergent semantics: Towards self-organizing scientific metadata,Bill Howe; Kuldeep Tanna; Paul Turner; David Maier,Abstract Tasked with designing a metadata management system for a large scientific datarepository; we find that the customary database application development procedure exhibitsseveral disadvantages in this environment. Data cannot be accessed until the system is fullydesigned and implemented; specialized data modeling skills are required to design anappropriate schema; and once designed; such schemas are intolerant of change. Weminimize setup and maintenance costs by automating the database design; data load; anddata transformation tasks. Data creators are responsible only for extracting data fromheterogeneous sources according to a simple RDF-based data model. The system thenloads the data into a generic RDBMS schema.

Dealing with disorder,Peter A Tucker; David Maier,Abstract Often; queries over data streams require input that is ordered in somepredetermined way. This order may simply be arrival order or given explicitly on specificattributes; such as timestamp or sequence numbers. For various reasons; data in a streammay not arrive in the expected order. We first introduce a new operator; called the punctuateoperator; which is one way to embed punctuations into a data stream. We then discuss twoways for handling disorder in data streams; and compare them to how disorder can beaddressed using punctuations embedded with the punctuate operator.,MPDS; June,2003,12

Join-order optimization with Cartesian products,Bennet Vance,Abstract Join-order optimization plays a central role in the processing of relational databasequeries. This dissertation presents two new algorithms for join-order optimization: adeterministic; exhaustive-search algorithm; and a stochastic algorithm that is based on thedeterministic one. The deterministic algorithm achieves new complexity bounds forexhaustive search in join-order optimization; and in timing tests; both algorithms are shownto run many times faster than their predecessors. In addition; these new; fast algorithmssearch a larger space of join orders than is customary in join-order optimization.

Connecting scientific programs and data using object databases,Judith Bayard Cushing; David Hansen; David Maier; Carlton Pu,Abstract Scientific applications and databases rarely interoperate easily.

Metadata records with a value that is proximate to auser-entered search parameter can be identified. A proximity score can be calculated foreach identified metadata record.

Explicitly representing superimposed information in a conceptual model,Sudarshan Murthy; Lois Delcambre; David Maier,Abstract Superimposed information (SI) refers to new information such as annotations andsummaries overlaid on fragments of existing base information (BI) such as web pages andPDF documents. Each BI fragment is referenced using an encapsulated address called amark. Based on the widespread applicability of SI and wide range of superimposedapplications (SAs) that can be built; we consider here how to represent marks explicitly in aconceptual model for an SA. The goal of this work is to facilitate the development of SAs bymaking it easy to model SI (including the marks) and to exploit the middleware and querycapability that we have developed for managing marks and interacting with the baseapplications.

Supporting display generation for complex database objects,Belinda B Flynn; David Maier,Many database user interfaces are favoring a style in which the main mode of interaction isediting and browsing data objects-the interface produces the effect of directly affecting thedata as if they were concrete objects. Several visual database interfaces have adopted thisstyle to enable users to access databases more effectively without extensive training orknowledge of the database schema. Domain-specific database applications most likelywould receive similar benefits by having such interfaces. The overall objective of thisresearch is to develop support for creating such interfaces in applications that deal withcomplex database objects. Presently; database applications that support visual interfaces oncomplex objects do so without much help from the DBMS. With record-oriented data models;the responsibility for displaying structured objects is typically associated with the …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1992,10

Mistaking identity,Jacob Stein; T Lougenia Anderson; David Maier,Abstract We examine the use and abuse of identity in object-oriented data managementsystems. We then examine mechanisms for reducing the abuse while preserving theadvantages of identity. In particular; we are concerned with reintroducing traditionaldatabase amenities; such as value based reference; that have been lost in the transitionfrom traditional data management systems.,Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Database Programming Languages; Salishan Lodge; Gleneden Beach; Oregon; USA,1990,10
The revenge of the JD,David Maier; Jeffrey D Ullman; Moshe Y Vardi,Abstract Manifestations of the" universal relation assumption" can be seen either asdefinitions of a one-relation user view of data; or as algorithms for answering queries aboutarbitrary sets of attributes. In this paper we explore equivalences between these two pointsof view. We show that if the user's view is the representative instance; then our ability toanswer queries about the universal relation; by applying relational algebra to the actualdatabase; is equivalent to a" boundedness" condition on the dependencies of the databasescheme. Further; whenever this condition holds; there is a finite union of lossless tableaumappings that produces the desired relation.,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD symposium on Principles of database systems,1983,10
Natural language database updates,Sharon C Salveter; David Maier,Abstract Although a great deal of research effort has been expended in support of naturallanguage (NL) database querying; little effort has gone to NL database< u> update</u>. Onereason for this state of affairs is that in NL querying; one can tie nouns and stative verbs inthe query to database objects (relation names; attributes and domain values). In many casesthis correspondence seems sufficient to interpret NL queries. NL update seems to requiredatabase counterparts for active verbs; such as" hire;"" schedule" and" enroll;" rather than forstative entities. There seem to be no natural candidates to fill this role. We suggest adatabase counterpart for active verbs; which we call< u> verbgraphs</u>. The verbgraphsmay be used to support NL update. A verbgraph is a structure for representing the variousdatabase changes that a given verb might describe. In addition to describing the variants …,Proceedings of the 20th annual meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics,1982,10
User trust and judgments in a curated database with explicit provenance,David W Archer; Lois ML Delcambre; David Maier,Abstract We focus on human-in-the-loop; information-integration settings where users gatherand evaluate data from a broad variety of sources and where the levels of trust in sourcesand users change dynamically. In such settings; users must use their judgment as theycollect and modify data. As an example; a battlefield information officer preparing a report toinform his or her superiors about the current state of affairs must gather and integrate datafrom many (including non-computerized) sources. By tracking multiple sources for individualvalues; the officer may eliminate a value from the current state whenever all of the sourceswhere this value was found are no longer trusted. We define a conceptual model for acurated database with provenance for such settings; the Multi-granularity; Multi-provenanceModel (MMP); which supports multiple insertions and multiple (copy-and-) paste …,*,2013,9
The curriculum forecast for Portland: cloudy with a chance of data,Michael Grossniklaus; David Maier,Abstract With the advent of cloud computing; new data management technologies andsystems have emerged that differ from existing databases in important ways. As aconsequence; universities are currently facing the challenge of integrating these topics intotheir curriculum in order to prepare students for the changed IT landscape. In this report; wedescribe the approach we have taken at Portland State University to teach datamanagement in the cloud.

Streaming Queries,*,Computers are very effective at storing large amounts of data; such as in a database. Over thelast half century or so; techniques have been refined for establishing computational options;such as accessing or querying the stored data; viewing the data; modifying the data; etc. In thesescenarios; the data can be thought of as relatively static and so the techniques; such as databasequerying techniques tend not to be very applicable to time sensitive scenarios; such as thoseinvolving real-time or near real-time. For instance; a database query technique designed to retrievea definition of a word from a dictionary database need not be time sensitive since the data isstatically stored in the database … In contrast; other scenarios tend to be involve streamingdata in real-time or near real-time.

DB: An ODMG-Based Object-Oriented DBMS,Leonidas Fegaras; Chandrasekhar Srinivasan; Arvind Rajendran; David Maier,The A-DB project at the University of Texas at Arlington aims at developing frameworks andprototype systems that address the new query optimization challenges for object-orientedand object-relational databases; such as query nesting; multiple collection types; methods;and arbitrary nesting of collections. We have already developed a theoretical framework forquery optimization based on an effective calculus; called the monoid comprehensioncalculus [4]. The system reported here is a fully operational ODMG 2.0 [2] OODBmanagement system; based on this framework. Our system can handle most ODLdeclarations and can process most OQL query forms.

Updatable and evolvable transforms for virtual databases,James F Terwilliger; Lois ML Delcambre; David Maier; Jeremy Steinhauer; Scott Britell,Abstract Applications typically have some local understanding of a database schema; avirtual database that may differ significantly from the actual schema of the data where it isstored. Application engineers often support a virtual database using custom-builtmiddleware because the available solutions; including updatable views; are unable toexpress necessary capabilities. We propose an alternative means of mapping a virtualdatabase to a physical database that guarantees they remain synchronized under data orschema updates against the virtual schema. One constructs a mapping by composingchannel transformations (CTs) that encapsulate atomic transformations---including complextransformations such as pivoting---with known updatability properties.

Scientific mashups: Runtime-configurable data product ensembles,Bill Howe; Harrison Green-Fishback; David Maier,Abstract Mashups are gaining popularity as a rapid-development; re-use-orientedprogramming model to replace monolithic; bottom-up application development. Thisprogramming style is attractive for the “long tail” of scientific data management applications;characterized by exploding data volumes; increasing requirements for data sharing andcollaboration; but limited software engineering budgets. We observe that scientists alreadyroutinely construct a primitive; static form of mashup—an ensemble of related visualizationsthat convey a specific scientific message encoded as; eg; a Powerpoint slide. Inspired bytheir ubiquity; we adopt these conventional data-product ensembles as a core model; endowthem with interactivity; publish them online; and allow them to be repurposed at runtime bynon-programmers. We observe that these scientific mashups must accommodate a wider …,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2009,8
Exploiting punctuation semantics in data streams,Pete Tucker; David Maier,Applications that process data streams are becoming common. These applications are oftenqueries over streams; so it seems natural to use a database management system instead ofa custom application. However; some traditional relational operators are not conducive tostream processing. We propose embedding punctuations into data streams. A punctuation isa predicate that describes a subset of tuples. It informs a stream processor that no tuplesexist after that punctuation that satisfy its predicate.,Data Engineering; 2002.

Computational objects in object-oriented data models,Jianhua Zhu; David Maier,Abstract Computational objects—objects with functional interpretations—are a valuableaddition to structural objects in object-oriented data models for engineering CAD/CAMapplications. We argue that the graph reduction technique from functional programming canbe naturally blended with data models supporting complex objects and be used as a basistowards adding computational semantics to structural semantics in such data models. Wepresent such an effort in an object-oriented data model: TEDM. We discuss a design of thegraph memory; an implementation of a computational engine in Prolog; and the semantics ofmixing pattern matching; reduction and imperative action in data manipulation languages.,Proceedings of the second international workshop on Database programming languages,1989,8
Fast and adaptive indexing of multi-dimensional observational data,Sheng Wang; David Maier; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract Sensing devices generate tremendous amounts of data each day; which includelarge quantities of multi-dimensional measurements. These data are expected to beimmediately available for real-time analytics as they are streamed into storage. Suchscenarios pose challenges to state-of-the-art indexing methods; as they must not onlysupport efficient queries but also frequent updates. We propose here a novel indexingmethod that ingests multi-dimensional observational data in real time. This method primarilyguarantees extremely high throughput for data ingestion; while it can be continuouslyrefined in the background to improve query efficiency. Instead of representing collections ofpoints using Minimal Bounding Boxes as in conventional indexes; we model sets ofsuccessive points as line segments in hyperspaces; by exploiting the intrinsic value …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,7
Frames: data-driven windows,Michael Grossniklaus; David Maier; James Miller; Sharmadha Moorthy; Kristin Tufte,Abstract Traditional Data Stream Management Systems (DSMS) segment data streamsusing windows that are defined either by a time interval or a number of tuples. Suchwindows are fixed---the definition unvarying over the course of a stream---and are definedbased on external properties unrelated to the data content of the stream. However; streamsand their content do vary over time---the rate of a data stream may vary or the datadistribution of the content may vary. The mismatch between a fixed stream segmentation anda variable stream motivates the need for a more flexible; expressive and physicallyindependent stream segmentation. We introduce a new stream segmentation technique;called frames. Frames segment streams based on data content. We present a theory andimplementation of frames and show the utility of frames for a variety of applications.,Proceedings of the 10th ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event-based Systems,2016,7
Lightweight indexing of observational data in log-structured storage,Sheng Wang; David Maier; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract Huge amounts of data are being generated by sensing devices every day;recording the status of objects and the environment. Such observational data is widely usedin scientific research. As the capabilities of sensors keep improving; the data produced aredrastically expanding in precision and quantity; making it a write-intensive domain. Log-structured storage is capable of providing high write throughput; and hence is a naturalchoice for managing large-scale observational data. In this paper; we propose an approachto indexing and querying observational data in log-structured storage. Based on key traits ofobservational data; we design a novel index approach called the CR-index (ContinuousRange Index); which provides fast query performance without compromising writethroughput. It is a lightweight structure that is fast to construct and often small enough to …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,7

Adaptwid: An adaptive; memory-efficient window aggregation implementation,Jin Li; Kristin Tufte; David Maier; Vassilis Papadimos,Memory efficiency is important for processing high-volume data streams. Previous stream-aggregation methods can exhibit excessive memory overhead in the presence of skeweddata distributions. Further; data skew is a common feature of massive data streams. Theauthors introduce the AdaptWID algorithm; which uses adaptive processing to cope withtime-varying data skew. AdaptWID models the memory usage of alternative aggregationalgorithms and selects between them at runtime on a group-by-group basis. The authors'experimental study using the NiagaraST stream system verifies that the adaptive algorithmimproves memory usage while maintaining execution cost and latency comparable toexisting implementations.,IEEE Internet Computing,2008,7
Toward management and imputation of unavailable data in online advanced traveler information systems,Rafael J Fernández-Moctezuma; Kristin A Tufte; David Maier; Robert L Bertini,Advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) deliver information derived from intelligenttransportation systems data. ATIS continue to emerge and grow in popularity; as some ofthese systems are public and freely available. ATIS performance and perceived usefulnessdepends; among several design factors; on the reliability and quality of its data sources;especially when the systems are reporting current conditions. We present a sample scenarioin which an inductive loop detector station along a freeway stops transmitting data; and anATIS service presents an estimated state of the system instead of showing that no data isavailable. The estimation is based on sources of available and correlated data. Our firstapproach to implement an estimation framework consists of deriving a parametricdescription of the correlation from archived historical data.

SPARCE: Superimposed Pluggable Architecture for Contexts and Excerpts,Sudarshan Murthy; David Maier,Abstract People often impose new interpretations onto existing information. In the process;they work with information in two layers: A base layer; where the original information resides;and a superimposed layer; where only the new interpretations reside. Referring to baseinformation in this manner reduces redundancy and preserves context. Superimposedinformation management (managing layered information) preserves these layers ofinformation. It facilitates superimposed applications in which people can interact withheterogeneous information sources.,OGI CSE Technical Report# CSE-03-010; 2003,2003,6
Device and physical data independence for multimedia presentations,Richard Staehli; Jonathan Walpole; David Maier,Multimedia computing promises access to any type of visual or aural medium through digitalnetworks. But can a given multimedia document be effectively accessed everywhere? Thepresentation of data must adapt to both the available communications bandwidth and theoutput device resolution. Current multimedia systems assume that applications require thehighest possible quality and handle resource overloads through ad hoc methods; such asvideo frame dropping. To support a variety of applications with lower quality requirements;we need both new standards for scalable data encoding and new techniques forcommunicating application quality requirements. This paper describes a new approach forspecifying quality of service(QoS) requirements based on functionality rather than on dataencoding and device capabilities.

The world of scientific computation is far from perfect; and its rich legacy of data andprograms carries a major disadvantage: lack of interoperability.

Abstract object in an object-oriented data model,Jianhua Zhu; David Maier,Abstract This paper introduces abstract object as an extension to an object-oriented datamodel. An abstract object is essentially a template for regular database objects. It can beused for various kinds of matching in database queries and for the structural portion of typedefinitions. In a sense; abstract objects are similar to nonground terms in some logicsystems; but with the ability to put structural constraints on the binding of a variable. Wepresent abstract objects in the context of the TEDM object-oriented data model. We showhow to represent database commands using abstract objects and investigate the semanticsof pattern-matching using abstract objects. We then cover implementation techniques; usesfor abstract objects other than pattern matching and ideas for extensions to the model.,*,1987,6

In prior work; we hypothesized thatInformation Retrieval-style ranked search can be applied to data sets to help a scientistdiscover the most relevant data amongst the thousands of data sets in many formats; muchlike text-based ranked search helps users make sense of the vast number of Internetdocuments.

Helping scientists reconnect their datasets,Abdussalam Alawini; David Maier; Kristin Tufte; Bill Howe,Abstract It seems inevitable that the datasets associated with a research project proliferateover time: collaborators may extend datasets with new measurements and new attributes;new experimental runs result in new files with similar structures; and subsets of data areextracted for independent analysis. As these" residual" datasets begin to accrete over time;scientists can lose track of the derivation history that connects them; complicating datasharing; provenance tracking; and scientific reproducibility.

Although much attentionhas been paid to the issues in building components for these services; not enough attentionhas been paid to their deployment—specifically to distribution. We believe that matching thelocation of executable and data components to the needs of patrons and digital libraries canimprove the overall system performance. We describe five distribution alternatives forproviding superimposed information services in a digital library and discuss the trade-offs foreach alternative.

Adaptation space: Surviving non-maskable failures,Crispin Cowan; Lois Delcambre; Anne-Francoise Le Meur; Ling Liu; David Maier; Dylan McNamee; Michael Miller; Calton Pu; Perry Wagle; Jonathan Walpole,Abstract Some failures cannot be masked by redundancies; because an unanticipatedsituation occurred; because fault-tolerance measures were not adequate; or because therewas a security breach (which is not amenable to replication). Applications that wish tocontinue to offer some service despite nonmaskable failure must adapt to the loss ofresources. When numerous combinations of non-maskable failure modes are considered;the set of possible adaptations becomes complex. This paper presents adaptation spaces; aformalism for navigating among combinations of adaptations. An adaptation spacedescribes a collection of possible adaptations of a software component or system; andprovides a uniform way of viewing a group of alternative software adaptations.

Indexing in an Actor-Oriented Database.,Philip A Bernstein; Mohammad Dashti; Tim Kiefer; David Maier,ABSTRACT Many of today's interactive server applications are implemented using actor-oriented programming frameworks. Such applications treat actors as a distributed in-memoryobject-oriented database. However; actor programming frameworks offer few if anydatabase system features; leaving application developers to fend for themselves. It ischallenging to add such features because the design space is different than traditionaldatabase systems. The system must be scalable to a large number of servers; it must workwell with a variety of cloud storage services; and it must integrate smoothly with the actorprogramming model. We present the vision of an actor-oriented database. We then describeone component of such a system; to support indexed actors; focusing especially on details ofthe fault tolerance design.

Towards automated prediction of relationships among scientific datasets,Abdussalam Alawini; David Maier; Kristin Tufte; Bill Howe; Rashmi Nandikur,Abstract Before scientists can analyze; publish; or share their data; they often need todetermine how their datasets are related. Determining relationships helps scientists identifythe most complete version of a dataset; detect versions of datasets that complement eachother; and determine multiple datasets that overlap. In previous work; we showed howobservable relationships between two datasets help scientists recall their original derivationconnection. While that work helped with identifying relationships between two datasets; it isinfeasible for scientists to use it for finding relationships between all possible pairs in a largecollection of datasets. In order to deal with larger numbers of datasets; we are extending ourmethodology with a relationship-prediction system; ReDiscover; a tool to identify pairs from acollection of datasets that are most likely related and the relationship between them.

Support for schema evolution in data stream management systems.,James F Terwilliger; Rafael Fernández-Moctezuma; Lois ML Delcambre; David Maier,Abstract: Unlike Database Management Systems (DBMSs); Data Stream ManagementSystems (DSMSs) do not evaluate queries over static data sets—rather; they continuouslyproduce result streams to standing queries; and often operate in a context where anyinterruption can lead to data loss. Support for schema evolution in such an environment iscurrently unaddressed. In this work we address evolution in DSMSs by introducing a newelement to streams; called an accent; that precedes and describes an evolution. Wecharacterize how a subset of commonly used query operators in DSMS act on andpropagate accents with respect to three evolution primitives: Add Attribute; Drop Attribute;and Alter Data.,J.

Efficient Scheduling and Execution of Scientific Workflow Tasks.,Laura Bright; David Maier,Abstract Large-scale scientific workflows are often characterized by tasks that produce orconsume large amounts of data (frequently both) and generate large volumes of deriveddata products. Minimizing the end-to-end running time of a set of workflow tasks is importantto deliver data products in a timely manner and free up processors to accomodate additionalworkflows. A single workflow task may perform the same computations on multiple files;presenting many opportunities for concurrent execution on multiple nodes of a Grid. Inaddition; many different tasks may operate on the same large input files. An importantchallenge to efficient workflow execution on multiple nodes is determining an assignment oftasks to nodes. Processor and network speeds may vary at different times; workflow tasksmay be modified; and new workflows may be added. In this paper we examine algorithms …,SSDBM,2005,4
Enhancements of personal information,David Maier; Alon Halevy; Marcia Bates; Harry Bruce; Ben Bederson; Mel Knox,Personal information as initially encountered can often be very raw; fragmentary; or partiallyrelevant; it may come from disparate sources with differing format and structures. Hencethere have been many proposals to enhance it in various ways to make it more useful for thetask at hand; to improve later findability; or to record and reuse human analysis andjudgment connected with it. Enhancements typically involve adding more data to personalinformation or adding links between previously unconnected pieces of personal information;but can involve deletions or removal of extraneous relationships. This breakout groupdiscussed the kinds of enhancements that have been considered (or should be considered);the variety of reasons for enhancing personal information; and the issues that arise indevising enhancement methods. We recount our discussions on each in turn.,Breakout Group Summary; PIM Workshop,2005,4
The hybrid technique for reference materialization in object query processing,Quan Wang; David Maier; Leonard Shapiro,Resolving object references; or reference materialization; is a fundamental operation inobject query evaluation. Existing reference materialization techniques fall into twocategories: pointer-based and value-based. We identify several drawbacks of existingtechniques and propose a hybrid technique that combines the advantages of each category.This technique relaxes the limitations of value-based techniques; while preserving much oftheir performance advantage over pointer-based techniques; it performs well in those caseswhere no existing algorithm is applicable or efficient. The hybrid technique shows evenstronger performance advantages when moving from single-valued to collection-valuedattributes. We present algebraic transformations to enable the hybrid technique in a rule-based query optimizer.

Specification and generation of displays for complex database objects,Belinda B Flynn; David Maier,Abstract The overall objective of this research is to provide support for producing interactivedisplays of complex database objects. In particular; the generat; ed displays sho~ tld be ableto express the semantics and behavior of the ustderlyi~ lg dat. a; in order to promote thefeeling of directly affecting the data as concrete objects. Our approach is to move displaymanage~ nent from the application program to a display system that generates and operatesdisplays; and directly accesses database objects according to user request;^ made throughthe displays. Thus; the application program is only concerned with how and when displaysare created; not how they operatr.. Designing the display facility involves two major parts: 1)the specification techniques used to describe the desired display; and 3) a runtime syst; emthat produces the displays from specifications. A main issue to address in the design is …,*,1992,4
PROTEUS: the DBMS user interface as an object,T Lougenia Anderson; Earl F Ecklund; David Maier,Abstract Our thesis is that the external representation of all components of a databasesystem should be under programmer control: objects; schemes; commands; even therepresentation specifications themselves. Here we give the rationale and design for thePROTEUS interface system that sits atop an object-oriented DBMS. After introducing themodel; TEDM; for the DBMS; we describe the classes of objects that model components ofthe database of interest to PROTEUS: type definitions; representation definitions; layouts;commands; and representation mappings. The advantage of “objectifying” everything isthree-fold: the database itself can manage all the information of interest to PROTEUS;representation can be changed via database updates; and the representation mappingsthemselves can be expressed as database commands or rules. We conclude by showing …,*,1991,4

Finding augmented-set bases,Virgil Gligor; David Maier,The problem of finding a minimum-cost; augmented-set basis is NP-complete. In this paperwe show that this problem is not approximable. That is; if P≠NP; then no constants c and dexist so that A\leqqcASB+d; where A is the cost provided by a polynomial-timeapproximation algorithm and ASB is the optimal cost. We also provide a briefcharacterization of the cost functions for which this result remains valid. The proof techniqueused in the augmented-set basis problem is applied directly to other NP-complete problems;such as several graph augmentation and deletion problems; to show that they are also notapproximable.,SIAM Journal on Computing,1982,4
A space efficient method for the lowest common ancestor problem and an application to finding negative cycles,David Maier,We present a method of storing infor- mation in a tree which assists in quickly finding the lowestcornmon ancestor of two nodes in the tree. We begin in Section II by presenting the generalmethod; giving algorithms for the operations of inserting a node in the tree; grafting a subtreefrom one part of the tree to another; finding the ancestor of a node at a specified depth in thetree; and finding the lowest common an- cestor of two nodes. The structure we im- pose on thetree turns out to be a general- ization of that of van Emde Boas; Kaas and Zijlstra[12]; althoughwe use the structure in a somewhat different manner. We derive time and space bounds for theseoperations; in terms of a parameter; G. In section III we see how the complexity of these procedurescan be tailored; by letting G = G(n); where n is the number of nodes in our tree; and give a hypotheticalexample for which we perform the tailoring. We also compare …,Foundations of Computer Science; 1977.; 18th Annual Symposium on,1977,4

Tags in domain-specific sites: new information?,Jeremy Steinhauer; Lois ML Delcambre; David Maier; Marianne Lykke; Vu H Tran,Abstract If researchers use tags in retrieval applications they might assume; implicitly; thattags represent novel information; eg; when they attribute performance improvement in theirretrieval algorithm (s) to the use of tags. In this work; we investigate whether this assumptionis true. We focus on the use of tags in domain-specific websites because such websites aremore likely to have a coherent; discernible website structure and because the users that aresearching for and tagging pages in such a site may have specific information needs (asopposed to the broad range of information needs that users have when browsing/searchingthe Internet at large). For this study; we assume that the application of the same tag tomultiple pages provides an indication that those pages are related. To determine whetherthis indication of relatedness is contributing new information; we first measure whether …,Proceedings of the 11th annual international ACM/IEEE joint conference on Digital libraries,2011,3
Toward formal semantics for data and schema evolution in data stream management systems,Rafael J Fernández-Moctezuma; James F Terwilliger; Lois ML Delcambre; David Maier,Abstract Data Stream Management Systems (DSMSs) do not statically respond to issuedqueries—rather; they continuously produce result streams to standing queries; and oftenoperate in a context where any interruption can lead to data loss. Support for schemaevolution in continuous query processing is currently unaddressed. In this work we addressevolution in DSMSs by proposing semantics for three evolution primitives: Add Attribute andDrop Attribute (schema evolution); and Alter Data (data evolution). We characterize how asubset of commonly used query operators in a DSMS act on and propagate these primitives.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2009,3

Managing the Forecast Factory,Laura Bright; David Maier; Bill Howe,The CORIE forecast factory consists of a set of data product generation runs that areexecuted daily on dedicated local resources. The goal is to maximize productivity andresource utilization while still ensuring timely completion of all forecasts. Many existingworkflow management systems address low-level workflow specification and executionchallenges; but do not directly address the high-level challenges posed by large-scale dataproduct factories. In this paper we discuss several specific challenges to managing theCORIE forecast factory including planning and scheduling; improving data flow; andanalyzing log data; and point out their analogs in the" physical" manufacturing world. Wepresent solutions we have implemented to address these challenges; and presentexperimental results that show the benefits of these solutions.,Data Engineering Workshops; 2006.

Retrofitting a Data Model to Existing Environmental Data.,Bill Howe; David Maier,Abstract Environmental data repositories are frequently stored as a collection of packedbinary files arranged in an intricate directory structure; rather than in a database. In previouswork; we 1) show that environmental data is often logically equipped with a topological gridstructure and 2) provide a data model and algebra of gridfields for manipulating suchgridded datasets. In this paper; we show how to expose native data sources as gridfieldswithout preprocessing; bulkloading; or other prohibitively expensive operations. Wedescribe native directory structures and file contents using a simple schema languagebased on nested; variable-length arrays. This language is capable of describing generalbinary file formats as well as custom formats such as those used in the CORIEEnvironmental Observation and Forecasting System.

Looking for the objects in object-relational DBMSs (panel),Lougie Anderson; Mike Carey; Ken Jacobs; Erin Kinikin; David Maier,Abstract The Relational Model first came into vogue in the early 1980's. It was based on thesimplifying idea that all data could be modeled as mathematical relations (tables in" normalform"). Permissible operations on this table data structure were specified by the relationalgebra and calculus. The Relational Model led to years of research in areas such as querylanguages; query optimization; transaction models; and database design methodologies.This research has dominated DBMS conferences for the last fifteen years and has also leadto major products offerings in wide-spread use in the computer industry today. While theRelational revolution was happening in the DBMS community there was a minority opinionemerging from the object community. This minority opinion surfaced in heated debates andpanels at DBMS conferences where it was often pitted against" relational purists." The …,ACM SIGPLAN Notices,1997,3
The data that you won't find in databases: tutorial panel on data exchange formats,Peter Buneman; David Maier,Data exchange formats were originally devised for moving data between programs andbetween groups of researchers in a platform-independent file format. They are mostly self-describing; containing data element definitions along with the base data; though in somecases they involve a standardized external data dictionary. DXS allow exchange of datastructures between programs; not just byte streams. They tend not to support a behavioralcomponent as part of the interchange format; though some have assertions and derived dataelements. They are typically implemented as a procedure library that is linked with anapplication; along with some stand-alone utilities; An interesting phenomenon is that DXSare being used for data management; alt bough they were originally intended for dataexchange.

Specifying a database system to itself,David Maier,Abstract Query processors have long been monolithic pieces of software that resistextension. Query capabilities are needed in many applications of persistent object bases;but object models and storage managers are evolving so rapidly that matching a monolithicquery processor to each of them is infeasible. The EREQ project seeks to structure objectquery processors into well-defined software components that can be independentlymodified; extended and exchanged. This paper sets forth our initial ideas on what the majorcomponents will be and how we will specify the interfaces to each.,*,1992,3
The proteus bibliography: Representation and interactive display in databases,T Lougenia Anderson; Earl F Ecklund; David Maier,The study of database systems has largely overlooked the display of data; even thoughdatabase applications typically contain more code for data display and entry than for datamanipulation.

With the advent of object-orienteddatabase systems that support complex objects and multiple connectivity; a fixed format fordisplaying the results of queries is no longer adequate.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1986,3
Capturing more meaning in databases,David Maier,Abstract: Users must understand the meaning of a database before they can intelligentlyinterpret the data in it. We explore the problem of making databases selfdescriptive. We firstexamine the levels of semantics of data by analogy to the area of programming languages.Next; we consider several semantic data models; which are formal languages for conceptualdata description; and how a semantic description can be linked to the objects in a database.We discuss the advantages of making a semantic description part of a database itself andthe types of application programs that would use that description. In particular; we focus onpique; a high-level relational query language that uses such semantic information.,Journal of Management Information Systems,1984,3

Towards execution guarantees for stream queries,Rafael J Fernández-Moctezuma; David Maier; Kristin A Tufte,The unbounded nature of data streams and the low-latency requirements of streamprocessing present interesting challenges in Data Stream Management System (DSMS)design. Streaming query operators are typically designed to produce results with lowlatency; as well as to efficiently manage their state. Stream-progress delimitation techniques;such as punctuation; can help query operators achieve these goals. In this work; we look atderiving execution guarantees with respect to result production and state management forcomplete queries over punctuated streams. These guarantees are derived before queryexecution. We formalize notions of successful stream processing at an operator level; andextend these definitions to stream queries as a whole.

Algebraic unnesting for nested queries,Quan Wang; David Maier; Leonard Shapiro,ABSTRACT Both relational and object query languages allow nested queries (queries withsub-queries). Nested queries are typically inefficient to execute in their original form [K82];and are difficult to optimize. Most existing query unnesting techniques are based on source-to-source; query graph; or calculus transformations; few are based on algebraictransformations. Algebraic unnesting is desirable for cost-based algebraic optimization;because it allows such optimizers to be more readily extended with unnesting capabilities.Also it facilitates more integrated unnesting; transformation; costing; and pruning duringoptimization. However; the existing algebraic approaches [CM93; S95] apply to a limitedsubset of nested queries. In many cases; they cannot unnest sub-queries that containcollection-valued attributes. In this paper; we propose a sound and complete rule set and …,*,1999,2

This paper reports on our experiences in applying TEDM; anobject-oriented logic-based data ntodel; to the problem of nzodeliizg CSG solids. In addition;we report on a new representation for the spatial relationships between CSG primitivesbased on constraints. These constraints are nzodeled as first-class objects in TEDM; andhence are available explicitly to programs for reasoning about properties oj the resultingCSG representation. Further; the constraint mechanism supports information hiding;provides support for capturing tolercncing injormation jor a CSG solid; allowspartiallyspecified solids; and appears appropriate for the design system user interface.,*,1988,2

Sorting through this collection to findneeded information can be a formidable and timeconsuming task. The electronic medicalrecord (EMR) offers some hope of improving access to patient information; but may createnew problems for the health professional who must navigate through digital information;where traditional document boundaries are not necessarily easy to discern. We are focusingon the problem of familiarization where a physician or other healthcare professional ispresented with the medical record for a new patient. How can the physician get a feeling forthe overall medical condition of this patient? How can a physician locate the informationrelevant to the patient's current problem? More generally; how can a physician become …,*,1900,2
Minimizing data movement through query transformation,Patrick Leyshock; David Maier; Kristin Tufte,Reducing data movement between desktop analytic systems and server-based datamanagement systems is an important resource-management challenge. The systempresented in this paper automatically minimizes data movement in these “hybrid” analyticsystems through rewrite-based query-transformation techniques pioneered in relationaldatabase query optimization. We evaluate different classes of transformations both in termsof query improvement and optimization time.,Big Data (Big Data); 2014 IEEE International Conference on,2014,1
Data movement in hybrid analytic systems: a case for automation,Patrick Leyshock; David Maier; Kristin Tufte,Abstract Hybrid data analysis systems integrate an analytic tool and a data managementtool. While hybrid systems have benefits; in order to be effective data movement between thetwo hybrid components must be minimized. Through experimental results we demonstratethat under workloads whose inputs vary in size; shape; and location; automation is the onlypractical way to manage data movement in hybrid systems.,Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2014,1
Guiding Data-Driven Transportation Decisions,Kristin A Tufte; Basem Elazzabi; Nathan Hall; Morgan Harvey; Kath Knobe; David Maier; Veronika Margaret Megler,Abstract Urban transportation professionals are under increasing pressure to perform data-driven decision making and to provide data-driven performance metrics. This pressurecomes from sources including the federal government and is driven; in part; by the increasedvolume and variety of transportation data available. This sudden increase of data is partiallya result of improved technology for sensors and mobile devices as well as reduced deviceand storage costs. However; using this proliferation of data for decisions and performancemetrics is proving to be difficult. In this paper; we describe a proposed structure for a systemto support data-driven decision making. A primary goal of this system is improving the use ofhuman time; effort and attention with side benefits of improved consistency anddocumentation.,*,2014,1
Physically Independent Stream Merging,Badrish Chandramouli; David Maier; Jonathan Goldstein,A facility for merging equivalent data streams can support multiple capabilities in a datastream management system (DSMS); such as query-plan switching and high availability.One can logically view a data stream as a temporal table of events; each associated with alifetime (time interval) over which the event contributes to output. In many applications; the"same" logical stream may present itself physically in multiple physical forms; for example;due to disorder arising in transmission or from combining multiple sources; andmodifications of earlier events. Merging such streams correctly is challenging when thestreams may differ physically in timing; order; and composition. This paper introduces a newstream operator called Logical Merge (LMerge) that takes multiple logically consistentstreams as input and outputs a single stream that is compatible with all of them.

Enabling revisitation of fine-grained clinical information,James F Terwilliger; Lois ML Delcambre; Judith R Logan; David Maier; David W Archer; Jeremy Steinhauer; Scott Britell,Abstract Many times when working with medical information; healthcare professionals arepresented with a summary of a patient record. When questions arise about this information itcan be useful to view the information in its original context. We propose to usesuperimposed information; defined as an information source that includes encapsulatedaddresses to potentially fine-grained information in other information sources; as a way ofenabling the ability to revisit fine-grained information. In this paper we show how the Guava(GUI-As-View) framework can be extended to define references to individual attribute valuespresent in data-bound controls in a forms-based information system. These addresses;called g-seeds; can be created directly in the user interface of a Guava-enabled informationsystem; or generated automatically for each data value returned from a query.,Proceedings of the 1st ACM International Health Informatics Symposium,2010,1
Improving travel information products via robust estimation techniques,David Maier; Kristin A Tufte; Rafael J Fernández Moctezuma,Abstract Traffic-monitoring systems; such as those using loop detectors; are prone tocoverage gaps; arising from sensor noise; processing errors and transmission problems.Such gaps adversely affect the accuracy of Advanced Traveler Information Systems. Thisproject will explore models based on historical data that can provide estimates to fill suchgaps. We build on an initial study by Mr. Rafael J. Fernandez-Moctezuma; using both alinear model and an artificial neural network (ANN) trained on historical data to estimatevalues for reporting gaps. These initial models were 80% and 89% accurate; respectively; inestimating the correct speed range; and misclassifications were always between adjacentspeed ranges (in particular; the free-flow range and congested range were never confused).Going forward; we will investigate other non-linear models; such as Gaussian Mixtures …,*,2009,1
Speeding up on-the-fly integration of DB and exo-DB data,Sudarshan Murthy; David Maier; Lois Delcambre,Applications that perform on-the-fly integration of data inside a database (DB) with “exo-DBdata”(that is; data outside a DB) are becoming common. Ease of integration and speed ofperformance are key considerations in such applications. To this end; we have devised ameans to mix data in a traditional DB with references to fine-grained exo-DB data of arbitraryformats; and a means to use “bi-level queries” to integrate DB data and exo-DB data usingexisting query languages. In this paper; we present a “bulk accessor” to speed up retrieval ofdata from a large number of exo-DB references. The bulk accessor supports differentpolicies a query processor can use to improve performance depending on datacharacteristics such as clustering. Experiments show that the bulk accessor saves 69%–90% time per query over a naïve method.,Data Engineering Workshop; 2008. ICDEW 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,1
Pay-as-You-Go information integration,David Maier; Nicolas B Rayner,1. INTRODUCTION Recently; dataspace management has been proposed as an approach thattakes a holistic view of all information in an enterprise; be it structured; semi-structured orunstructured; and whether or not it is supported by an explicit informa- tion system [1; 2]. Whileits goal is to provide services over the entirety of the data; dataspace management takes thepragmatic view that initial limits on time and effort may only permit simple services at first; suchas cataloging and keyword search. Additional services or capabilities can come later; little bylittle; as resources permit. Such a pay- as-you-go approach seeks a steady return on investment(ROI); rather than a long period of implementation before any services become available …2.

A Framework for Relationship Pattern Languages,Sudarshan Murthy; David Maier,Abstract. A relationship pattern is an abstraction of a recurring need when establishingrelationships among information elements in specific contexts. By developing or leveraginga relationship pattern; modelers can solve a class of problems once and describe manyrelationship types at once. We have developed a framework for specifying relationshippatterns and pattern languages (sets of patterns) in both modeling-language-independentand modeling-language-specific ways. We describe this framework both informally andformally. We provide examples of some commonly observed relationship patterns and showhow to use them in ER with the help of a relationship pattern language called Exemplar. Wealso provide notes on using relationship patterns in UML.,Unpublished,2005,1

Logical and Physical Data Independence for Native Scientific Data Repositories.,Bill Howe; David Maier,Abstract Many datasets in the physical sciences; especially the results of simulations; aredefined over a topological grid structure. Applications in these domains would benefit from aprincipled interface to gridded datasets via a specialized data model. Traditionally; benefitsof a data model are realized only after data is ensconced within a managed databaseenvironment. However; massive bulk-loading and reloading operations in large-scale datarepositories are prohibitively expensive. Instead; we superimpose a specialized data modelover native data repositories stored on directly on OS filesystems rather than managed by adatabase system. Views in a specialized data model can be defined via references to nativedirectory structures and file content; providing physical and logical data independence.

Enriching documents in an information portal using superimposed schematics,Shawn Bowers; Lois Delcambre; David Maier,Abstract Portals offer relevant information often with improved and customizable search.However; most portals concentrate on locating documents as opposed to enhancing theiruse. We present superimposed schematics which serve to enrich documents by adding astructured; conceptual guide for their contents. A schematic provides entity-relationship (ER)style structures integrated with marks; where each mark holds an address to an excerpt in anunderlying document.

Revisiting reference materialization techniques for object query Processing,Quan Wang; David Maier; Leonard Shapiro,Abstract Resolving object references; or reference materialization; is a fundamentaloperation in object query evaluation. Existing reference materialization techniques fall intotwo categories: pointer-based and valuebased. We identify several drawbacks of existingtechniques; and propose a hybrid technique that combines the advantages of eachcategory. This algorithm relaxes the limitations of value-based techniques; while preservingmuch of their performance advantage over pointer-based techniques. The hybrid techniqueshows even stronger performance advantages in when moving from single-valued tocollection-valued attributes. We also show how to enhance the performance of value-basedtechniques on collection-valued attributes when inverse relationships are available. Both thehybrid and enhanced value-based techniques can be easily incorporated into rule-based …,*,1999,1
Repackaging database systems,David Maier,An example of a new division of functionality: A database schema typically contains two mainkinds of information---type definitions and name declarations. In relational systems; this distinctionis a little hard to discern. A single CREATE TABLE statement both defines a table type and declaresa particular relation name to be of that type. (It initializes that name; too; for that matter.) In mostobject-oriented database systems; the distinction is quite clear. Class definitions definetypes; while a separate mechanism declares persistent variables of those types … In goingto a networked environment; it is important for type definitions (or at least their interfaces) to beavailable globally; while name spaces can still be managed locally.

Applications of object database technology in thermodynamics and materials science,R Venkatesh; David Hansen; David Maier; James T Stanley II,Abstract Over the last few decades there has been a continual development of computerprograms and databases directed at storage and manipulation of scienti c data. The datathese programs manipulate are typically kept in a proprietary format with little thought givento portability; upgrading or interfacing with other software. Hence; there is an inability toshare data across programs or between data sources. We believe that many of the dicultieswith sharing scienti c data and building on previous computational e orts result from theincompatibility of programs and data in the scienti c domain. We are involved in exploring analternative data management technology; namely object-oriented databases (OODB) todevelop solutions to these questions.

Blazes: Coordination Analysis and Placement for Distributed Programs,Peter Alvaro; Neil Conway; Joseph M Hellerstein; David Maier,Abstract Distributed consistency is perhaps the most-discussed topic in distributed systemstoday. Coordination protocols can ensure consistency; but in practice they causeundesirable performance unless used judiciously. Scalable distributed architectures avoidcoordination whenever possible; but under-coordinated systems can exhibit behavioralanomalies under fault; which are often extremely difficult to debug. This raises significantchallenges for distributed system architects and developers. In this article; we present Blazes; a cross-platform program analysis framework that (a) identifies program locations thatrequire coordination to ensure consistent executions; and (b) automatically synthesizesapplication-specific coordination code that can significantly outperform general-purposetechniques.

GRETA: graph-based real-time event trend aggregation,Olga Poppe; Chuan Lei; Elke A Rundensteiner; David Maier,Abstract Streaming applications from algorithmic trading to traffic management deployKleene patterns to detect and aggregate arbitrarily-long event sequences; called eventtrends. State-of-theart systems process such queries in two steps. Namely; they firstconstruct all trends and then aggregate them. Due to the exponential costs of trendconstruction; this two-step approach suffers from both a long delays and high memory costs.To overcome these limitations; we propose the Graph-based Real-time Event TrendAggregation (GRETA) approach that dynamically computes event trend aggregation withoutfirst constructing these trends. We define the GRETA graph to compactly encode all trends.Our GRETA runtime incrementally maintains the graph; while dynamically propagatingaggregates along its edges. Based on the graph; the final aggregate is incrementally …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,*
Dynamic pattern matching over ordered and disordered data streams,*,Architecture introduces a new pattern operator referred to as called an augmented transitionnetwork (ATN); which is a streaming adaptation of non-reentrant; fixed-state ATNs fordynamic patterns. Additional user-defined information is associated with automaton statesand is accessible to transitions during execution. ATNs are created that directly modelcomplex pattern continuous queries with arbitrary cycles in a transition graph. Thearchitecture can express the desire to ignore some events during pattern detection; and canalso detect the absence of data as part of a pattern. The architecture facilitates efficientsupport for negation; ignorable events; and state cleanup based on predicate punctuations.,*,2016,*

Cloaking data to ease view creation; query expression; and query execution,Sudarshan Murthy; David Maier; Lois Delcambre,Abstract XML schemas often allow many aspects of an object to be described in the samedocument; but queries over such documents might be concerned with just one aspect. Forexample; an XML representation of a spreadsheet can include both spreadsheet data andstyling; but a query might address only the data portions. In these situations; traditionalapproaches first define a data-only view and then query that view. However; theseapproaches can make it hard to define views and to express queries; and in some cases(even with view unfolding); they can even make query-execution inefficient in terms of timeand space. We propose cloaking document parts and selectively revealing the cloaked partsas an alternative. Cloaking exposes many simultaneous conceptual views of a documentwithout constructing new data; allows queries to be expressed in existing languages; and …,*,2012,*

The CORIE system both measuresand simulates the physical properties of the estuary; generating 5GB of data and thousandsof data products for each simulation run; including visualizations; aggregated results andderived datasets. In the current production CORIE system;" canned" visualizations areproduced eagerly for every run. Users cannot customize their data products nor access thedata directly; inhibiting data sharing. The term e-science is used to connote global;distributed collaboration enabled by sharing of both data and compute resources.,Data Engineering; 2005. ICDE 2005.

We also discuss how to addconstructs for programming XML queries in a declarative (and; thus; optimizable) way andfinally sketch a dispatch algorithm to demonstrate how static type information can be used inefficient compilation schemas.,*,1997,*
Interoperating with DIF data,Paul Benninghoff; David Maier,Most computerized data is not under the purview of traditional database managementsystems; but; rather; it is stored in files. Data Interchange Formats (DIFs) are the basis of animportant class of such files; containing massive volumes of data; and serving a large usercommunity. Initially designed for data exchange; DIFs are increasingly being used for datastorage. Collections of DIF files have become de facto databases; and the software toolssurrounding them have evolved to become ad hoc data management systems. But thesesystems are primitive compared with traditional database management technology. Theylack flexibility; and are unlikely to scale as DIF data volumes grow. An acute need exists toprovide more robust DBMS style support for data in such files; and to support interoperabilityin heterogeneous environments that include this data. We suggest that object oriented …,Research Issues in Data Engineering; 1996. Interoperability of Nontraditional Database Systems. Proceedings. Sixth International Workshop on,1996,*

Keynote Discussion on Evolution in Persistent Systems,Richard Connor; Alex Farkas; Dave Maier,Abstract Evolution is without doubt one of the hardest problems to address with respect toprogramming systems. When the systems under consideration handle large amounts of long-lived data; the ability to handle evolution becomes not only essential; but also even harder toprovide. When some of the intrinsic restrictions of traditional databases are removed; as isthe case with persistent programming systems; the problems become harder still. Very littlework has been done on system evolution in persistent systems; probably for the reason thatit is simply too hard. A major result of this keynote discussion; however; was to show that thecurrent state of thinking about evolution is at least sufficiently advanced for a reasonablelevel of technical discussion to emerge amongst the workshop participants.

An Object-Oriented Heterogeneous Database Architecture,David M Hansen,Abstract Many data management environments face a critical need to integrateheterogeneous data-data that are stored in varying locations using various datamanagement systems with diverse data formats and schemas. To address this problem; thedatabase research community has developed the concept of a heterogeneous databasesystem (HDB) that provides users with the illusion of a single unified database. However;HDBs rely on the implicit assumption that all data to be integrated into the HDB are stored infull-fledged database management systems (DBMS). This assumption leaves environmentsthat need to integrate non-DBMS data unserved by HDB systems. Furthermore; HDBs arecomplex software solutions that are not easily lmplementable by database developerswrestling with heterogeneous data.

Introduction to object-oriented database management systems,David Maier,This tutorial begins by explaining object-oriented database management systems(OODBMS) in terms of what is the value added beyond record-oriented database systemsand object-oriented programming languages. It presents most of the current commercialOODBMS and several advanced prototypes with particular attention to distinguishing themin their data models; application interfaces and system architectures. It will also contrast theOODBMS approach with extended relational systems. A goal of the tutorial is to giveparticipants an appreciation for the consequences of design choices made in the differentsystems.

A Study of Three Alternative,David J DeWitt; David Maier; Fernando Velez,ABSTRACT In the engineering and scientific marketplaces; the workstation-server model ofcomputing is emerging as the standard of the 1990s. Implementing an object-orienteddatabase system in this environment immediately presents the design choice of how topartition database functionality between the server and workstation processors. To betterunderstand the alternatives to this fundamental design decision; we analyze three differentworkstation-server architectures; evaluating them both qualitatively and throughbenchmarking of prototypes. The three approaches are labeled object server; in whichindividual objects pass between the server and workstation; page server; in which a diskpage is the unit of transport and the server buffers pages; and file server; where wholepages are transferred as well; but they are accessed directly by the workstation process …,*,1990,*
Efficient Assembly of Complex Objects; CU-CS-502-90,Tom Keller; Goetz Graefe; David Maier,Abstract Although object-oriented database systems offer advantages over relational orrecord-oriented database systems; such as modeling facilities for complex objects; they arecriticized for poor performance and query capabilities on set-oriented applications. Theunacceptable performance is due in part to the object-at-a-time processing typically used byobject-oriented database systems. We believe that improved performance of object-orienteddatabase systems depends partially on the efficient and selective retrieval of sets of complexobjects from secondary storage. In this report; we present the method of complex objectretrieval and assembly used in the Volcano query processing system and the Revelationproject.

cse-94-026,Richard Staehli; Jonathan Walpole; David Maier,ABSTRACT Multimedia presentations convey information not only by the output values andtheir sequence; but by the timing of those outputs. However; it is impossible to implement apresentation with perfect timing and it is often necessary to throw away information becauseof resource limitations. As with any reproduction of a signal; the utility of a time-basedpresentation depends on its fidelity to the ideal. This imprecise but intuitive definition ofquality suggests that quality specification should be an important part of a multimediasystem. Recent operating systems and networking research has focussed on definingQuality of Service (QOS) parameters that define resource-level requirements forperformance guarantees.

Buffer-free; Disorder-tolerant Window Aggregate Evaluation,Jin Li; David Maier; Vassilis Papadimos; Peter Tucker; Kristin Tufte,Abstract Window queries are proving essential to data-stream processing. A windowedquery operator breaks a stream into possibly overlapping subsets of data and computesresults over each. Existing approaches to evaluating windowed aggregates use buffering tohandle the complexity of tuples participating in multiple subsets. They also use buffering tosort out-of-order inputs (or they impose ordering requirements on the stream). We present anon-buffering; non-sorting approach for evaluating window aggregates over possiblydisordered streams. Our method separates the logical definition of windows from physicaldata ordering and allows most query operators to be" window agnostic." In the case ofoverlapping windows; we demonstrate additional performance benefits from dividingwindows into disjoint" panes." In addition; our approach inherently handles disordered …,*,*,*
I12,L Fegaras; D Maier; T Sheard Specifying Rule-based Query,5 Conclusion We have presented an experimental optimizer for OQL that unnests all formsof nested queries (including nested aggregation and quantiﬁcation) and converts all objectreferences found in path expressions into pointer joins. This optimizer is expressed in termsof a small number of rules in a powerful optimizer speciﬁcation language. The reason thatthis speciﬁcation is so concrete is that OQL queries are ﬁrst translated into the monoidcomprehension calculus; which is uniform and easy to manipulate. In fact; most forms ofunnesting are removed from the OQL queries by applying a simple normalization techniquefor monoid comprehensions. Currently our OQL optimizer produces plans that are evaluatedin memory. As a future work; we are planning to connect our optimizer to the SHORE objectmanagement system In addition; we are planning to improve our cost functions and to …,*,*,*

Optimizing Bulk Access to Fine-grained Exo-DB Data,Sudarshan Murthy; David Maier; Lois Delcambre,Abstract Most database (DB) systems allow references to “exo-DB data”(that is; to dataresident outside a DB) to be stored along with traditional DB data; but limit the nature andgranularity of the exo-DB data referenced. Some systems let users mix DB data with exo-DBdata in queries; but are inefficient when retrieving data from a large number and variety ofexo-DB sources (that is; bulk access to exo-DB data). To address this problem; we havedevised a means to incorporate; in a traditional DB; references to fine-grained exo-DB dataof arbitrary formats; and have developed a “bulk accessor” to retrieve exo-DB data efficiently.The bulk accessor supports different policies a query processor may exploit to improveperformance depending on data characteristics such as clustering. Experiments show thatthe bulk accessor can save about 69% execution time per query over a naïve method; the …,*,*,*

Demo Proposal: Superimposed Applications using SPARCE,Sudarshan Murthy; David Maier; Lois Delcambre; Shawn Bowers,Abstract People often impose new interpretations onto existing information (by makingannotations and so on). In the process; they work with information in two layers: a baselayer; where the original information resides; and a superimposed layer; where only the newinterpretations reside. People like to view base-layer selections (along with contextualinformation) and navigate back to selections; regardless of base-layer type. Unfortunately;base layers differ in their support for these operations. Appropriate architectural abstractionsplaced between the two layers can ease communication between the layers; they can alsomake up for some of the deficiencies of base layers. The Superimposed PluggableArchitecture for Contexts and Excerpts (SPARCE) provides a practical collection of suchabstractions.
