Can social bookmarking improve web search?,Paul Heymann; Georgia Koutrika; Hector Garcia-Molina,Abstract Social bookmarking is a recent phenomenon which has the potential to give us agreat deal of data about pages on the web. One major question is whether that data can beused to augment systems like web search. To answer this question; over the past year wehave gathered what we believe to be the largest dataset from a social bookmarking site yetanalyzed by academic researchers. Our dataset represents about forty million bookmarksfrom the social bookmarking site del. icio. us. We contribute a characterization of posts todel. icio. us: how many bookmarks exist (about 115 million); how fast is it growing; and howactive are the URLs being posted about (quite active). We also contribute a characterizationof tags used by bookmarkers. We found that certain tags tend to gravitate towards certaindomains; and vice versa. We also found that tags occur in over 50 percent of the pages …,Proceedings of the 2008 International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2008,591
Fighting spam on social web sites: A survey of approaches and future challenges,Paul Heymann; Georgia Koutrika; Hector Garcia-Molina,In recent years; social Web sites have become important components of the Web. With theirsuccess; however; has come a growing influx of spam. If left unchecked; spam threatens toundermine resource sharing; interactivity; and openness. This article surveys threecategories of potential countermeasures-those based on detection; demotion; andprevention. Although many of these countermeasures have been proposed before for emailand Web spam; the authors find that their applicability to social Web sites differs.,IEEE Internet Computing,2007,297
Entity resolution with iterative blocking,Steven Euijong Whang; David Menestrina; Georgia Koutrika; Martin Theobald; Hector Garcia-Molina,Abstract Entity Resolution (ER) is the problem of identifying which records in a databaserefer to the same real-world entity. An exhaustive ER process involves computing thesimilarities between pairs of records; which can be very expensive for large datasets.Various blocking techniques can be used to enhance the performance of ER by dividing therecords into blocks in multiple ways and only comparing records within the same block.However; most blocking techniques process blocks separately and do not exploit the resultsof other blocks. In this paper; we propose an iterative blocking framework where the ERresults of blocks are reflected to subsequently processed blocks. Blocks are now iterativelyprocessed until no block contains any more matching records. Compared to simple blocking;iterative blocking may achieve higher accuracy because reflecting the ER results of …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,207

Personalization of queries in database systems,Georgia Koutrika; Yannis Ioannidis,As information becomes available in increasing amounts to a wide spectrum of users; theneed for a shift towards a more user-centered information access paradigm arises. Wedevelop a personalization framework for database systems based on user profiles andidentify the basic architectural modules required to support it. We define a preference modelthat assigns to each atomic query condition a personal degree of interest and provide amechanism to compute the degree of interest in any complex query condition based on thedegrees of interest in the constituent atomic ones. Preferences are stored in profiles. Atquery time; personalization proceeds in two steps:(a) preference selection and (b)preference integration into the original user query. We formulate the main personalizationstep; ie preference selection; as a graph computation problem and provide an efficient …,Data Engineering; 2004.

Personalized queries under a generalized preference model,Georgia Koutrika; Yannis Ioannidis,Query personalization is the process of dynamically enhancing a query with related userpreferences stored in a user profile with the aim of providing personalized answers. Theunderlying idea is that different users may find different things relevant to a search due todifferent preferences. Essential ingredients of query personalization are:(a) a model forrepresenting and storing preferences in user profiles; and (b) algorithms for the generationof personalized answers using stored preferences. Modeling the plethora of preferencetypes is a challenge. In this paper; we present a preference model that combinesexpressivity and concision. In addition; we provide efficient algorithms for the selection ofpreferences related to a query; and an algorithm for the progressive generation ofpersonalized results; which are ranked based on user interest.

Combating spam in tagging systems,Georgia Koutrika; Frans Adjie Effendi; Zoltán Gyöngyi; Paul Heymann; Hector Garcia-Molina,Abstract Tagging systems allow users to interactively annotate a pool of shared resourcesusing descriptive tags. As tagging systems are gaining in popularity; they become moresusceptible to tag spam: misleading tags that are generated in order to increase the visibilityof some resources or simply to confuse users. We introduce a framework for modelingtagging systems and user tagging behavior. We also describe a method for rankingdocuments matching a tag based on taggers' reliability. Using our framework; we study thebehavior of existing approaches under malicious attacks and the impact of a moderator andour ranking method.,Proceedings of the 3rd international workshop on Adversarial information retrieval on the web,2007,147
A survey on representation; composition and application of preferences in database systems,Kostas Stefanidis; Georgia Koutrika; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract Preferences have been traditionally studied in philosophy; psychology; andeconomics and applied to decision making problems. Recently; they have attracted theattention of researchers in other fields; such as databases where they capture soft criteria forqueries. Databases bring a whole fresh perspective to the study of preferences; bothcomputational and representational. From a representational perspective; the centralquestion is how we can effectively represent preferences and incorporate them in databasequerying. From a computational perspective; we can look at how we can efficiently processpreferences in the context of database queries. Several approaches have been proposedbut a systematic study of these works is missing. The purpose of this survey is to provide aframework for placing existing works in perspective and highlight critical open challenges …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2011,140
Setting the foundation of digital libraries,Leonardo Candela; Donatella Castelli; Pasquale Pagano; Constantino Thanos; Yannis Ioannidis; Georgia Koutrika; Seamus Ross; Hans-Jörg Schek; Heiko Schuldt,Abstract The term" Digital Libraries" corresponds to a very complex notion with severaldiverse aspects and cannot be captured by a simple definition. A robust model of DigitalLibraries encapsulating the richness of these perspectives is required. This need has led tothe drafting of The Digital Library Manifesto; the aim of which is to set the foundations andidentify the cornerstone concepts within the universe of Digital Libraries; facilitating theintegration of research results and proposing better ways of developing appropriatesystems.

Data clouds: summarizing keyword search results over structured data,Georgia Koutrika; Zahra Mohammadi Zadeh; Hector Garcia-Molina,Abstract Keyword searches are attractive because they facilitate users searching structureddatabases. On the other hand; tag clouds are popular for navigation and visualizationpurposes over unstructured data because they can highlight the most significant conceptsand hidden relationships in the underlying content dynamically. In this paper; we proposecoupling the flexibility of keyword searches over structured data with the summarization andnavigation capabilities of tag clouds to help users access a database. We propose usingclouds over structured data (data clouds) to summarize the results of keyword searches overstructured data and to guide users to refine their searches. The cloud presents the mostsignificant words associated with the search results.

Précis: The essence of a query answer,Georgia Koutrika; Alkis Simitsis; Yannis Ioannidis,Wide spread use of database systems in modern society has brought the need to provideinexperienced users with the ability to easily search a database with no specific knowledgeof a query language. Several recent research efforts have focused on supporting keyword-based searches over relational databases. This paper presents an alternative proposal andintroduces the idea of précis queries. These are free-form queries whose answer (a précis)is a synthesis of results; containing not only information directly related to the queryselections but also information implicitly related to them in various ways. Our approach toprécis queries includes two additional novelties:(a) queries do not generate individualrelations but entire multi-relation databases; and (b) query results are personalized to user-specific and/or domain requirements.

Combating spam in tagging systems: An evaluation,Georgia Koutrika; Frans Adjie Effendi; Zolt Gyöngyi; Paul Heymann; Hector Garcia-Molina,Abstract Tagging systems allow users to interactively annotate a pool of shared resourcesusing descriptive strings called tags. Tags are used to guide users to interesting resourcesand help them build communities that share their expertise and resources. As taggingsystems are gaining in popularity; they become more susceptible to tag spam: misleadingtags that are generated in order to increase the visibility of some resources or simply toconfuse users. Our goal is to understand this problem better. In particular; we are interestedin answers to questions such as: How many malicious users can a tagging system toleratebefore results significantly degrade&quest; What types of tagging systems are morevulnerable to malicious attacks&quest; What would be the effort and the impact of employinga trusted moderator to find bad postings&quest; Can a system automatically protect itself …,ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB),2008,70
A unified user profile framework for query disambiguation and personalization,Georgia Koutrika; Yannis Ioannidis,Abstract. Personalization of keyword searches has attracted interest in the researchcommunity as a means to decrease search ambiguity and return results that are more boundto be interesting to a particular user. We describe a termbased user profile that treats querydisambiguation and personalization as a uniform term rewriting process. Its key feature isthe representation of connections between terms based on possible rewritings betweenthem on a per user basis. We present a query-rewriting algorithm for such querydisambiguation based on the proposed profiles. Preliminary experimental results show thepotential of the overall approach.,Proceedings of workshop on new technologies for personalized information access,2005,70
On the selection of tags for tag clouds,Petros Venetis; Georgia Koutrika; Hector Garcia-Molina,Abstract We examine the creation of a tag cloud for exploring and understanding a set ofobjects (eg; web pages; documents). In the first part of our work; we present a formal systemmodel for reasoning about tag clouds. We then present metrics that capture the structuralproperties of a tag cloud; and we briefly present a set of tag selection algorithms that areused in current sites (eg; del. icio. us; Flickr; Technorati) or that have been described inrecent work. In order to evaluate the results of these algorithms; we devise a novel syntheticuser model. This user model is specifically tailored for tag cloud evaluation and assumes an"ideal" user. We evaluate the algorithms under this user model; as well as the model itself;using two datasets: CourseRank (a Stanford social tool containing information aboutcourses) and del. icio. us (a social bookmarking site).

Précis: from unstructured keywords as queries to structured databases as answers,Alkis Simitsis; Georgia Koutrika; Yannis Ioannidis,Abstract Précis queries represent a novel way of accessing data; which combines ideas andtechniques from the fields of databases and information retrieval. They are free-form;keyword-based; queries on top of relational databases that generate entire multi-relationdatabases; which are logical subsets of the original ones. A logical subset contains not onlyitems directly related to the given query keywords but also items implicitly related to them invarious ways; with the purpose of providing to the user much greater insight into the originaldata. In this paper; we lay the foundations for the concept of logical database subsets thatare generated from précis queries under a generalized perspective that removes severalrestrictions of previous work. In particular; we extend the semantics of précis queriesconsidering that they may contain multiple terms combined through the AND; OR; and …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2008,62
Constrained optimalities in query personalization,Georgia Koutrika; Yannis Ioannidis,Abstract Personalization is a powerful mechanism that helps users to cope with theabundance of information on the Web. Database query personalization achieves this bydynamically constructing queries that return results of high interest to the user. This;however; may conflict with other constraints on the query execution time and/or result sizethat may be imposed by the search context; such as the device used; the networkconnection; etc. For example; if the user is accessing information using a mobile phone; thenit is desirable to construct a personalized query that executes quickly and returns a handfulof answers. Constrained Query Personalization (CQP) is an integrated approach todatabase query answering that dynamically takes into account the queries issued; the user'sinterest in the results; response time; and result size in order to build personalized …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,61

Meta-blocking: Taking entity resolutionto the next level,George Papadakis; Georgia Koutrika; Themis Palpanas; Wolfgang Nejdl,Entity Resolution is an inherently quadratic task that typically scales to large data collectionsthrough blocking. In the context of highly heterogeneous information spaces; blockingmethods rely on redundancy in order to ensure high effectiveness at the cost of lowerefficiency (ie; more comparisons). This effect is partially ameliorated by coarse-grained blockprocessing techniques that discard entire blocks either a-priori or during the resolutionprocess. In this paper; we introduce meta-blocking as a generic procedure that intervenesbetween the creation and the processing of blocks; transforming an initial set of blocks into anew one with substantially fewer comparisons and equally high effectiveness. In essence;meta-blocking aims at extracting the most similar pairs of entities by leveraging theinformation that is encapsulated in the block-to-entity relationships. To this end; it first …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,43
Explaining structured queries in natural language,Georgia Koutrika; Alkis Simitsis; Yannis E Ioannidis,Many applications offer a form-based environment for naïve users for accessing databaseswithout being familiar with the database schema or a structured query language. Userinteractions are translated to structured queries and executed. However; as a user is unlikelyto know the underlying semantic connections among the fields presented in a form; it is oftenuseful to provide her with a textual explanation of the query. In this paper; we take a graph-based approach to the query translation problem. We represent various forms of structuredqueries as directed graphs and we annotate the graph edges with template labels using anextensible template mechanism. We present different graph traversal strategies for efficientlyexploring these graphs and composing textual query descriptions. Finally; we presentexperimental results for the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed methods.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,41

HIL: a high-level scripting language for entity integration,Mauricio Hernández; Georgia Koutrika; Rajasekar Krishnamurthy; Lucian Popa; Ryan Wisnesky,Abstract We introduce HIL; a high-level scripting language for entity resolution andintegration. HIL aims at providing the core logic for complex data processing flows thataggregate facts from large collections of structured or unstructured data into clean; unifiedentities. Such flows typically include many stages of processing that start from the outcomeof information extraction and continue with entity resolution; mapping and fusion. A HILprogram captures the overall integration flow through a combination of SQL-like rules thatlink; map; fuse and aggregate entities. A salient feature of HIL is the use of logical indexes inits data model to facilitate the modular construction and aggregation of complex entities.Another feature is the presence of a flexible; open type system that allows HIL to handleinput data that is irregular; sparse or partially known. As a result; HIL can accurately …,Proceedings of the 16th international conference on extending database technology,2013,36
Personalizing queries based on networks of composite preferences,Georgia Koutrika; Yannis Ioannidis,Abstract People's preferences are expressed at varying levels of granularity and detail as aresult of partial or imperfect knowledge. One may have some preference for a general classof entities; for example; liking comedies; and another one for a fine-grained; specific class;such as disliking recent thrillers with Al Pacino. In this article; we are interested in capturingsuch complex; multi-granular preferences for personalizing database queries and instudying their impact on query results. We organize the collection of one's preferences in apreference network (a directed acyclic graph); where each node refers to a subclass of theentities that its parent refers to; and whenever they both apply; more specific preferencesoverride more generic ones. We study query personalization based on networks ofpreferences and provide efficient algorithms for identifying relevant preferences …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2010,31

Towards preference-aware relational databases,Anastasios Arvanitis; Georgia Koutrika,In implementing preference-aware query processing; a straightforward option is to build aplug-in on top of the database engine. However; treating the DBMS as a black box affectsboth the expressivity and performance of queries with preferences. In this paper; we arguethat preference-aware query processing needs to be pushed closer to the DBMS. Wepresent a preference-aware relational data model that extends database tuples withpreferences and an extended algebra that captures the essence of processing queries withpreferences. A key novelty of our preference model itself is that it defines a preference inthree dimensions showing the tuples affected; their preference scores and the credibility ofthe preference.

In user-centricperson search; the search query is issued by a person participating in the social networkand the goal is to find people that are relevant not only to the keywords; but also to thesearcher herself. Link prediction is the task of predicting new friendships (links) that arelikely to be added to the network.

Schema-agnostic vs schema-based configurations for blocking methods on homogeneous data,George Papadakis; George Alexiou; George Papastefanatos; Georgia Koutrika,Abstract Entity Resolution constitutes a core task for data integration that; due to its quadraticcomplexity; typically scales to large datasets through blocking methods. These can beconfigured in two ways. The schema-based configuration relies on schema information inorder to select signatures of high distinctiveness and low noise; while the schema-agnosticone treats every token from all attribute values as a signature. The latter approach hassignificant potential; as it requires no fine-tuning by human experts and it applies toheterogeneous data. Yet; there is no systematic study on its relative performance withrespect to the schema-based configuration. This work covers this gap by comparinganalytically the two configurations in terms of effectiveness; time efficiency and scalability.We apply them to 9 established blocking methods and to 11 benchmarks of structured …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,16
Supervised meta-blocking,George Papadakis; George Papastefanatos; Georgia Koutrika,Abstract Entity Resolution matches mentions of the same entity. Being an expensive task forlarge data; its performance can be improved by blocking; ie; grouping similar entities andcomparing only entities in the same group. Blocking improves the run-time of EntityResolution; but it still involves unnecessary comparisons that limit its performance. Meta-blocking is the process of restructuring a block collection in order to prune suchcomparisons. Existing unsupervised meta-blocking methods use simple pruning rules;which offer a rather coarse-grained filtering technique that can be conservative (ie; keepingtoo many unnecessary comparisons) or aggressive (ie; pruning good comparisons). In thiswork; we introduce supervised meta-blocking techniques that learn classification models fordistinguishing promising comparisons. For this task; we propose a small set of generic …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,16

These resources shouldbe close to the passage both in terms of the subject matter and the reading level. However;using a search engine to find such resources interrupts the reading flow. It is also aninefficient; trial-and-error process because existing web search and recommendationsystems do not support large queries; they do not understand semantic topics; and they donot take into account the reading level of the original document a person is reading.

The key novelty of PrefDB is the use of an extended relational datamodel and algebra that allow expressing different flavors of preferential queries.Furthermore; unlike existing approaches that either treat the DBMS as a black box or requiremodifications of the database core; PrefDB's hybrid implementation enables operator-levelquery optimizations without being obtrusive to the database engine. We showcase theflexibility and efficiency of PrefDB using PrefDBAdmin; a graphical tool that we have builtaiming at assisting application designers in the task of building; testing and tuning querieswith preferences.,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,13

Synthesizing structured text from logical database subsets,Alkis Simitsis; Georgia Koutrika; Yannis Alexandrakis; Yannis Ioannidis,Abstract In the classical database world; information access has been based on a paradigmthat involves structured; schema-aware; queries and tabular answers. In the currentenvironment; however; where information prevails in most activities of society; servingpeople; applications; and devices in dramatically increasing numbers; this paradigm hasproved to be very limited. On the query side; much work has been done on moving towardskeyword queries over structured data. In our previous work; we have touched the other sideas well; and have proposed a paradigm that generates entire databases in response tokeyword queries. In this paper; we continue in the same direction and propose synthesizingtextual answers in response to queries of any kind over structured data. In particular; westudy the transformation of a dynamically-generated logical database subset into a …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,13
OLAP Cubes for Social Searches: Standing on the Shoulders of Giants?,Konstantinos Morfonios; Georgia Koutrika,ABSTRACT The advent of social bookmarking has signaled a new era towards a more“pluralistic” web; where entities of multiple types (eg; users; resources; tags) can coexist andget interconnected. In this paper; we propose going beyond classical searches for resourcesbased on keywords to exploring social data starting from any type of entity; ie; user; resourceor annotation; and requesting aggregated views of related entities based on therelationships defined between entities. We map this type of social searching to OLAP queryprocessing bridging the gap between OLAP and the social web and we study various waysto support on-the-fly aggregations of social data. We further describe how data cubes can beused for precomputing and materializing the results of all possible aggregate queries over asocial dataset. Our experiments show that cubes can efficiently support searches over …,WebDB,2008,13
PrefDB: Supporting preferences as first-class citizens in relational databases,Anastasios Arvanitis; Georgia Koutrika,In this paper; we argue that preference-aware query processing needs to be pushed closerto the DBMS. We introduce a preference-aware relational data model that extends databasetuples with preferences and an extended algebra that captures the essence of processingqueries with preferences. Based on a set of algebraic properties and a cost model that wepropose; we provide several query optimization strategies for extended query plans. Further;we describe a query execution algorithm that blends preference evaluation with queryexecution; while making effective use of the native query engine. We have implemented ourframework and methods in a prototype system; PrefDB. PrefDB allows transparent andefficient evaluation of preferential queries on top of a relational DBMS. Our extensiveexperimental evaluation on two real-world datasets demonstrates the feasibility and …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,12
Logos: a system for translating queries into narratives,Andreas Kokkalis; Panagiotis Vagenas; Alexandros Zervakis; Alkis Simitsis; Georgia Koutrika; Yannis Ioannidis,Abstract This paper presents Logos; a system that provides natural language translations forrelational queries expressed in SQL. Our translation mechanism is based on a graph-basedapproach to the query translation problem. We represent various forms of structured queriesas directed graphs and we annotate the graph edges with template labels using anextensible template mechanism. Logos uses different graph traversal strategies for efficientlyexploring these graphs and composing textual query descriptions. The audience mayinteractively explore Logos using various database schemata and issuing either sample orad hoc queries.,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,12
Generating reading orders over document collections,Georgia Koutrika; Lei Liu; Steve Simske,Given a document collection; existing systems allow users to browse the collection orperform searches that return lists of documents ranked based on their relevance to the userquery. While these approaches work fine when a user is trying to locate specific documents;they are insufficient when users need to access the pertinent documents in some logicalorder; for example for learning or editorial purposes. We present a system that automaticallyorganizes a collection of documents in a tree from general to more specific documents; andallows a user to choose a reading sequence over the documents. This a novel way tocontent consumption that departs from the typical ranked lists of documents based on theirrelevance to a user query and from static navigational interfaces.

On Principles of Egocentric Person Search in Social Networks.,Sara Cohen; Benny Kimelfeld; Georgia Koutrika; Jan Vondrák,ABSTRACT Person search is the problem of finding; by means of keyword search; relevantpeople in a social network. In egocentric person search; the search query is issued by aperson s participating in the social network; and the goal is to find people that possess twoqualities: relevancy to the query; and relevancy to s herself. This position paper considersthe latter quality; and specifically; scoring functions that rank persons by their relevancy to s.In particular; the paper proposes general principles (ie; properties) that should be held bysuch scoring functions. Several functions; which were proposed in the past for measuringnode connectivity; are analyzed with respect to the proposed principles. It is shown thatnone of these functions sufficiently satisfy the principles. In contrast; the paper presents twoadditional functions that satisfy the principles in a strong sense.,VLDS,2011,9
To print or not to print: hybrid learning with METIS learning platform,Joshua Hailpern; Rares Vernica; Molly Bullock; Udi Chatow; Jian Fan; Georgia Koutrika; Jerry Liu; Lei Liu; Steven Simske; Shanchan Wu,Abstract As part of the explosion in educational software; online tools; and open educationalresources there has been a rapid devaluation of printed textbooks. While digital texts haveadvantages; printed textbooks still provide irreplaceable value over online media. Thereforetechnology should enhance; rather than eliminate printed text. To this end; this paperpresents METIS; a hybrid learning software/service platform that is designed to supportactive reading. METIS provides easy digital-to-print-to-digital usage; simple creation ofCheat Sheets & FlexNotes for personal note taking and organization; and a custom flexiblerendering & publishing engine for education called Aero. METIS was designed based onlessons learned from a formative study of 523 students at SJSU; and validated through focusgroups involving 32 educators and students at both high school and college levels.,Proceedings of the 7th ACM SIGCHI Symposium on Engineering Interactive Computing Systems,2015,8
Personalized DBMS: an Elephant in Disguise or a Chameleon?,Georgia Koutrika,Abstract A query; expressed in a structured query language such as SQL; describesprecisely the data that should comprise the answer and a non-empty answer is returned onlyif it satisfies all query criteria. However; the Boolean database query model has limitations. Auser may run into empty answers when the query conditions are too restrictive or sift throughtoo many results that match the query. User preferences naturally blend into queriesallowing to explore alternatives or prioritize and filter available choices. In addition; they canbe used to generate answers that are personalized to the user. In this paper; we explain theneed towards personalized and preference-aware query answering in the context ofdatabases and we discuss how it can be enabled. Our objective is to discuss the pros andcons of existing approaches and the challenges and opportunities towards a truly …,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2011,8
Personalization of queries based on user preferences,Georgia Koutrika; Yannis Ioannidis,Abstract Query Personalization is the process of dynamically enhancing a query with relateduser preferences stored in a user profile with the aim of providing personalized answers.The underlying idea is that different users may find different things relevant to a search dueto different preferences. Essential ingredients of query personalization are:(a) a model forrepresenting and storing preferences in user profiles; and (b) algorithms for the generationof personalized answers using stored preferences. Modeling the plethora of preferencetypes is a challenge. In this paper; we present a preference model that combinesexpressivity and concision. In addition; we provide algorithms for the selection ofpreferences related to a query and the progressive generation of personalized results; whichare ranked based on user interest.,Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings,2006,8
Preference-based query personalization,Georgia Koutrika; Evaggelia Pitoura; Kostas Stefanidis,Abstract In the context of database queries; computational methods for handling preferencescan be broadly divided into two categories. Query personalization methods consider thatuser preferences are provided as a user profile separately from the query and dynamicallydetermine how this profile will affect the query results. On the other hand; preferential queryanswering methods consider that preferences are explicitly expressed within queries. Thefocus of this chapter is on query personalization methods. We will first describe howpreferences can be represented and stored in user profiles. Then; we will discuss howpreferences are selected from a user profile and applied to a query.,*,2013,7
Comprehensible answers to précis queries,Alkis Simitsis; Georgia Koutrika,Abstract Users without knowledge of schemas or query languages have difficulties inaccessing information stored in databases. Commercial and research efforts have focusedon keyword-based searches. Among them; précis queries generate entire multi-relationdatabases; which are logical subsets of existing ones; instead of individual relations. Thelogical database subset contains not only items directly related to the query selections butalso items implicitly related to them in various ways. Earlier work has identified the need ofproviding the naïve user with meaningful answers to his questions and has suggested thetranslation of précis query answer in narrative form. In this paper; we present a semi-automatic method that translates the relational output of a précis query into a synthesis ofresults. We describe a translator engine that uses a template mechanism for generating a …,International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering,2006,7

Social sites research through courserank,Benjamin Bercovitz; Filip Kaliszan; Georgia Koutrika; Henry Liou; Aditya Parameswaran; Petros Venetis; Zahra Mohammadi Zadeh; Hector Garcia-Molina,Abstract Social sites such as FaceBook; Orkut; Flickr; MySpace and many others havebecome immensely popular. At these sites; users share their resources (eg; photos; profiles;blogs) and learn from each other. On the other hand; higher education applications helpstudents and administrators track and manage academic information such as grades; courseevaluations and enrollments. Despite the importance of both these areas; there is relativelylittle research on the mechanisms that make them effective.

Personalization of structured queries with personal and collaborative preferences,Georgia Koutrika,Abstract. The underlying idea of personalized searches is that different people may finddifferent things relevant; therefore; they may expect different answers to the same query.One of the primary ways to personalize a search is query personalization. This is theprocess of dynamically enhancing a query with related preferences stored in a user profilewith the purpose of providing more focused answers. However; in many cases; this may betoo restrictive; since users are always provided with items matching their own profile. Inevery day life; people often make choices not only based on their personal preferences butalso taking into account preferences; opinions or choices of other people. Tapping into thepreferences and choices of others enables people to examine alternative or additionaloptions and make more informed decisions.

Exploratory Search in Databases and the Web.,Georgia Koutrika; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Mirek Riedewald; Kostas Stefanidis,The traditional way a user interacts with a database system is through queries. Structuredquery languages; such as SQL for relational data; XQuery for XML; and SPARQL for RDFdata; allow users to submit queries that may precisely capture their information needs; butusers need to be familiar with the underlying ontology and data structure and of course thequery language itself. Moreover; users need to some extent be familiar with the content ofthe database and have a clear understanding of their information needs. Theserequirements stand as the weaknesses of this interaction mode. As data stored in databasesgrows in unprecedented rates and becomes accessible to diverse and less technicallyoriented audience; new forms of data exploration and interaction become increasingly moreattractive.

Report on the first international workshop on exploratory search in databases and the web (exploredb 2014),Georgia Koutrika; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Mirek Riedewald; Kostas Stefanidis,Databases are well-organized collections of data. Structured query languages; such as SQL;XQuery; and SPARQL; enable users to formulate precise queries over the data stored in adatabase. To be successful; users need to be familiar with the query language and theunderlying data organization. They also need to understand; to some extent; the data stored;and have a fairly clear idea of what they are looking for.

An enhanced search interface for information discovery from digital libraries,Georgia Koutrika; Alkis Simitsis,Abstract Libraries; museums; and other organizations make their electronic contentsavailable to a growing number of users on the Web. A large fraction of the informationpublished is stored in structured or semi-structured form. However; most users have nospecific knowledge of schemas or structured query languages for accessing informationstored in (relational or XML) databases. Under these circumstances; the need for facilitatingaccess to information stored in databases becomes increasingly more important. Précisqueries are free-form queries that instead of simply locating and connecting values in tables;they also consider information around these values that may be related to them. Therefore;the answer to a précis query might also contain information found in other parts of thedatabase. In this paper; we describe a précis query answering prototype system that …,International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries,2006,3
Database Query Personalization.,Georgia Koutrika,Traditional database and information retrieval systems have followed a query-basedinformation access paradigm (ie; information is returned to the user on the basis of a queryissued). As a result; users issuing the same query are provided with the same answer. Withthe advent of the World Wide Web and hand-held electronic devices such as palmtops andcellular phones; information access entered a new era. Increasing amounts of informationbecome available to a growing mass of untrained lay users through various access media. Auser searching Web-resident information may have to reformulate queries issued severaltimes and sift through many results until a satisfactory; if any; answer is obtained. As purelyquery-driven approaches may be inappropriate in this context; the need for a shift towards amore user-centered information access paradigm arises. To this end; different …,*,2005,3

A survey of context-aware cross-digital library personalization,Ana Nika; Tiziana Catarci; Yannis Ioannidis; Akrivi Katifori; Georgia Koutrika; Natalia Manola; Andreas Nürnberger; Manfred Thaller,Abstract The constant interaction of users with different Digital Libraries (DLs) and thesubsequent scattering of user information across them raise the need not only for DigitalLibrary interoperability but also for cross-Digital Library personalization. The latter calls forsharing and combining of user-information across different DL systems so that a DL systemmay take advantage of data from others. To achieve this goal; DL systems should be able tomaintain compliant and interoperable user models and profiles that enable propagation andreconciliation of user information across different DLs. In this paper; we motivate the need forcross-Digital Library personalization; we define and examine user model; profile; andcontext interoperability; and we survey and discuss existing user model interoperabilityapproaches.,International Workshop on Adaptive Multimedia Retrieval,2010,2

In contrast totraditional approaches for finding related documents that perform content comparisonsacross the content of the posts as a whole; we consider each post as a set of segments;each written with a different goal in mind. We advocate that the relatedness between twoposts should be based on the similarity of their respective segments that are intended for thesame goal; ie; are conveying the same intention. This means that it is possible for the sameterms to weigh differently in the relatedness score depending on the intention of the segmentin which they are found.

Those services are discoverable using natural language search; and composableusing a drag-and-drop interface. To support efficient execution; composed services areautomatically merged to a single executable script; which can then be run by a growingselection of platform-specific optimizers and interpreters.,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,1
Mirror mirror on the wall; which query's fairest of them all?,Georgia Koutrika; Alkis Simitsis,ABSTRACT Scientists heavily use database technologies to store and analyze massiveamounts of experimental data. However these tasks require (sometimes; advanced)knowledge of a query language; which is not necessarily amongst the normal skills of ascientist. Database experts may help in the initial construction of such queries; which arethen stored in a repository. Afterwards; instead of writing queries from scratch; stored queriescan be re-used with few or no changes by people in the same or a different research group.However; as much as this is a desired reality; we are actually stepping into dreamland.Searching a pool of database queries for those that fit in a certain analysis is not easy evenfor experienced database users. One solution could be to provide a description for eachquery and then; use a keyword search technique to identify queries of interest. But doing …,CIDR,2013,1

Modeling Users and Context in Digital Libraries: Interoperability Issues,Ana Nika; Tiziana Catarci; Akrivi Katifori; Georgia Koutrika; Natalia Manola; Andreas Nürnberger; Manfred Thaller,Abstract. The modeling of user characteristics is an important mechanism for the support andenhancement of personalization in Digital Libraries (DLs). Contextual information issometimes considered in the literature as part of the user model; although it in factinfluences user-DL interaction. However; context modeling and user modeling are stronglyinterrelated. Similar methods are employed for the representation of user context and usermodel and the use of ontologies constitutes a promising approach for such a representationbecause they facilitate the sharing of information and reinforce interoperability. In this paper;we define the user model and user context for Digital Libraries; we examine identifiedcontext dimensions as well as context-independent and contextdependent user modelattributes; and we propose a Shareable User and Context Model Ontology (SUCMO) for …,Proc. of the 2nd DL. org Workshop in conjunction with the 14th European Conference on Digital Libraries (ECDL 2010); Glasgow; Scotland,2010,*

One major question is whether that data can beused to augment systems like web search. To answer this question; over the past year wehave gathered what we believe to be the largest dataset from a social bookmarking site yetanalyzed by academic researchers. Our dataset represents about forty million bookmarksfrom the social bookmarking site del. icio. us. We contribute a characterization of posts todel. icio. us: how many bookmarks exist (about 115 million); how fast is it growing; and howactive are the URLs being posted about (quite active). We also contribute a characterizationof tags used by bookmarkers. We found that certain tags tend to gravitate towards certaindomains; and vice versa.

Context-dependent Access to Digital Libraries,Yannis Ioannidis; Georgia Koutrika; Timos Sellis; Nicolas Spyratos; Yannis Stavrakas,DELOS envisages Digital Libraries that would allow information to be accessed and used ina global environment; where implicit assumptions about data become less and less evident.Users with different backgrounds or viewpoints may interpret the same data in differentways. Moreover; the interpretation and suitability of data may depend on changingconditions; eg the current position of the user or the media he is using (laptop; mobile; PDA;etc.). To cater for such ambiguous situations the information provider needs to specify thecontext under which information becomes relevant. Conversely; information users canspecify their own current context when requesting for data in order to denote the part that isrelevant to their specific situation. Task 2.9 aims to investigate how support for context-dependent data can be integrated into Digital Libraries. The goal is to use context as an …,Network of Excellence on Digital Libraries,2006,*
Rule-based query personalization in digital libraries,Γιάννης Ιωαννίδης; Γεωργία Κούτρικα; Yannis Ioannidis; Georgia Koutrika,Searching a digital library is typically a tedious task. A system can improve informationaccess by building on knowledge about a user acquired in a user profile in order tocustomize information access both in terms of the information returned in response to aquery (query personalization) as well as in terms of the presentation of the results(presentation personalization). In this paper; we focus on query personalization in digitallibraries; in particular; we address structured queries involving metadata stored in relationaldatabases. We describe the specification of user preferences at the level of a user profileand the process of query personalization with the use of query-rewriting rules.,*,2004,*
A Personalization Framework for Database Queries,Georgia Koutrika,Abstract Increasing amounts of information becoming available to a wide spectrum of users;call for a shift towards a more user-centred; personalized information access paradigm. Inthis paper; we develop a personalization framework for database systems based on userprofiles and identify the basic architectural components required to support it. We define apreference model that assigns to each possible atomic query condition a personal degree ofinterest and provide an intuitive mechanism to calculate the degree of interest of anycomplex query condition based on the degrees of interest of the participating atomicconditions. Preferences are stored in user profiles. At query time; personalization proceedsin two steps:(a) preference selection; where the conditions relevant to the query and mostinteresting to the user are derived from the user profile;(b) preference integration; where …,HDMS,2003,*

Recommending Learning Resources with Selected Passage based on Latent Topics in E-Text,Lei Liu; Georgia Koutrika,Abstract: When readers have difficulty to understand any part of the e-text; they may want tofind some learning resources to help them understand. Treating the whole unclear passageas the query and submit it to a search engine is unsuccessful since existing search engineswere designed to accept small queries. In addition; as search engines usually transform thequery and candidate resources into bags or vectors of words; the semantic topics underlyingthe content are totally overlooked. We believe that topics offer a better choice for trulyunderstanding both the query and the candidate documents. In this paper; we propose anovel system for e-texts that facilitates the learning process by enabling search using asqueries text passages of any length and retrieving a ranked list of resources (documents;videos; etc) that match the different topics covered within the selected passage.
