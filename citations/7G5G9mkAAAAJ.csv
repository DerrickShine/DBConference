UML2Alloy: A challenging model transformation,Kyriakos Anastasakis; Behzad Bordbar; Geri Georg; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract Alloy is a formal language; which has been applied to modelling of systems in awide range of application domains. It is supported by Alloy Analyzer; a tool; which allowsfully automated analysis. As a result; creating Alloy code from a UML model provides theopportunity to exploit analysis capabilities of the Alloy Analyzer to discover possible designflaws at early stages of the software development. Our research makes use of model basedtechniques for the automated transformation of UML class diagrams with OCL constraints toAlloy code. The paper demonstrates challenging aspects of the model transformation; whichoriginate in fundamental differences between UML and Alloy. We shall discuss some of thedifferences and illustrate their implications on the model transformation process. Thepresented approach is explained via an example of a secure e-business system.,International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems,2007,295
Aspect-oriented approach to early design modelling,Robert France; Indrakshi Ray; Geri Georg; Sudipto Ghosh,Developers of modern software systems are often required to build software that addressessecurity; fault-tolerance and other dependability concerns. A decision to address adependability concern in a particular manner can make it difficult or impossible to addressother concerns in software. Proper attention to balancing key dependability and otherconcerns in the early phases of development can help developers better manage productrisks through early identification and resolution of conflicts and undesirable emergentbehaviours that arise as a result of interactions across behaviours that address differentconcerns. The authors describe an aspect-oriented modelling (AOM) approach that easesthe task of exploring alternative ways of addressing concerns during software modelling.The paper focuses on use of the AOM approach to produce logical; aspect-oriented …,IEE Proceedings-Software,2004,282
On challenges of model transformation from UML to Alloy,Kyriakos Anastasakis; Behzad Bordbar; Geri Georg; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is the de facto language used in theindustry for software specifications. Once an application has been specified; Model DrivenArchitecture (MDA) techniques can be applied to generate code from such specifications.Since implementing a system based on a faulty design requires additional cost and effort; itis important to analyse the UML models at earlier stages of the software developmentlifecycle. This paper focuses on utilizing MDA techniques to deal with the analysis of UMLmodels and identify design faults within a specification. Specifically; we show how UMLmodels can be automatically transformed into Alloy which; in turn; can be automaticallyanalysed by the Alloy Analyzer. The proposed approach relies on MDA techniques totransform UML models to Alloy. This paper reports on the challenges of the model …,Software & Systems Modeling,2010,190
Reducing damage assessment latency in survivable databases,Indrakshi Ray; Ross M McConnell; Monte Lunacek; Vijay Kumar,Abstract Traditional recovery mechanisms are not adequate in protecting databases frommalicious attacks. A malicious transaction by virtue of writing on to the database can corruptone or more data items; benign transactions reading these data items and writing on otherdata items can help spread the damage. To prevent the damage from spreading; it isimportant to assess the damage and confine it as quickly as possible. Algorithms providingfast damage assessment are needed. In this paper we look at two existing techniques fordamage assessment and analyze their complexity. We also propose a new technique thatimproves upon the existing techniques by reducing the time required for damageassessment.,British National Conference on Databases,2004,166
A semantic-based transaction processing model for multilevel transactions 1,Indrakshi Ray; Paul Ammann; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract Multilevel transactions have been proposed for multilevel secure databases; incontrast to most proposals; such transactions allow users to read and write across multiplesecurity levels. The security requirement that no high level operation influence a low leveloperation often conflicts with the atomicity requirement of the standard transactionprocessing model. In particular; others have shown that no concurrency control algorithmbased on the standard transaction processing model can guarantee both atomicity andsecurity. This conflict motivates us to propose an alternative semantic-based transactionprocessing model for multilevel transactions. Our model uses the semantics of theapplication to analyze an application and reason about its behavior. Our notion ofcorrectness is based on semantic correctness instead of serializability as in the standard …,Journal of Computer Security,1998,164
Recovering from malicious attacks in workflow systems,Yajie Zhu; Tai Xin; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract Workflow management systems (WFMS) coordinate execution of logically relatedmultiple tasks in an organization. Such coordination is achieved through dependencies thatare specified between the tasks of a workflow. Often times preventive measures are notenough and a workflow may be subjected to malicious attacks. Traditional workflow recoverymechanisms do not address how to recover from malicious attacks. Database survivabilitytechniques do not work for workflow because tasks in a workflow have dependencies thatare not present in traditional transaction processing systems. In this paper; we present analgorithm that shows how we can assess and repair the effects of damage caused bymalicious tasks. Our algorithm focuses not only on restoring the consistency of data items byremoving the effects of malicious tasks but also takes appropriate actions to ensure the …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2005,163
A spatio-temporal role-based access control model,Indrakshi Ray; Manachai Toahchoodee,Abstract With the growing advancement of pervasive computing technologies; we aremoving towards an era where spatio-temporal information will be necessary for accesscontrol. The use of such information can be used for enhancing the security of anapplication; and it can also be exploited to launch attacks. For critical applications; a formalmodel for spatio-temporal-based access control is needed that increases the security of theapplication and ensures that the location information cannot be exploited to cause harm. Inthis paper; we propose a spatio-temporal access control model; based on the Role-BasedAccess Control (RBAC) model; that is suitable for pervasive computing applications.

Using UML to visualize role-based access control constraints,Indrakshi Ray; Na Li; Robert France; Dae-Kyoo Kim,Abstract Organizations use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to protect informationresources from unauthorized access. We propose an approach; based on the UnifiedModeling Language (UML); that shows how RBAC policies can be systematicallyincorporated into an application design. We consider an RBAC model to be a pattern whichwe express using UML diagram templates; RBAC policies for an application conforming tothis model can be generated by instantiating these templates with values obtained from theapplication. The constraints of the RBAC model are expressed using the Object ConstraintLanguage (OCL). OCL constraints; based on first-order logic; are difficult to understand. Toalleviate this problem; we show how violation of such constraints can be visuallyrepresented using object diagram templates. With adequate tool support; developers can …,Proceedings of the ninth ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2004,134
Using aspects to design a secure system,Geri Georg; Indrakshi Ray; Robert France,Developers of complex systems have to address concerns such as security; availability ofservices; and timeliness that often are non-orthogonal to traditional design structures; that is;the concerns cross-cut traditional design units. We illustrate how an aspect-orientedapproach to modeling allows developers to encapsulate such design concerns so that theycan be woven into a design in a systematic and consistent manner. The paper focuses onthe use of aspects for modeling and weaving in security concerns.,Engineering of Complex Computer Systems; 2002. Proceedings. Eighth IEEE International Conference on,2002,119
An aspect-based approach to modeling access control concerns,Indrakshi Ray; Robert France; Na Li; Geri Georg,Abstract Specifying; enforcing and evolving access control policies is essential to preventsecurity breaches and unavailability of resources. These access control design concernsimpose requirements that allow only authorized users to access protected computer-basedresources. Addressing these concerns in a design results in the spreading of access controlfunctionality across several design modules. The pervasive nature of access controlfunctionality makes it difficult to evolve; analyze; and enforce access control policies. Totackle this problem; we propose using an aspect-oriented modeling (AOM) approach foraddressing access control concerns. In the AOM approach; functionality that addresses apervasive access control concern is localized in an aspect. Other functional design concernsare addressed in a model of the application referred to as a primary model. Composing …,Information and Software Technology,2004,112
An anonymous and failure resilient fair-exchange e-commerce protocol,Indrajit Ray; Indrakshi Ray; Narasimhamurthi Natarajan,Abstract In an electronic commerce environment; the merchant and the customer areunlikely to trust each other. This problem has motivated researchers to propose fair-exchange protocols based on using an on-line trusted third party; the third party receives theitems being exchanged from the customer and the merchant and then forwards it to the otherparty in a fair manner. However; the third party is a source of bottleneck for these protocols.Not only is the performance of the third party an issue; but also its vulnerability to denial ofservice attacks. In this paper; we propose an optimistic protocol in which the trusted thirdparty is invoked only if any party misbehaves or prematurely aborts. The protocol achievesfairness and dispute resolution is performed automatically within the scope of the protocol.We show how we can distribute the function of the trusted third party across several third …,Decision Support Systems,2005,97
A cryptographic solution to implement access control in a hierarchy and more,Indrakshi Ray; Indrajit Ray; Natu Narasimhamurthi,Abstract The need for access control in a hierarchy arises in several different contexts. Onesuch context is managing the information of an organization where the users are divided intodifferent security classes depending on who has access to what. Several cryptographicsolutions have been proposed to address this problem---the solutions are based ongenerating cryptographic keys for each security class such that the key for a lower levelsecurity class depends on the key for the security class that is higher up in the hierarchy.Most solutions use complex cryptographic techniques: integrating these into existingsystems may not be trivial. Others have impractical requirement: if a user at a security levelwants to access data at lower levels; then all intermediate nodes must be traversed.Moreover; if there is an access control policy that does not conform to the hierarchical …,Proceedings of the seventh ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2002,94
Fair exchange in e-commerce,Indrajit Ray; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract Many business transactions over the Internet involve the exchange of digitalproducts between two parties-electronic mails; digital audio and video; electronic contractsigning and digital signatures; to name a few. Often these transactions occur betweenplayers that do not trust each other. To facilitate such transactions; a number of secureprotocols have been proposed. The main objective of these protocols is: either both theparties obtain each other's items or none do. Sometimes it is not possible to meet the aboveobjective and researchers have aimed for a weaker objective: gather evidence duringprotocol execution using which an honest party can prove his case. Protocols which meetany of the two objectives are collectively termed fair exchange protocols. In this paper wereview some of the work done on such fair exchange protocols and identify areas that still …,ACM SIGecom Exchanges,2002,94
An anonymous electronic voting protocol for voting over the internet,Indrajit Ray; Indrakshi Ray; Natarajan Narasimhamurthi,We propose a secure electronic voting protocol that is suitable for large scale voting over theInternet. The protocol allows a voter to cast his or her ballot anonymously; by exchanginguntraceable yet authentic messages. The protocol ensures that: only eligible voters are ableto cast votes; a voter is able to cast only one vote; a voter is able to verify that his or her voteis counted in the final tally; nobody; other than the voter is able to link a cast vote with avoter; and if a voter decides not to cast a vote; nobody is able to cast a fraudulent vote inplace of the voter.,Advanced Issues of E-Commerce and Web-Based Information Systems; WECWIS 2001; Third International Workshop on.,2001,90
Towards a location-based mandatory access control model,Indrakshi Ray; Mahendra Kumar,Abstract With the growing use of wireless networks and mobile devices; we are movingtowards an era where location information will be necessary for access control. The use oflocation information can be used for enhancing the security of an application; and it can alsobe exploited to launch attacks. For critical applications; such as the military; a formal modelfor location-based access control is needed that increases the security of the application andensures that the location information cannot be exploited to cause harm. In this paper; weshow how the mandatory access control (MAC) model can be extended to incorporate thenotion of location. We also show how the different components in the MAC model are relatedwith location and how this location information can be used to determine whether a subjecthas access to a given object.

An optimistic fair exchange e-commerce protocol with automated dispute resolution,Indrakshi Ray; Indrajit Ray,Abstract In this paper we propose an e-commerce protocol with the following features:(1)ensures true fair exchange;(2) does not require manual dispute resolution in case of unfairbehavior by any party;(3) does not require the active involvement of a trusted third party;(4)allows the customer to verify that the product he is about to receive is the one he is payingfor; and (5) can be used for the fair exchange of any two digital items.,International Conference on Electronic Commerce and Web Technologies,2000,77
An aspect-oriented methodology for designing secure applications,Geri Georg; Indrakshi Ray; Kyriakos Anastasakis; Behzad Bordbar; Manachai Toahchoodee; Siv Hilde Houmb,Abstract We propose a methodology; based on aspect-oriented modeling (AOM); forincorporating security mechanisms in an application. The functionality of the application isdescribed using the primary model and the attacks are specified using aspects. The attackaspect is composed with the primary model to obtain the misuse model. The misuse modeldescribes how much the application can be compromised. If the results are unacceptable;then some security mechanism must be incorporated into the application. The securitymechanism; modeled as security aspect; is composed with the primary model to obtain thesecurity-treated model. The security-treated model is analyzed to give assurance that it isresilient to the attack.,Information and Software Technology,2009,76
An interoperable context sensitive model of trust,Indrakshi Ray; Indrajit Ray; Sudip Chakraborty,Abstract Although the notion of trust is widely used in secure information systems; very fewworks attempt to formally define it or reason about it. Moreover; in most works; trust isdefined as a binary concept—either an entity is completely trusted or not at all. Absolute truston an entity requires one to have complete knowledge about the entity. This is rarely thecase in real-world applications. Not trusting an entity; on the other hand; prohibits allcommunications with the entity rendering it useless. In short; treating trust as a binaryconcept is not acceptable in practice. Consequently; a model is needed that incorporates thenotion of different degrees of trust. We propose a model that allows us to formalize trustrelationships. The trust relationship between a truster and a trustee is associated with acontext and depends on the experience; knowledge; and recommendation that the truster …,Journal of Intelligent Information Systems,2009,72
Achieving privacy in trust negotiations with an ontology-based approach,Anna Cinzia Squicciarini; Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Indrakshi Ray,The increasing use of Internet in a variety of distributed multiparty interactions andtransactions with strong real-time requirements has pushed the search for solutions to theproblem of attribute-based digital interactions. A promising solution today is represented byautomated trust negotiation systems. Trust negotiation systems allow subjects in differentsecurity domains to securely exchange protected resources and services. These trustnegotiation systems; however; by their nature; may represent a threat to privacy in thatcredentials; exchanged during negotiations; often contain sensitive personal information thatmay need to be selectively released. In this paper; we address the problem of preservingprivacy in trust negotiations.

Secure personal data servers: a vision paper,Tristan Allard; Nicolas Anciaux; Luc Bouganim; Yanli Guo; Lionel Le Folgoc; Benjamin Nguyen; Philippe Pucheral; Indrajit Ray; Indrakshi Ray; Shaoyi Yin,Abstract An increasing amount of personal data is automatically gathered and stored onservers by administrations; hospitals; insurance companies; etc. Citizen themselves oftencount on internet companies to store their data and make them reliable and highly availablethrough the internet. However; these benefits must be weighed against privacy risks incurredby centralization. This paper suggests a radically different way of considering themanagement of personal data. It builds upon the emergence of new portable and securedevices combining the security of smart cards and the storage capacity of NAND Flashchips. By embedding a full-fledged Personal Data Server in such devices; user control ofhow her sensitive data is shared by others (by whom; for how long; according to which rule;for which purpose) can be fully reestablished and convincingly enforced.

Query m-invariance: Preventing query disclosures in continuous location-based services,Rinku Dewri; Indrakshi Ray; Indrajit Ray; Darrell Whitley,Location obfuscation using cloaking regions preserves location anonymity by hiding the trueuser among a set of other equally likely users. Furthermore; a cloaking region should alsoguarantee that the type of queries issued by users within the region are mutually diverseenough. The first requirement is fulfilled by satisfying location k-anonymity while the secondone is ensured by satisfying query l-diversity. However; these two models are not sufficientto prevent the association of queries to users when the service depends on continuouslocation updates. Successive cloaking regions for a user may be k-anonymous and query l-diverse but still be prone to correlation attacks. In this paper; we provide a formal analysis ofthe privacy risks involved in a continuous location-based service; and show how continuousqueries can invalidate the privacy guarantees provided by k-anonymity and l-diversity …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2010 Eleventh International Conference on,2010,62
Modeling role-based access control using parameterized UML models,Dae-Kyoo Kim; Indrakshi Ray; Robert France; Na Li,Abstract Organizations use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to protect computer-basedresources from unauthorized access. There has been considerable work on formallyspecifying RBAC policies but there is still a need for RBAC policy specification techniquesthat can be integrated into software design methods. This paper describes a method forincorporating specifications of RBAC policies into UML design models. Reusable RBACpolicies are specified as patterns and are expressed using UML template diagrams.Incorporating RBAC policies into an application specific model involves instantiating thepatterns and composing the instantiations with the model. The method also includes atechnique for specifying patterns of RBAC violations. Developers can use the patterns toidentify policy violations in their models. The method is illustrated using a small banking …,International Conference on Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,2004,60
A fair-exchange e-commerce protocol with automated dispute resolution,Indrajit Ray; Indrakshi Ray; Natarajan Narasimhamurthi,Abstract In this paper; we present a fair-exchange electronic commerce (e-commerce)protocol; based on using an online trusted third party; that ensures fairness and preventsany party from gaining advantage by quitting prematurely from the transaction or otherwisemisbehaving. An important contribution of this protocol is that the dispute resolution is takencare of within the protocol itself and does not require manual intervention. Thus even if oneof the parties disappear after the transaction completion; the other party does not suffer inany manner. Another noteworthy contribution is that the protocol allows the customer toverify that the product he is about to receive is the one he actually ordered; before thecustomer pays for the product. At the same time it ensures that the customer receives theproduct if and only if the merchant gets paid for the product. All these features are …,*,2002,59
Applying formal methods to semantic-based decomposition of transactions,Paul Ammann; Sushil Jajodia; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract In some database applications the traditional approach of seerializability; in whichtransactions appear to execute atomically and in isolation on a consistent database state;fails to satisfy performance requirements. Although many researchers have investigated theprocess of decomposing transactions into steps to increase concurrency; such researchtypically focuses on providing algorithms necessary to implement a decomposition suppliedby the database application developer and pays relatively little attention to what constitutessa desirable decomposition or how the developer should obtain one. We focus onthedecomposition itself. A decomposition generates proof obligations whose deschargeensures desirable properties with respect to the original collection of transactions. Weintroduce the notion of semantic histories to formulate and prove the necessary properties …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1997,52
Optimal security hardening on attack tree models of networks: a cost-benefit analysis,Rinku Dewri; Indrajit Ray; Nayot Poolsappasit; Darrell Whitley,Abstract Researchers have previously looked into the problem of determining whether agiven set of security hardening measures can effectively make a networked system secure.However; system administrators are often faced with a more challenging problem since theyhave to work within a fixed budget which may be less than the minimum cost of systemhardening. An attacker; on the other hand; explores alternative attack scenarios to inflict themaximum damage possible when the security controls are in place; very often rendering theoptimality of the controls invalid. In this work; we develop a systematic approach to perform acost-benefit analysis on the problem of optimal security hardening under such conditions.Using evolutionary paradigms such as multi-objective optimization and competitive co-evolution; we model the attacker-defender interaction as an “arms race”; and explore how …,International Journal of Information Security,2012,50
Ensuring spatio-temporal access control for real-world applications,Manachai Toahchoodee; Indrakshi Ray; Kyriakos Anastasakis; Geri Georg; Behzad Bordbar,Abstract Traditional access control models; such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC); donot take into account contextual information; such as location and time; for making accessdecisions. Consequently; they are inadequate for specifying the access control needs ofmany complex real-world applications; such as the Dengue Decision Support (DDS) that wediscuss in this paper. We need to ensure that such applications are adequately protectedusing emerging access control models. This requires us to represent the application and itsaccess control requirements in a formal specification language. We choose the UnifiedModeling Language (UML) for this purpose; since UML is becoming the defactospecification language in the software industry. We need to analyze this formal specificationto get assurance that the application is adequately protected.

Verifiable composition of access control and application features,Eunjee Song; Raghu Reddy; Robert France; Indrakshi Ray; Geri Georg; Roger Alexander,Abstract Access control features are often spread across and tangled with other functionalityin a design. This makes modifying and replacing these features in a design difficult. Aspect-oriented modeling (AOM) techniques can be used to support separation of access controlconcerns from other application design concerns. Using an AOM approach; access controlfeatures are described by aspect models and other application features are described by aprimary model. Composition of aspect and primary models yields a design model in whichaccess control features are integrated with other application features. In this paper; wepresent; through an example; an AOM approach that supports verifiable composition ofbehaviors described in access control aspect models and primary models. Given an aspectmodel; a primary model; and a specified property; the composition technique produces …,Proceedings of the tenth ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2005,46
Using parameterized UML to specify and compose access control models,Indrakshi Ray; Na Li; Dae-Kyoo Kim; Robert France,Abstract Situations can arise in which organizations have to merge policies that are basedon different access control frameworks; such as Role Based Access Control (RBAC) andMandatory Access Control (MAC). Integrating policies requires addressing the followingquestion: How will the integration impact access to protected resources? In particular; oneneeds to determine that the integration does not result in security breaches or unavailabilityof resources. A way of addressing these concerns is to model the access controlframeworks; compose the models; and analyze the resulting model to identify problems. Inthis paper we outline a technique for modeling and composing access control policyframeworks. Specifically; we model RBAC and MAC using a variant of the Unified ModelingLanguage (UML) and show how to compose the models. The composed model can be …,*,2004,46
A spatio-temporal access control model supporting delegation for pervasive computing applications,Indrakshi Ray; Manachai Toahchoodee,Abstract The traditional access control models; such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)and Bell-LaPadula (BLP); are not suitable for pervasive computing applications whichtypically lack well-defined security perimeters and where all the entities and interactions arenot known in advance. We propose an access control model that handles such dynamicapplications and uses environmental contexts to determine whether a user can get access tosome resource. Our model is based on RBAC because it simplifies role management and isthe de facto access control model for commercial organizations. However; unlike RBAC; ituses information from the environmental contexts to determine access decisions. The modelalso supports delegation which is important for dynamic applications where a user isunavailable and permissions may have to be transferred temporarily to another user/role …,International Conference on Trust; Privacy and Security in Digital Business,2008,45
Vulnerability discovery in multi-version software systems,Jinyoo Kim; Yashwant K Malaiya; Indrakshi Ray,The vulnerability discovery process for a program describes the rate at which the securityvulnerabilities are discovered. Being able to predict the vulnerability discovery processallows developers to adequately plan for resource allocation needed to develop patches forthem. It also enables the users to assess the security risks. Thus there is a need to develop amodel of the discovery process that can predict the number of vulnerabilities that are likely tobe discovered in a given time frame. Recent studies have produced vulnerability discoveryprocess models that are suitable for a specific version of a software. However; these modelsmay not accurately estimate the vulnerability discovery rates for a software when weconsider successive versions; hi this paper; we propose a new approach for quantitativelymodeling the vulnerability discovery process; based on shared source code …,High Assurance Systems Engineering Symposium; 2007.

Using UML to model relational database operations,Eunjee Song; Shuxin Yin; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is being used as the de-facto standard inthe software industry. With the adoption of UML 2.0; the new enhancements allow thisversion to describe many of the elements found in today's software technology as well asModel Driven Architecture and Service-Oriented Architecture. Although the ObjectManagement Group (OMG) has released several UML Profiles to tailor the language tospecific areas; relational database modeling is not fully addressed in these profiles.

Failure analysis of an e-commerce protocol using model checking,Indrakshi Ray,The rapid growth of electronic commerce (e-commerce) has necessitated the developmentof e-commerce protocols. These protocols ensure the confidentiality and integrity ofinformation exchanged. In addition; researchers have identified other desirable properties;such as money atomicity; goods atomicity and validated receipt; that must be satisfied by e-commerce protocols. This paper shows how model checking can be used to obtain anassurance about the existence of these properties in an e-commerce protocol. It is essentialthat these desirable properties be satisfied even in the presence of site or communicationfailures. Using the model checker; we evaluate which failures cause the violation of one ormore of the properties. The results of the analysis are then used to propose a mechanismthat handles the failures to make the protocol failure-resilient.,Advanced Issues of E-Commerce and Web-Based Information Systems; 2000.

Scenario-based static analysis of UML class models,Lijun Yu; Robert B France; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract Static analysis tools; such as OCLE and USE; can be used to analyze structuralproperties of class models. The USE tool also provides support for analyzing specifiedoperations through interactive simulations in which users provide operation parameters; andmanually assign values to state elements to reflect the effect of an operation. In this paperwe describe an approach to statically analyzing behavior that does not require a user tomanually simulate behavior. The approach involves transforming a class model into a staticmodel of behavior; called a Snapshot Model. A Snapshot Model characterizes sequences ofsnapshots; where a snapshot describes an application state. A scenario describing asequence of operation invocations can be verified against a Snapshot Model using toolssuch as USE and OCLE.

On the formal analysis of a spatio-temporal role-based access control model,Manachai Toahchoodee; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract With the growing use of wireless networks and mobile devices; we are movingtowards an era where spatial and temporal information will be necessary for access control.The use of such information can be used for enhancing the security of an application; and itcan also be exploited to launch attacks. For critical applications; a model for spatio-temporal-based access control is needed that increases the security of the application and ensuresthat the location information cannot be exploited to cause harm. Consequently; researchershave proposed various spatio-temporal access control models that are useful in pervasivecomputing applications. Such models typically have numerous different features to supportthe various application requirements.

Verification and trade-off analysis of security properties in UML system models,Geri Georg; Kyriakos Anastasakis; Behzad Bordbar; Siv Hilde Houmb; Indrakshi Ray; Manachai Toahchoodee,Designing secure systems is a nontrivial task. Incomplete or faulty designs can causesecurity mechanisms to be incorrectly incorporated in a system; allowing them to bebypassed and resulting in a security breach. We advocate the use of the Aspect-OrientedRisk-Driven Development (AORDD) methodology for developing secure systems. Thismethodology begins with designers defining system assets; identifying potential attacksagainst them; and evaluating system risks. When a risk is unacceptable; designers mustmitigate the associated threat by incorporating security mechanisms methodically into thesystem design. Designers next formally evaluate the resulting design to ensure that thethreat has been mitigated; while still allowing development to meet other project constraints.In this paper; we focus on the AORDD analysis; which consists of:(1) a formal security …,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,2010,31
Detecting termination of active database rules using symbolic model checking,Indrakshi Ray; Indrajit Ray,Abstract Many algorithms have been proposed that detect non-termination of activedatabase rules. However; most of these provide a conservative estimate–they detect allpotential cases of non-termination. The onus is on the database programmers to furtheranalyze these cases and give more definite results about non-termination. In this paper weshow how the database programmer can automatically detect non-termination using anexisting symbolic model checker.

With the growth of wireless and mobile technologies; we are witnessing anincrease in location-based services (LBSs). Although LBSs provide enhancedfunctionalities; they open up new vulnerabilities that can be exploited to cause security andprivacy breaches. Consequently; location data of individuals used by such services must beadequately protected. Such services will require new models for expressing privacypreferences for location data and mechanisms for enforcing them. We identify the factors onwhich location privacy depends and propose models for expressing privacy that can beused by LBSs. We discuss the architecture of a system that allows one to specify andenforce location privacy and that can be easily integrated with existing systems providingLBSs. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by developing a prototype.,Trans. Data Privacy,2009,30
A crossover operator for the k-anonymity problem,Monte Lunacek; Darrell Whitley; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract Recent dissemination of personal data has created an important optimizationproblem: what is the minimal transformation of a dataset that is needed to guarantee theanonymity of the underlying individuals? One natural representation for this problem is a bit-string; which makes a genetic algorithm a logical choice for optimization. Unfortunately;under certain realistic conditions; not all bit combinations will represent valid solutions. Thismeans that in many instances; useful solutions are sparse in the search space. Weimplement a new crossover operator that preserves valid solutions under thisrepresentation. Our results show that this reproductive strategy is more efficient; effective;and robust than previous work. We also investigate how the population size and uniquenesscan affect the performance of genetic search on this application.,Proceedings of the 8th annual conference on Genetic and evolutionary computation,2006,29
Optimizing on-demand data broadcast scheduling in pervasive environments,Rinku Dewri; Indrakshi Ray; Indrajit Ray; Darrell Whitley,Abstract Data dissemination in pervasive environments is often accomplished by on-demand broadcasting. The time critical nature of the data requests plays an important role inscheduling these broadcasts. Most research in on-demand broadcast scheduling hasfocused on the timely servicing of requests so as to minimize the number of misseddeadlines. However; there exists many pervasive environments where the utility of the datais an equally important criterion as its timeliness. Missing the deadline reduces the utility ofthe data but does not make it zero. In this work; we address the problem of scheduling on-demand data broadcasts with soft deadlines. We investigate search based optimizationtechniques to develop broadcast schedulers that make explicit attempts to maximize theutility of data requests as well as service as many requests as possible within the …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,28
Composing aspect models,Geri Georg; Robert France; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract. Aspect-oriented modeling (AOM) techniques allow system developers to addressconcerns such as security; fault-tolerance; safety; and availability separately from corefunctional requirements during system design. Such separation implies that developers mustalso be able to analyze the integration of these additional concern designs with corefunctionality designs in order to compare realizations that may be based on conflictingdesign goals. System developers may create and analyze alternative design realizationsseveral times before a balanced system design is achieved. Separating concerns as aspectscan aid in this design evolution since a developer can focus on the realization of a singleconcern without having to worry about its interactions with other concerns or primaryfunctionality. However; the iterative nature of the process dictates that the composition …,The 4th AOSD Modeling With UML Workshop,2003,27
A trust-based access control model for pervasive computing applications,Manachai Toahchoodee; Ramadan Abdunabi; Indrakshi Ray; Indrajit Ray,Abstract With the rapid growth in wireless networks and sensor and mobile devices; we aremoving towards an era of pervasive computing. Access control is challenging in theseenvironments. In this work; we propose a trust based approach for access control forpervasive computing systems. Our previously proposed belief based trust model is used toevaluate the trustworthiness of users. Fine-grained access control is achieved depending onthe trust levels of users. We develop a class of trust-based access control models havingvery formal semantics; expressed in graph theory. The models differ with respect to thefeatures they provide; and the types of the trust constraints that they can support.,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2009,26
On the Optimal Selection of k in the k-Anonymity Problem,Rinku Dewri; Indrajit Ray; Indrakshi Ray; Darrell Whitley,When disseminating data involving human subjects; researchers have to weigh in therequirements of privacy of the individuals involved in the data. A model widely used forenhancing individual privacy is k-anonymity; where an individual data record is renderedsimilar to k-1 other records in the data set by using generalization and/or suppressionoperations on the data attributes. The drawback of this model is that such transformationsresult in considerable loss of information that is proportional to the choice of k. Studies in thiscontext have so far focused on minimizing the information loss for some given value of k.However; owing to the presence of outliers; a specified k value may or may not beobtainable. Further; an exhaustive analysis is required to determine ak value that fits the lossconstraint specified by a data publisher. In this paper; we formulate a multi-objective …,Data Engineering; 2008.

Designing high integrity systems using aspects,Geri Georg; Robert France; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract In this paper we show how design-level aspects can be used to develop highintegrity systems. In our approach; a system designer must first identify the specificmechanisms required for high integrity systems. To support this activity we have developedan initial tabulation of different kinds of threats and the mechanisms used to prevent; detect;and recover from the related attacks and problems. Each mechanism can be modeledindependently as an aspect. After the mechanisms are identified; the corresponding aspectsare then woven in the appropriate order into the models of the essential system functionalityto produce a model of a high integrity system.,*,2003,26
Information flow control for stream processing in clouds,Xing Xie; Indrakshi Ray; Raman Adaikkalavan; Rose Gamble,Abstract In the near future; clouds will provide situational monitoring services usingstreaming data. Examples of such services include health monitoring; stock marketmonitoring; shopping cart monitoring; and emergency control and threat management.Offering such services require securely processing data streams generated by multiple;possibly competing and/or complementing; organizations. Processing of data streams alsoshould not cause any overt or covert leakage of information across organizations. Wepropose an information flow control model adapted from the Chinese Wall policy that can beused to protect against sensitive data disclosure. We propose architectures that are suitablefor securely and efficiently processing streaming information belonging to differentorganizations.

Using alloy to analyse a spatio-temporal access control model supporting delegation,Manachai Toahchoodee; Indrakshi Ray,Pervasive computing applications use the knowledge of the environment to provide betterservices and functionality to the end user. Access control for such applications needs to usecontextual information. Towards this end; we proposed an access control model based onrole-based access control that uses the environmental contexts time and location todetermine whether a user can get access to some resource. The model also supportsdelegation which is important for dynamic applications where a user is unavailable andpermissions may have to be transferred temporarily to another user/role in order to completea specific task. Such a model typically has numerous features to support the requirements ofvarious applications. The features may interact in subtle ways to produce conflicts. Here; wepropose an automated approach using Alloy for detecting such conflicts. Alloy is …,IET Information Security,2009,25
Supporting multi-dimensional separation of design concerns,Robert France; Geri Georg; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract The development of dependable software requires developers to address multiple;interrelated; design concerns; for example; security; fault tolerance; and safety concerns. Asthe complexity of software increases there is a need to develop mechanisms that allowdevelopers to isolate realizations of design concerns during design and then compose themto obtain a comprehensive design. Such mechanisms can facilitate separation of concernsalong multiple dimensions and can help manage the complexity inherent in creating andevolving highly-dependable software. In this paper we discuss some of the issues andchallenges that should be addressed in developing mechanisms that support multi-dimensional separation of design concerns (MDSoC). We also outline a UML-basedapproach we are currently developing to support MDSoC.,Proceedings of the Third International Workshop on Aspect-Oriented Modeling,2003,25
Specification; validation; and enforcement of a generalized spatio-temporal role-based access control model,Ramadan Abdunabi; Mustafa Al-Lail; Indrakshi Ray; Robert B France,With the advent of wireless and mobile devices; many new applications are beingdeveloped that make use of the spatio-temporal information of a user to provide betterfunctionality. Such applications also necessitate sophisticated authorization models whereaccess to a resource depends on the credentials of the user and also on the location andtime of access. Consequently; researchers have extended the traditional access controlmodels; such as role-based access control; to provide spatio-temporal access control. Weimprove upon these models by providing additional features that allow us to expressconstraints that were not possible until now. We express our model using the unifiedmodeling language (UML) and the object constraint language that are the de factospecification languages used by the industry.

A rigorous approach to uncovering security policy violations in UML designs,Lijun Yu; Robert France; Indrakshi Ray; Sudipto Ghosh,There is a need for rigorous analysis techniquesthat developers can use to uncover securitypolicyviolations in their UML designs. There are a few UMLanalysis tools that can be usedfor this purpose; butthey either rely on theorem-proving mechanisms thatrequiresophisticated mathematical skill to useeffectively; or they are based on model-checkingtechniques that require a “closed-world” view of thesystem (ie; a system in whichthere are no inputs fromexternal sources). In this paper we show how alightweight; scenario-based UML design analysisapproach we developed can be used to rigorouslyanalyze aUML design to uncover security policyviolations.

Rigorous analysis of uml access control policy models,Wuliang Sun; Robert France; Indrakshi Ray,The use of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) for specifying security policies is attractivebecause it is expressive and has a wide user base in the software industry. However; thereare very few mature tools that support rigorous analysis of UML models. Alloy is a formalspecification language that has been used to rigorously analyze security policies; but fewpractitioners have the background needed to develop good Alloy models. We propose anew approach to policy analysis in which designers use UML at the front-end to describetheir security policies and the Alloy Analyzer is used at the backend to analyze the modeledproperties. The UML-to-Alloy and Alloy-to-UML transformations obviate the need for securitydesigners to understand the Alloy specification language. The proposed approach supportsthe analysis of both functional and structural aspects of security policies.,Policies for Distributed Systems and Networks (POLICY); 2011 IEEE International Symposium on,2011,23
On the formalization and analysis of a spatio-temporal role-based access control model,Manachai Toahchoodee; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract With the growing use of wireless networks and mobile devices; we are movingtowards an era of pervasive computing. Such environments will spawn new applications thatuse contextual information to provide enhanced services. Traditional access control modelscannot protect such applications because the access requirements may be contingent uponthe location of the user and the time of access. Consequently; we propose a new spatio-temporal role-based access control model that supports delegation for use in suchapplications. The model can be used by any application where the access is contingent notonly on the role of the user; but also on the locations of the user and the object and the timeof access. We describe how each entity in the role-based access control model is affected bytime and location and propose constraints to express this.

VTRUST: a trust Management System based on a Vector Model of Trust,Indrajit Ray; Sudip Chakraborty; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract Trust can be used to measure our confidence that a secure system behaves asexpected. We had previously proposed a vector model of trust [1]. In this work we addressthe problem of trust management using the vector model. We develop a new trustmanagement engine which we call VTrust (from Vector Trust). The trust management enginestores and manages current as well as historical information about different parameters thatdefine a trust relation between a truster and a trustee. We propose an SQL like languagecalled TrustQL to interact with the trust management engine. TrustQL consists of a TrustDefinition Language (TDL) that is used to define a trust relationship and a TrustManipulation Language (TML) that is used to query and update information about trustrelationships.,International Conference on Information Systems Security,2005,22

Specification and analysis of access control policies for mobile applications,Ramadan Abdunabi; Indrakshi Ray; Robert France,Abstract Mobile applications allow individuals on-the-move access to resources" anytime;anywhere" using hand-held mobile devices. We argue that for critical and sensitiveresources this is often times not desirable--a lost or stolen mobile device can be tamperedwith to view or alter sensitive information. We need authorization policies that take intoaccount time of access and location of the user in addition to the credentials of the user.Towards this end; we propose a new spatio-temporal role-based access control model. Itimproves upon existing models by providing features that are useful for mobile applications.Thus; an application using our model can specify different types of spatio-temporalconstraints.

Pervasive computingapplications typically involve interactions between a large number of entities that spandifferent organizations. Uncontrolled disclosure of information or unconstrained interactionamong entities may have extremely grave consequences. Traditional security policies andmechanisms are inadequate for pervasive computing applications. Unlike traditionalapplications; pervasive computing applications have no definite security perimeters and aredynamic in nature. Pervasive computing applications may need to interact with entities thatare not known a priori and therefore cannot be trusted.

Analysis of dependencies in advanced transaction models,Indrakshi Ray; Tai Xin,Abstract Transactional dependencies play an important role in coordinating and executingthe subtransactions in advanced transaction processing models; such as; nestedtransactions and workflow transactions. Researchers have formalized the notion oftransactional dependencies and have shown how various advanced transaction models canbe expressed using different kinds of dependencies. Incorrect specification of dependenciescan result in unpredictable behavior of the advanced transaction; which; in turn; can lead tounavailability of resources and information integrity problems. In this work; we focus on howto correctly specify dependencies in an advanced transaction. We enumerate the differentkinds of dependencies that may be present in an advanced transaction and classify theminto two broad categories: event ordering and event enforcement dependencies.

Applying semantic knowledge to real-time update of access control policies,Indrakshi Ray,Real-time update of access control policies; that is; updating policies while they are in effectand enforcing the changes immediately; is necessary for many security-critical applications.In this paper; we consider real-time update of access control policies in a database system.Updating policies while they are in effect can lead to potential security problems; such as;access to database objects by unauthorized users. In this paper; we propose severalalgorithms that not only prevent such security breaches but also ensure the correctness ofexecution. The algorithms differ from each other in the degree of concurrency provided andthe semantic knowledge used. Of the algorithms presented; the most concurrency isachieved when transactions are decomposed into atomic steps. Once transactions aredecomposed; the atomicity; consistency; and isolation properties no longer hold. Since …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2005,18
A lattice-based approach for updating access control policies in real-time,Tai Xin; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract Real-time update of access control policies; that is; updating policies while they arein effect and enforcing the changes immediately and automatically; is necessary for manydynamic environments. Examples of such environments include disaster relief and warzone. In such situations; system resources may need re-configuration or operational modesmay change; necessitating a change of policies. For the system to continue functioning; thepolicies must be changed immediately and the modified policies automatically enforced. Inthis paper; we propose a solution to this problem—we consider real-time update of accesscontrol policies in the context of a database system. In our model; a database consists of aset of objects that are read and updated through transactions. Access to the data objects arecontrolled by access control policies which are stored in the form of policy objects. We …,Information Systems,2007,17
A light-weight static approach to analyzing UML behavioral properties,Lijun Yu; Robert B France; Indrakshi Ray; Kevin Lano,Identifying and resolving design problems in the early design phase can help ensuresoftware quality and save costs. There are currently few tools for analyzing designsexpressed using the Unified Modeling Language (UML). Tools such as OCLE and USEsupport analysis of static structural properties. These tools provide mechanisms for checkinginstance models against invariant properties expressed using the object constraint language(OCL). In this paper we propose an approach to analyzing behavioral properties of UMLmodels that can utilize static analysis tools. The approach includes a technique forgenerating a class model of behavior from operation specifications expressed in a restrictedform of OCL Behavioral properties are expressed as invariants defined in the class model ofbehavior.

Aspect-oriented risk driven development of secure applications,Geri Georg; Siv Hilde Houmb; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract Security breaches seldom occur because of faulty security mechanisms. Oftentimes; security mechanisms are incorrectly incorporated in an application which allows themto be bypassed resulting in a security breach. Methodologies are needed for incorporatingsecurity mechanisms in an application and assessing whether the resulting system is indeedsecure. We propose one such methodology for designing secure applications. We begin byidentifying the assets in the application that need protection. We then find the kinds ofattacks that are typical for such applications. We show how to evaluate the applicationagainst such attacks. If the results are unacceptable; that is; they pose a high security risk;then some security mechanism must be incorporated into the application. We illustrate howthis can be done and show how the resulting system can be evaluated to give assurance …,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2006,16
Ensuring atomicity of multilevel transactions,Paul Ammann; Sushil Jajodia; Indrakshi Ray,Ensuring atomicity is a major outstanding problem with present methods of handlingmultilevel transactions. The chief difficulty is that a high section of a transaction may beunable to complete due to violations of the integrity constraints; and a rollback of sectionscan be exploited to implement a covert channel. We define a notion of semantic atomicitywhich guarantees that either all or none of the sections of a transaction are present in anyhistory. The notion of correct executions in our model is based on semantic correctness-thatis; maintenance of integrity constraints-rather than serializability. We give a method wherebythe application developer can statically analyze the set of transactions in the application anddetermine if the set ensures semantic atomicity and other desirable properties.,Security and Privacy; 1996.

Most research in on-demand broadcast scheduling hasfocused on the timely servicing of requests so as to minimize the number of misseddeadlines. However; there exists many environments where the utility of the received data isan equally important criterion as its timeliness.

Towards trustworthy delegation in role-based access control model,Manachai Toahchoodee; Xing Xie; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract The need to delegate; which allows the temporary grant or transfer of access rights;arise in many applications. Although a lot of research appears in extending Role-BasedAccess Control (RBAC) to support delegation; not much appears on providing a formal basisfor choosing delegatees. We provide an approach that allows one to assess thetrustworthiness of potential delegatees in the context of the task that is to be delegated. It isalso important to ensure that the choice of the delegatee does not cause any security policyviolation. Towards this end; we show how to formally analyze the application using existingSAT solvers to get assurance that our choice of delegatee does not cause a security breach.Once the process of choosing delegatee can be formalized; it will be possible to automatedelegation and use it for real-time applications.,International Conference on Information Security,2009,14

In our protocol;(1) consumers whohave subscribed for an object can get access to the object only during the period that theirsubscription is valid;(2) persons who have not subscribed to an object do not get access tothe object;(3) increasing the number of consumers subscribing to an object does notdeteriorate the quality of service;(4) multiple key distributions to each consumer isavoided;(5) key management is simple–each consumer just remembers one key;(6)bandwidth requirements are low; and (7) large processing overhead required for …,ipdps,2002,14
Satisfiability analysis of workflows with control-flow patterns and authorization constraints,Ping Yang; Xing Xie; Indrakshi Ray; Shiyong Lu,Workflow security has become increasingly important and challenging in today's openservice world. While much research has been conducted on various security issues ofworkflow systems; the workflow satisfiability problem; which asks whether a set of userstogether can complete a workflow; is recently identified as an important research problemthat needs more investigation. In this paper; we study the computational complexity of theproblem along two directions: one is by considering either one path or all paths of aworkflow; and the other is by considering the possible patterns in a workflow. We haveshown that the general workflow satisfiability analysis problem is intractable. This resultmotivates us to consider restrictions on workflow control-flow patterns and access controlpolicies; and to identify tractable cases of practical interest.,IEEE Transactions on Services Computing,2014,13
Detection for conflicts of dependencies in advanced transaction models,Tai Xin; Indrakshi Ray,Transactional dependencies play an important role in coordinating the execution ofsubtransactions in advanced transaction models; such as; nested transactions and workflowtransactions. The correct execution of the advanced transactions depends on ensuring thesatisfaction of all the dependencies; which are specified by the application developer.Incorrect specification of transaction dependencies might lead to information integrityproblems and unavailability of resources. An example of incorrect specification ofdependencies is the presence of conflicts-the satisfaction of constraints imposed by onedependency may violate the constraints imposed by another dependency. Algorithms thatcan analyze and detect dependency conflicts are necessary.

Ensuring task dependencies during workflow recovery,Indrakshi Ray; Tai Xin; Yajie Zhu,Abstract Workflow management systems (WFMS) coordinate execution of multiple tasksperformed by different entities within an organization. In order to coordinate the execution ofthe various tasks in a workflow; task dependencies are specified among them. These taskdependencies are enforced during the normal execution of the workflow. When a systemcrash occurs some tasks of the workflow may be committed; some may be partially executedand others unscheduled. In such a situation; the recovery mechanism must take appropriateactions to react to the failure. Although researchers have worked on the problem of workflowrecovery; most of these work focus on restoring consistency by removing the effects ofpartially executed tasks. However; these work fail to address how to ensure taskdependencies during workflow recovery. In this paper; we consider the workflow recovery …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2004,13
Using formal methods to reason about semantics-based decompositions of transactions,Paul Ammann; Sushil Jajodia; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract Many researchers have investigated the process of decomposing transactions intosmaller pieces to increase concurrency. The research typically focuses on implementing adecomposition supplied by the database application developer; with relatively little attentionto what constitutes a desirable decomposition and how the developer should obtain such adecomposition. In this paper; we argue that the decomposition process itself warrantsattention. A decomposition generates a set of proof obligations that must be satis ed to showthat a particular decomposition correctly models the original collection of transactions. Weintroduce the notion of semantic histories to formulate and prove the necessary properties.Since the decomposition impacts not only the atomicity of transactions; but isolation andconsistency as well; we present a technique based on formal methods that allows these …,VLDB,1995,13
A generic digital forensic investigation framework for internet of things (iot),Victor R Kebande; Indrakshi Ray,Although numerous researches have been carried on Internet of Things (IoT); little focus hasbeen employed on how Digital Forensics (DF) techniques can be used to conduct DigitalForensic Investigations (DFIs) in IoT-based infrastructures. Up to this point; IoT has not fullyadapted to DF techniques owing to the fact that the current DF tools and procedures are notable to meet the heterogeneity and distributed nature of the IoT infrastructures. As a result;gathering; examining and analysing potential evidence from IoT environments that may beused as admissible evidence in a court of law poses a challenge to DF investigators andLaw Enforcement Agencies (LEA). Therefore; the problem addressed is that; at the time ofwriting this paper; there currently exist no accepted DF frameworks that can help to conductDFIs in an IoT-based environment.

Privacy preserving record matching using automated semi-trusted broker,Ibrahim Lazrig; Tarik Moataz; Indrajit Ray; Indrakshi Ray; Toan Ong; Michael Kahn; Frédéric Cuppens; Nora Cuppens,Abstract In this paper; we present a novel scheme that allows multiple data publishers thatcontinuously generate new data and periodically update existing data; to share sensitiveindividual records with multiple data subscribers while protecting the privacy of their clients.An example of such sharing is that of health care providers sharing patients' records withclinical researchers. Traditionally; such sharing is performed by sanitizing personallyidentifying information from individual records. However; removing identifying informationprevents any updates to the source information to be easily propagated to the sanitizedrecords; or sanitized records belonging to the same client to be linked together. We solvethis problem by utilizing the services of a third party; which is of very limited capabilities interms of its abilities to keep a secret; secret; and by encrypting the identification part used …,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2015,11
Trust-based access control for secure cloud computing,Indrajit Ray; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract Multi-tenancy; elasticity and dynamicity pose several novel challenges for accesscontrol in a cloud environment. Accessing subjects may dynamically change; resourcesrequiring protection may be created or modified; and subject access requirements toresources may change during the course of the application execution. Users may need toacquire different permissions from different administrative domains based on the services incloud computing environment.

On the formation of historically k-anonymous anonymity sets in a continuous LBS,Rinku Dewri; Indrakshi Ray; Indrajit Ray; Darrell Whitley,Abstract Privacy preservation in location based services (LBS) has received extensiveattention in recent years. One of the less explored problems in this domain is associated withservices that rely on continuous updates from the mobile object. Cloaking algorithmsdesigned to hide user locations in single requests perform poorly in this scenario. Thehistorical k-anonymity property is therefore enforced to ensure that all cloaking regionsinclude at least k objects in common. However; the mobility of the objects can easily renderincreasingly bigger cloaking regions and degrade the quality of service. To this effect; thispaper presents an algorithm to efficiently enforce historical k-anonymity by partitioning of anobject's cloaking region. We further enforce some degree of directional similarity in the kcommon peers in order to prevent an excessive expansion of the cloaking region.,International Conference on Security and Privacy in Communication Systems,2010,11
Security provisioning in pervasive environments using multi-objective optimization,Rinku Dewri; Indrakshi Ray; Indrajit Ray; Darrell Whitley,Abstract Pervasive computing applications involve information flow across multipleorganizations. Thus; any security breach in an application can have far-reachingconsequences. However; effective security mechanisms can be quite different from thosetypically deployed in conventional applications since these mechanisms are constrained byvarious factors in a pervasive environment. In this paper; we propose a methodology toperform a cost-benefit analysis under such circumstances. Our approach is based on theformulation of a set of constrained multi-objective optimization problems to minimize theresidual damage and the cost of security provisioning. We propose the use of workflowprofiles to capture the contexts in which a communication channel is used in a pervasiveenvironment. This is used to minimize the cost that the underlying business entity will …,European Symposium on Research in Computer Security,2008,11
Concurrent and real-time update of access control policies,Indrakshi Ray; Tai Xin,Abstract Access control policies are security policies that govern access to resources. Real-time update of access control policies; that is; updating policies while they are in effect andenforcing the changes immediately; is necessary for many security-critical applications. Inthis paper; we consider real-time update of access control policies in a database system. Weconsider an environment in which different kinds of transactions execute concurrently someof which are policy update transactions. Updating policy objects while they are deployed canlead to potential security problems. We propose two algorithms that not only prevent suchsecurity problems; but also ensure serializable execution of transactions. The algorithmsdiffer on the degree of concurrency provided.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2003,11
Systematic scenario-based analysis of UML design class models,Lijun Yu; Robert B France; Indrakshi Ray; Wuliang Sun,Scenario-based UML Design Analysis (SUDA) is a lightweight technique for analyzingbehavior specified in UML design class models. A person (verifier) charged with verifying adesign class model developed by an independent group of modelers can use SUDA toanalyze the design class model against a set of scenarios manually created by the verifier.In this paper we describe an extension of SUDA that allows a verifier to automaticallygenerate scenarios satisfying criteria defined by the verifier. We illustrate the extendedSUDA technique by analyzing a subset of the behavior specified in a Location-aware Role-Base Access Control (LRBAC) class model.,Engineering of Complex Computer Systems (ICECCS); 2012 17th International Conference on,2012,10
Using semantic correctness in multidatabases to achieve local autonomy; distribute coordination; and maintain global integrity,Indrakshi Ray; Paul Ammann; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract A multidatabase poses the following four; often contradictory; requirements. First;local databases require both design autonomy to accommodate the diverse legacy nature ofthe local databases; and execution autonomy to ensure that local transactions are notunduly blocked by global transactions. Second; management of global transactions must bedistributed to avoid bottlenecks and to tolerate failure in the global database. Third; bothlocal and global integrity constraints must be maintained. Finally; concurrent processing oftransactions requires that execution histories be correct; an objective traditionally achievedwith serializability. Although alternate forms of correctness have been proposed; none of thesolutions advanced to date has simultaneously achieved all four requirements. We proposea transaction processing model that uses a semantics-based notion of correctness to …,Information Sciences,2000,10
Audit log management in MongoDB,Prabhakaran Murugesan; Indrakshi Ray,In the past few years; web-based applications and their data management needs havechanged dramatically. Relational databases are often being replaced by other viablealternatives; such as NoSQL databases; for reasons of scalability and heterogeneity.MongoDB; a NoSQL database; is an agile database built for scalability; performance andhigh availability. It can be deployed in single server environment and also on complex multi-site architectures. MongoDB provides high performance for read and write operations byleveraging in-memory computing. Although researchers have motivated the need forMongoDB; not much appears in the area of log management. Efficient log managementtechniques are needed for various reasons including security; accountability; and improvingthe performance of the system. Towards this end; we analyze the different logging …,Services (SERVICES); 2014 IEEE World Congress on,2014,9
Enforcing spatio-temporal access control in mobile applications,Ramadan Abdunabi; Wuliang Sun; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract Mobile application technology is quickly evolving and being progressively utilizedin the commercial and public sectors. Such applications make use of spatio-temporalinformation to provide better services and functionalities. Authorization to such services oftendepends on the credentials of the user and also on the location and time. Althoughresearchers have proposed spatio-temporal access control models for such applications; notmuch has been done with respect to enforcement of spatio-temporal access control.Towards this end; we provide a practical framework that allows one to enforce spatio-temporal policies in mobile applications. Our policy enforcement mechanism illustrates thepractical viability of spatio-temporal authorization models and discusses potentialchallenges with possible solutions. Specifically; we propose an architecture for enforcing …,Computing,2014,9
An Approach to Analyzing Temporal Properties in UML Class Models.,Mustafa Al-Lail; Ramadan Abdunabi; Robert B France; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) Class Models are widely used for modelingthe static structure of object-oriented software systems. Temporal properties of such systemscan expressed using TOCL; a temporal extension to the Object Constraint Language (OCL).Verification and validation of temporal properties expressed in TOCL is non-trivial and thereare no automated tools that can aid such analysis. Existing approaches rely on transformingthe UML models to another language that supports automated analysis. Such transformationis complex and can introduce errors. Towards this end; we propose an approach for directlyanalyzing temporal properties expressed in TOCL. We present a case study based on theSteam Boiler Control System to demonstrate the applicability of the approach.,MoDeVVa@ MoDELS,2013,9
Multilevel secure data stream processing: Architecture and implementation,Raman Adaikkalavan; Xing Xie; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract The proliferation of sensors and mobile devices and their connectedness to thenetwork have given rise to numerous types of situation monitoring applications. Data StreamManagement Systems (DSMSs) have been proposed to address the data processing needsof such applications that require collection of high-speed data; computing results on-the-fly;and taking actions in real-time. Although a lot of work appears in the area of DSMS; notmuch has been done in multilevel secure (MLS) DSMS making the technology unsuitable forhighly sensitive applications; such as battlefield monitoring.

Estimating the relative trustworthiness of information sources in security solution evaluation,Siv Hilde Houmb; Indrakshi Ray; Indrajit Ray,Abstract When evaluating alternative security solutions; such as security mechanism;security protocols etc.;“hard” data or information is rarely available; and one have to relay onthe opinions of domain experts. Log-files from IDS; Firewalls and honeypots might also beused. However; such source are most often only used in an “penetrate and patch” strategy;meaning that system administrators; security experts or similar surveillance the network andinitiate appropriate reactions to the actions observed. Such sources refers to real-timeinformation; but might also be used in a more preventive manner by combining it with theopinions provided by the domain experts. To appropriately combine the information fromsuch various sources the notion of trust is used.

Implementing semantic-based decomposition of transactions,Sushil Jajodia; Indrakshi Ray; Paul Ammann,Abstract In some database applications; performance requirements are not satisfied by thetraditional approach of serializability; in which transactions appear to execute atomically andin isolation on a consistent database state. Although many researchers have investigatedthe process of decomposing transactions into steps to increase concurrency; the focus of theresearch is typically on implementing a decomposition supplied by the database applicationdeveloper; with relatively little attention to what constitutes a desirable decomposition andhow the developer should obtain such a decomposition. In our research; we focus on thedecomposition process itself. In [2]; we introduced the notion of semantic histories andidentified a number of properties which must be satisfied by a decomposition if thedecomposition correctly models the original collection of transactions. We also formulated …,International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering,1997,9
Towards efficient dissemination and filtering of XML data streams,Kirill Belyaev; Indrakshi Ray,The vast amounts of data generated in near real-time due to prolific use of sensors;pervasive usage of mobile Internet; and popularity of social media platforms; necessitatesthe efficient dissemination of the semi-structured streaming data to the consumingapplications. Towards this end; we introduce the subscriber-centric XML filtering approachfor seamless and efficient XML stream replication/distribution mechanism. The subscriber-centric filtering architecture can be configured to support different topologies in order tosupport efficient message filtering for a large number of concurrent subscribers. It allowsselective filtering on the various nodes that improves efficiency and provides applicationswith data on a need-to-know basis. Moreover; it supports inter-operability and allows semi-structured streams generated from multiple sources to be filtered.

Analysis of a relationship based access control model,Phillipa Bennett; Indrakshi Ray; Robert France,Abstract With the advent of online social networks (OSN) and personalized healthcare;relationship-based access control is playing an ever important role. People often sharesensitive personal information through online social networks (OSNs) to keep in touch withtheir friends and families. Such sensitive information if leaked inadvertently to third partiesmay have detrimental effects and sometimes disastrous consequences on the lives ofindividuals. Access control models are needed that allows controlled sharing of information.Different features of the model may conflict with each other. Identifying potential conflicts isimportant as sometimes such conflicts are sources of misconfigurations. We propose anaccess control model for use in OSNs and provide its formal specification. Manuallychecking the formal specification is tedious and error-prone.

Privacy-preserving multiple keyword search on outsourced data in the clouds,Tarik Moataz; Benjamin Justus; Indrakshi Ray; Nora Cuppens-Boulahia; Frédéric Cuppens; Indrajit Ray,Abstract Honest but curious cloud servers can make inferences about the stored encrypteddocuments and the profile of a user once it knows the keywords queried by her and thekeywords contained in the documents. We propose two progressively refined privacy-preserving conjunctive symmetric searchable encryption (PCSSE) schemes that allow cloudservers to perform conjunctive keyword searches on encrypted documents with differentprivacy assurances. Our scheme generates randomized search queries that prevent theserver from detecting if the same set of keywords are being searched by different queries. Itis also able to hide the number of keywords in a query as well as the number of keywordscontained in an encrypted document. Our searchable encryption scheme is efficient and atthe same time it is secure against the adaptive chosen keywords attack.,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2014,8
Contract-Aware slicing of UML class models,Wuliang Sun; Robert B France; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract Slicing is a reduction technique that has been applied to class models to supportmodel comprehension; analysis; and other modeling activities. In particular; slicingtechniques can be used to produce class model fragments that include only those elementsneeded to analyze semantic properties of interest. In this paper we describe a class modelslicing approach that takes into consideration invariants and operation contracts expressedin the Object Constraint Language (OCL). The approach is used to produce modelfragments; each of which consists of only the model elements needed to analyze specifiedproperties. We use the slicing approach to support a technique for analyzing sequences ofoperation invocations to uncover invariant violations. The slicing technique is used toproduce model fragments that can be analyzed separately.

k-Anonymization in the Presence of Publisher Preferences,Rinku Dewri; Indrajit Ray; Indrakshi Ray; Darrell Whitley,Privacy constraints are typically enforced on shared data that contain sensitive personalattributes. However; owing to its adverse effect on the utility of the data; information loss mustbe minimized while sanitizing the data. Existing methods for this purpose modify the dataonly to the extent necessary to satisfy the privacy constraints; thereby asserting that theinformation loss has been minimized. However; given the subjective nature of informationloss; it is often difficult to justify such an assertion. In this paper; we propose an interactiveprocedure to generate a data generalization scheme that optimally meets the preferences ofthe data publisher. A data publisher guides the sanitization process by specifyingaspirations in terms of desired achievement levels in the objectives. A reference directionbased methodology is used to investigate neighborhood solutions if the generated …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,8
Using graph theory to represent a spatio-temporal role-based access control model,Manachai Toahchoodee; Indrakshi Ray; Ross M McConnell,Pervasive computing applications have unique characteristics that preclude the use oftraditional access control models; such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC); for theirprotection. Such models do not take into account contextual information before makingaccess decisions and cannot handle the dynamism inherent in pervasive computingapplications. Towards this end; we propose new spatio-temporal access control models foruse in such applications and formally define their semantics using graph-theoretic notation.The dynamism inherent in pervasive computing applications may cause the access controlconfiguration to change while the policies are deployed. Towards this end; we show how toperform incremental analysis to give assurance that security breaches do not occur as aresult of changing the access control configuration. Our analysis makes clever use of data …,International Journal of Next-Generation Computing,2010,8
A multi-objective approach to data sharing with privacy constraints and preference based objectives,Rinku Dewri; Darrell Whitley; Indrajit Ray; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract Public data sharing is utilized in a number of businesses to facilitate the exchangeof information. Privacy constraints are usually enforced to prevent unwanted inference ofinformation; specially when the shared data contain sensitive personal attributes. This;however; has an adverse effect on the utility of the data for statistical studies. Thus; arequirement while modifying the data is to minimize the information loss. Existing methodsemploy the notion of" minimal distortion" where the data is modified only to the extentnecessary to satisfy the privacy constraint; thereby asserting that the information loss hasbeen minimized. However; given the subjective nature of information loss; it is often difficultto justify this assertion. In this paper; we propose an evolutionary algorithm to explicitlyminimize an achievement function given constraints on the privacy level of the …,Proceedings of the 11th Annual conference on Genetic and evolutionary computation,2009,8
Towards a scalable model for location privacy,Nayot Poolsappasit; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract With the growth of wireless and mobile technologies; we are witnessing an increasein location-based services (LBS). Although LBS provide enhanced functionalities; they openup new vulnerabilities that can be exploited to cause security and privacy breaches.Specifically; location data of individuals that are used by such services must be protectedfrom security and privacy breaches. Such services will require new models for expressingprivacy preferences for location data and mechanisms for enforcing them. We identify thefactors on which location privacy depends and propose a scalable model for expressingprivacy that can be used for LBS and other applications where the privacy of locationinformation must be protected.,Proceedings of the SIGSPATIAL ACM GIS 2008 International Workshop on Security and Privacy in GIS and LBS,2008,8

Real-time update of access control policies,Indrakshi Ray,Abstract Access control policies are security policies that govern access to resources. Theneed for real-time update of such policies while they are in effect and enforcing the changesimmediately; arise in many scenarios. Consider; for example; a military environmentresponding to an international crisis; such as a war. In such situations; countries changestrategies necessitating a change of policies. Moreover; the changes to policies must takeplace in real-time while the policies are in effect. In this paper we address the problem ofreal-time update of access control policies in the context of a database system. Accesscontrol policies; governing access to the data objects; are specified in the form of policyobjects. The data objects and policy objects are accessed and modified throughtransactions. We consider an environment in which different kinds of transactions execute …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2004,8
Building high assurance human-centric decision systems,Constance L Heitmeyer; Marc Pickett; Elizabeth I Leonard; Myla M Archer; Indrakshi Ray; David W Aha; J Gregory Trafton,Abstract Many future decision support systems will be human-centric; ie; require substantialhuman oversight and control. Because these systems often provide critical services; highassurance is needed that they satisfy their requirements. This paper; the product of aninterdisciplinary research team of experts in formal methods; adaptive agents; and cognitivescience; addresses this problem by proposing a new process for developing high assurancehuman-centric decision systems. This process uses AI (artificial intelligence) methods—ie; acognitive model to predict human behavior and an adaptive agent to assist the human—toimprove system performance; and software engineering methods—ie; formal modeling andanalysis—to obtain high assurance that the system behaves as intended.

A responsive defense mechanism against DDoS attacks,Negar Mosharraf; Anura P Jayasumana; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract Distributed Denials of Service (DDoS) attacks are among the most serious threatson the Internet. With large-scale DDoS attacks; it is necessary to stop malicious traffic closerto the attack sources with minimal disruption of legitimate traffic. A responsive defensemechanism that filters potential attack traffic and prevents it from reaching the victim networkis developed. First we investigate the features of network traffic that can be used fordiscriminating attacks from normal traffic; and then use the identified features to develop anaccurate and robust signature-based filtering model that forms the basis of a responsivedefense mechanism. A Bloom filter based mechanism is proposed to efficiently implementand disseminate the signature-based model; it helps reduce the communication overheadand the computation and storage requirements at the upstream routers that check for …,International Symposium on Foundations and Practice of Security,2014,7
Personal health record storage on privacy preserving green clouds,Kirill Belyaev; Indrakshi Ray; Indrajit Ray; Gary Luckasen,With digitization there is a plethora of personal information; such as; health records andpersonal artifacts; that are stored on the data servers provided by the Internet companies.Such a solution is resource-intensive as the servers should be up and running. Moreover;the users no longer have complete control over their own data. We propose an alternativearchitecture where the data is no longer stored on Internet servers; but on set of newhardware devices called Secure Portable Tokens (SPTs) that are under the control ofindividual users. SPTs are cheap; portable; and secure devices that combine the computingpower and tamper-resistant properties of the smart cards and the storage capacity of NANDflash memory chips. SPTs can be used to store personal data and can act as a PersonalData Server (PDS). In order to make such stored data reliable and available; we propose …,Collaborative Computing: Networking; Applications and Worksharing (Collaboratecom); 2013 9th International Conference Conference on,2013,7
Auditing requirements for implementing the chinese wall model in the service cloud,Sarra M Alqahtani; Rose Gamble; Indrakshi Ray,The service cloud model allows for the composition of services into an application that canrespond to tenant requests. The composition of services; which may originate with differentvendors; results in a service chain that supports end-to-end round trip messaging. Thus; theservice cloud model must support provisioning services for the request without incurring aconflict of interest (COI) in their message exchange among vendors. Service vendors mustdisclose their COI classes for storage and analysis by the cloud because as services areprovisioned to an application; additional conflict classes may be added; preventing theservice from future compositions to avoid COI. In this paper; we present a strategy tocentrally store and monitor COI classes for services in a service chain using principles of theChinese Wall Model.

Balancing security and performance properties during system architectural design,Siv Hilde Houmb; Geri Georg; Dorina C Petriu; Behzad Bordbar; Indrakshi Ray; Kyriakos Anastasakis; Robert B France,ABSTRACT Developers of critical systems need to address several quality properties; suchas security and performance; in the early stages of the development cycle to ensure that thesystem under construction meets its requirements. Sometimes quality properties conflict witheach other and/or with the system's functionalities; so the developers need to make trade-offdecisions.

On the comparison of microdata disclosure control algorithms,Rinku Dewri; Indrajit Ray; Indrakshi Ray; Darrell Whitley,Abstract Privacy models such as k-anonymity and l-diversity typically offer an aggregate orscalar notion of the privacy property that holds collectively on the entire anonymized dataset. However; they fail to give an accurate measure of privacy with respect to the individualtuples. For example; two anonymizations achieving the same value of k in the k-anonymitymodel will be considered equally good with respect to privacy protection. However; it is quitepossible that for one of the anonymizations a majority of the individual tuples have lesserprobabilities of privacy breaches than their counterparts in the other anonymization. Wetherefore reject the notion that all anonymizations satisfying a particular privacy property;such as k-anonymity; are equally good. The scalar or aggregate value used in privacymodels is often biased towards a fraction of the data set; resulting in higher privacy for …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,7
Towards Access Control for Isolated Applications.,Kirill Belyaev; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract: With the advancements in contemporary multi-core CPU architectures; it is nowpossible for a server operating system (OS); such as Linux; to handle a large number ofconcurrent application services on a single server instance. Individual applicationcomponents of such services may run in different isolated runtime environments; such aschrooted jails or application containers; and may need access to system resources and theability to collaborate and coordinate with each other in a regulated and secure manner. Wepropose an access control framework for policy formulation; management; and enforcementthat allows access to OS resources and also permits controlled collaboration andcoordination for service components running in disjoint containerized environments under asingle Linux OS server instance.

Query plan execution in a heterogeneous stream management system for situational awareness,Indrakshi Ray; Sanjay K Madria; Mark Linderman,Battlefield monitoring involves collecting streaming data from different sources; transmittingthe data over a heterogeneous network; and processing queries in real-time in order torespond to events in a timely manner. Nodes in these networks differ with respect to theirprocessing; storage and communication capabilities. Links in the network differ with respectto their communication bandwidth. The topology of the network itself is subject to change; asthe nodes and links may become unavailable. Continuous queries executed in suchenvironments must also meet some quality of service (QoS) requirements; such as;response time; throughput; and memory usage. We propose that the processing of thequeries be shared to improve resource utilization; such as storage and bandwidth; which; inturn; will impact the QoS. We show how multiple queries can be represented in the form of …,Reliable Distributed Systems (SRDS); 2012 IEEE 31st Symposium on,2012,6
POkA: identifying pareto-optimal k-anonymous nodes in a domain hierarchy lattice,Rinku Dewri; Indrajit Ray; Indrakshi Ray; Darrell Whitley,Abstract Data generalization is widely used to protect identities and prevent inference ofsensitive information during the public release of microdata. The k-anonymity model hasbeen extensively applied in this context. The model seeks a generalization scheme suchthat every individual becomes indistinguishable from at least k-1 other individuals and theloss in information while doing so is kept at a minimum. The search is performed on adomain hierarchy lattice where every node is a vector signifying the level of generalizationfor each attribute. An effort to understand privacy and data utility trade-offs will requireknowing the minimum possible information losses of every possible value of k. However; thiscan easily lead to an exhaustive evaluation of all nodes in the hierarchy lattice. In this paper;we propose using the concept of Pareto-optimality to obtain the desired trade-off …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,6

Reliable scheduling of advanced transactions,Tai Xin; Yajie Zhu; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract The traditional transaction processing model is not suitable for many advancedapplications; such as those having long duration or those consisting of co-operatingactivities. Researchers have addressed this problem by proposing various new transactionmodels capable of processing advanced transactions. Advanced transactions arecharacterized by having a number of component subtransactions whose execution iscontrolled by dependencies. The dependencies pose new challenges which must beaddressed to ensure secure and reliable execution of advanced transactions. Violation ofdependencies in advanced transactions could lead to unavailability of resources andinformation integrity problems. Although advanced transactions have received a lot ofattention; not much work appears in addressing these issues.

Creating security mechanism aspect models from abstract security aspect models,Geri Georg; Robert France; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract. Aspect-oriented modeling (AOM) techniques allow system architects to design themost important decompositions of complex systems to create a primary systemmodularization. These techniques can also be used to design additional system concernsthat are not part of the primary system modularization. Aspect-oriented modeling techniquescan be used to compose different aspect models with the primary decomposition models inorder to analyze the complete system design. The results of analyses can be used tocompare potential design realizations of multiple competing concerns. Aspect models;composition; and analysis techniques must be available at different levels of abstraction toenable comprehensive trade-off analysis among competing concern realizations. Differentlevels of abstraction are particularly important when multiple mechanisms are available to …,In Proceedings of the Workshop on Critical Systems Development at UML 2003,2003,6
Practical DoS attacks on embedded networks in commercial vehicles,Subhojeet Mukherjee; Hossein Shirazi; Indrakshi Ray; Jeremy Daily; Rose Gamble,Abstract The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol has become the primary choice for in-vehicle communications for passenger cars and commercial vehicles. However; it ispossible for malicious adversaries to cause major damage by exploiting flaws in the CANprotocol design or implementation. Researchers have shown that an attacker can remotelyinject malicious messages into the CAN network in order to disrupt or alter normal vehiclebehavior. Some of these attacks can lead to catastrophic consequences for both the vehicleand the driver. Although there are several defense techniques against CAN based attacks;attack surfaces like physically and remotely controllable Electronic Control Units (ECUs) canbe used to launch attacks on protocols running on top of the CAN network; such as the SAEJ1939 protocol.

Specification and enforcement of location-aware attribute-based access control for online social networks,Andy Chunliang Hsu; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract Online social networks (OSNs) are gaining in popularity and are used by a largenumber of users with varied educational and socio-economic backgrounds. OSNs contain aplethora of personal information which; if misused; may cause enormous damage toindividuals. A well-designed and userfriendly authentication and access control mechanismare the initial steps towards protecting personal information stored on OSNs. Researchershave proposed access control models for OSNs; some of which are classified as relationshipbased and others are in the category of attribute based access control models. In this paper;we demonstrate the use of an attribute-based access control model which has an attributecalled location to provide additional security for OSNs.

The UML has been used to describe access control models and thereare a number of proposed approaches for analyzing UML access control models. Practicalsupport for checking UML access control models against temporal properties is still lacking.In this paper; we describe a lightweight approach to analyzing a UML model of securitypolicies against linear temporal properties. The access control policies are based on ageneralized spatio-temporal role-based access control (GSTRBAC) model.

A model for trust-based access control and delegation in mobile clouds,Indrajit Ray; Dieudonne Mulamba; Indrakshi Ray; Keesook J Han,Abstract Multi-tenancy; elasticity and dynamicity pose several novel challenges for accesscontrol in mobile smartphone clouds such as the Android \textsuperscript\texttrademarkcloud. Accessing subjects may dynamically change; resources requiring protection may becreated or modified; and a subject's access requirements to resources may change duringthe course of the application execution. Cloud tenants may need to acquire permissionsfrom different administrative domains based on the services they require. Moreover; all theentities participating in a cloud may not be trusted to the same degree. Traditional accesscontrol models are not adequate for mobile clouds. In this work; we propose a new accesscontrol framework for mobile smartphone clouds. We formalize a trust-based access controlmodel with delegation for providing fine-grained access control.

A formal temporal log data model for the global synchronized virtual machine environment,Sean Thorpe; Indrajit Ray; Indrakshi Ray; Tyrone Grandison,Abstract: The use of timestamps is fundamental to the management of time varyinginformation and arguably it may be even more important for the synchronization of the virtualmachine (VM) log data sets. In the context of managing (VM) logs for transactional databaseactivity; the consistency of its state can be evaluated by these timestamps. Temporal datamodels claim to be point based whereas other temporal models are interval based. Hencethe premise for synchronization as a component of a time event has become critical to adistributed hybrid compute cloud. The contributions of this paper apply the use of formaltemporal mechanisms to appreciate the behaviour of our case study deployment. In ourstudy we design a software application called a global virtual machine log auditor. We usethe auditor to synchronize virtual server log events across a suite of non native VM …,Int. J. Inform.

Using trust-based information aggregation for predicting security level of systems,Siv Hilde Houmb; Sudip Chakraborty; Indrakshi Ray; Indrajit Ray,Abstract Sometimes developers must design innovative security solutions that have a rapiddevelopment cycle; short life-time; short time-to-market; and small budget. Securityevaluation standards; such as Common Criteria and ISO/IEC 17799; cannot be used due toresource limitations; time-to-market; and other constraints. We propose an alternative timeand cost effective approach for predicting the security level of a security solution usinginformation sources who are trusted to varying degrees. We show how to assess thetrustworthiness of each information source and demonstrate how to aggregate theinformation obtained from them. We illustrate our approach by showing the security levelprediction for two Denial of Service (DoS) solutions.,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2010,5
Optimizing real-time ordered-data broadcasts in pervasive environments using evolution strategy,Rinku Dewri; Darrell Whitley; Indrajit Ray; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract We consider the problem of real-time data broadcast scheduling in pervasivesystems with soft deadlines and constraints on the order in which data items should bebroadcast to be useful. The broadcast schedule needs to be generated to provide a certainlevel of quality of service. Thus; the real-time scheduler has to effectively trade-off betweenits running time and the quality of schedules generated. We use an evolution strategy tosolve the problem. The variants tested includes (1+ λ)-ES;(1; λ)-ES; and a (2+ 1)-ES with amodified Syswerda recombination operator; as well as a genetic algorithm.,International Conference on Parallel Problem Solving from Nature,2008,5
Anonymity preserving techniques in trust negotiations,Indrakshi Ray; Elisa Bertino; Anna C Squicciarini; Elena Ferrari,Abstract Trust negotiation between two subjects require each one proving its properties tothe other. Each subject specifies disclosure policies stating the types of credentials andattributes the counterpart has to provide to obtain a given resource. The counterpart; inresponse; provides a disclosure set containing the necessary credentials and attributes. Ifthe counterpart wants to remain anonymous; its disclosure sets should not contain identityrevealing information. In this paper; we propose anonymization techniques using which asubject can transform its disclosure set into an anonymous one. Anonymization transforms adisclosure set into an alternative anonymous one whose information content is different fromthe original one. This alternative disclosure set may no longer satisfy the original disclosurepolicy causing the trust negotiation to fail. To address this problem; we propose that trust …,International Workshop on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,2005,5
Implementing real-time update of access control policies,Indrakshi Ray; Tai Xin,Abstract Real-time update of access control policies; that is; updating policies while they arein effect and enforcing the changes immediately; is necessary for many security-criticalapplications. In this paper; we consider real-time update of access control policies that arisein a database system. Updating policy while they are in-effect can lead to potential securityproblems. In an earlier work; we presented an algorithm that not only prevents such securityproblems but also ensures correct execution of transactions.

Component-oriented access control for deployment of application services in containerized environments,Kirill Belyaev; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract With the advancements in multi-core CPU architectures; it is now possible for aserver operating system (OS) such as Linux to handle a large number of concurrentapplication services on a single server instance. Individual service components of suchservices may run in different isolated environments; such as chrooted jails or applicationcontainers; and may need controlled access to system resources and the ability tocollaborate and coordinate with each other in a regulated and secure manner. In an earlierwork; we motivated the need for an access control framework that is based on the principleof least privilege for formulation; management; and enforcement of policies that allowscontrolled access to system resources and also permits controlled collaboration andcoordination for service components deployed in disjoint containerized environments …,International Conference on Cryptology and Network Security,2016,4
SybilRadar: A Graph-Structure Based Framework for Sybil Detection in On-line Social Networks,Dieudonne Mulamba; Indrajit Ray; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract Online Social Networks (OSN) are increasingly becoming victims of Sybil attacks.These attacks involve creation of multiple colluding fake accounts (called Sybils) with thegoal of compromising the trust underpinnings of the OSN; in turn; leading to security and theprivacy violations. Existing mechanisms to detect Sybils are based either on analyzing userattributes and activities; which are often incomplete or inaccurate or raise privacy concerns;or on analyzing the topological structures of the OSN. Two major assumptions that the lattercategory of works make; namely; that the OSN can be partitioned into a Sybil and a non-Sybil region and that the so-called “attack edges” between Sybil nodes and non-Sybil nodesare only a handful; often do not hold in real life scenarios. Consequently; when attackersengineer Sybils to behave like real user accounts; these mechanisms perform poorly. In …,IFIP International Information Security and Privacy Conference,2016,4
Applying attribute based access control for privacy preserving health data disclosure,Indrakshi Ray; Toan C Ong; Indrajit Ray; Michael G Kahn,Patients often willingly share their health data in a controlled manner for the purposes ofresearch. The disclosure of such data in response to requests from researchers mustconform to various policies imposed by the patient; the rights of the data requester; andorganizational and governmental regulations. This work investigates the applicability ofAttribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) model for specifying and enforcing these varioustypes of policies. Specifically; it demonstrates how the XACML framework can be used forspecifying and enforcing these policies.,Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI); 2016 IEEE-EMBS International Conference on,2016,4
Using slicing to improve the performance of model invariant checking,Wuliang Sun; Benoit Combemale; Robert B France; Arnaud Blouin; Benoit Baudry; Indrakshi Ray,In Model Driven Development (MDD); it is important to ensure that a model conforms to theinvariants defined in the metamodel. Such invariant checking can improve developers'understanding of modeled aspects of complex systems and uncover structural errors indesign models. General-purpose rigorous analysis tools that check invariants are likely toperform the analysis over the entire metamodel and model. Since modern day software isexceedingly complex; the size of the model together with the metamodel can be very large.Consequently; invariant checking can take a very long time. For example; checking a modelconsisting of 5;000 elements can take up to several hours if the analysis completes.Moreover; sometimes the analysis process cannot be completed as the system resourcesget exhausted. To this end; we introduce model slicing within the invariant checking …,The Journal of Object Technology,2015,4
When does a workflow complete?,Parvathi Chundi; Tai Xin; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract Workflow Management Systems (WFMS) coordinate execution of logically relatedmultiple tasks in an organization. Each workflow that is executed on such a system is aninstance of some workflow schema. A workflow schema is defined using a set of tasks thatare coordinated using dependencies. Workflows generated from the same schema maydiffer with respect to the tasks executed. An important issue that must be addressed whiledesigning a workflow is to decide what tasks are needed for the workflow to complete—werefer to this set of tasks as the completion set. Since different tasks are executed in differentworkflow instances; a workflow schema may be associated with multiple completion sets.Incorrect specification of completion sets may prohibit some workflow from completing. This;in turn; will cause the workflow to hold on to the resources and raise availability problems …,Computer Standards & Interfaces,2011,4
Exploring privacy versus data quality trade-offs in anonymization techniques using multi-objective optimization,Rinku Dewri; Indrajit Ray; Indrakshi Ray; Darrell Whitley,Abstract Data anonymization techniques have received extensive attention in the privacyresearch community over the past several years. Various models of privacy preservationhave been proposed: k-anonymity; ℓ-diversity and t-closeness; to name a few. An oft-citeddrawback of these models is that there is considerable loss in data quality arising from theuse of generalization and suppression techniques. Optimization attempts in this contexthave so far focused on maximizing the data utility for a pre-specified level of privacy. Todetermine if better privacy levels are obtainable with the same level of data utility; majority ofthe existing formulations require exhaustive analysis. Further; the data publisher'sperspective is often missed in the process. The publisher wishes to maintain a given level ofdata utility (since the data utility is the revenue earner) and then maximize the level of …,Journal of Computer Security,2011,4
Extensions to the Role Based Access Control Model for Newer Computing Paradigms,Ramadan Abdunabi; Indrajit Ray,Abstract Authorization and access control are two of the most important techniques to ensurethe security of systems. There has been a lot of work done by security researchers indeveloping flexible and semantically rich authorization/access control models. Currently; theRole Based Access Control Model is the de facto standard. However; notwithstanding itspopularity; RBAC has been found lacking in many computing applications. Consequently;resarchers have proposed numerous extensions to the classical RBAC model.Unfortunately; we find in this work that there are quite a few newer types of applications thatimpose five authorization requirements at the same time; that are not satisfied by any of theproposed extensions of RBAC. We outline a new authorization model to fill this gap andconclude that there is still need of continued research in this area.,*,2010,4
Evolution strategy based optimization of on-demand dependent data broadcast scheduling,Rinku Dewri; Darrell Whitley; Indrakshi Ray; Indrajit Ray,Abstract Data broadcasting makes effective use of low bandwidth and is commonly used inapplications involving mobile devices. We consider the case where data must be broadcastin a particular order and within a specified response time. However; communicationbottlenecks prohibit the timely serving of all requests; although; missing the deadline doesnot make the data utility zero. In this work; we consider the problem of real-time databroadcast scheduling in the presence of soft deadlines together with constraints on the orderin which data-items should be broadcast to be useful. We explore the method of evolutionstrategy to solve the problem; keeping in view that the real-time scheduler has to effectivelytrade-off between its running time and the quality of schedules generated.,Proceedings of the 10th annual conference on Genetic and evolutionary computation,2008,4
Checking Policy Enforcement in an Access Control Aspect Model,Eunjee Song; Robert France; Indrakshi Ray; Hanil Kim,ABSTRACT From a software design perspective; access control policies are requirementsthat must be addressed in a design. For example; access control policies are constraints thatdetermine the type of access authorized users have on information resources. In this paper;we show how one can formulate access control policies as a policy model; formulate anaccess control aspect model that enforces policies as an aspect; and verify whether theaspect model enforces the given policies or not. As an access control policy example; weuse Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).,Proceedings of the International Conference on Convergence Technology and Information Convergence (CTIC)'07,2007,4
Trust negotiations with customizable anonymity,Anna Cinzia Squicciarini; Abhilasha Barghav-Spantzel; Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract Trust negotiation makes it possible for two parties to carry on secure transactions byfirst establishing trust through a bilateral; iterative process of requesting and disclosingdigital credentials and policies. Credentials; exchanged during trust negotiations; oftencontain sensitive attributes that attest to the properties of the credential owner. Uncontrolleddisclosure of such sensitive attributes may cause grave damage to the credential owner.Research has shown that disclosing non-sensitive attributes only can cause identity to berevealed as well. Consequently; we impose a stronger requirement: our negotiations shouldhave the k-anonymity property--the set of credentials submitted by a subject during anegotiation should be equal to k other such sets received by the counterpart during earliernegotiations. In this paper we propose a protocol that ensures k-anonymity. Our protocol …,Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE/WIC/ACM international conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology,2006,4

Using schemas to simplify access control for XML documents,Indrakshi Ray; Marianna Muller,Abstract Organizations are increasingly using the the eXtensible Markup Language (XML)for document representation and exchange on the Web. To protect an XML document fromunauthorized access; authorizations are specified on the XML document itself or on theDocument Type Definition (DTD) that defines the type of the XML document. Each XMLdocument or DTD is associated with an XML Access Sheet (XAS) that specifies theauthorizations. The DTD not being an XML document complicates the specification andenforcement of authorization policies. To overcome the above mentioned problem; XMLSchemas need to be used instead of DTDs. In this paper; we show how XAS DTDs can bespecified using XML Schemas and propose an access control architecture that can processXAS authorizations.

Using the b-toolkit to ensure safety in scr specifications,Indrakshi Ray; Paul Ammann,SCR (Software Cost Reduction) specifications are useful for specifying event-drivensystems. To use SCR effectively for critical applications; automated verification of safetyproperties is important. The fact that model checking approaches are sometimes problematicmotivates us to further examine the alternative approach of theorem proving. Theoremproving; in general; is a difficult task; however the regular structure of the proof obligationsgenerated from SCR specifications suggests that relatively unsophisticated theorem proverscan discharge many of these obligations. As a feasibility study; we use the B-Toolkit to detectsafety violations in an example SCR specification. The B-Toolkit is a good choice because itis commercially available and Supports verified refinement to executables in a commercialprogramming language (C).

Modeling of online social network policies using an attribute-based access control framework,Phillipa Bennett; Indrakshi Ray; Robert France,Abstract People often share sensitive personal information through online social networks(OSNs) to keep in touch with their friends and families. Such sensitive information if leakedinadvertently to malicious third parties may have disastrous consequences on the lives ofindividuals. Access control policies need to be specified; analyzed; enforced; and managedin a simple manner for the regular OSN users. We demonstrate how this can be done. Wefirst propose a simple model that captures the typical OSN features and show how torepresent it using an Entity-Relationship Diagram. The numerous features of an OSNinteract with each other in subtle ways–this makes it easy for the naïve user to makemisconfiguration errors. Towards this end; we illustrate how our OSN model can beformalized in Alloy and its constraints adequately captured.

ELITE: zero links identity management system,Tarik Moataz; Nora Cuppens-Boulahia; Frédéric Cuppens; Indrajit Ray; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract Modern day biometric systems; such as those used by governments to issuebiometric-based identity cards; maintain a deterministic link between the identity of the userand her biometric information. However; such a link brings in serious privacy concerns forthe individual. Sensitive information about the individual can be retrieved from the databaseby using her biometric information. Individuals; for reasons of privacy therefore; may notwant such a link to be maintained. Deleting the link; on the other hand; is not feasiblebecause the information is used for purposes of identification or issuing of identity cards. Inthis work; we address this dilemma by hiding the biometrics information; and keeping theassociation between biometric information and identity probabilistic. We extend traditionalBloom filters to store the actual information and propose the SOBER data structure for this …,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2014,3

Supporting iterative development of robust operation contracts in UML requirements models,Wuliang Sun; Robert B France; Indrakshi Ray,Developing adequate system operation contracts at the requirements level can bechallenging. A specifier needs to ensure that a contract allows an operation to be invoked indifferent usage contexts without putting the system in an invalid state. Specifiers needusable rigorous analysis techniques that can help them develop more robust contracts; thatis; contracts that are neither too restrictive nor too permissive. In this paper we describe aniterative approach to developing robust operation contracts. The approach supports rigorousrobustness analysis of operation contracts against a set of scenarios that provide usagecontexts for the operation. We illustrate the approach by developing a robust operationcontract for a functional feature in a Location-aware Role-Based Access Control (LRBAC)model.,High-Assurance Systems Engineering (HASE); 2011 IEEE 13th International Symposium on,2011,3

Real time stochastic scheduling in broadcast systems with decentralized data storage,Rinku Dewri; Indrakshi Ray; Indrajit Ray; Darrell Whitley,Abstract Data broadcasting is an efficient method to disseminate information to a large groupof requesters with common interests. Performing such broadcasts typically involve thedetermination of a broadcast schedule intended to maximize the quality of service providedby the broadcast system. Earlier studies have proposed solutions to this problem in the formof heuristics and local search techniques designed to achieve minimal deadline misses ormaximal utility. An often ignored factor in these studies is the possibility of the data itemsbeing not available locally; but rather have to be fetched from data servers distributed over anetwork; thereby inducing a certain level of stochasticity in the actual time required to servea data item. This stochasticity is introduced on behalf of the data servers which themselvesundergo a dynamic management of serving data requests. In this paper we revisit the …,Real-Time Systems,2010,3
On the identification of property based generalizations in microdata anonymization,Rinku Dewri; Indrajit Ray; Indrakshi Ray; Darrell Whitley,Abstract Majority of the search algorithms in microdata anonymization restrict themselves toa single privacy property and a single criteria to optimize. The solutions obtained aretherefore of limited application since adherence to multiple privacy models is required toimpede different forms of privacy attacks. Towards this end; we propose the concept of aproperty based generalization (PBG) to capture the non-dominance relationships thatappear when multiple objectives are to be met in an anonymization process. We propose anevolutionary algorithm that can identify a representative subset of the set of PBGs for thepurpose of decision making.,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2010,3
Increasing Expressiveness of Composite Events Using Parameter Contexts,Indrakshi Ray; Wei Huang,Abstract The event-condition-action paradigm (also known as triggers or ECA rules) gives adatabase “active” capabilities–the ability to react automatically to changes in the database orthe environment. Events can be primitive or composite. Primitive events cannot bedecomposed. Different types of primitive events can be composed using event compositionoperators to form composite events. When a composite event occurs; it is possible that manyinstances of some constituent primitive event occurs. The context determines which of theseprimitive events should be considered for evaluating the composite event. Researchershave identified four different contexts; namely; recent; chronicle; continuous; and cumulativethat can be associated with a composite event. Associating a single context with a complexcomposite event is often times not adequate. Many real-world scenarios cannot be …,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2008,3
On the completion of workflows,Tai Xin; Indrakshi Ray; Parvathi Chundi; Sopak Chaichana,Abstract Workflow Management Systems (WFMS) coordinate execution of logically relatedmultiple tasks in an organization.

An important issue that must be addressed whiledesigning a workflow is to decide what tasks are needed for the workflow to complete–werefer to this set as the completion set. Since different tasks are executed in different workflowinstances; a workflow schema may be associated with multiple completion sets.

Event detection in multilevel secure active databases,Indrakshi Ray; Wei Huang,Abstract The event-condition-action paradigm (also known as triggers or rules) is a powerfultechnology. It gives a database “active” capabilities–the ability to react automatically tochanges in the database or in the environment. One potential use of this technology is in thearea of multilevel secure (MLS) data processing; such as; military; where the subjects andobjects are classified into different security levels and mandatory access control rulesgovern who has access to what. Although a lot of research appears in MLS databases; notmuch work has been done in the area of MLS active databases. In this paper; we look at onevery important aspect of an MLS active database–event detection. An MLS rule; like anyother object in an MLS database; is associated with a security level. Events in an MLSdatabase are also associated with security levels. Since an MLS rule can be triggered by …,International Conference on Information Systems Security,2005,3
Editors’ message for the special issue on security,Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Indrakshi Ray,Recent technological advancements have resulted in phenomenal growth in digital libraries.Often; professionals in the government; military; and commercial sectors make criticaldecisions based on data obtained from digital libraries.

Towards a privacy preserving e-commerce protocol,Indrajit Ray; Mike Geisterfer,Abstract Every time a user performs a transaction over the Internet; a wealth of personalinformation is revealed; either voluntarily or involuntarily. This causes serious breach ofprivacy for the user; in particular; if the personally identifying information is misused by thedifferent players involved in the transaction. Ideally; therefore; the user would like to have aconsiderable degree of control over what personal information to reveal and to whom. In thispaper we propose a new e-commerce protocol that helps the user protect her privacy whilepurchasing products over the Internet. The proposed scheme provides a flexible andpowerful approach for the secure handling of private data and offers the user considerablecontrol over how she wishes to disseminate her personal data.,International Conference on Electronic Commerce and Web Technologies,2004,3
Semantic-Based Decomposition of Transactions,Paul Ammann; Sushil Jajodia; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract Sometimes transactions must be decomposed into steps. The need fordecomposition arises in a variety of different domains. For example; long durationtransactions may be decomposed to improve performance; global transactions inmultidatabases may be decomposed to preserve local database autonomy; and multilevelsecure transactions may be decomposed to avoid leaking sensitive information. To achievethese various objectives; a decomposition sacrifices those desirable properties; namelyatomicity; consistency; and isolation; that form the foundation of syntactically basedcorrectness approaches such as conflict serializability. We remedy this loss by defining asemantic view of correctness organized around a new set of desirable properties that arespecifically designed for reasoning about decompositions.

Confidence-weighted bipartite ranking,Majdi Khalid; Indrakshi Ray; Hamidreza Chitsaz,Abstract Bipartite ranking is a fundamental machine learning and data mining problem. Itcommonly concerns the maximization of the AUC metric. Recently; a number of studies haveproposed online bipartite ranking algorithms to learn from massive streams of class-imbalanced data. These methods suggest both linear and kernel-based bipartite rankingalgorithms based on first and second-order online learning. Unlike kernelized ranker; linearranker is more scalable learning algorithm. The existing linear online bipartite rankingalgorithms lack either handling non-separable data or constructing adaptive large margin.These limitations yield unreliable bipartite ranking performance.

Software modelers refactor their design models to improve design quality whilepreserving essential functional properties. Tools that allow modelers to check whether theirrefactorings preserve specified essential behaviors are needed to support rigorous modelevolution. In this paper we describe a rigorous approach to analyzing design modelrefactorings that involve changes to operation specifications expressed in the ObjectConstraint Language (OCL). The analysis checks whether the refactored model preservesthe essential behavior of changed operations in a source design model.

A context-aware model of trust facilitating secure ad hoc collaborations,Indrajit Ray; Indrakshi Ray; Sudip Chakraborty,Adhoc collaborations often necessitate impromptu sharing of sensitive information orresources between member organizations. Each member of resulting collaboration needs tocarefully assess and tradeoff the requirements of protecting its own sensitive informationagainst the requirements of sharing some or all of them. The challenge is that no policieshave been previously arrived at for such secure sharing (since the collaboration has beenformed in an ad hoc manner). Thus; it needs to be done based on an evaluation of thetrustworthiness of the recipient of the information or resources. In this chapter; the authorsdiscuss some previously proposed trust models to determine if they can be effectively usedto compute trustworthiness for such sharing purposes in ad hoc collaborations.Unfortunately; none of these models appear to be completely satisfactory.

Such applications oftenrequire sending Bloom filters using messages. Consequently; it is important to minimize thesize of the filters such that the storage; transmission; and processing costs are minimized. Inthis paper; we introduce a novel data structure; which we refer to as the Compacted BloomFilter (CmBF) that improves performance; uses less storage; and provides the samefunctionality as a standard Bloom filter. CmBF is suitable for many networking applicationsincluding IP traceback; peer-to-peer networks; and DDoS attack filtering approaches thatrequire the transfer of large amount of information; such as IP addresses; among nodes.Moreover; CmBF works well for endpoints with limited memory. However; unlike the …,Collaboration and Internet Computing (CIC); 2016 IEEE 2nd International Conference on,2016,1
Privacy Preserving Probabilistic Record Linkage Using Locality Sensitive Hashes,Ibrahim Lazrig; Toan Ong; Indrajit Ray; Indrakshi Ray; Michael Kahn,Abstract As part of increased efforts to provide precision medicine to patients; large clinicalresearch networks (CRNs) are building regional and national collections of electronic healthrecords (EHRs) and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). To protect patient privacy; each datacontributor to the CRN (for example; a health-care provider) uses anonymizing andencryption technology before publishing the data. An important problem in such CRNsinvolves linking records of the same patient across multiple source databases.Unfortunately; in practice; the records to be matched often contain typographic errors andinconsistencies arising out of formatting and pronunciation incompatibilities; as well asincomplete information. When encryption is applied on these records; similarity search forrecord linkage is rendered impossible.

Analyzing Regulatory Conformance in Medical Research Systems Using Multi-Paradigm Modeling.,Phillipa Bennett; Wuliang Sun; Wade Ted; Geri Georg; Indrakshi Ray; Michael G Kahn,Abstract. Many of today's partially or fully automated medical research systems are rule; orconstraint-driven systems that must be analyzed with respect to their rule compliance. Wepropose a new method called Multi Modeling Constraint-Driven System Analysis to exploreand analyze rule conformance in these systems. Specifically; our method takes advantage ofexisting system documentation in the form of operational flow charts; and refines andtransforms the information in them to into more formal system representations that allowautomated analysis and reasoning; including reasoning about rule conformance. Themethod uses UML; Alloy; and protocol state machine models; and includes trace linkingbetween informal and formal diagram and model elements; to allow analysis reporting onmore informal diagrams and also 'what if'exploration to address atypical settings or …,GEMOC+ MPM@ MoDELS,2015,1
Secure complex event processing in a heterogeneous and dynamic network,Thilina Buddhika; Indrakshi Ray; Mark Linderman; Anura Jayasumana,Battlefield monitoring involves collecting streaming data from different sources; transmittingthe data over a heterogeneous network; and processing queries in real-time in order torespond to events in a timely manner. Nodes in these networks differ with respect to theirtrustworthiness; processing; storage; and communication capabilities. Links in the networkdiffer with respect to their communication bandwidth. The topology of the network itself issubject to change; as the nodes and links may become unavailable. Continuous queriesexecuted in such environments must also meet some quality of service (QoS) requirements;such as; response time and throughput. Data streams generated from the various nodes inthe network belong to different security levels; consequently; these must be processed in asecure manner without causing unauthorized leakage or modification. Towards this end …,Ground/Air Multisensor Interoperability; Integration; and Networking for Persistent ISR V,2014,1
Enforcing the Chinese wall model for tenant conflict of interest in the service cloud,Sarra Alqahtani; Rose F Gamble; Indrakshi Ray,The service cloud provisions the services from different vendors into an application that canrespond to tenant requests. Thus; the service cloud model must support provisioningservices for the request without incurring a Conflict of Interest (COI) in their messageexchange among vendors. Service vendors must disclose their COI classes for storage andanalysis by the cloud because as services are provisioned to an application; additionalconflict classes may be added; preventing the service from future compositions to avoid COI.In this paper; we present a strategy to centrally store and monitor COI classes for servicesusing principles of the Chinese wall model. We introduce a Security Monitoring Database(SMDB) that encompasses the repositories and resources to audit the COI classes as theyare assigned to hosted services. We describe an algorithm to prevent COI before …,International Journal of Business Process Integration and Management 9,2014,1

Distributed multilevel secure data stream processing,Xing Xie; Indrakshi Ray; Waruna Ranasinghe; Philips A Gilbert; Pramod Shashidhara; Anoop Yadav,Data Stream Management Systems (DSMSs) have been proposed to address the dataprocessing needs of situation monitoring applications that collect high-speed data fromvarious sources; compute results on-the-fly; and take actions in realtime. Traditional DSMSsare not suitable for processing military applications which involve data belonging to multiplesecurity levels and there are rules governing information flow. Moreover; a centralizedDSMS may not be suitable for military applications. Towards this end; we propose adistributed multilevel secure DSMS systems. We provide an architecture and animplementation and demonstrate how simple queries can be executed in our system.,Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW); 2013 IEEE 33rd International Conference on,2013,1
Trust-based security level evaluation using Bayesian belief networks,Siv Hilde Houmb; Indrakshi Ray; Indrajit Ray; Sudip Chakraborty,Abstract Security is not merely about technical solutions and patching vulnerabilities.Security is about trade-offs and adhering to realistic security needs; employed to supportcore business processes. Also; modern systems are subject to a highly competitive market;often demanding rapid development cycles; short life-time; short time-to-market; and smallbudgets. Security evaluation standards; such as ISO 14508 Common Criteria and ISO/IEC27002; are not adequate for evaluating the security of many modern systems for resourcelimitations; time-to-market; and other constraints. Towards this end; we propose analternative time and cost effective approach for evaluating the security level of a securitysolution; system or part thereof. Our approach relies on collecting information from differentsources; who are trusted to varying degrees; and on using a trust measure to aggregate …,*,2010,1
Access control challenges for cyber-physical systems,Indrakshi Ray; Indrajit Ray,Abstract With the growth of wireless networks and mobile devices; we are moving closertowards an era of cyberphysical systems (CPSs). Such systems have the potential to benefitnumerous applications in areas as diverse as military; financial; and health care. However;security issues must be addressed before CPSs can be widely deployed. The problem isserious because CPSs involve interactions between a large number of entities that can spandifferent organizational boundaries. Unlike traditional applications; these applications do notusually have well-defined security perimeters and are dynamic in nature. Moreover; theseapplications use knowledge of surrounding physical spaces. This requires security policiesto use contextual information that; in turn; must be adequately protected from securitybreaches.

Periodic scheduling in on-demand broadcast system,Nitin Prabhu; Vijay Kumar; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract: Recent advances in mobile computing have enabled the deployment of broadcastbased information systems such as; wireless internet; traffic information systems; etc. Thesesystems are mainly pull-based and their performance very much depends on the broadcastschedule they use. In this paper we focus on on-demand broadcast system. We propose anew ondemand scheduling algorithm that takes scheduling decision at periodic interval;unlike previous algorithms that take decision after broadcasting every data item. Thisreduces the time client spends monitoring the broadcast channel for data items. We study itsbehavior with a detailed simulation study and show that our algorithm performs better thanthe pervious algorithms for on-demand systems. 1,*,2004,1

Multilevel secure rules and its impact on the design of active database systems,Indrakshi Ray,Abstract The event-condition-action paradigm (also known as triggers or rules) gives adatabase “active” capabilities—the ability to react automatically to changes in the databaseor in the environment. One potential use of this technology is in the area of multilevel secure(MLS) data processing; such as; military; where the subjects and objects are classified intodifferent security levels and mandatory access control rules govern who has access to what.Unfortunately; not much work has been done in the area of multilevel secure activedatabase system. In this paper we define the structure of MLS rules and identify what effectsthese rules have on the execution semantics of an active database system. Such knowledgeis essential before developing a multilevel secure active database system.,British National Conference on Databases,2003,1

Accessing subjects maydynamically change; resources requiring protection may be created or modified; and asubject's access requirements to resources may change during the course of the applicationexecution. Cloud tenants may need to acquire permissions from different administrativedomains based on the services they require.

Multi-Objective Evolutionary Optimization in Statistical Disclosure Control,Rinku Dewri; Indrajit Ray; Indrakshi Ray; Darrell Whitley,Abstract Statistical disclosure control involves the sanitization of personally identifyinginformation in data sets prior to their dissemination. Such a process typically results in a lossin utility of the data. A data publisher is thus confronted with two requirements to fulfill–ensuring the safety of respondents and maintaining statistical utility in the anonymized data.Existing approaches model the first requirement as a constraint in an optimization frameworkdirected towards maximizing data utility. An immediate consequence of this method is therequirement for exhaustive analysis if the much desired trade-off behavior between privacylevels and data utility has to be explored. In this chapter; we explore an alternativeframework based on multi-objective optimization to cater to the data publisher'srequirements.

A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}.

The project has produced the following results. 1. It hasproposed a formal model to assess multiple levels of trust that is more inclusive than thecurrent binary models. A major strength of the model is that it is more in keeping with thesocial models of trust used by policy makers. 2. It has defined a notion of degrees of trustand proposed expressions and procedures to evaluate and establish the degree of trust ofdifferent systems. 3. It has defined procedures to compare information at different degrees oftrust. 4.

Using formal methods in semantic-based decomposition of transactions,Indrakshi Ray,Database systems are one of the most important applications of computer technology. Theyprovide an organized and uniform method for handling large volumes of data involved inapplications such as banking systems and airlines reservation systems. A database consistsof a set of objects; the values of these objects comprise the state of the database. Integrityconstraints or invariants are predicates that specify the relationships among the objects. Adatabase state is said to be consistent if the values of objects satisfy the integrity constraints;otherwise the state is inconsistent. Users perform operations on databases using specialapplication programs known as transactions. The traditional model BHG87] is built on threeproperties; namely; atomicity; consistency; and isolation.

Security policies for outsourced data,Tarik Moataz; Nora Cuppens-Boulahia; Frédéric Cuppens; Indrajit Ray,Achievements based on virtualization infrastructure and services offer new solutions foroutsourcing and pooling of data. Since these data can be sensitive or critical; we areinterested in new approaches to outsourcing and pooling data preserving securityrequirements such as confidentiality; integrity; respect for privacy and authenticity. In fact; Inthis thesis; we focus on issues related to the protection of data and their content which areoutsourced or shared; and particularly on data confidentiality (via access control;encryption); integrity (via a digital signature or watermarking); the authenticity ofcommunicating entities (authentication mechanisms); anonymity of the communicatingentities (communication networks anonymous credentials anonymous) and privacy policy(outsourcing data and preserving the users privacy as the k-anonymity and its extensions) …,*,*,*

Security; trust; and resilience of distributed networks and systems,Jinshu Su; Weisong Shi; Indrakshi Ray; Xiaofeng Wang,Distributed networks and systems are becoming increasingly important for the humansociety. However; the rapid growth of distributed and networking technologies has made ourinformation system more vulnerable to attack threats; malicious behaviors and unpredictablefailures. First; the widely spread network system is an attractive target for various malwaressuch as botnets; distributed denial-of-service attack; and advanced persistent threat attacks.The traditional defense technology cannot cope well with the new large scale andobfuscated malwares. Second; in the open distributed environments; the trust risk for anapplication has been increased considerably with the possible malicious behavior comingfrom uncontrolled participants and unknown service providers.

Using Multi-objective Optimization to Analyze Data Utility and Privacy Tradeoffs in Anonymization Techniques,Rinku Dewri; Indrakshi Ray; Indrajit Ray; Darrell Whitley,Abstract Data anonymization techniques have received extensive attention in the privacyresearch community over the past several years. Various models of privacy preservationhave been proposed: k–anonymity; l–diversity and t–closeness; to name a few. A typicaldrawback of these models is that there is considerable loss in data utility arising from the useof generalization and suppression techniques. Optimization attempts in this context have sofar focused on maximizing the data utility for a pre-specified level of privacy. To determine ifbetter privacy levels are obtainable with the same level of data utility; most of the existingformulations require exhaustive analysis. Further; the data publisher's perspective is oftenmissed in the process. The publisher wishes to maintain a given level of data utility and thenmaximize the level of privacy within acceptable limits. In this paper; we explore multi …,*,*,*

Challenges in Securing Pervasive Computing Applications,Indrakshi Ray,Abstract Pervasive computing technology has the potential to benefit applications in themilitary; financial; and health care domain. Although pervasive computing technology lookspromising; one critical challenge needs to be addressed before it can be widely deployed–security. The problem is serious because pervasive computing applications involveinteractions between a large number of entities that can span different organizationalboundaries. Unlike traditional applications; these applications do not usually have well-defined security perimeters and are dynamic in nature. Moreover; these applications useknowledge of surrounding physical spaces. This requires security policies to use contextualinformation that; in turn; must be adequately protected from security breaches. Uncontrolleddisclosure of information or unconstrained interactions among entities can lead to very …,*,*,*
Periodic Scheduling in On-Demand Broadcast System,Indrakshi Ray; Nitin Prabhu; Vijay Kumar,Abstract: Recent advances in mobile computing have enabled the deployment of broadcastbased information systems such as; wireless internet; traffic information systems; etc. Thesesystems are mainly pull-based and their performance very much depends on the broadcastschedule they use. In this paper we focus on on-demand broadcast system. We propose anew ondemand scheduling algorithm that takes scheduling decision at periodic interval;unlike previous algorithms that take decision after broadcasting every data item. Thisreduces the time client spends monitoring the broadcast channel for data items. We study itsbehavior with a detailed simulation study and show that our algorithm performs better thanthe pervious algorithms for on-demand systems.,*,*,*

Message from TACS 2006 Chairs,Jingde Cheng; Xiaolin Li; Nohpill Park; Indrakshi Ray,As computer systems become increasingly large and complex; their trustworthiness and self-manageability play an important role in supporting the next-generation science;engineering; and commercial applications. For critical applications; users rely on theconfidentiality; correctness; and availability provided by such systems. A complicating factoris that the technology used to develop large and complex systems introduce new kinds ofaccidental and deliberate faults causing such systems to fail. Designing; analyzing; andevolving such complex systems is non-trivial. Autonomic computing appears to be apromising solution to this problem. It will enable systems to manage themselves by providingself-optimization; self-healing; self-configuration; and self-protection. Trusted and autonomiccomputing and communications need synergistic research efforts covering many …,*,*,*
