Current status of the AMOEBA polarizable force field,Jay W Ponder; Chuanjie Wu; Pengyu Ren; Vijay S Pande; John D Chodera; Michael J Schnieders; Imran Haque; David L Mobley; Daniel S Lambrecht; Robert A DiStasio Jr; Martin Head-Gordon; Gary NI Clark; Margaret E Johnson; Teresa Head-Gordon,Molecular force fields have been approaching a generational transition over the past severalyears; moving away from well-established and well-tuned; but intrinsically limited; fixed pointcharge models toward more intricate and expensive polarizable models that should allowmore accurate description of molecular properties. The recently introduced AMOEBA forcefield is a leading publicly available example of this next generation of theoretical model; butto date; it has only received relatively limited validation; which we address here. We showthat the AMOEBA force field is in fact a significant improvement over fixed charge models forsmall molecule structural and thermodynamic observables in particular; although further fine-tuning is necessary to describe solvation free energies of drug-like small molecules;dynamical properties away from ambient conditions; and possible improvements in …,*,2010,676
Tetrahedral structure or chains for liquid water,Teresa Head-Gordon; Margaret E Johnson,Abstract It has been suggested; based on x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experimentson liquid water [Wernet; Ph.; et al.(2004) Science 304; 995–999]; that a condensed-phasewater molecule's asymmetric electron density results in only two hydrogen bonds per watermolecule on average. The larger implication of the XAS interpretation is that theconventional view of liquid water being a tetrahedrally coordinated random network is nowreplaced by a structural organization that instead strongly favors hydrogen-bonded waterchains or large rings embedded in a weakly hydrogen-bonded disordered network. Thiswork reports that the asymmetry of the hydrogen density exhibited in the XAS experimentsagrees with reported x-ray scattering structure factors and intensities for Q> 6.5 Å− 1.However; the assumption that the asymmetry in the hydrogen electron density does not …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2006,244
Representability problems for coarse-grained water potentials,Margaret E Johnson; Teresa Head-Gordon; Ard A Louis,The use of an effective intermolecular potential often involves a compromise between moreaccurate; complex functional forms and more tractable simple representations. To study thischoice in detail; we systematically derive coarse-grained isotropic pair potentials thataccurately reproduce the oxygen-oxygen radial distribution function of the TIP4P-Ew watermodel at state points over density ranges from 0.88 to 1.30 g∕ cm 3 and temperatureranges from 235 to 310 K. Although by construction these effective potentials correctlyrepresent the isothermal compressibility of TIP4P-Ew water; they do not accurately resolveother thermodynamic properties such as the virial pressure; the internal energy; orthermodynamic anomalies. Because at a given state point the pair potential that reproducesthe pair structure is unique; we have therefore explicitly demonstrated that it is impossible …,The Journal of chemical physics,2007,176
Hydration water dynamics near biological interfaces,Margaret E Johnson; Cecile Malardier-Jugroot; Rajesh K Murarka; Teresa Head-Gordon,We performed classical molecular dynamics simulations using both fixed-charge andpolarizable water and protein force fields to contrast the hydration dynamics near hydrophilicand amphiphilic peptides as a function of temperature. The high peptide concentrations weuse serve as a model for the surface of folded proteins where hydration layers around eachresidue overlap significantly. Through simulation we determine that there are notabledifferences in the water dynamics analyzed from the outer and inner hydration layer regionsof the amphiphilic peptide solution that explains the experimentally observed presence oftwo translational relaxations; while the hydrophilic peptide solution shows only a single non-Arrhenius translational process with no distinction between hydration layers. Given thatwater dynamics for the amphiphilic peptide system reproduces all known rotational and …,The Journal of Physical Chemistry B,2008,57
Nonspecific binding limits the number of proteins in a cell and shapes their interaction networks,Margaret E Johnson; Gerhard Hummer,Abstract Multicellular organisms; from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans; have roughly thesame number of protein encoding genes. We show that the need to prevent disease-causingnonspecific interactions between proteins provides a simple physical reason why organismcomplexity is not reflected in the number of distinct proteins. By collective evolution of theamino acid sequences of protein binding interfaces we estimate the degree of misbinding asa function of the number of distinct proteins. Protein interaction energies are calculated withan empirical; residue-specific energy function tuned for protein binding. We show that theachievable energy gap favoring specific over nonspecific binding decreases with proteinnumber in a power-law fashion. From the fraction of proteins involved in nonspecificcomplexes as a function of increasing protein number and decreasing energy gap; we …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2011,44
Effects of co-solvents on peptide hydration water structure and dynamics,Margaret E Johnson; Cecile Malardier-Jugroot; Teresa Head-Gordon,We evaluate the molecular response of hydration water as a function of temperature andproximity to the surface of the peptide N-acetyl-leucine-methylamide (NALMA) when in thepresence of the kosmotrope co-solvent glycerol or the chaotrope co-solvent dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO); using molecular dynamics simulation with a polarizable force field. Thesedetailed microscopic studies complement established thermodynamic analysis on the role ofco-solvents in shifting the equilibrium for proteins away from or towards the native foldedstate. We find that the structure of the water at the peptide interfaces reflects an increase inhydration number in the glycerol solution and a decrease in hydration numbers in the DMSOsolution. While the water dynamics around NALMA in the presence of both co-solvents isslower than that observed with the water solvent alone; in the DMSO mixture we no …,Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,2010,38
Aqueous peptides as experimental models for hydration water dynamics near protein surfaces,Cecile Malardier-Jugroot; Margaret E Johnson; Rajesh K Murarka; Teresa Head-Gordon,We report quasi-elastic neutron scattering experiments to contrast the water dynamics as afunction of temperature for hydrophilic and amphiphilic peptides under the same level ofconfinement; as models for understanding hydration dynamics near chemicallyheterogeneous protein surfaces. We find that the hydrophilic peptide shows only a singlenon-Arrhenius translational process with no evidence of spatial heterogeneity unlike theamphiphilic peptide solution that exhibits two translational relaxations with an Arrhenius andnon-Arrhenius dependence on temperature. Together these results provide experimentalproof that heterogeneous dynamical signatures near protein surfaces arise in part fromchemical heterogeneity (energy disorder) as opposed to mere topological roughness of theprotein surface.,Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,2008,37
Characterization of a dynamic string method for the construction of transition pathways in molecular reactions,Margaret E Johnson; Gerhard Hummer,We explore the theoretical foundation of different string methods used to find dominantreaction pathways in high-dimensional configuration spaces. Pathways are assessed by theamount of reactive flux they carry and by their orientation relative to the committor function.By examining the effects of transforming between different collective coordinates that spanthe same underlying space; we unmask artificial coordinate dependences in stringsoptimized to follow the free energy gradient. In contrast; strings optimized to follow the driftvector produce reaction pathways that are significantly less sensitive to reparameterizationsof the collective coordinates. The differences in these paths arise because the drift vectordepends on both the free energy gradient and the diffusion tensor of the coarse collectivevariables. Anisotropy and position dependence of diffusion tensors arise commonly in …,The Journal of Physical Chemistry B,2012,28
Structure and water dynamics of aqueous peptide solutions in the presence of co-solvents,Cecile Malardier-Jugroot; Daniel T Bowron; Alan K Soper; Margaret E Johnson; Teresa Head-Gordon,We perform neutron diffraction and quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) to probehydration water structure; and dynamics down to supercooled temperatures; of aconcentrated amphiphilic peptide system with the co-solvents glycerol and dimethylsulfoxide. We find that the kosmotropic co-solvent glycerol preserves the hydration structurenear the peptide that is observed in the water solvent alone; that in turn preserves thedynamical temperature trends of two water relaxation processes—one corresponding to alocalized relaxation process of the peptide bound surface water and a second relaxationprocess of the outer hydration layers. By contrast the chaotropic co-solvent; by disrupting thehydration layer near the peptide surface; eliminates the inner hydration layer relaxationprocess induced by the peptide; to show a single time scale for translational water …,Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,2010,23
Assessing thermodynamic-dynamic relationships for waterlike liquids,Margaret E Johnson; Teresa Head-Gordon,Here we investigate a family of isotropic waterlike glass-forming liquids; in which eachthermodynamic state point corresponds to a different potential energy surface which isprescribed to reproduce the g OO (r; T; ρ) of the reference TIP4P-Ew water model potential.Although each isotropic potential is simulated separately; together the family of isotropicpotentials displays anomalous dynamics with density and fragile diffusivity with temperature.By removing a common energy landscape; and therefore expected thermodynamic trendswith temperature within a single potential; we can more rigorously evaluate whether variousentropic measures used in popular phenomenological thermodynamic theories canquantitatively predict the diffusivity or viscosity. We find that the Adam–Gibbs relationbetween diffusion (or viscosity) and the temperature scaled configurational entropy; S c; is …,The Journal of chemical physics,2009,23
Interface-resolved network of protein-protein interactions,Margaret E Johnson; Gerhard Hummer,We define an interface-interaction network (IIN) to capture the specificity and competitionbetween protein-protein interactions (PPI). This new type of network represents interactionsbetween individual interfaces used in functional protein binding and thereby contains thedetail necessary to describe the competition and cooperation between any pair of bindingpartners. Here we establish a general framework for the construction of IINs that mergescomputational structure-based interface assignment with careful curation of availableliterature. To complement limited structural data; the inclusion of biochemical data is criticalfor achieving the accuracy and completeness necessary to analyze the specificity andcompetition between the protein interactions. Firstly; this procedure provides a means toclarify the information content of existing data on purported protein interactions and to …,PLoS computational biology,2013,20
Free-propagator reweighting integrator for single-particle dynamics in reaction-diffusion models of heterogeneous protein-protein interaction systems,Margaret E Johnson; Gerhard Hummer,Abstract We present a new algorithm for simulating reaction-diffusion equations at single-particle resolution. Our algorithm is designed to be both accurate and simple to implement;and to be applicable to large and heterogeneous systems; including those arising insystems biology applications. We combine the use of the exact Green's function for a pair ofreacting particles with the approximate free-diffusion propagator for position updates toparticles. Trajectory reweighting in our free-propagator reweighting (FPR) method recoversthe exact association rates for a pair of interacting particles at all times. FPR simulations ofmany-body systems accurately reproduce the theoretically known dynamic behavior for avariety of different reaction types. FPR does not suffer from the loss of efficiency common toother path-reweighting schemes; first; because corrections apply only in the immediate …,Physical Review X,2014,11
Evolutionary pressure on the topology of protein interface interaction networks,Margaret E Johnson; Gerhard Hummer,The densely connected structure of protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks reflects thefunctional need of proteins to cooperate in cellular processes. However; PPI networks do notadequately capture the competition in protein binding. By contrast; the interface interactionnetwork (IIN) studied here resolves the modular character of protein–protein binding anddistinguishes between simultaneous and exclusive interactions that underlie bothcooperation and competition. We show that the topology of the IIN is under evolutionarypressure; and we connect topological features of the IIN to specific biological functions. Toreveal the forces shaping the network topology; we use a sequence-based computationalmodel of interface binding along with network analysis. We find that the more fragmentedstructure of IINs; in contrast to the dense PPI networks; arises in large part from the …,The Journal of Physical Chemistry B,2013,2
Theory of bi-molecular association dynamics in 2D for accurate model and experimental parameterization of binding rates,Osman N Yogurtcu; Margaret E Johnson,The dynamics of association between diffusing and reacting molecular species are routinelyquantified using simple rate-equation kinetics that assume both well-mixed concentrations ofspecies and a single rate constant for parameterizing the binding rate. In two-dimensions(2D); however; even when systems are well-mixed; the assumption of a single characteristicrate constant for describing association is not generally accurate; due to the properties ofdiffusional searching in dimensions d≤ 2. Establishing rigorous bounds for discriminatingbetween 2D reactive systems that will be accurately described by rate equations with asingle rate constant; and those that will not; is critical for both modeling and experimentallyparameterizing binding reactions restricted to surfaces such as cellular membranes.

Understanding the interplay of structure and dynamics in liquids using coarse-grained models and experiment,Margaret Ellen Johnson,Abstract In these studies we examined the structure; thermodynamics; and dynamics ofwater in both bulk and in peptide solutions using simulation and experiment. With thesetechniques we were able to carefully examine the molecular mechanisms that give rise toseveral observable equilibrium properties of water as a function of temperature andpressure. First we critically examined the implications of a recent experiment that concludedthat liquid water does not form a tetrahedral network; as is commonly believed; but ratherorganizes into chains. We found that by imposing an asymmetric charge distribution on awater model;(an appropriate test of the chain-water hypothesis) the resulting structure of thewater does not agree well with experimental data. Hence; we provided further evidence thatthis new interpretation of non-tetrahedral water is not consistent with experimental data …,*,2009,*
