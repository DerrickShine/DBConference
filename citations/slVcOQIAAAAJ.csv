Exact indexing of dynamic time warping,Eamonn Keogh; Chotirat Ann Ratanamahatana,Abstract The problem of indexing time series has attracted much interest. Most algorithmsused to index time series utilize the Euclidean distance or some variation thereof. However;it has been forcefully shown that the Euclidean distance is a very brittle distance measure.Dynamic time warping (DTW) is a much more robust distance measure for time series;allowing similar shapes to match even if they are out of phase in the time axis. Because ofthis flexibility; DTW is widely used in science; medicine; industry and finance. Unfortunately;however; DTW does not obey the triangular inequality and thus has resisted attempts atexact indexing. Instead; many researchers have introduced approximate indexingtechniques or abandoned the idea of indexing and concentrated on speeding up sequentialsearches. In this work; we introduce a novel technique for the exact indexing of DTW. We …,Knowledge and information systems,2005,1966
A symbolic representation of time series; with implications for streaming algorithms,Jessica Lin; Eamonn Keogh; Stefano Lonardi; Bill Chiu,Abstract The parallel explosions of interest in streaming data; and data mining of time serieshave had surprisingly little intersection. This is in spite of the fact that time series data aretypically streaming data. The main reason for this apparent paradox is the fact that the vastmajority of work on streaming data explicitly assumes that the data is discrete; whereas thevast majority of time series data is real valued. Many researchers have also consideredtransforming real valued time series into symbolic representations; nothing that suchrepresentations would potentially allow researchers to avail of the wealth of data structuresand algorithms from the text processing and bioinformatics communities; in addition toallowing formerly" batch-only" problems to be tackled by the streaming community. Whilemany symbolic representations of time series have been introduced over the past …,Proceedings of the 8th ACM SIGMOD workshop on Research issues in data mining and knowledge discovery,2003,1465
Dimensionality reduction for fast similarity search in large time series databases,Eamonn Keogh; Kaushik Chakrabarti; Michael Pazzani; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract. The problem of similarity search in large time series databases has attracted muchattention recently. It is a non-trivial problem because of the inherent high dimensionality ofthe data. The most promising solutions involve first performing dimensionality reduction onthe data; and then indexing the reduced data with a spatial access method. Three majordimensionality reduction techniques have been proposed: Singular Value Decomposition(SVD); the Discrete Fourier transform (DFT); and more recently the Discrete WaveletTransform (DWT). In this work we introduce a new dimensionality reduction technique whichwe call Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA). We theoretically and empiricallycompare it to the other techniques and demonstrate its superiority. In addition to beingcompetitive with or faster than the other methods; our approach has numerous other …,Knowledge and information Systems,2001,1280
On the need for time series data mining benchmarks: a survey and empirical demonstration,Eamonn Keogh; Shruti Kasetty,Abstract In the last decade there has been an explosion of interest in mining time seriesdata. Literally hundreds of papers have introduced new algorithms to index; classify; clusterand segment time series. In this work we make the following claim. Much of this work hasvery little utility because the contribution made (speed in the case of indexing; accuracy inthe case of classification and clustering; model accuracy in the case of segmentation) offeran amount of “improvement” that would have been completely dwarfed by the variance thatwould have been observed by testing on many real world datasets; or the variance thatwould have been observed by changing minor (unstated) implementation details. Toillustrate our point; we have undertaken the most exhaustive set of time series experimentsever attempted; re-implementing the contribution of more than two dozen papers; and …,Data Mining and knowledge discovery,2003,1167
An online algorithm for segmenting time series,Eamonn Keogh; Selina Chu; David Hart; Michael Pazzani,In recent years; there has been an explosion of interest in mining time-series databases. Aswith most computer science problems; representation of the data is the key to efficient andeffective solutions. One of the most commonly used representations is piecewise linearapproximation. This representation has been used by various researchers to supportclustering; classification; indexing and association rule mining of time-series data. A varietyof algorithms have been proposed to obtain this representation; with several algorithmshaving been independently rediscovered several times. In this paper; we undertake the firstextensive review and empirical comparison of all proposed techniques. We show that allthese algorithms have fatal flaws from a data-mining perspective. We introduce a novelalgorithm that we empirically show to be superior to all others in the literature.,Data Mining; 2001. ICDM 2001; Proceedings IEEE International Conference on,2001,982
Querying and mining of time series data: experimental comparison of representations and distance measures,Hui Ding; Goce Trajcevski; Peter Scheuermann; Xiaoyue Wang; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract The last decade has witnessed a tremendous growths of interests in applicationsthat deal with querying and mining of time series data. Numerous representation methodsfor dimensionality reduction and similarity measures geared towards time series have beenintroduced. Each individual work introducing a particular method has made specific claimsand; aside from the occasional theoretical justifications; provided quantitative experimentalobservations. However; for the most part; the comparative aspects of these experimentswere too narrowly focused on demonstrating the benefits of the proposed methods oversome of the previously introduced ones. In order to provide a comprehensive validation; weconducted an extensive set of time series experiments re-implementing 8 differentrepresentation methods and 9 similarity measures and their variants; and testing their …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,928
Locally adaptive dimensionality reduction for indexing large time series databases,Eamonn Keogh; Kaushik Chakrabarti; Michael Pazzani; Sharad Mehrotra,Abstract Similarity search in large time series databases has attracted much researchinterest recently.

The most promising solutions involve performing dimensionality reduction on the data;then indexing the reduced data with a multidimensional index structure. Manydimensionality reduction techniques have been proposed; including Singular ValueDecomposition (SVD); the Discrete Fourier transform (DFT); and the Discrete WaveletTransform (DWT). In this work we introduce a new dimensionality reduction technique whichwe call Adaptive Piecewise Constant Approximation (APCA).

Whilemany symbolic representations of time series have been introduced over the past decades;they all suffer from two fatal flaws. First; the dimensionality of the symbolic representation isthe same as the original data; and virtually all data mining algorithms scale poorly withdimensionality.

Derivative dynamic time warping,Eamonn J Keogh; Michael J Pazzani,1 Introduction Time series are a ubiquitous form of data occurring in virtually every scientificdiscipline. A common task with time series data is comparing one sequence with another. Insome domains a very simple distance measure; such as Euclidean distance will suffice.However; it is often the case that two sequences have the approximately the same overallcomponent shapes; but these shapes do not line up in X-axis. Figure 1 shows this with asimple example. In order to find the similarity between such sequences; or as apreprocessing step before averaging them; we must “warp” the time axis of one (or both)sequences to achieve a better alignment. Dynamic time warping (DTW); is a technique forefficiently achieving this warping. In addition to data mining (Keogh & Pazzani 2000; Yi et. al.1998; Berndt & Clifford 1994); DTW has been used in gesture recognition (Gavrila & …,*,2001,824
Scaling up dynamic time warping for datamining applications,Eamonn J Keogh; Michael J Pazzani,ABSTRACT There has been much recent interest in adapting data mining algorithms to timeseries databases. Most of these algorithms need to compare time series. Typically somevariation of Euclidean distance is used. However; as we demonstrate in this paper;Euclidean distance can be an extremely brittle distance measure. Dynamic time warping(DTW) has been suggested as a technique to allow more robust distance calculations;however it is computationally expensive. In this paper we introduce a modification of DTWwhich operates on a higher level abstraction of the data; in particular; a PiecewiseAggregate Approximation (PAA). Our approach allows us to outperform DTW by one to twoorders of magnitude; with no loss of accuracy.,Proceedings of the sixth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2000,611
An Enhanced Representation of Time Series Which Allows Fast and Accurate Classification; Clustering and Relevance Feedback.,Eamonn J Keogh; Michael J Pazzani,Abstract We introduce an extended representation of time series that allows fast; accurateclassification and clustering in addition to the ability to explore time series data in arelevance feedback framework. The representation consists of piecewise linear segments torepresent shape and a weight vector that contains the relative importance of each individuallinear segment. In the classification context; the weights are learned automatically as part ofthe training cycle. In the relevance feedback context; the weights are determined by aninteractive and iterative process in which users rate various choices presented to them. Ourrepresentation allows a user to define a variety of similarity measures that can be tailored tospecific domains. We demonstrate our approach on space telemetry; medical and syntheticdata.,Kdd,1998,603
Towards parameter-free data mining,Eamonn Keogh; Stefano Lonardi; Chotirat Ann Ratanamahatana,Abstract Most data mining algorithms require the setting of many input parameters. Twomain dangers of working with parameter-laden algorithms are the following. First; incorrectsettings may cause an algorithm to fail in finding the true patterns. Second; a perhaps moreinsidious problem is that the algorithm may report spurious patterns that do not really exist;or greatly overestimate the significance of the reported patterns. This is especially likelywhen the user fails to understand the role of parameters in the data mining process. Datamining algorithms should have as few parameters as possible; ideally none. A parameter-free algorithm would limit our ability to impose our prejudices; expectations; andpresumptions on the problem at hand; and would let the data itself speak to us. In this work;we show that recent results in bioinformatics and computational theory hold great promise …,Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2004,591
Hot sax: Efficiently finding the most unusual time series subsequence,Eamonn Keogh; Jessica Lin; Ada Fu,In this work; we introduce the new problem of finding time series discords. Time seriesdiscords are subsequences of a longer time series that are maximally different to all the restof the time series subsequences. They thus capture the sense of the most unusualsubsequence within a time series. Time series discords have many uses for data mining;including improving the quality of clustering; data cleaning; summarization; and anomalydetection. Discords are particularly attractive as anomaly detectors because they onlyrequire one intuitive parameter (the length of the subsequence) unlike most anomalydetection algorithms that typically require many parameters. We evaluate our work with acomprehensive set of experiments. In particular; we demonstrate the utility of discords withobjective experiments on domains as diverse as Space Shuttle telemetry monitoring …,Data mining; fifth IEEE international conference on,2005,583
Probabilistic discovery of time series motifs,Bill Chiu; Eamonn Keogh; Stefano Lonardi,Abstract Several important time series data mining problems reduce to the core task offinding approximately repeated subsequences in a longer time series. In an earlier work; weformalized the idea of approximately repeated subsequences by introducing the notion oftime series motifs. Two limitations of this work were the poor scalability of the motif discoveryalgorithm; and the inability to discover motifs in the presence of noise. Here we addressthese limitations by introducing a novel algorithm inspired by recent advances in theproblem of pattern discovery in biosequences. Our algorithm is probabilistic in nature; but aswe show empirically and theoretically; it can find time series motifs with very high probabilityeven in the presence of noise or" don't care" symbols. Not only is the algorithm fast; but it isan anytime algorithm; producing likely candidate motifs almost immediately; and …,Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2003,551

Clustering of time-series subsequences is meaningless: implications for previous and future research,Eamonn Keogh; Jessica Lin,Abstract Given the recent explosion of interest in streaming data and online algorithms;clustering of time-series subsequences; extracted via a sliding window; has received muchattention. In this work; we make a surprising claim. Clustering of time-series subsequencesis meaningless. More concretely; clusters extracted from these time series are forced to obeya certain constraint that is pathologically unlikely to be satisfied by any dataset; and becauseof this; the clusters extracted by any clustering algorithm are essentially random. While thisconstraint can be intuitively demonstrated with a simple illustration and is simple to prove; ithas never appeared in the literature. We can justify calling our claim surprising because itinvalidates the contribution of dozens of previously published papers. We will justify ourclaim with a theorem; illustrative examples; and a comprehensive set of experiments on …,Knowledge and information systems,2005,487
Time series shapelets: a new primitive for data mining,Lexiang Ye; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Classification of time series has been attracting great interest over the past decade.Recent empirical evidence has strongly suggested that the simple nearest neighboralgorithm is very difficult to beat for most time series problems. While this may be consideredgood news; given the simplicity of implementing the nearest neighbor algorithm; there aresome negative consequences of this. First; the nearest neighbor algorithm requires storingand searching the entire dataset; resulting in a time and space complexity that limits itsapplicability; especially on resource-limited sensors. Second; beyond mere classificationaccuracy; we often wish to gain some insight into the data. In this work we introduce a newtime series primitive; time series shapelets; which addresses these limitations. Informally;shapelets are time series subsequences which are in some sense maximally …,Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2009,447
Finding surprising patterns in a time series database in linear time and space,Eamonn Keogh; Stefano Lonardi; Bill'Yuan-chi' Chiu,Abstract The problem of finding a specified pattern in a time series database (ie query bycontent) has received much attention and is now a relatively mature field. In contrast; theimportant problem of enumerating all surprising or interesting patterns has received far lessattention. This problem requires a meaningful definition of" surprise"; and an efficient searchtechnique. All previous attempts at finding surprising patterns in time series use a verylimited notion of surprise; and/or do not scale to massive datasets. To overcome theselimitations we introduce a novel technique that defines a pattern surprising if the frequencyof its occurrence differs substantially from that expected by chance; given some previouslyseen data.,Proceedings of the eighth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2002,440
Fast time series classification using numerosity reduction,Xiaopeng Xi; Eamonn Keogh; Christian Shelton; Li Wei; Chotirat Ann Ratanamahatana,Abstract Many algorithms have been proposed for the problem of time series classification.However; it is clear that one-nearest-neighbor with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distanceis exceptionally difficult to beat. This approach has one weakness; however; it iscomputationally too demanding for many realtime applications. One way to mitigate thisproblem is to speed up the DTW calculations. Nonetheless; there is a limit to how much thiscan help. In this work; we propose an additional technique; numerosity reduction; to speedup one-nearest-neighbor DTW. While the idea of numerosity reduction for nearest-neighborclassifiers has a long history; we show here that we can leverage off an original observationabout the relationship between dataset size and DTW constraints to produce an extremelycompact dataset with little or no loss in accuracy. We test our ideas with a comprehensive …,Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on Machine learning,2006,431
Indexing multi-dimensional time-series with support for multiple distance measures,Michail Vlachos; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Although most time-series data mining research has concentrated on providingsolutions for a single distance function; in this work we motivate the need for a single indexstructure that can support multiple distance measures. Our specific area of interest is theefficient retrieval and analysis of trajectory similarities. Trajectory datasets are very commonin environmental applications; mobility experiments; video surveillance and are especiallyimportant for the discovery of certain biological patterns. Our primary similarity measure isbased on the Longest Common Subsequence (LCSS) model; that offers enhancedrobustness; particularly for noisy data; which are encountered very often in real worldapplications. However; our index is able to accommodate other distance measures as well;including the ubiquitous Euclidean distance; and the increasingly popular Dynamic Time …,Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2003,429
Searching and mining trillions of time series subsequences under dynamic time warping,Thanawin Rakthanmanon; Bilson Campana; Abdullah Mueen; Gustavo Batista; Brandon Westover; Qiang Zhu; Jesin Zakaria; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Most time series data mining algorithms use similarity search as a core subroutine;and thus the time taken for similarity search is the bottleneck for virtually all time series datamining algorithms. The difficulty of scaling search to large datasets largely explains whymost academic work on time series data mining has plateaued at considering a few millionsof time series objects; while much of industry and science sits on billions of time seriesobjects waiting to be explored. In this work we show that by using a combination of fournovel ideas we can search and mine truly massive time series for the first time. Wedemonstrate the following extremely unintuitive fact; in large datasets we can exactly searchunder DTW much more quickly than the current state-of-the-art Euclidean distance searchalgorithms. We demonstrate our work on the largest set of time series experiments ever …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2012,428
Experimental comparison of representation methods and distance measures for time series data,Xiaoyue Wang; Abdullah Mueen; Hui Ding; Goce Trajcevski; Peter Scheuermann; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract The previous decade has brought a remarkable increase of the interest inapplications that deal with querying and mining of time series data.

Making time-series classification more accurate using learned constraints,Chotirat Ann Ratanamahatana; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract It has long been known that Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is superior to Euclideandistance for classification and clustering of time series. However; until lately; most researchhas utilized Euclidean distance because it is more efficiently calculated. A recentlyintroduced technique that greatly mitigates DTWs demanding CPU time has sparked a flurryof research activity. However; the technique and its many extensions still only allow DTW tobe applied to moderately large datasets. In addition; almost all of the research on DTW hasfocused exclusively on speeding up its calculation; there has been little work done onimproving its accuracy. In this work; we target the accuracy aspect of DTW performance andintroduce a new framework that learns arbitrary constraints on the warping path of the DTWcalculation.

In this paper a probabflisticapproach is taken to this problem.

A brief survey on sequence classification,Zhengzheng Xing; Jian Pei; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Sequence classification has a broad range of applications such as genomicanalysis; information retrieval; health informatics; finance; and abnormal detection. Differentfrom the classification task on feature vectors; sequences do not have explicit features. Evenwith sophisticated feature selection techniques; the dimensionality of potential features maystill be very high and the sequential nature of features is difficult to capture. This makessequence classification a more challenging task than classification on feature vectors. In thispaper; we present a brief review of the existing work on sequence classification. Wesummarize the sequence classification in terms of methodologies and application domains.We also provide a review on several extensions of the sequence classification problem;such as early classification on sequences and semi-supervised learning on sequences.,ACM Sigkdd Explorations Newsletter,2010,313
Three myths about dynamic time warping data mining,Chotirat Ann Ratanamahatana; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract The Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance measure is a technique that has longbeen known in speech recognition community. It allows a non-linear mapping of one signalto another by minimizing the distance between the two. A decade ago; DTW was introducedinto Data Mining community as a utility for various tasks for time series problems includingclassification; clustering; and anomaly detection. The technique has flourished; particularlyin the last three years; and has been applied to a variety of problems in various disciplines.In spite of DTW's great success; there are still several persistent “myths” about it. Thesemyths have caused confusion and led to much wasted research effort. In this work; we willdispel these myths with the most comprehensive set of time series experiments everconducted.,*,2005,310
Exact discovery of time series motifs,Abdullah Mueen; Eamonn Keogh; Qiang Zhu; Sydney Cash; Brandon Westover,Abstract Time series motifs are pairs of individual time series; or subsequences of a longertime series; which are very similar to each other. As with their discrete analogues incomputational biology; this similarity hints at structure which has been conserved for somereason and may therefore be of interest. Since the formalism of time series motifs in 2002;dozens of researchers have used them for diverse applications in many different domains.Because the obvious algorithm for computing motifs is quadratic in the number of items;more than a dozen approximate algorithms to discover motifs have been proposed in theliterature. In this work; for the first time; we show a tractable exact algorithm to find timeseries motifs. As we shall show through extensive experiments; our algorithm is up to threeorders of magnitude faster than brute-force search in large datasets. We further show that …,*,2009,294
Learning augmented Bayesian classifiers: A comparison of distribution-based and classification-based approaches.,Eamonn J Keogh; Michael J Pazzani,Abstract The naïve Bayes classifier is built on the assumption of conditional independencebetween the attributes given the class. The algorithm has been shown to be surprisinglyrobust to obvious violations of this condition; but it is natural to ask if it is possible to furtherimprove the accuracy by relaxing this assumption. We examine an approach where naïveBayes is augmented by the addition of correlation arcs between attributes. We explore twomethods for finding the set of augmenting arcs; a greedy hillclimbing search; and a novel;more computationally efficient algorithm that we call SuperParent. We compare thesemethods to TAN; a state-of the-art distribution-based approach to finding the augmentingarcs.,AIStats,1999,292

Iterative deepening dynamic time warping for time series,Selina Chu; Eamonn Keogh; David Hart; Michael Pazzani,1 Introduction Time series are a ubiquitous form of data occurring in virtually every scientificdiscipline and business application. There has been much recent work on adapting datamining algorithms to time series databases. For example; Das et al. attempt to show howassociation rules can be learned from time series [7]. Debregeas and Hebrail [8]demonstrate a technique for scaling up time series clustering algorithms to massivedatasets. Keogh and Pazzani introduced a new; scalable time series classification algorithm[16]. Almost all algorithms that operate on time series data need to compute the similaritybetween them. Euclidean distance; or some extension or modification thereof; is typicallyused. However as we will demonstrate in Section 2.1; Euclidean distance can be anextremely brittle distance measure.,*,2002,266
Indexing large human-motion databases,Eamonn Keogh; Themistoklis Palpanas; Victor B Zordan; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Marc Cardle,Abstract Data-driven animation has become the industry standard for computer games andmany animated movies and special effects. In particular; motion capture data recorded fromlive actors; is the most promising approach offered thus far for animating realistic humancharacters. However; the manipulation of such data for general use and re-use is not yet asolved problem. Many of the existing techniques dealing with editing motion rely on indexingfor annotation; segmentation; and re-ordering of the data. Euclidean distance isinappropriate for solving these indexing problems because of the inherent variability foundin human motion. The limitations of Euclidean distance stems from the fact that it is verysensitive to distortions in the time axis. A partial solution to this problem; Dynamic TimeWarping (DTW); aligns the time axis before calculating the Euclidean distance.

Scaling up dynamic time warping to massive datasets,Eamonn J Keogh; Michael J Pazzani,Abstract There has been much recent interest in adapting data mining algorithms to timeseries databases. Many of these algorithms need to compare time series. Typically somevariation or extension of Euclidean distance is used. However; as we demonstrate in thispaper; Euclidean distance can be an extremely brittle distance measure. Dynamic timewarping (DTW) has been suggested as a technique to allow more robust distancecalculations; however it is computationally expensive. In this paper we introduce amodification of DTW which operates on a higher level abstraction of the data; in particular; apiecewise linear representation. We demonstrate that our approach allows us to outperformDTW by one to three orders of magnitude. We experimentally evaluate our approach onmedical; astronomical and sign language data.,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,1999,255

Weintroduce a novel-dimensionality reduction technique that supports an indexing algorithmthat is more than an order of magnitude faster than the previous best known method. Inaddition to being much faster our approach has numerous other advantages. It is simple tounderstand and implement; allows more flexible distance measures including weightedEuclidean queries and the index can be built in linear time. We call our approach PCA-indexing (Piecewise Constant Approximation) and experimentally validate it on spacetelemetry; financial; astronomical; medical and synthetic data.,Pacific-Asia conference on knowledge discovery and data mining,2000,235
Scaling and time warping in time series querying,Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Eamonn Keogh; Leo Yung Lau; Chotirat Ann Ratanamahatana; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract The last few years have seen an increasing understanding that dynamic timewarping (DTW); a technique that allows local flexibility in aligning time series; is superior tothe ubiquitous Euclidean distance for time series classification; clustering; and indexing.More recently; it has been shown that for some problems; uniform scaling (US); a techniquethat allows global scaling of time series; may just be as important for some problems. In thiswork; we note that for many real world problems; it is necessary to combine both DTW andUS to achieve meaningful results. This is particularly true in domains where we mustaccount for the natural variability of human actions; including biometrics; query by humming;motion-capture/animation; and handwriting recognition.

LB_Keogh supports exact indexing of shapes under rotation invariance with arbitrary representations and distance measures,Eamonn Keogh; Li Wei; Xiaopeng Xi; Sang-Hee Lee; Michail Vlachos,Abstract The matching of two-dimensional shapes is an important problem with applicationsin domains as diverse as biometrics; industry; medicine and anthropology. The distancemeasure used must be invariant to many distortions; including scale; offset; noise; partialocclusion; etc. Most of these distortions are relatively easy to handle; either in therepresentation of the data or in the similarity measure used. However rotation invarianceseems to be uniquely difficult. Current approaches typically try to achieve rotation invariancein the representation of the data; at the expense of discrimination ability; or in the distancemeasure; at the expense of efficiency. In this work we show that we can take the slow butaccurate approaches and dramatically speed them up.

Semi-supervised time series classification,Li Wei; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract The problem of time series classification has attracted great interest in the lastdecade. However current research assumes the existence of large amounts of labeledtraining data. In reality; such data may be very difficult or expensive to obtain. For example; itmay require the time and expertise of cardiologists; space launch technicians; or otherdomain specialists. As in many other domains; there are often copious amounts of unlabeleddata available. For example; the PhysioBank archive contains gigabytes of ECG data. In thiswork we propose a semi-supervised technique for building time series classifiers. Whilesuch algorithms are well known in text domains; we will show that special considerationsmust be made to make them both efficient and effective for the time series domain.

Mining motifs in massive time series databases,Pranav Patel; Eamonn Keogh; Jessica Lin; Stefano Lonardi,The problem of efficiently locating previously known patterns in a time series database (ie;query by content) has received much attention and may now largely be regarded as asolved problem. However; from a knowledge discovery viewpoint; a more interestingproblem is the enumeration of previously unknown; frequently occurring patterns. We callsuch patterns" motifs"; because of their close analogy to their discrete counterparts incomputation biology. An efficient motif discovery algorithm for time series would be useful asa tool for summarizing and visualizing massive time series databases. In addition it could beused as a subroutine in various other data mining tasks; including the discovery ofassociation rules; clustering and classification. In this paper we carefully motivate; thenintroduce; a nontrivial definition of time series motifs. We propose an efficient algorithm to …,Data Mining; 2002. ICDM 2003.

A complexity-invariant distance measure for time series,Gustavo EAPA Batista; Xiaoyue Wang; Eamonn J Keogh,Abstract The ubiquity of time series data across almost all human endeavors has produced agreat interest in time series data mining in the last decade. While there is a plethora ofclassification algorithms that can be applied to time series; all of the current empiricalevidence suggests that simple nearest neighbor classification is exceptionally difficult tobeat. The choice of distance measure used by the nearest neighbor algorithm depends onthe invariances required by the domain. For example; motion capture data typically requiresinvariance to warping. In this work we make a surprising claim. There is an invariance thatthe community has missed; complexity invariance. Intuitively; the problem is that in manydomains the different classes may have different complexities; and pairs of complex objects;even those which subjectively may seem very similar to the human eye; tend to be further …,*,2011,194
Logical-shapelets: an expressive primitive for time series classification,Abdullah Mueen; Eamonn Keogh; Neal Young,Abstract Time series shapelets are small; local patterns in a time series that are highlypredictive of a class and are thus very useful features for building classifiers and for certainvisualization and summarization tasks. While shapelets were introduced only recently; theyhave already seen significant adoption and extension in the community. Despite theirimmense potential as a data mining primitive; there are two important limitations ofshapelets. First; their expressiveness is limited to simple binary presence/absencequestions. Second; even though shapelets are computed offline; the time taken to computethem is significant. In this work; we address the latter problem by introducing a novelalgorithm that finds shapelets in less time than current methods by an order of magnitude.Our algorithm is based on intelligent caching and reuse of computations; and the …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2011,184
Iterative incremental clustering of time series,Jessica Lin; Michail Vlachos; Eamonn Keogh; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract We present a novel anytime version of partitional clustering algorithm; such as k-Means and EM; for time series. The algorithm works by leveraging off the multi-resolutionproperty of wavelets. The dilemma of choosing the initial centers is mitigated by initializingthe centers at each approximation level; using the final centers returned by the coarserrepresentations. In addition to casting the clustering algorithms as anytime algorithms; thisapproach has two other very desirable properties. By working at lower dimensionalities wecan efficiently avoid local minima. Therefore; the quality of the clustering is usually betterthan the batch algorithm. In addition; even if the algorithm is run to completion; our approachis much faster than its batch counterpart. We explain; and empirically demonstrate thesesurprising and desirable properties with comprehensive experiments on several publicly …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2004,184
Fast shapelets: A scalable algorithm for discovering time series shapelets,Thanawin Rakthanmanon; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Time series shapelets are a recent promising concept in time series data mining.Shapelets are time series snippets that can be used to classify unlabeled time series.Shapelets not only provide interpretable results; which are useful for domain experts anddevelopers alike; but shapelet-based classifiers have been shown by several independentresearch groups to have superior accuracy on many datasets. Moreover; shapelets can beseen as generalizing the lazy nearest neighbor classifier to an eager classifier. Thus; as adeployed classification tool; shapelets can be many orders of magnitude faster than any rivalwith comparable accuracy. Although shapelets are a useful concept; the current literaturebemoans the fact that shapelet discovery is a time-consuming task. In spite of several effortsto speed up shapelet discovery algorithms; including the use of specialist hardware; the …,*,2013,173
Visually mining and monitoring massive time series,Jessica Lin; Eamonn Keogh; Stefano Lonardi; Jeffrey P Lankford; Donna M Nystrom,Abstract Moments before the launch of every space vehicle; engineering disciplinespecialists must make a critical go/no-go decision.

Online amnesic approximation of streaming time series,Themistoklis Palpanas; Michail Vlachos; Eamonn Keogh; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Wagner Truppel,The past decade has seen a wealth of research on time series representations; because themanipulation; storage; and indexing of large volumes of raw time series data is impractical.The vast majority of research has concentrated on representations that are calculated inbatch mode and represent each value with approximately equal fidelity. However; theincreasing deployment of mobile devices and real time sensors has brought home the needfor representations that can be incrementally updated; and can approximate the data withfidelity proportional to its age. The latter property allows us to answer queries about therecent past with greater precision; since in many domains recent information is more usefulthan older information. We call such representations amnesic. While there has beenprevious work on amnesic representations; the class of amnesic functions possible was …,Data Engineering; 2004.

Detecting time series motifs under uniform scaling,Dragomir Yankov; Eamonn Keogh; Jose Medina; Bill Chiu; Victor Zordan,Abstract Time series motifs are approximately repeated patterns foundwithin the data. Suchmotifs have utility for many data mining algorithms; including rule-discovery; novelty-detection; summarization and clustering. Since the formalization of the problem and theintroduction of efficient linear time algorithms; motif discovery has been successfully appliedtomany domains; including medicine; motion capture; robotics and meteorology. In this workwe show that most previous applications of time series motifs have been severely limited bythe definition's brittleness to even slight changes of uniform scaling; the speed at which thepatterns develop. We introduce a new algorithm that allows discovery of time series motifswith invariance to uniform scaling; and show that it produces objectively superior results inseveral important domains.

A wavelet-based anytime algorithm for k-means clustering of time series,Michail Vlachos; Jessica Lin; Eamonn Keogh; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract The emergence of the field of data mining in the last decade has sparked anincreasing interest in clustering of tiate series. Although there has been much research onclustering in general; most classic machine learning and data mining algorithms do not workwell for time series due to their unique structure. In particular; the high dimensionaliF; veryhigh feature correlation; and the (typically) large amount of noise that characterize timeseries data present a difficult challenge. In this work we address these challenges byintroducing a novel anytiate version of k-Means clustering algorithm for time series. Thealgorithm works by leveraging off the multi-resolution property of wavelets. In particular; aninitial clustering is perforated with a very coarse resolution representation of the data.

Relevance feedback retrieval of time series data,Eamonn J Keogh; Michael J Pazzani,ABSTRACT There has been much recent interest in retrieval of time series data. Earlier workhas used a fixed similarity metric (eg; Euclidean distance) to determine the similaritybetween a userspecified query and items in the database. Here; we describe a novelapproach to retrieval of time series data by using relevance feedback from the user to adjustthe similarity metric. This is important because the Euclidean distance metric does notcapture many notions of similarity between time series. In particular; Euclidean distance issensitive to various “distortions” such as offset translation; amplitude scaling; etc. Dependingon the domain and the user; one may wish a query to be sensitive or insensitive to thesedistortions to varying degrees. This paper addresses this problem by introducing a profilethat encodes the user's subjective notion of similarity in a domain.

Time series shapelets: a novel technique that allows accurate; interpretable and fast classification,Lexiang Ye; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Classification of time series has been attracting great interest over the past decade.While dozens of techniques have been introduced; recent empirical evidence has stronglysuggested that the simple nearest neighbor algorithm is very difficult to beat for most timeseries problems; especially for large-scale datasets. While this may be considered goodnews; given the simplicity of implementing the nearest neighbor algorithm; there are somenegative consequences of this. First; the nearest neighbor algorithm requires storing andsearching the entire dataset; resulting in a high time and space complexity that limits itsapplicability; especially on resource-limited sensors.

In the last decade;there has been an explosion of interest in Mining time series data. A nunber of newalgorithms have been introduced to classify; cluster; segment; index; discover rules; anddetect anomalies/novelties in time series. While these many different techniques used tosolve these problems use a multitude of different techniques; they all have one commonfactor; they require some high level representation of the data; rather than the original rawdata. These high level representation are necessary as a feature extraction step; or simply tomake the storage; transmission; and computation of massive dataset feasible.

Our specific area of interest is theefficient retrieval and analysis of similar trajectories. Trajectory datasets are very common inenvironmental applications; mobility experiments; and video surveillance and are especiallyimportant for the discovery of certain biological patterns. Our primary similarity measure isbased on the longest common subsequence (LCSS) model that offers enhancedrobustness; particularly for noisy data; which are encountered very often in real-worldapplications.

Finding the most unusual time series subsequence: algorithms and applications,Eamonn Keogh; Jessica Lin; Sang-Hee Lee; Helga Van Herle,Abstract In this work we introduce the new problem of finding time series discords. Timeseries discords are subsequences of longer time series that are maximally different to all therest of the time series subsequences. They thus capture the sense of the most unusualsubsequence within a time series. While discords have many uses for data mining; they areparticularly attractive as anomaly detectors because they only require one intuitiveparameter (the length of the subsequence) unlike most anomaly detection algorithms thattypically require many parameters. While the brute force algorithm to discover time seriesdiscords is quadratic in the length of the time series; we show a simple algorithm that is threeto four orders of magnitude faster than brute force; while guaranteed to produce identicalresults.

Online discovery and maintenance of time series motifs,Abdullah Mueen; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract The detection of repeated subsequences; time series motifs; is a problem which hasbeen shown to have great utility for several higher-level data mining algorithms; includingclassification; clustering; segmentation; forecasting; and rule discovery. In recent years therehas been significant research effort spent on efficiently discovering these motifs in staticoffline databases. However; for many domains; the inherent streaming nature of time seriesdemands online discovery and maintenance of time series motifs. In this paper; we developthe first online motif discovery algorithm which monitors and maintains motifs exactly in realtime over the most recent history of a stream.

Disk aware discord discovery: Finding unusual time series in terabyte sized datasets,Dragomir Yankov; Eamonn Keogh; Umaa Rebbapragada,Abstract The problem of finding unusual time series has recently attracted much attention;and several promising methods are now in the literature. However; virtually all proposedmethods assume that the data reside in main memory. For many real-world problems this isnot be the case. For example; in astronomy; multi-terabyte time series datasets are the norm.Most current algorithms faced with data which cannot fit in main memory resort to multiplescans of the disk/tape and are thus intractable. In this work we show how one particulardefinition of unusual time series; the time series discord; can be discovered with a diskaware algorithm. The proposed algorithm is exact and requires only two linear scans of thedisk with a tiny buffer of main memory. Furthermore; it is very simple to implement.

Assumption-Free Anomaly Detection in Time Series.,Li Wei; Nitin Kumar; Venkata Nishanth Lolla; Eamonn J Keogh; Stefano Lonardi; Chotirat (Ann) Ratanamahatana,Abstract Recent advancements in sensor technology have made it possible to collectenormous amounts of data in real time. However; because of the sheer volume of data mostof it will never be inspected by an algorithm; much less a human being. One way to mitigatethis problem is to perform some type of anomaly (novelty/interestingness/surprisingness)detection and flag unusual patterns for further inspection by humans or more CPU intensivealgorithms. Most current solutions are “custom made” for particular domains; such as ECGmonitoring; valve pressure monitoring; etc. This customization requires extensive effort bydomain expert. Furthermore; hand-crafted systems tend to be very brittle to concept drift.,SSDBM,2005,105

Accelerating dynamic time warping subsequence search with GPUs and FPGAs,Doruk Sart; Abdullah Mueen; Walid Najjar; Eamonn Keogh; Vit Niennattrakul,Many time series data mining problems require subsequence similarity search as asubroutine. Dozens of similarity/distance measures have been proposed in the last decadeand there is increasing evidence that Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is the best measureacross a wide range of domains. Given DTW's usefulness and ubiquity; there has been alarge community-wide effort to mitigate its relative lethargy. Proposed speedup techniquesinclude early abandoning strategies; lower-bound based pruning; indexing and embedding.In this work we argue that we are now close to exhausting all possible speedup fromsoftware; and that we must turn to hardware-based solutions.

Given the ubiquity of shape;shape matching is an important problem with applications in domains as diverse asbiometrics; industry; medicine; zoology and anthropology. The distance/similarity measurefor used for shape matching must be invariant to many distortions; including scale; offset;noise; articulation; partial occlusion; etc. Most of these distortions are relatively easy tohandle; either in the representation of the data or in the similarity measure used.

Clustering time series using unsupervised-shapelets,Jesin Zakaria; Abdullah Mueen; Eamonn Keogh,Time series clustering has become an increasingly important research topic over the pastdecade. Most existing methods for time series clustering rely on distances calculated fromthe entire raw data using the Euclidean distance or Dynamic Time Warping distance as thedistance measure. However; the presence of significant noise; dropouts; or extraneous datacan greatly limit the accuracy of clustering in this domain. Moreover; for most real worldproblems; we cannot expect objects from the same class to be equal in length. As aconsequence; most work on time series clustering only considers the clustering of individualtime series" behaviors;" eg; individual heart beats or individual gait cycles; and contrives thetime series in some way to make them all equal in length. However; contriving the data insuch a way is often a harder problem than the clustering itself. In this work; we show that …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on,2012,94

An indexing scheme for fast similarity search in large time series databases,Eamonn J Keogh; Michael J Pazzani,Addresses the problem of similarity searching in large time-series databases. We introducea novel indexing algorithm that allows faster retrieval. The index is formed by creating binsthat contain time series subsequences of approximately the same shape. For each bin; wecan quickly calculate a lower bound on the distance between a given query and the mostsimilar element of the bin. This bound allows us to search the bins in best-first order; and toprune some bins from the search space without having to examine the contents. Additionalspeedup is obtained by optimizing the data within the bins such that we can avoid having tocompare the query to every item in the bin. We call our approach STB (Shape To Bit-vector)indexing; and experimentally validate it on space telemetry; medical and synthetic data;demonstrating approximately an order-of-magnitude speedup.,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 1999.

A novel bit level time series representation with implication of similarity search and clustering,Chotirat Ratanamahatana; Eamonn Keogh; Anthony J Bagnall; Stefano Lonardi,Abstract Because time series are a ubiquitous and increasingly prevalent type of data; therehas been much research effort devoted to time series data mining recently. As with all datamining problems; the key to effective and scalable algorithms is choosing the rightrepresentation of the data. Many high level representations of time series have beenproposed for data mining. In this work; we introduce a new technique based on a bit levelapproximation of the data. The representation has several important advantages overexisting techniques. One unique advantage is that it allows raw data to be directly comparedto the reduced representation; while still guaranteeing lower bounds to Euclidean distance.This fact can be exploited to produce faster exact algorithms for similarly search. In addition;we demonstrate that our new representation allows time series clustering to scale to …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2005,88

In this work; we argue that this assumption is unjustified; and this has inmany cases led to unwarranted optimism about the performance of the proposed algorithms.As we shall show; the task of correctly extracting individual gait cycles; heartbeats; gestures;behaviors; etc.; is generally much more difficult than the task of actually classifying thosepatterns.

Addressing big data time series: Mining trillions of time series subsequences under dynamic time warping,Thanawin Rakthanmanon; Bilson Campana; Abdullah Mueen; Gustavo Batista; Brandon Westover; Qiang Zhu; Jesin Zakaria; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Most time series data mining algorithms use similarity search as a core subroutine;and thus the time taken for similarity search is the bottleneck for virtually all time series datamining algorithms; including classification; clustering; motif discovery; anomaly detection;and so on. The difficulty of scaling a search to large datasets explains to a great extent whymost academic work on time series data mining has plateaued at considering a few millionsof time series objects; while much of industry and science sits on billions of time seriesobjects waiting to be explored. In this work we show that by using a combination of fournovel ideas we can search and mine massive time series for the first time. We demonstratethe following unintuitive fact: in large datasets we can exactly search under Dynamic TimeWarping (DTW) much more quickly than the current state-of-the-art Euclidean distance …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2013,84
Dynamic time warping averaging of time series allows faster and more accurate classification,François Petitjean; Germain Forestier; Geoffrey I Webb; Ann E Nicholson; Yanping Chen; Eamonn Keogh,Recent years have seen significant progress in improving both the efficiency andeffectiveness of time series classification. However; because the best solution is typically theNearest Neighbor algorithm with the relatively expensive Dynamic Time Warping as thedistance measure; successful deployments on resource constrained devices remain elusive.Moreover; the recent explosion of interest in wearable devices; which typically have limitedcomputational resources; has created a growing need for very efficient classificationalgorithms. A commonly used technique to glean the benefits of the Nearest Neighboralgorithm; without inheriting its undesirable time complexity; is to use the Nearest Centroidalgorithm. However; because of the unique properties of (most) time series data; the centroidtypically does not resemble any of the instances; an unintuitive and underappreciated fact …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2014 IEEE International Conference on,2014,80
Time series epenthesis: Clustering time series streams requires ignoring some data,Thanawin Rakthanmanon; Eamonn J Keogh; Stefano Lonardi; Scott Evans,Given the pervasiveness of time series data in all human endeavors; and the ubiquity ofclustering as a data mining application; it is somewhat surprising that the problem of timeseries clustering from a single stream remains largely unsolved. Most work on time seriesclustering considers the clustering of individual time series; eg; gene expression profiles;individual heartbeats or individual gait cycles. The few attempts at clustering time seriesstreams have been shown to be objectively incorrect in some cases; and in other casesshown to work only on the most contrived datasets by carefully adjusting a large set ofparameters. In this work; we make two fundamental contributions. First; we show that theproblem definition for time series clustering from streams currently used is inherently flawed;and a new definition is necessary. Second; we show that the Minimum Description Length …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on,2011,79

Learning the structure of augmented Bayesian classifiers,Eamonn J Keogh; Michael J Pazzani,The naïve Bayes classifier is built on the assumption of conditional independence betweenthe attributes given the class. The algorithm has been shown to be surprisingly robust toobvious violations of this condition; but is is natural to ask if it is possible to further improvethe accuracy by relaxing this assumption. We examine an approach where naïve Bayes isaugmented by the addition of correlation arcs between attributes. We explore two methodsfor finding the set of augmenting arcs; a greedy hill-climbing search; and a novel; morecomputationally efficient algorithm that we call SuperParent. We compare these methods toTAN; a state-of the-art distribution-based approach to finding the augmenting arcs.,International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools,2002,77
Finding unusual medical time-series subsequences: Algorithms and applications,Eamonn Keogh; Jessica Lin; Ada Waichee Fu; Helga VanHerle,In this work; we introduce the new problem of finding time series discords. Time seriesdiscords are subsequences of longer time series that are maximally different to all the rest ofthe time series subsequences. They thus capture the sense of the most unusualsubsequence within a time series. While discords have many uses for data mining; they areparticularly attractive as anomaly detectors because they only require one intuitiveparameter (the length of the subsequence); unlike most anomaly detection algorithms thattypically require many parameters. While the brute force algorithm to discover time seriesdiscords is quadratic in the length of the time series; we show a simple algorithm that is threeto four orders of magnitude faster than brute force; while guaranteed to produce identicalresults. We evaluate our work with a comprehensive set of experiments on …,IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine,2006,74

A compression‐based distance measure for texture,Bilson JL Campana; Eamonn J Keogh,Abstract The analysis of texture is an important subroutine in application areas as diverse asbiology; medicine; robotics; and forensic science. While the last three decades have seenextensive research in algorithms to measure texture similarity; almost all existing methodsrequire the careful setting of many parameters. There are many problems associated with alot of parameters; the most obvious of which is that with many parameters to fit; it is verydifficult to avoid overfitting. In this work; we propose to extend recent advances inKolmogorov complexity-based similarity measures to texture matching problems. TheseKolmogorov-based methods have been shown to be very useful in intrinsically discretedomains such as DNA; protein sequences; MIDI music; and natural languages; however;they are not well defined for real-valued data.

Wat: Finding top-k discords in time series database,Yingyi Bu; Tat-Wing Leung; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Eamonn Keogh; Jian Pei; Sam Meshkin,Abstract Finding discords in time series database is an important problem in a great varietyof applications; such as space shuttle telemetry; mechanical industry; biomedicine; andfinancial data analysis. However; most previous methods for this problem suffer from toomany parameter settings which are difficult for users. The best known approach to ourknowledge that has comparatively fewer parameters still requires users to choose a wordsize for the compression of subsequences. In this paper; we propose a Haar wavelet andaugmented trie based algorithm to mine the top-K discords from a time series database;which can dynamically determine the word size for compression. Due to the characteristicsof Haar wavelet transform; our algorithm has greater pruning power than previousapproaches.

A bit level representation for time series data mining with shape based similarity,Anthony Bagnall; Eamonn Keogh; Stefano Lonardi; Gareth Janacek,Abstract Clipping is the process of transforming a real valued series into a sequence of bitsrepresenting whether each data is above or below the average. In this paper; we argue thatclipping is a useful and flexible transformation for the exploratory analysis of large timedependent data sets. We demonstrate how time series stored as bits can be very efficientlycompressed and manipulated and that; under some assumptions; the discriminatory powerwith clipped series is asymptotically equivalent to that achieved with the raw data. Unlikeother transformations; clipped series can be compared directly to the raw data series. Weshow that this means we can form a tight lower bounding metric for Euclidean and DynamicTime Warping distance and hence efficiently query by content.

Atomic wedgie: efficient query filtering for streaming time series,Li Wei; Eamonn Keogh; Helga Van Herle; Agenor Mafra-Neto,In many applications; it is desirable to monitor a streaming time series for predefinedpatterns. In domains as diverse as the monitoring of space telemetry; patient intensive caredata; and insect populations; where data streams at a high rate and the number ofpredefined patterns is large; it may be impossible for the comparison algorithm to keep up.We propose a novel technique that exploits the commonality among the predefined patternsto allow monitoring at higher bandwidths; while maintaining a guarantee of no falsedismissals.

Clustering of streaming time series is meaningless,Jessica Lin; Eamonn Keogh; Wagner Truppel,Abstract Time series data is perhaps the most frequently encountered type of data examinedby the data mining community. Clustering is perhaps the most frequently used data miningalgorithm; being useful in it's own right as an exploratory technique; and also as asubroutine in more complex data mining algorithms such as rule discovery; indexing;summarization; anomaly detection; and classification. Given these two facts; it is hardlysurprising that time series clustering has attracted much attention. The data to be clusteredcan be in one of two formats: many individual time series; or a single time series; from whichindividual time series are extracted with a sliding window. Given the recent explosion ofinterest in streaming data and online algorithms; the latter case has received much attention.In this work we make a surprising claim.

Streaming time series summarization using user-defined amnesic functions,Themis Palpanas; Michail Vlachos; Eamonn Keogh; Dimitrios Gunopulos,The past decade has seen a wealth of research on time series representations. The vastmajority of research has concentrated on representations that are calculated in batch modeand represent each value with approximately equal fidelity. However; the increasingdeployment of mobile devices and real time sensors has brought home the need forrepresentations that can be incrementally updated; and can approximate the data withfidelity proportional to its age. The latter property allows us to answer queries about therecent past with greater precision; since in many domains recent information is more usefulthan older information. We call such representations amnesic. While there has beenprevious work on amnesic representations; the class of amnesic functions possible wasdictated by the representation itself.

Discovering the intrinsic cardinality and dimensionality of time series using MDL,Bing Hu; Thanawin Rakthanmanon; Yuan Hao; Scott Evans; Stefano Lonardi; Eamonn Keogh,Most algorithms for mining or indexing time series data do not operate directly on theoriginal data; but instead they consider alternative representations that include transforms;quantization; approximation; and multi-resolution abstractions. Choosing the bestrepresentation and abstraction level for a given task/dataset is arguably the most critical stepin time series data mining. In this paper; we investigate techniques to discover the naturalintrinsic representation model; dimensionality and alphabet cardinality of a time series. Theability to discover these intrinsic features has implications beyond selecting the bestparameters for particular algorithms; as characterizing data in such a manner is useful in itsown right and an important sub-routine in algorithms for classification; clustering and outlierdiscovery.

The great time series classification bake off: a review and experimental evaluation of recent algorithmic advances,Anthony Bagnall; Jason Lines; Aaron Bostrom; James Large; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract In the last 5 years there have been a large number of new time series classificationalgorithms proposed in the literature. These algorithms have been evaluated on subsets ofthe 47 data sets in the University of California; Riverside time series classification archive.The archive has recently been expanded to 85 data sets; over half of which have beendonated by researchers at the University of East Anglia. Aspects of previous evaluationshave made comparisons between algorithms difficult. For example; several differentprogramming languages have been used; experiments involved a single train/test split andsome used normalised data whilst others did not.

However; the problem of finding structure and regularities in largeimage datasets is an area in which data mining is beginning to make fundamentalcontributions. In this work; we consider the new problem of discovering shape motifs; whichare approximately repeated shapes within (or between) image collections.

Finding time series motifs in disk-resident data,Abdullah Mueen; Eamonn Keogh; Nima Bigdely-Shamlo,Time series motifs are sets of very similar subsequences of a long time series. They are ofinterest in their own right; and are also used as inputs in several higher-level data miningalgorithms including classification; clustering; rule-discovery and summarization. In spite ofextensive research in recent years; finding exact time series motifs in massive databases isan open problem. Previous efforts either found approximate motifs or considered relativelysmall datasets residing in main memory. In this work; we describe for the first time a disk-aware algorithm to find exact time series motifs in multi-gigabyte databases which containon the order of tens of millions of time series. We have evaluated our algorithm on datasetsfrom diverse areas including medicine; anthropology; computer networking and imageprocessing and show that we can find interesting and meaningful motifs in datasets that …,Data Mining; 2009.

In this paper weconsider how to efficiently evaluate trajectory joins; ie; how to identify all pairs of similartrajectories between two datasets. Our approach represents an object trajectory as asequence of symbols (ie; a string). Based on special lower-bounding distances between twostrings; we propose a pruning heuristic for reducing the number of trajectory pairs that needto be examined. Furthermore; we present an indexing scheme designed to support efficientevaluation of string similarities in secondary storage.

Finding time series discords based on haar transform,Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Oscar Tat-Wing Leung; Eamonn Keogh; Jessica Lin,Abstract The problem of finding anomaly has received much attention recently. However;most of the anomaly detection algorithms depend on an explicit definition of anomaly; whichmay be impossible to elicit from a domain expert. Using discords as anomaly detectors isuseful since less parameter setting is required. Keogh et al proposed an efficient method forsolving this problem. However; their algorithm requires users to choose the word size for thecompression of subsequences. In this paper; we propose an algorithm which candynamically determine the word size for compression. Our method is based on someproperties of the Haar wavelet transformation. Our experiments show that this method ishighly effective.,International Conference on Advanced Data Mining and Applications,2006,50

In theproposed algorithm; we map the problem of the best matching subsequence to the problemof a cheapest path in a DAG (directed acyclic graph). The proposed approach allows us toalso compute the optimal scale and translation of time series values; which is a nontrivialproblem in the case of subsequence matching.,Data Mining; Fifth IEEE International Conference on,2005,50
DTW-D: time series semi-supervised learning from a single example,Yanping Chen; Bing Hu; Eamonn Keogh; Gustavo EAPA Batista,Abstract Classification of time series data is an important problem with applications invirtually every scientific endeavor. The large research community working on time seriesclassification has typically used the UCR Archive to test their algorithms. In this work weargue that the availability of this resource has isolated much of the research community fromthe following reality; labeled time series data is often very difficult to obtain. The obvioussolution to this problem is the application of semi-supervised learning; however; as we shallshow; direct applications of off-the-shelf semi-supervised learning algorithms do not typicallywork well for time series. In this work we explain why semi-supervised learning algorithmstypically fail for time series problems; and we introduce a simple but very effective fix.

Efficiently finding arbitrarily scaled patterns in massive time series databases,Eamonn Keogh,Abstract The problem of efficiently finding patterns in massive time series databases hasattracted great interest; and; at least for the Euclidean distance measure; may now beregarded as a solved problem. However in recent years there has been an increasingawareness that Euclidean distance is inappropriate for many real world applications. Thelimitations of Euclidean distance stems from the fact that it is very sensitive to distortions inthe time axis. A partial solution to this problem; Dynamic Time Warping (DTW); aligns thetime axis before calculating the Euclidean distance. However; DTW can only address theproblem of local scaling. As we demonstrate in this work; uniform scaling may be just asimportant in many domains; including applications as diverse as bioinformatics; spacetelemetry monitoring and motion editing for computer animation.

Fast motion capture matching with replicated motion editing,Marc Cardle; Michail Vlachos; Stephen Brooks; Eamonn Keogh; Dimitrios Gunopulos,The possibility of storing large quantities of human motion capture; or 'mocap'; has resultedin a growing demand for content-based retrieval of motion sequences without usingannotations or other meta-data. We address the issue of rapidly retrieving perceptuallysimilar occurrences of a particular motion in a long mocap sequence or unstructured mocapdatabase for the purpose of replicating editing operations with minimal user-input. One ormore editing operations on a given motion are made to affect all similar matching motions.This general approach is applied to standard mocap editing operations such astimewarping; filtering or motion-warping. The style of interaction lies between automationand complete user control. Unlike recent mocap synthesis systems [1]; where new motion isgenerated by searching for plausible transitions between motion segments; our method …,ACM SIGGRAPH,2003,43
Accelerating dynamic time warping clustering with a novel admissible pruning strategy,Nurjahan Begum; Liudmila Ulanova; Jun Wang; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Clustering time series is a useful operation in its own right; and an importantsubroutine in many higher-level data mining analyses; including data editing for classifiers;summarization; and outlier detection. While it has been noted that the general superiority ofDynamic Time Warping (DTW) over Euclidean Distance for similarity search diminishes aswe consider ever larger datasets; as we shall show; the same is not true for clustering. Thus;clustering time series under DTW remains a computationally challenging task. In this work;we address this lethargy in two ways. We propose a novel pruning strategy that exploits bothupper and lower bounds to prune off a large fraction of the expensive distance calculations.This pruning strategy is admissible; giving us provably identical results to the brute forcealgorithm; but is at least an order of magnitude faster.

Manifold clustering of shapes,Dragomir Yankov; Eamonn Keogh,Shape clustering can significantly facilitate the automatic labeling of objects present inimage collections. For example; it could outline the existing groups of pathological cells in abank of cyto-images; the groups of species on photographs collected from certain aerials; orthe groups of objects observed on surveillance scenes from an office building. Here wedemonstrate that a nonlinear projection algorithm such as Isomap can attract togethershapes of similar objects; suggesting the existence of isometry between the shape spaceand a low dimensional nonlinear embedding. Whenever there is a relatively small amount ofnoise in the data; the projection forms compact; convex clusters that can easily be learnedby a subsequent partitioning scheme.

An augmented visual query mechanism for finding patterns in time series data,Eamonn Keogh; Harry Hochheiser; Ben Shneiderman,Abstract Relatively few query tools exist for data exploration and pattern identification in timeseries data sets. In previous work we introduced Timeboxes. Timeboxes are rectangular;direct-manipulation queries for studying time-series datasets. We demonstrated howTimeboxes can be used to support interactive exploration via dynamic queries; along withoverviews of query results and drag-and-drop support for query-by-example. In this paper;we extend our work by introducing Variable Time Timeboxes (VTT). VTTs are a naturalgeneralization of Timeboxes; which permit the specification of queries that allow a degree ofuncertainty in the time axis. We carefully motivate the need for these more expressivequeries; and demonstrate the utility of our approach on several data sets.,International Conference on Flexible Query Answering Systems,2002,39
Beyond one billion time series: indexing and mining very large time series collections with $ $ i $ $ sax2+,Alessandro Camerra; Jin Shieh; Themis Palpanas; Thanawin Rakthanmanon; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract There is an increasingly pressing need; by several applications in diverse domains;for developing techniques able to index and mine very large collections of time series.Examples of such applications come from astronomy; biology; the web; and other domains. Itis not unusual for these applications to involve numbers of time series in the order ofhundreds of millions to billions.

On the non-trivial generalization of dynamic time warping to the multi-dimensional case,Mohammad Shokoohi-Yekta; Jun Wang; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract In the last decade; Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) has emerged as the distancemeasure of choice for virtually all time series data mining applications. This is the result ofsignificant progress in improving DTW's efficiency; and multiple empirical studies showingthat DTW-based classifiers at least equal the accuracy of all their rivals across dozens ofdatasets. Thus far; most of the research has considered only the one-dimensional case; withpractitioners generalizing to the multi-dimensional case in one of two ways. In general; itappears the community believes either that the two ways are equivalent; or that the choice isirrelevant. In this work; we show that this is not the case.

In this work we investigate algorithms to find such rare motifs.

Given this; the last sixty years have seen many research efforts on this task. Todate; however; none of this research has had a lasting impact. In this work; we explain thislack of progress.

In contrast; weshow that pseudo-acoustic optical sensors can produce vastly superior data; that we canexploit additional features; both intrinsic and extrinsic to the insect's flight behavior; and …,Journal of insect behavior,2014,35
Discovery of meaningful rules in time series,Mohammad Shokoohi-Yekta; Yanping Chen; Bilson Campana; Bing Hu; Jesin Zakaria; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract The ability to make predictions about future events is at the heart of much ofscience; so; it is not surprising that prediction has been a topic of great interest in the datamining community for the last decade. Most of the previous work has attempted to predict thefuture based on the current value of a stream. However; for many problems the actual valuesare irrelevant; whereas the shape of the current time series pattern may foretell the future.The handful of research efforts that consider this variant of the problem have met with limitedsuccess. In particular; it is now understood that most of these efforts allow the discovery ofspurious rules. We believe the reason why rule discovery in real-valued time series hasfailed thus far is because most efforts have more or less indiscriminately applied the ideas ofsymbolic stream rule discovery to real-valued rule discovery.

The few attempts at clustering timeseries streams have been shown to be objectively incorrect in some cases; and in othercases shown to work only on the most contrived synthetic datasets by carefully adjusting alarge set of parameters.

Ensembles of nearest neighbor forecasts,Dragomir Yankov; Dennis DeCoste; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Nearest neighbor forecasting models are attractive with their simplicity and theability to predict complex nonlinear behavior. They rely on the assumption that observationssimilar to the target one are also likely to have similar outcomes. A common practice innearest neighbor model selection is to compute the globally optimal number of neighbors ona validation set; which is later applied for all incoming queries. For certain queries; however;this number may be suboptimal and forecasts that deviate a lot from the true realizationcould be produced. To address the problem we propose an alternative approach of trainingensembles of nearest neighbor predictors that determine the best number of neighbors forindividual queries. We demonstrate that the forecasts of the ensembles improve significantlyon the globally optimal single predictors.,European Conference on Machine Learning,2006,33

In the traditional sense;contrast-set mining identifies attributes; values and instances that differ significantly acrossgroups; and helps user understand the differences between groups of data. We reformulatethe notion of contrast-sets for time series data; and define it to be the key pattern (s) that aremaximally different from the other set of data. We propose a fast and exact algorithm to findthe contrast sets; and demonstrate its utility in several diverse domains; ranging fromindustrial to anthropology.

We propose an algorithmthat automatically determines a subsequence b′ of a target time series b that best matchesa query series a. In the proposed algorithm we map the problem of the best matchingsubsequence to the problem of a cheapest path in a DAG (directed acyclic graph). Ourexperimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the commonlyused Dynamic Time Warping in retrieval accuracy.,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2005,31

Faster and more accurate classification of time series by exploiting a novel dynamic time warping averaging algorithm,François Petitjean; Germain Forestier; Geoffrey I Webb; Ann E Nicholson; Yanping Chen; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract A concerted research effort over the past two decades has heralded significantimprovements in both the efficiency and effectiveness of time series classification. Theconsensus that has emerged in the community is that the best solution is a surprisinglysimple one. In virtually all domains; the most accurate classifier is the nearest neighboralgorithm with dynamic time warping as the distance measure. The time complexity ofdynamic time warping means that successful deployments on resource-constrained devicesremain elusive. Moreover; the recent explosion of interest in wearable computing devices;which typically have limited computational resources; has greatly increased the need forvery efficient classification algorithms. A classic technique to obtain the benefits of thenearest neighbor algorithm; without inheriting its undesirable time and space complexity …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2016,29
A novel approximation to dynamic time warping allows anytime clustering of massive time series datasets,Qiang Zhu; Gustavo Batista; Thanawin Rakthanmanon; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Given the ubiquity of time series data; the data mining community has spentsignificant time investigating the best time series similarity measure to use for various tasksand domains. After more than a decade of extensive efforts; there is increasing evidence thatDynamic Time Warping (DTW) is very difficult to beat. Given that; recent efforts have focusedon making the intrinsically slow DTW algorithm faster. For the similarity-search task; animportant subroutine in many data mining algorithms; significant progress has been madeby replacing the vast majority of expensive DTW calculations with cheap-to-compute lowerbound calculations. However; these lower bound based optimizations do not directly applyto clustering; and thus for some realistic problems; clustering with DTW can take days orweeks. In this work; we show that we can mitigate this untenable lethargy by casting DTW …,*,2012,29
SIGKDD demo: sensors and software to allow computational entomology; an emerging application of data mining,Gustavo E Batista; Eamonn J Keogh; Agenor Mafra-Neto; Edgar Rowton,Abstract The history of humankind is intimately connected to insects. Insect borne diseaseskill a million people and destroy tens of billions of dollars worth of crops annually. However;at the same time; beneficial insects pollinate the majority of crop species; and it has beenestimated that approximately one third of all food consumed by humans is directly pollinatedby bees alone. Given the importance of insects in human affairs; it is somewhat surprisingthat computer science has not had a larger impact in entomology. We believe that recentadvances in sensor technology are beginning change this; and a new field of ComputationalEntomology will emerge. We will demonstrate an inexpensive sensor that allows us tocapture data from flying insects; and the software that allows us to analyze the data.Moreover; we will distribute both the sensors and software for free; to parties willing to …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2011,28
Configurable cache subsetting for fast cache tuning,Pablo Viana; Ann Gordon-Ross; Eamonn Keogh; Edna Barros; Frank Vahid,Abstract Numerous variations of configurable caches; having variable parameters like totalsize; line size; and associativity; have been proposed in commercial microprocessors inrecent years. Tuning a configurable cache to a target application has been shown to reducememory-access power by over 50%. However; searching the configuration space for thebest configuration can require much time or power; even when using recent cache tuningheuristics. We sought to determine; for a particular domain of applications; the smallestsubset of cache configurations that would still enable effective tuning. For a suite of 34benchmarks and a cache with 18 possible configurations; we determine through anexhaustive search of all possible subsets; that only 3 or 4 candidate configurations arenecessary to support tuning.

Data editing techniques to allow the application of distance-based outlier detection to streams,Vit Niennattrakul; Eamonn Keogh; Chotirat Ann Ratanamahatana,The problem of finding outliers in data has broad applications in areas as diverse as datacleaning; fraud detection; network monitoring; invasive species monitoring; etc. While thereare dozens of techniques that have been proposed to solve this problem for static datacollections; very simple distance-based outlier detection methods are known to becompetitive or superior to more complex methods. However; distance-based methods havetime and space complexities that make them impractical for streaming data and/or resourcelimited sensors. In this work; we show that simple data-editing techniques can makedistance-based outlier detection practical for very fast streams and resource limited sensors.Our technique generalizes to produce two algorithms; which; relative to the originalalgorithm; can guarantee to produce no false positives; or guarantee to produce no false …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2010 IEEE 10th International Conference on,2010,26

Matrix profile I: all pairs similarity joins for time series: a unifying view that includes motifs; discords and shapelets,Chin-Chia Michael Yeh; Yan Zhu; Liudmila Ulanova; Nurjahan Begum; Yifei Ding; Hoang Anh Dau; Diego Furtado Silva; Abdullah Mueen; Eamonn Keogh,The all-pairs-similarity-search (or similarity join) problem has been extensively studied fortext and a handful of other datatypes. However; surprisingly little progress has been madeon similarity joins for time series subsequences. The lack of progress probably stems fromthe daunting nature of the problem. For even modest sized datasets the obvious nested-loopalgorithm can take months; and the typical speed-up techniques in this domain (ie; indexing;lower-bounding; triangular-inequality pruning and early abandoning) at best produce one ortwo orders of magnitude speedup.

Classification of multi-dimensional streaming time series by weighting each classifier's track record,Bing Hu; Yanping Chen; Jesin Zakaria; Liudmila Ulanova; Eamonn Keogh,Extensive research on time series classification in the last decade has produced fast andaccurate algorithms for the single-dimensional case. However; the increasing prevalence ofinexpensive sensors has reinforced the need for algorithms to handle multi-dimensionaltime series. For example; modern smartphones have at least a dozen sensors capable ofproducing streaming time series; and hospital-based (and increasingly; home-based)medical devices can produce time series streams from more than twenty sensors. The twomost common ways to generalize from single to multi-dimensional data are to use all thestreams or just the single best stream as determined at training time. However; as we showhere; both approaches can be very brittle. Moreover; neither approach exploits theobservation that different sensors may be considered" experts" on different classes.

A MPAA-based iterative clustering algorithm augmented by nearest neighbors search for time-series data streams,Jessica Lin; Michai Vlachos; Eamonn Keogh; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Jianwei Liu; Shoujian Yu; Jiajin Le,Abstract In streaming time series the Clustering problem is more complex; since the dynamicnature of streaming data makes previous clustering methods inappropriate. In this paper; wepropose firstly a new method to evaluate Clustering in streaming time series databases.First; we introduce a novel multi-resolution PAA (MPAA) transform to achieve our iterativeclustering algorithm. The method is based on the use of a multi-resolution piecewiseaggregate approximation representation; which is used to extract features of time series.Then; we propose our iterative clustering approach for streaming time series. We takeadvantage of the multiresolution property of MPPA and equip a stopping criteria based onHoeffding bound in order to achieve fast response time.

A disk-aware algorithm for time series motif discovery,Abdullah Mueen; Eamonn Keogh; Qiang Zhu; Sydney S Cash; M Brandon Westover; Nima Bigdely-Shamlo,Abstract Time series motifs are sets of very similar subsequences of a long time series. Theyare of interest in their own right; and are also used as inputs in several higher-level datamining algorithms including classification; clustering; rule-discovery and summarization. Inspite of extensive research in recent years; finding time series motifs exactly in massivedatabases is an open problem. Previous efforts either found approximate motifs orconsidered relatively small datasets residing in main memory. In this work; we leverage offprevious work on pivot-based indexing to introduce a disk-aware algorithm to find timeseries motifs exactly in multi-gigabyte databases which contain on the order of tens ofmillions of time series. We have evaluated our algorithm on datasets from diverse areasincluding medicine; anthropology; computer networking and image processing and show …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2011,22
Towards automatic classification on flying insects using inexpensive sensors,Gustavo EAPA Batista; Yuan Hao; Eamonn Keogh; Agenor Mafra-Neto,Insects are intimately connected to human life and well being; in both positive and negativesenses. While it is estimated that insects pollinate at least two-thirds of the all foodconsumed by humans; malaria; a disease transmitted by the female mosquito of theAnopheles genus; kills approximately one million people per year. Due to the importance ofinsects to humans; researchers have developed an arsenal of mechanical; chemical;biological and educational tools to help mitigate insects' harmful effects; and to enhancetheir beneficial effects. However; the efficiency of such tools depends on knowing the timeand location of migrations/infestations/population as early as possible. Insect detection andcounting is typically performed by means of traps; usually" sticky traps"; which are regularlycollected and manually analyzed.

Annotating historical archives of images,Xiaoyue Wang; Lexiang Ye; Eamonn Keogh; Christian Shelton,Abstract Recent initiatives like the Million Book Project and Google Print Library Project havealready archived several million books in digital format; and within a few years a significantfraction of world's books will be online. While the majority of the data will naturally be text;there will also be tens of millions of pages of images. Many of these images will defyautomation annotation for the foreseeable future; but a considerable fraction of the imagesmay be amiable to automatic annotation by algorithms that can link the historical image witha modern contemporary; with its attendant metatags. In order to perform this linking we musthave a suitable distance measure which appropriately combines the relevant features ofshape; color; texture and text. However the best combination of these features will vary fromapplication to application and even from one manuscript to another.

Dot plots for time series analysis,Dragomir Yankov; Eamonn Keogh; Stefano Lonardi,Since their introduction in the seventies by Gibbs and McIntyre; dot plots have proved to be apowerful and intuitive technique for visual sequence analysis and mining. Their maindomain of application is the field of bioinformatics where they are frequently used byresearchers in order to elucidate genomic sequence similarities and alignment. However;this useful technique has remained comparatively constrained to domains where the datahas an inherent discrete structure (ie; text). In this paper we demonstrate how dot plots canbe used for the analysis and mining of real-valued time series. We design a tool that createshighly descriptive dot plots which allow one to easily detect similarities; anomalies; reversesimilarities; and periodicities well as changes in the frequencies of repetitions. As theunderlying algorithm scales we with the input size; we also show the feasibility of the plots …,Tools with Artificial Intelligence; 2005. ICTAI 05. 17th IEEE International Conference on,2005,21

Generalizing DTW to the multi-dimensional case requires an adaptive approach,Mohammad Shokoohi-Yekta; Bing Hu; Hongxia Jin; Jun Wang; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract In recent years Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) has emerged as the distancemeasure of choice for virtually all time series data mining applications. For example; virtuallyall applications that process data from wearable devices use DTW as a core sub-routine.This is the result of significant progress in improving DTW's efficiency; together with multipleempirical studies showing that DTW-based classifiers at least equal (and generally surpass)the accuracy of all their rivals across dozens of datasets. Thus far; most of the research hasconsidered only the one-dimensional case; with practitioners generalizing to the multi-dimensional case in one of two ways; dependent or independent warping. In general; itappears the community believes either that the two ways are equivalent; or that the choice isirrelevant. In this work; we show that this is not the case.

Polishing the right apple: Anytime classification also benefits data streams with constant arrival times,Jin Shieh; Eamonn Keogh,Classification of items taken from data streams requires algorithms that operate in timesensitive and computationally constrained environments. Often; the available time forclassification is not known a priori and may change as a consequence of externalcircumstances. Many traditional algorithms are unable to provide satisfactory performancewhile supporting the highly variable response times that exemplify such applications. In suchcontexts; anytime algorithms; which are amenable to trading time for accuracy; have beenfound to be exceptionally useful and constitute an area of increasing research activity.Previous techniques for improving anytime classification have generally been concernedwith optimizing the probability of correctly classifying individual objects.

Mining massive archives of mice sounds with symbolized representations,Jesin Zakaria; Sarah Rotschafer; Abdullah Mueen; Khaleel Razak; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Many animals produce long sequences of vocalizations best described as “songs.”In some animals; such as crickets and frogs; these songs are relatively simple and repetitivechirps or trills. However; animals as diverse as whales; bats; birds and even the humblemice considered here produce intricate and complex songs. These songs are worthy ofstudy in their own right. For example; the study of bird songs has helped to cast light onvarious questions in the nature vs. nurture debate. However; there is a particular reason whythe study of mice songs can benefit mankind. The house mouse (Mus musculus) has longbeen an important model organism in biology and medicine; and it is by far the mostcommonly used genetically altered laboratory mammal to address human diseases.

Mosquito borne diseases kill millions of people and insect pests consume and destroyaround US $40 billion worth of food each year. In contrast; insects pollinate at least two-thirds of all the food consumed in the world. In order to control populations of diseasevectors and agricultural pests; researchers in entomology have developed numerousmethods including chemical; biological and mechanical approaches. However; without theknowledge of the exact location of the insects; the use of these techniques becomes costlyand inefficient. We are developing a novel sensor as a tool to control disease vectors andagricultural pests.

Fast best-match shape searching in rotation-invariant metric spaces,Dragomir Yankov; Eamonn Keogh; Li Wei; Xiaopeng Xi; Wendy Hodges,Object recognition and content-based image retrieval systems rely heavily on the accurateand efficient identification of 2-D shapes. Features such as color; texture; positioning etc.;are insufficient to convey the information that could be obtained through shape analysis. Afundamental requirement in this analysis is that shape similarities are computed invariantlyto basic geometric transformations; eg; scaling; shifting; and most importantly; rotations. Andwhile scale and shift invariance are easily achievable through a suitable shaperepresentation; rotation invariance is much harder to deal with. In this work; we explore themetric properties of the rotation-invariant distance measures and propose an algorithm forfast similarity search in the shape space. The algorithm can be utilized in a number ofimportant data mining tasks such as shape clustering and classification; or for discovering …,IEEE Transactions on multimedia,2008,17
Scalable clustering of time series with u-shapelets,Liudmila Ulanova; Nurjahan Begum; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract A recently introduced primitive for time series data mining; unsupervised shapelets(u-shapelets); has demonstrated significant potential for time series clustering. In contrast toapproaches that consider the entire time series to compute pairwise similarities; the u-shapelets technique allows considering only relevant subsequences of time series.Moreover; u-shapelets allow us to bypass the apparent chicken-and-egg paradox of definingrelevant with reference to the clustering itself. U-shapelets have several advantages overrival methods. First; they are defined even when the time series are of different lengths; forexample; they allow clustering datasets containing a mixture of single heartbeats and multi-beat ECG recordings. Second; u-shapelets mitigate sensitivity to irrelevant data such asnoise; spikes; dropouts; etc. Finally; u-shapelets demonstrated ability to provide …,*,2015,16
Applying machine learning and audio analysis techniques to insect recognition in intelligent traps,Diego F Silva; Vinicius MA De Souza; Gustavo EAPA Batista; Eamonn Keogh; Daniel PW Ellis,Throughout the history; insects have had an intimate relationship with humanity; bothpositive and negative.

Multimedia retrieval using time series representation and relevance feedback,Chotirat Ann Ratanamahatana; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Multimedia data is ubiquitous and is involved in almost every aspect of our lives.Likewise; much of the world's data is in the form of time series; and as will be shown; manyother types of data; such as video; image; and handwriting; can be transformed into timeseries. This fact has fueled enormous interest in time series retrieval in the database anddata mining community. However; much of this work's narrow focus on efficiency andscalability has come at the cost of usability and effectiveness. In this work; we explore theutility of the multimedia data transformation into a much simpler one-dimensional time seriesrepresentation. With this time series data; we can exploit the capability of Dynamic TimeWarping; which results in a more accurate retrieval.

Towards never-ending learning from time series streams,Yuan Hao; Yanping Chen; Jesin Zakaria; Bing Hu; Thanawin Rakthanmanon; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Time series classification has been an active area of research in the data miningcommunity for over a decade; and significant progress has been made in the tractability andaccuracy of learning. However; virtually all work assumes a one-time training session inwhich labeled examples of all the concepts to be learned are provided. This assumptionmay be valid in a handful of situations; but it does not hold in most medical and scientificapplications where we initially may have only the vaguest understanding of what conceptscan be learned. Based on this observation; we propose a never-ending learning frameworkfor time series in which an agent examines an unbounded stream of data and occasionallyasks a teacher (which may be a human or an algorithm) for a label.

Most of the data in historical manuscripts is text; but there is also a significant fractiondevoted to images. This fact has driven much of the recent increase in interest in query-by-content systems for images. While querying/indexing systems can undoubtedly be useful;we believe that the historical manuscript domain is finally ripe for true unsuperviseddiscovery of patterns and regularities. To this end; we introduce an efficient and scalablesystem which can detect approximately repeated occurrences of shape patterns both withinand between historical texts. We show that this ability to find repeated shapes allowsautomatic annotation of manuscripts; and allows users to trace the evolution of ideas.

Autocannibalistic and anyspace indexing algorithms with applications to sensor data mining,Lexiang Ye; Xiaoyue Wang; Eamonn Keogh; Agenor Mafra-Neto,Abstract Efficient indexing is at the heart of many data mining algorithms. A simple andextremely effective algorithm for indexing under any metric space was introduced in 1991 byOrchard. Orchard's algorithm has not received much attention in the data mining anddatabase community because of a fatal flaw; it requires quadratic space. In this work weshow that we can produce a reduced version of Orchard's algorithm that requires much lessspace; but produces nearly identical speedup. We achieve this by casting the algorithm inan anyspace framework; allowing deployed applications to take as much of an index as theirmain memory/sensor can afford. As we shall demonstrate; this ability to create an anyspacealgorithm also allows us to create auto-cannibalistic algorithms.

However; in some domains; forexample seismology; there is an insatiable need to address even larger datasets.

Monitoring and mining animal sounds in visual space,Yuan Hao; Bilson Campana; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Monitoring animals by the sounds they produce is an important and challengingtask; whether the application is outdoors in a natural habitat; or in the controlled environmentof a laboratory setting.

In the latter case; researchers often create control andtreatment groups of animals; expose them to different interventions; and test for differentoutcomes. One possible manifestation of different outcomes may be changes in thebioacoustics of the animals. With such a plethora of important applications; there have beensignificant efforts to build bioacoustic classification tools. However; we argue that mostcurrent tools are severely limited.

Efficiently finding unusual shapes in large image databases,Li Wei; Eamonn Keogh; Xiaopeng Xi; Melissa Yoder,Abstract Among the visual features of multimedia content; shape is of particular interestbecause humans can often recognize objects solely on the basis of shape.

We motivate the problemby considering the utility of shape discords in diverse domains including zoology;microscopy; anthropology; and medicine. While the brute force search algorithm hasquadratic time complexity; we avoid this untenable lethargy by using locality-sensitivehashing to estimate similarity between shapes which enables us to reorder the search moreefficiently and thus extract the maximum benefit from an admissible pruning strategy we …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2008,13

In the original space; the function outlines the boundaries ofhigher density regions; naturally splitting the data into individual clusters. The method;however; though theoretically sound; has certain drawbacks which make it not so appealingto the practitioner. Namely; it is unstable in the presence of outliers and it is hard to controlthe number of clusters that it identifies. Parametrizing the algorithm incorrectly in noisysettings; can either disguise some objectively present clusters in the data; or can identify alarge number of small and nonintuitive clusters.

Since all natural motiontypically has some variability in the time axis; Dynamic Time Warping (DTW); a techniquethat aligns the motion streams before calculating their similarity; is typically used. However;DTW can only address the problem of local scaling. As we demonstrate in this work; uniformscaling may be just as important for meaningful automatic analysis of video surveillancedata streams. In this work; we demonstrate a novel technique to index of similarity searchunder uniform scaling. As we will demonstrate; our technique is simple and intuitive; and …,First ACM SIGMM international workshop on Video surveillance,2003,13
Ensemble-index: A new approach to indexing large databases,Eamonn Keogh; Selina Chu; Michael Pazzani,Abstract The problem of similarity search (query-by-content) has attracted much researchinterest. It is a difficult problem because of the inherently high dimensionality of the data. Themost promising solutions involve performing dimensionality reduction on the data; thenindexing the reduced data with a multidimensional index structure. Many dimensionalityreduction techniques have been proposed; including Singular Value Decomposition (SVD);the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT); the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and PiecewisePolynomial Approximation. In this work; we introduce a novel framework for usingensembles of two or more representations for more efficient indexing. The basic idea is thatinstead of committing to a single representation for an entire dataset; differentrepresentations are chosen for indexing different parts of the database.

A minimum description length technique for semi-supervised time series classification,Nurjahan Begum; Bing Hu; Thanawin Rakthanmanon; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract In recent years the plunging costs of sensors/storage have made it possible toobtain vast amounts of medical telemetry; both in clinical settings and more recently; even inpatient's own homes. However for this data to be useful; it must be annotated. Thisannotation; requiring the attention of medical experts is very expensive and time consuming;and remains the critical bottleneck in medical analysis. The technique of Semi-supervisedlearning is the obvious way to reduce the need for human labor; however; most suchalgorithms are designed for intrinsically discrete objects such as graphs or strings; and donot work well in this domain; which requires the ability to deal with real-valued objectsarriving in a streaming fashion.

Grid-based indexing for large time series databases,Jiyuan An; Hanxiong Chen; Kazutaka Furuse; Nobuo Ohbo; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Similarity search in large time series databases is an interesting and challengingproblem. Because of the high dimensional nature of the data; the difficulties associated withdimensionality curse arise. The most promising solution is to use dimensionality reduction;and construct a multi-dimensional index structure for the reduced data. In this work weintroduce a new approach called grid-based Datawise Dimensionality Reduction (DDR)which attempts to preserve the characteristics of time series. We then apply quantization toconstruct an index structure.

Diversifying query results on semi-structured data,Mahbub Hasan; Abdullah Mueen; Vassilis Tsotras; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Queries on the web can easily result in a large number of results. ResultDiversification; a process by which the query provides the k most diverse set of matches;enables the user to better understand/explore such large results. Computing the diversesubset from a large set of results needs a massive number of pair-wise distancecomputations as well as finding the subset that maximizes the total pair-wise distance; whichis NP-hard and requires efficient approximate algorithm. The problem becomes more difficultwhen querying semi-structured data; since diversity can occur not only in the documentcontent but also (and more importantly) in the document structure; thus one needs toefficiently measure the structural differences between results. The tree edit distance is thestandard choice but; is too expensive for large result sets. Moreover; the generalized tree …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,11
Efficient query filtering for streaming time series with applications to semisupervised learning of time series classifiers,Li Wei; Eamonn Keogh; Helga Van Herle; Agenor Mafra-Neto; Russell J Abbott,Abstract In this paper; we define time series query filtering; the problem of monitoring thestreaming time series for a set of predefined patterns. This problem is of great practicalimportance given the massive volume of streaming time series available through sensors;medical patient records; financial indices and space telemetry. Since the data may arrive ata high rate and the number of predefined patterns can be relatively large; it may beimpossible for the comparison algorithm to keep up. We propose a novel technique thatexploits the commonality among the predefined patterns to allow monitoring at higherbandwidths; while maintaining a guarantee of no false dismissals. Our approach is based onthe widely used envelope-based lower-bounding technique. As we will demonstrate onextensive experiments in diverse domains; our approach achieves tremendous …,Knowledge and information systems,2007,11
Efficient discovery of unusual patterns in time series,Stefano Lonardi; Jessica Lin; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract The problem of finding a specified pattern in a time series database (ie; query bycontent) has received much attention and is now a relatively mature field. In contrast; theimportant problem of enumerating all surprising or interesting patterns has received far lessattention. This problem requires a meaningful definition of “surprise”; and an efficient searchtechnique. All previous attempts at finding surprising patterns in time series use a verylimited notion of surprise; and/or do not scale to massive datasets. To overcome theselimitations we propose a novel technique that defines a pattern surprising if the frequency ofits occurrence differs substantially from that expected by chance; given some previouslyseen data. This notion has the advantage of not requiring the user to explicitly define what isa surprising pattern; which may be hard; or perhaps impossible; to elicit from a domain …,New Generation Computing,2006,11
Extracting optimal performance from dynamic time warping,Abdullah Mueen; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a distance measure that compares two time seriesafter optimally aligning them. DTW is being used for decades in thousands of academic andindustrial projects despite the very expensive computational complexity; O (n 2). Theseapplications include data mining; image processing; signal processing; robotics andcomputer graphics among many others. In spite of all this research effort; there are manymyths and misunderstanding about DTW in the literature; for example" it is too slow to beuseful" or" the warping window size does not matter much." In this tutorial; we correct thesemisunderstandings and we summarize the research efforts in optimizing both the efficiencyand effectiveness of both the basic DTW algorithm; and of the higher-level algorithms thatexploit DTW such as similarity search; clustering and classification.

Using the minimum description length to discover the intrinsic cardinality and dimensionality of time series,Bing Hu; Thanawin Rakthanmanon; Yuan Hao; Scott Evans; Stefano Lonardi; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Many algorithms for data mining or indexing time series data do not operate directlyon the raw data; but instead they use alternative representations that include transforms;quantization; approximation; and multi-resolution abstractions. Choosing the bestrepresentation and abstraction level for a given task/dataset is arguably the most critical stepin time series data mining. In this work; we investigate the problem of discovering the naturalintrinsic representation model; dimensionality and alphabet cardinality of a time series. Theability to automatically discover these intrinsic features has implications beyond selectingthe best parameters for particular algorithms; as characterizing data in such a manner isuseful in its own right and an important sub-routine in algorithms for classification; clusteringand outlier discovery. We will frame the discovery of these intrinsic features in the Minimal …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2015,10
Mother fugger: mining historical manuscripts with local color patches,Qiang Zhu; Eamonn Keogh,Initiatives such as the Google Print Library Project and the Million Book Project have alreadyarchived more than ten million books in digital format; and within the next decade themajority of world's books will be online. Although most of the data will naturally be text; therewill also be tens of millions of pages of images; many in color. While there is an activeresearch community pursuing data mining of text from historical manuscripts; there has beenvery little work that exploits the rich color information which is often present. In this work weintroduce a simple color measure which both addresses and exploits typical features ofhistorical manuscripts. To enable the efficient mining of massive archives; we propose a tightlower bound to the measure. Beyond the fast similarity search; we show how this lowerbound allows us to build several higher-level data mining tools; including motif discovery …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2010 IEEE 10th International Conference on,2010,10

In this paper a probabilisticapproach is taken to this problem.

Converting non-parametric distance-based classification to anytime algorithms,Xiaopeng Xi; Ken Ueno; Eamonn Keogh; Dah-Jye Lee,Abstract For many real world problems we must perform classification under widely varyingamounts of computational resources. For example; if asked to classify an instance takenfrom a bursty stream; we may have anywhere from several milliseconds to several minutesto return a class prediction. For such problems an anytime algorithm may be especiallyuseful. In this work we show how we convert the ubiquitous nearest neighbor classifier intoan anytime algorithm that can produce an instant classification; or if given the luxury ofadditional time; can continue computations to increase classification accuracy. Wedemonstrate the utility of our approach with a comprehensive set of experiments on datafrom diverse domains. We further show the utility of our work with two deployed applications;in classifying and counting fish; and in classifying insects.,Pattern Analysis and Applications,2008,9

Reliable early classification of time series based on discriminating the classes over time,Usue Mori; Alexander Mendiburu; Eamonn Keogh; Jose A Lozano,Abstract The goal of early classification of time series is to predict the class value of asequence early in time; when its full length is not yet available. This problem arises naturallyin many contexts where the data is collected over time and the label predictions have to bemade as soon as possible. In this work; a method based on probabilistic classifiers isproposed for the problem of early classification of time series. An important feature of thismethod is that; in its learning stage; it discovers the timestamps in which the predictionaccuracy for each class begins to surpass a pre-defined threshold. This threshold is definedas a percentage of the accuracy that would be obtained if the full series were available; andit is defined by the user. The class predictions for new time series will only be made in thesetimestamps or later. Furthermore; when applying the model to a new time series; a class …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2017,8
SIMPle: Assessing music similarity using subsequences joins,Diego F Silva; Chin-Chin M Yeh; Gustavo Enrique de Almeida Prado Alves Batista; Eamonn Keogh,Most algorithms for music information retrieval are based on the analysis of the similaritybetween feature sets extracted from the raw audio. A common approach to assessingsimilarities within or between recordings is by creating similarity matrices. However; thisapproach requires quadratic space for each comparison and typically requires a costly post-processing of the matrix. In this work; we propose a simple and efficient representationbased on a subsequence similarity join; which may be used in several music informationretrieval tasks. We apply our method to the cover song recognition problem and demonstratethat it is superior to state-of-the-art algorithms. In addition; we demonstrate how theproposed representation can be exploited for multiple applications in music processing.,International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference; XVII,2016,8
Instruction set extensions for dynamic time warping,Joseph Tarango; Eamonn Keogh; Philip Brisk,Processor specialization through application-specific instruction set customization cansignificantly improve performance while reducing energy. Due to the costs associated withsemiconductor fabrication; specialized processors are only viable for products with highproduction volumes. The emergence of low-cost sensor-based computing products in recentyears has created an urgent need to process time-series data with the utmost efficiency.Although most sensor data is fixed-point; the normalization process-an absolute necessityfor highly accurate similarity search of time-series data-converts the data to floating-point inorder to avoid a loss in precision. The sensors that collect time-series data are typicallyconnected to low-power microcontrollers or RISC processors sans floating point units.

An Augmented Visual Query Mechanism for Finding Patterns in Time Series Data (2002),Eamonn Keogh; Harry Hochheiser; Ben Shneiderman,Relatively few query tools exist for data exploration and pattern identification in time seriesdata sets. In previous work we introduced Timeboxes. Timeboxes are rectangular; direct-manipulation queries for studying time-series datasets. We demonstrated how Timeboxescan be used to support interactive exploration via dynamic queries; along with overviews ofquery results and drag-and-drop support for query-by-example. In this paper; we extend ourwork by introducing Variable Time Timeboxes (VTT). VTTs are a natural generalization ofTimeboxes; which permit the specification of queries that allow a degree of uncertainty in thetime axis. We carefully motivate the need for these more expressive queries; anddemonstrate the utility of our approach on several data sets.,*,2005,8

Efficient long-term degradation profiling in time series for complex physical systems,Liudmila Ulanova; Tan Yan; Haifeng Chen; Guofei Jiang; Eamonn Keogh; Kai Zhang,Abstract The long term operation of physical systems inevitably leads to their wearing out;and may cause degradations in performance or the unexpected failure of the entire system.To reduce the possibility of such unanticipated failures; the system must be monitored for tell-tale symptoms of degradation that are suggestive of imminent failure. In this work; weintroduce a novel time series analysis technique that allows the decomposition of the timeseries into trend and fluctuation components; providing the monitoring software withactionable information about the changes of the system's behavior over time. We analyzethe underlying problem and formulate it to a Quadratic Programming (QP) problem that canbe solved with existing QP-solvers. However; when the profiling resolution is high; asgenerally required by real-world applications; such a decomposition becomes intractable …,Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2015,7
Flying insect detection and classification with inexpensive sensors,Yanping Chen; Adena Why; Gustavo Batista; Agenor Mafra-Neto; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract An inexpensive; noninvasive system that could accurately classify flying insectswould have important implications for entomological research; and allow for thedevelopment of many useful applications in vector and pest control for both medical andagricultural entomology. Given this; the last sixty years have seen many research effortsdevoted to this task. To date; however; none of this research has had a lasting impact. In thiswork; we show that pseudo-acoustic optical sensors can produce superior data; thatadditional features; both intrinsic and extrinsic to the insect's flight behavior; can be exploitedto improve insect classification; that a Bayesian classification approach allows to efficientlylearn classification models that are very robust to over-fitting; and a general classificationframework allows to easily incorporate arbitrary number of features.

Data Mining a Trillion Time Series Subsequences Under Dynamic Time Warping.,Thanawin Rakthanmanon; Eamonn J Keogh,Abstract Most time series data mining algorithms use similarity search as a core subroutine;and thus the time taken for similarity search is the bottleneck for virtually all time series datamining algorithms. The difficulty of scaling search to large datasets largely explains whymost academic work on time series data mining has plateaued at considering a few millionsof time series objects; while much of industry and science sits on billions of time seriesobjects waiting to be explored. In this work we show that by using a combination of fournovel ideas we can search and mine truly massive time series for the first time. Wedemonstrate the following extremely unintuitive fact; in large datasets we can exactly searchunder DTW much more quickly than the current state-of-the-art Euclidean distance searchalgorithms.

Classification of live moths combining texture; color and shape primitives,Gustavo EAPA Batista; Bilson Campana; Eamonn Keogh,Each year; insect-borne diseases kill more than one million people; and harmful insectsdestroy tens of billions of dollars worth of crops and livestock. At the same time; beneficialinsects pollinate three-quarters of all food consumed by humans. Given the extraordinaryimpact of insects on human life; it is somewhat surprising that machine learning has madevery little impact on understanding (and hence; controlling) insects. In this work we discusswhy this is the case; and argue that a confluence of facts make the time ripe for machinelearning research to reach out to the entomological community and help them solve someimportant problems. As a concrete example; we show how we can solve an importantclassification problem in commercial entomology by leveraging off recent progress in shape;color and texture measures.,Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA); 2010 Ninth International Conference on,2010,7
Compression-Based Data Mining.,Eamonn J Keogh; Li Keogh; John Handley,Compression-based datamining is auniversal approach to clustering; classification;dimensionality reduction; and anomaly detection. It is motivated by results in bioinformatics;learning; and computational theory that are not well known outside those communities. It isbased on an easily computed compression dissimilarity measure (CDM) between objectsobtained by compression. The basic concept is easy to understand; but its foundations arerigorously formalized in information theory. The similarity between any two objects (XMLfiles; time series; text strings; molecules; etc.) can be obtained using a universal losslesscompressor. The compression dissimilarity measure is the size of the compressedconcatenation of the two objects divided by the sum of the compressed sizes of each of theobjects. The intuition is that if two objects are similar; lossless compressor will remove the …,*,2009,7

The trajectory visually captures the nucleotide content of each sequence;allowing for fast and easy visualization of long DNA sequences. Then; we project the relativeplacement of the trajectories on the 2D plane using a spanning-tree arrangement method;which allows the efficient comparison of multiple sequences.

The kNN query is one of thehardest problems on multi-dimensional data. It has been shown analytically andexperimentally that any algorithm using hierarchical index structure based on either space-or data-partitioning is less efficient than the naive method of sequentially checking everydata record (called the sequential scan) in high-dimensional spaces [4]. Some datadistributions including the uniform distribution are particularly hard cases [1].

Accelerating the discovery of unsupervised-shapelets,Jesin Zakaria; Abdullah Mueen; Eamonn Keogh; Neal Young,Abstract Over the past decade; time series clustering has become an increasingly importantresearch topic in data mining community. Most existing methods for time series clusteringrely on distances calculated from the entire raw data using the Euclidean distance orDynamic Time Warping distance as the distance measure. However; the presence ofsignificant noise; dropouts; or extraneous data can greatly limit the accuracy of clustering inthis domain. Moreover; for most real world problems; we cannot expect objects from thesame class to be equal in length. As a consequence; most work on time series clusteringonly considers the clustering of individual time series “behaviors;” eg; individual heart beatsor individual gait cycles; and contrives the time series in some way to make them all equal inlength. However; automatically formatting the data in such a way is often a harder …,Data mining and knowledge discovery,2016,5

The asymmetric approximate anytime join: A new primitive with applications to data mining,Lexiang Ye; Xiaoyue Wang; Dragomir Yankov; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract It has long been noted that many data mining algorithms can be built on top of joinalgorithms. This has lead to a wealth of recent work on efficiently supporting such joins withvarious indexing techniques. However; there are many applications which are characterizedby two special conditions; firstly the two datasets to be joined are of radically different sizes;a situation we call an asymmetric join. Secondly; the two datasets are not; and possibly cannot be indexed for some reason. In such circumstances the time complexity is proportional tothe product of the number of objects in each of the two datasets; an untenable proposition inmost cases. In this work we make two contributions to mitigate this situation. We argue thatfor many applications; an exact solution to the problem is not required; and we show that byframing the problem as an anytime algorithm we can extract most of the benefit of a join in …,*,2008,5

The utility of Intelligent Icons can be further enhanced by arranging them on thescreen in a way that reflects their similarity/differences.

Prefix and suffix invariant dynamic time warping,Diego F Silva; Gustavo EAPA Batista; Eamonn Keogh,While there exist a plethora of classification algorithms for most data types; there is anincreasing acceptance that the unique properties of time series mean that the combination ofnearest neighbor classifiers and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is very competitive across ahost of domains; from medicine to astronomy to environmental sensors. While there hasbeen significant progress in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of DTW in recentyears; in this work we demonstrate that an underappreciated issue can significantly degradethe accuracy of DTW in real-world deployments. This issue has probably escaped theattention of the very active time series research community because of its reliance on statichighly contrived benchmark datasets; rather than real world dynamic datasets where theproblem tends to manifest itself.

Semi-supervision dramatically improves time series clustering under dynamic time warping,Hoang Anh Dau; Nurjahan Begum; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract The research community seems to have converged in agreement that for timeseries classification problems; Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)-based nearest-neighborclassifiers are exceptionally hard to beat. Obtaining the best performance from DTW requiressetting its only parameter; the warping window width (w). This is typically set by crossvalidation in the training stage. However; for clustering; by definition we do not have accessto such labeled data. This issue seems to have been largely ignored in the literature; withmany practitioners simply assuming that" the larger the better" for the value of w; and usingas large a value of w as computational resources permit. In this work we show that this is anaive approach which in most circumstances produces inferior clusterings. To address thisproblem; we introduce a novel semi-supervised technique that allows us to set the best …,Proceedings of the 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2016,4
Classification of streaming time series under more realistic assumptions,Bing Hu; Yanping Chen; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Much of the vast literature on time series classification makes several assumptionsabout data and the algorithm's eventual deployment that are almost certainly unwarranted.For example; many research efforts assume that the beginning and ending points of thepattern of interest can be correctly identified; during both the training phase and laterdeployment. Another example is the common assumption that queries will be made at aconstant rate that is known ahead of time; thus computational resources can be exactlybudgeted. In this work; we argue that these assumptions are unjustified; and this has inmany cases led to unwarranted optimism about the performance of the proposed algorithms.As we shall show; the task of correctly extracting individual gait cycles; heartbeats; gestures;behaviors; etc.; is generally much more difficult than the task of actually classifying those …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2016,4
Establishing the provenance of historical manuscripts with a novel distance measure,Bing Hu; Thanawin Rakthanmanon; Bilson JL Campana; Abdullah Mueen; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract The recent digitization of more than 20 million books has been led by initiativesfrom countries wishing to preserve their cultural heritage and by several commercialendeavors; including the Google Print Library Project. It is expected that within a few years asignificant fraction of the world's books will be online. However; for millions of completebooks and tens of millions of loose pages; the provenance of the manuscripts may becompletely unknown or disputed; thus denying historians an understanding of the context inwhich the content was created. In a handful of cases; it may be possible for experts to regainthe provenance by examining linguistic; cultural and/or stylistic clues. However; such expertsare a rarity and these investigations are time-consuming and expensive.

Resultados Preliminares na Classificaç ao de Insetos Utilizando SensoresOpticos,Diego F Silva; Gustavo E Batista; Eamonn Keogh; Agenor Mafra-Neto,Abstract. In this work we present a low-cost optical sensor to automatically count and classifydisease vector insects in real time. We show that although the counting task is relativelystraightforward; the insect classification in species is more elaborated and requires theidentification of attributes in data. We evaluate two attributes: the wing-beat frequency andthe circadian rhythm; as well as we present additional attributes that can be incorporated tothe classifiers in future research. Our results are promising; with data collected with threeinsect species; we were able to classify them with accuracy higher than 90%.

Using CAPTCHAs to index cultural artifacts,Qiang Zhu; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Rock art; human-made markings on stone; is an important cultural artifact and theearliest expression of abstract thinking. While there are tens of millions of photographs ofrock art in existence; there have been no large-scale attempts to organize; classify or clusterthem. This omission is not due to a lack of interest; but reflects the extraordinary difficultly ofextracting useful data from an incredibly heterogeneous and noisy dataset. As we shallshow; rock art is likely to resist efforts of automatic extraction from images for a long time. Inthis work we show that we can use CAPTCHAs; puzzles designed to tell humans andcomputers apart; to segment and index rock art. Unlike other CAPTCHAs which operate oninherently discrete data and expect discrete responses; our method considers inherentlyreal-valued data and expects real-valued responses. This creates a challenge which we …,International Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis,2010,4
TS2-tree-an efficient similarity based organization for trajectory data,Petko Bakalov; Eamonn Keogh; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract The increasingly popular GPS technology and the growing amount of trajectorydata it generates create the need for developing applications that efficiently store and querytrajectories of moving objects. In this paper we introduce TS2 tree; a novel indexing structurefor organizing trajectory data based on similarity between trajectories. TS2 tree provideslower and upper bounds on distance between trajectories; based on which we propose ageneral framework for effectively answering a wide range of similarity-based trajectoryqueries such as similarity threshold (ST) query and similarity best fit (SBF) query. Themultifold reduction in query computation times and the number of I/O operations isdemonstrated through an extensive experimental evaluation.,Proceedings of the 15th annual ACM international symposium on Advances in geographic information systems,2007,4

Finding or not finding rules in time series,Jessica Lin; Eamonn Keogh,Given the recent explosion of interest in streaming data and online algorithms; clustering oftime series subsequences has received much attention. In this work we make a surprisingclaim. Clustering of time series subsequences is completely meaningless. More concretely;clusters extracted from these time series are forced to obey a certain constraint that ispathologically unlikely to be satisfied by any dataset; and because of this; the clustersextracted by any clustering algorithm are essentially random. While this constraint can beintuitively demonstrated with a simple illustration and is simple to prove; it has neverappeared in the literature. We can justify calling our claim surprising; since it invalidates thecontribution of dozens of previously published papers. We will justify our claim with atheorem; illustrative examples; and a comprehensive set of experiments on …,*,2004,4
Matrix Profile III: The Matrix Profile Allows Visualization of Salient Subsequences in Massive Time Series,Chin-Chia Michael Yeh; Helga Van Herle; Eamonn Keogh,Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) is one of the most versatile tools used for exploratory datamining. It allows a first glimpse of possible structure in the data; which can inform the choiceof analyses used. Its uses are multiple. It can give the user an idea as to the cluster ability orlinear separability of the data. It can help spot outliers; or can hint at the intrinsicdimensionality of the data. Moreover; it can sometimes reveal unexpected latent dimensionsin the data. With all these uses; MDS is increasingly used in areas as diverse as marketing;medicine; genetics; music and linguistics. One of the strengths of MDS is that it is essentiallyagnostic to data type; as we can use any distance measure to create the distance matrix;which is the only required input to the MDS algorithm. In spite of this generality; we make thefollowing claim. MDS is not (well) defined for an increasingly important data type; time …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on,2016,3
Clustering of symbols using minimal description length,Oben M Tataw; Thanawin Rakthanmanon; Eamonn J Keogh,The clustering of glyphs (individual letters/characters/symbols) is typically the first step indocument processing algorithms and a critical enabling technology for most historicaldocument indexing techniques. In this work; we take a step back from currentdomain/language specialized research efforts to consider the problem from an agnosticperspective. In particular; we claim that; independent of the distance measure used; anymethod that attempts to cluster all the data is almost certainly doomed to failure. We explainthis observation; and introduce a clustering method based on Minimum Description Length(MDL) that can overcome it.,Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR); 2013 12th International Conference on,2013,3
Towards discovering the intrinsic cardinality and dimensionality of time series using MDL,Bing Hu; Thanawin Rakthanmanon; Yuan Hao; Scott Evans; Stefano Lonardi; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Most algorithms for mining or indexing time series data do not operate directly onthe original data; but instead they consider alternative representations that includetransforms; quantization; approximation; and multi-resolution abstractions. Choosing thebest representation and abstraction level for a given task/dataset is arguably the most criticalstep in time series data mining. In this paper; we investigate techniques that discover thenatural intrinsic representation model; dimensionality and alphabet cardinality of a timeseries. The ability to discover these intrinsic features has implications beyond selecting thebest parameters for particular algorithms; as characterizing data in such a manner is usefulin its own right and an important sub-routine in algorithms for classification; clustering andoutlier discovery.

Efficiently Finding Near Duplicate Figures in Archives of Historical Documents.,Thanawin Rakthanmanon; Qiang Zhu; Eamonn J Keogh,Abstract The increasing interest in archiving all of humankind's cultural artifacts has resultedin the digitization of millions of books; and soon a significant fraction of the world's books willbe online. Most of the data in historical manuscripts is text; but there is also a significantfraction devoted to images. This fact has driven much of the recent increase in interest inquery-by-content systems for images. While querying/indexing systems can undoubtedly beuseful; we believe that the historical manuscript domain is finally ripe for true unsuperviseddiscovery of patterns and regularities. To this end; we introduce an efficient and scalablesystem that can detect approximately repeated occurrences of shape patterns both withinand between historical texts. We show that this ability to find repeated shapes allowsautomatic annotation of manuscripts; and allows users to trace the evolution of ideas. We …,Journal of Multimedia,2012,3
Clustering time series using unsupervised-shapelets,Jesin Zakaria Abdullah Mueen; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract—Time series clustering has become an increasingly important research topic overthe past decade. Most existing methods for time series clustering rely on distancescalculated from the entire raw data using the Euclidean distance or Dynamic Time Warpingdistance as the distance measure. However; the presence of significant noise; dropouts; orextraneous data can greatly limit the accuracy of clustering in this domain. Moreover; formost real world problems; we cannot expect objects from the same class to be equal inlength. As a consequence; most work on time series clustering only considers the clusteringof individual time series “behaviors;” eg; individual heart beats or individual gait cycles; andcontrives the time series in some way to make them all equal in length. However; contrivingthe data in such a way is often a harder problem than the clustering itself. In this work; we …,International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM),2012,3

Augmenting historical manuscripts with automatic hyperlinks,Xiaoyue Wang; Eamonn Keogh,Hyperlinks are so useful for searching and browsing modern digital collections thatresearchers have longer wondered if it is possible to retroactively add hyperlinks to digitizedhistorical documents. There has already been significant research into this endeavor forhistorical text; however; in this work we consider the problem of adding hyperlinks amonggraphic elements. While such a system would not have the ubiquitous utility of text-basedhyperlinks; as we will show; there are several domains where it can significantly augmenttextual information. While OCR of historical text is known to be a difficult problem; the actualwords themselves are inherently discrete. Thus; two words are either identical or not. Thismeans that off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms; including semi-supervised learning;can be easily used. However; as we shall demonstrate; semi-supervised learning does …,Multimedia; 2009.

Multiresolution clustering of time series and application to images,Jessica Lin; Michail Vlachos; Eamonn Keogh; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Summary. Clustering is vital in the process of condensing and outlining information; since it canprovide a synopsis of the stored data. However; the high dimensionality of multime- dia datatoday presents an insurmountable challenge for clustering algorithms. Based on the well-knownfact that time series and image histograms can both be represented accurately in a lower resolutionusing orthonormal decompositions; we present an anytime version of the k-means algorithm.The algorithm works by leveraging off the multiresolution property of wavelets. The dilemmaof choosing the initial centers for k-means is mitigated by assign- ing the final centers at eachapproximation level as the initial centers for the subsequent; finer approximation. In additionto casting k-means as an anytime algorithm; our approach has two other very desirableproperties. We observe that even by working at coarser ap- proximations; the achieved …,*,2007,3
(Not) Finding Rules in Time Series: A Surprising Result with Implications for Previous and Future Research,Jessica Lin; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Time series data is perhaps the most frequently encountered type of data examinedby the data mining community. Clustering is perhaps the most frequently used data miningalgorithm; being useful in it's own right as an exploratory technique; and also as asubroutine in more complex data mining algorithms such as rule discovery; indexing;summarization; anomaly detection; and classification. Given these two facts; it is hardlysurprising that time series clustering has attracted much attention. The data to be clusteredcan be in one of two formats: many individual time series; or a single time series; from whichindividual time series are extracted with a sliding window. Given the recent explosion ofinterest in streaming data and online algorithms; the latter case has received much attention.In this work we make a surprising claim.

Generating Synthetic Data to Allow Learning from a Single Exemplar per Class,Liudmila Ulanova; Yuan Hao; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Recent years have seen an explosion in the volume of historical documents placedonline.

Ashuman transcription is prohibitively expensive; recent efforts focused on human/computercooperative transcription: a human annotates a small fraction of a text to provide labeleddata for recognition algorithms. Such a system naturally begs the question of how much datamust the human label? In this work we show that we can do well even if the human labelsonly a single instance from each class.

Why the lack of reproducibility is crippling research in data mining and what you can do about it,Eamonn Keogh,Abstract In this talk I will make a strong and potentially controversial claim. The majority ofpapers published in the best data mining conferences make no contribution. The reason forthis is that in most cases; no one; including the original authors can reproduce the findings inthe papers. As I shall argue; non-reproducible results are the same as no results at all. Theirreproducibility of results may be explicit; the refusal to share data or to give parametersettings; or implicit; the effort to reproduce may be so great that the authors ensure that noone will ever try.,Proceedings of the 8th international workshop on Multimedia data mining:(associated with the ACM SIGKDD 2007),2007,2
Using relevance feedback to learn both the distance measure and the query in multimedia databases,Chotirat Ann Ratanamahatana; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Much of the world's data is in the form of time series; and many other types of data;such as video; image; and handwriting; can easily be transformed into time series. This facthas fueled enormous interest in time series retrieval in the database and data miningcommunity. However; much of this work's narrow focus on efficiency and scalability hascome at the cost of usability and effectiveness. Here; we introduce a general framework thatlearns a distance measure with arbitrary constraints on the warping path of the DynamicTime Warping calculation. We demonstrate utility of our approach on both classification andquery retrieval tasks for time series and other types of multimedia data; then show that itsincorporating into the relevance feedback system and query refinement can further improvethe precision/recall by a wide margin.,International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems,2005,2

Exploiting a novel algorithm and GPUs to break the ten quadrillion pairwise comparisons barrier for time series motifs and joins,Yan Zhu; Zachary Zimmerman; Nader Shakibay Senobari; Chin-Chia Michael Yeh; Gareth Funning; Abdullah Mueen; Philip Brisk; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Time series motifs are approximately repeated subsequences found within a longertime series. They have been in the literature since 2002; but recently they have begun toreceive significant attention in research and industrial communities. This is perhaps due tothe growing realization that they implicitly offer solutions to a host of time series problems;including rule discovery; anomaly detection; density estimation; semantic segmentation;summarization; etc. Recent work has improved the scalability so exact motifs can becomputed on datasets with up to a million data points in tenable time.

Generating synthetic time series to augment sparse datasets,Germain Forestier; François Petitjean; Hoang Anh Dau; Geoffrey I Webb; Eamonn Keogh,In machine learning; data augmentation is the process of creating synthetic examples inorder to augment a dataset used to learn a model. One motivation for data augmentation isto reduce the variance of a classifier; thereby reducing error. In this paper; we propose newdata augmentation techniques specifically designed for time series classification; where thespace in which they are embedded is induced by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). The mainidea of our approach is to average a set of time series and use the average time series as anew synthetic example. The proposed methods rely on an extension of DTW BarycentricAveraging (DBA); the averaging technique that is specifically developed for DTW.

First; most methods require setting/learning many parameters and thus may haveproblems generalizing to novel situations. Second; most methods implicitly assume that allthe data is segmentable; and have difficulty when that assumption is unwarranted. Finally;most research efforts have been confined to the batch case; but online segmentation isclearly more useful and actionable.

A General Framework for Density Based Time Series Clustering Exploiting a Novel Admissible Pruning Strategy,Nurjahan Begum; Liudmila Ulanova; Hoang Anh Dau; Jun Wang; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract: Time Series Clustering is an important subroutine in many higher-level data mininganalyses; including data editing for classifiers; summarization; and outlier detection. It is wellknown that for similarity search the superiority of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) overEuclidean distance gradually diminishes as we consider ever larger datasets. However; aswe shall show; the same is not true for clustering. Clustering time series under DTW remainsa computationally expensive operation. In this work; we address this issue in two ways. Wepropose a novel pruning strategy that exploits both the upper and lower bounds to prune offa very large fraction of the expensive distance calculations. This pruning strategy isadmissible and gives us provably identical results to the brute force algorithm; but is at leastan order of magnitude faster.

In some situations it is not only possible to digitally sense someaspects of the world; but to physically capture a tangible aspect of that world. Currentlydeployed examples include devices that can capture water/air samples; and devices thatcapture individual insects or fish.

A general framework for never-ending learning from time series streams,Yanping Chen; Yuan Hao; Thanawin Rakthanmanon; Jesin Zakaria; Bing Hu; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Time series classification has been an active area of research in the data miningcommunity for over a decade; and significant progress has been made in the tractability andaccuracy of learning. However; virtually all work assumes a one-time training session inwhich labeled examples of all the concepts to be learned are provided. This assumptionmay be valid in a handful of situations; but it does not hold in most medical and scientificapplications where we initially may have only the vaguest understanding of what conceptscan be learned. Based on this observation; we propose a never-ending learning frameworkfor time series in which an agent examines an unbounded stream of data and occasionallyasks a teacher (which may be a human or an algorithm) for a label. We demonstrate theutility of our ideas with experiments that consider real-world problems in domains as …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2015,1

Instance-Based Learning,Eamonn Keogh,A proposed theory that the immune system is capable of achieving immunological memoryby the existence of a mutually reinforcing network of B-cells. Tis network of B-cells forms dueto the ability of the paratopes; located on B-cells; to match against the idiotopes on other B-cells. Te binding between the idiotopes and paratopes has the effect of stimulating the B-cells. Tis is because the paratopes on B-cells react to the idiotopes on similar B-cells; as itwould an antigen. However; to counter the reaction there is a certain amount of suppressionbetween the B-cells which acts as a regulatory mechanism. Tis interaction of the B-cells dueto the network was said to contribute to a stable memory structure and account for theretainment of memory cells; even in the absence of antigen. Tis interaction of cells forms thebasis of inspiration for a large number of AIS algorithms; for example aiNET.,*,2011,1

Automatic Construction of Typologies for Massive Collections of Projectile Points,Eamonn Keogh; Lexiang Ye; Taryn Rampley; Sang-Hee Lee,Abstract In the last few decades there have been several attempts to use computers toautomatically construct typologies (keys; classifiers; decision trees; etc) for projectile points.However; all these methods require human effort to extract the features. There are threeproblems with this. First; it is clearly not scalable to large data collections. Second; humanextraction of features is subjective; with all the attendant problems. Finally; and mostimportantly; all such attempts essentially put the cart before the horse in using preconceivedideas to build classifiers. Here we demonstrate a classification algorithm that tells us thedefining features for each class. All the user does is provide two or more labeled sets ofphotographs/drawings. Our method classifies projectile points with a high degree ofaccuracy and produces inuitive explanations as to what makes the classes different. We …,Learning,2006,1
Multi-Dimensional Trajectories for Similarity Queries,Michail Vlachos; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Eamonn Keogh; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract With the abundance of low-cost storage devices; a plethora of applications thatstore and manage very large multi-dimensional trajectories (or timeseries) datasets haveemerged recently. Examples include traffic supervision systems; video surveillanceapplications; meteorology and more. Thus; it is becoming essential to provide a robusttrajectory indexing framework designed especially for performing similarity queries in suchapplications.

A grid-based index method for time warping distance,Jiyuan An; Yi-Ping Phoebe Chen; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Recently DTW (dynamic time warping) has been recognized as the most robustdistance function to measure the similarity between two time series; and this fact hasspawned a flurry of research on this topic. Most indexing methods proposed for DTW arebased on the R-tree structure. Because of high dimensionality and loose lower bounds fortime warping distance; the pruning power of these tree structures are quite weak; resulting ininefficient search. In this paper; we propose a dimensionality reduction method motivated byobservations about the inherent character of each time series. A very compact index file isconstructed. By scanning the index file; we can get a very small candidate set; so that thenumber of page access is dramatically reduced. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ourapproach on real and synthetic datasets.,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2004,1
Time-Decaying Representations of Streaming Time Series,Themistoklis Palpanas; Michail Vlachos; Eamonn Keogh; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Wagner Truppel,Abstract. During the last years we have witnessed a wealth of research on approximaterepresentations for time series. The vast majority of the proposed approaches representeach value with approximately equal fidelity; which may not be always desirable. Forexample; mobile devices and real time sensors have brought home the need forrepresentations that can approximate the data with fidelity proportional to its age. We callsuch time-decaying representations amnesic. In this work; we introduce a novelrepresentation of time series that can represent arbitrary; user-specified time-decayingfunctions. We propose online algorithms for our representation; and discuss their properties.The algorithms we describe are designed to work on both the entire stream of data; or on asliding window of the data stream.

Using Relevance Feedback in Multimedia Databases,Chotirat Ann Ratanamahatana; Eamonn Keogh,ABSTRACT Much of the world's data is in the form of time series; and many other types ofdata; such as video; image; and handwriting; can easily be transformed into time series. Thisfact has fueled enormous interest in time series retrieval in the database and data miningcommunity. We argue; however; that much of this work's narrow focus on efficiency andscalability has come at the cost of usability and effectiveness. In this work; we introduce ageneral framework that learns a distance measure with arbitrary constraints on the warpingpath of the Dynamic Time Warping calculation. We demonstrate utility of our approach onboth classification and query retrieval tasks for time series and other types of multimediadata including images; videos; and handwriting archives.,*,*,1
Admissible Time Series Motif Discovery with Missing Data,Yan Zhu; Abdullah Mueen; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract: The discovery of time series motifs has emerged as one of the most usefulprimitives in time series data mining. Researchers have shown its utility for exploratory datamining; summarization; visualization; segmentation; classification; clustering; and rulediscovery. Although there has been more than a decade of extensive research; there is stillno technique to allow the discovery of time series motifs in the presence of missing data;despite the well-documented ubiquity of missing data in scientific; industrial; and medicaldatasets. In this work; we introduce a technique for motif discovery in the presence ofmissing data. We formally prove that our method is admissible; producing no falsenegatives. We also show that our method can piggy-back off the fastest known motifdiscovery method with a small constant factor time/space overhead. We will demonstrate …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.05472,2018,*
Time series joins; motifs; discords and shapelets: a unifying view that exploits the matrix profile,Chin-Chia Michael Yeh; Yan Zhu; Liudmila Ulanova; Nurjahan Begum; Yifei Ding; Hoang Anh Dau; Zachary Zimmerman; Diego Furtado Silva; Abdullah Mueen; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract The last decade has seen a flurry of research on all-pairs-similarity-search (orsimilarity joins) for text; DNA and a handful of other datatypes; and these systems have beenapplied to many diverse data mining problems. However; there has been surprisingly littleprogress made on similarity joins for time series subsequences. The lack of progressprobably stems from the daunting nature of the problem. For even modest sized datasets theobvious nested-loop algorithm can take months; and the typical speed-up techniques in thisdomain (ie; indexing; lower-bounding; triangular-inequality pruning and early abandoning)at best produce only one or two orders of magnitude speedup. In this work we introduce anovel scalable algorithm for time series subsequence all-pairs-similarity-search.

Matrix Profile VII: Time Series Chains: A New Primitive for Time Series Data Mining (Best Student Paper Award),Yan Zhu; Makoto Imamura; Daniel Nikovski; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract—Since their introduction over a decade ago; time series motifs have become afundamental tool for time series analytics; finding diverse uses in dozens of domains. In thiswork we introduce Time Series Chains; which are related to; but distinct from; time seriesmotifs. Informally; time series chains are a temporally ordered set of subsequence patterns;such that each pattern is similar to the pattern that preceded it; but the first and last patternsare arbitrarily dissimilar. In the discrete space; this is similar to extracting the text chain “hit;hot; dot; dog” from a paragraph. The first and last words have nothing in common; yet theyare connected by a chain of words with a small mutual difference. Time series chains cancapture the evolution of systems; and help predict the future. As such; they potentially haveimplications for prognostics.

Matrix Profile VI: Meaningful Multidimensional Motif Discovery,Chin-Chia Michael Yeh; Nickolas Kavantzas; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract—Time series motifs are approximately repeating patterns in real-valued time seriesdata. They are useful for exploratory data mining and are often used as inputs for varioustime series clustering; classification; segmentation; rule discovery; and visualizationalgorithms. Since the introduction of the first motif discovery algorithm for univariate timeseries in 2002; multiple efforts have been made to generalize motifs to the multidimensionalcase. In this work; we show that these efforts; which typically attempt to find motifs on alldimensions; will not produce meaningful motifs except in the most contrived situations. Weexplain this finding and introduce mSTAMP; an algorithm that allows meaningful discoveryof multidimensional motifs. Beyond producing objectively and subjectively meaningfulresults; our algorithm has a host of additional advantages; including being much faster …,2017 IEEE 17th International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM),2017,*

Judicious Setting of Dynamic Time Warping’s Window Width Allows More Accurate Classification of Time Series,Hoang Anh Dau; Diego Furtado Silva; François Petitjean; Germain Forestier; Anthony Bagnall; Eamonn Keogh,Nearest-Neighbor Classification algorithm is regarded as a strong baseline for time seriesclassification; in recent years there has been a plethora of algorithms that have claimed tobe able to improve upon its accuracy in the general case. Many of these proposed ideassacrifice the simplicity of implementation that DTW-based classifiers offer for rather modestgains. Nevertheless; there are clearly times when even a small improvement could make alarge difference in an important medical or financial domain. In this work; we make anunexpected claim; an underappreciated “low hanging fruit” in optimizing DTW's performancecan produce improvements that make it an even stronger baseline; closing most or all theimprovement gap of the more sophisticated methods.

Matrix profile IV: using weakly labeled time series to predict outcomes,Chin-Chia Michael Yeh; Nickolas Kavantzas; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract In academic settings over the last decade; there has been significant progress intime series classification. However; much of this work makes assumptions that are simplyunrealistic for deployed industrial applications. Examples of these unrealistic assumptionsinclude the following: assuming that data subsequences have a single fixed-length; areprecisely extracted from the data; and are correctly labeled according to their membership ina set of equal-size classes. In real-world industrial settings; these patterns can be of differentlengths; the class annotations may only belong to a general region of the data; may containerrors; and finally; the class distribution is typically highly skewed. Can we learn from suchweakly labeled data? In this work; we introduce SDTS; a scalable algorithm that can learn insuch challenging settings.

Query Suggestion to allow Intuitive Interactive Search in Multidimensional Time Series,Yifei Ding; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract In recent years; the research community; inspired by its success in dealing withsingle-dimensional time series; has turned its attention to dealing with multidimensional timeseries. There are now a plethora of techniques for indexing; classification; and clustering ofmultidimensional time series. However; we argue that the difficulty of exploratory search inlarge multidimensional time series remains underappreciated. In essence; the problemreduces to the" chicken-and-egg" paradox that it is difficult to produce a meaningful querywithout knowing the best subset of dimensions to use; but finding the best subset ofdimensions is itself query dependent. In this work we propose a solution to this problem.

Clustering in the Face of Fast Changing Streams,Liudmila Ulanova; Nurjahan Begum; Mohammad Shokoohi-Yekta; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Clustering is arguably the most important primitive for data mining; finding use as asubroutine in many higher-order algorithms. In recent years; the community has redirectedits attention from the batch case to the online case. This need to support online clustering isengendered by the proliferation of cheap ubiquitous sensors that continuously monitorvarious aspects of our world; from heartbeats as we exercise to the number of mosquitoesvisiting a well in a village in Ethiopia. In this work; we argue that current online clusteringsolutions offer a room for improvement. To some degree they all have at least one of thefollowing shortcomings: they are parameter-laden; only defined for certain distancefunctions; sensitive to outliers; and/or they are approximate. This last point requiresclarification; in some sense almost all clustering algorithms are approximate. For example …,*,2016,*

Accelerating Dynamic Time Warping Clustering with a Novel Admissible Pruning Strategy,Nurjahan Begum Liudmila Ulanova Jun Wang; Eamonn Keogh,ABSTRACT Clustering time series is a useful operation in its own right; and an importantsubroutine in many higher-level data mining analyses; including data editing for classifiers;summarization; and outlier detection. While it has been noted that the general superiority ofDynamic Time Warping (DTW) over Euclidean Distance for similarity search diminishes aswe consider ever larger datasets; as we shall show; the same is not true for clustering. Thus;clustering time series under DTW remains a computationally challenging task. In this work;we address this lethargy in two ways. We propose a novel pruning strategy that exploits bothupper and lower bounds to prune off a large fraction of the expensive distance calculations.This pruning strategy is admissible; giving us provably identical results to the brute forcealgorithm; but is at least an order of magnitude faster.

Getting your acceptance rate to 80%: a checklist for publishing,Eamonn Keogh,Abstract SIGMOD acceptance rates have generally been in the narrow range of between 14to 18 percent during the past decade. However; for given individuals the range is muchwider. Some people have a zero percent acceptance rate; after five or six frustratinglyunsuccessful attempts they set their sights lower (or; more pessimistically; they fail to gettenure and stop trying). Many people have acceptance rates that reflect the SIGMODaverage of about 20%. Are there people that have perfect acceptance rates? In this talk Iargue that while a perfect acceptance rate is essentially impossible to achieve year afteryear; an 80% acceptance rate is possible for top conferences.

Naturally; most of the data in historical manuscripts is text; but there is also a largeamount devoted to images. This observation is responsible for the dramatic increase ininterest in query-by-content systems for historical documents. While querying/indexingsystems can be useful; we believe that this domain is finally ready for unsuperviseddiscovery of patterns. With this in mind; we introduce an efficient and scalable technique thatcan detect approximately repeated occurrences of images both within and betweenhistorical texts. We demonstrate that this ability to find repeated shapes allows us to doautomatic annotation of manuscripts. We show the utility of our technique on datasets datingback to the fourteenth century.,Proceedings of the 2011 Workshop on Historical Document Imaging and Processing,2011,*

We have seen the future; and it is symbolic,Eamonn Keogh; Jessica Lin; Stefano Lonardi; Bill Chiu,Many high level representations of time series have been proposed for data mining. Onerepresentation that the data mining community has not considered in detail is thediscretization of the original data into symbolic strings. At first glance this seems a surprisingoversight. There is an enormous wealth of existing algorithms and data structures that allowthe efficient manipulations of strings. Such algorithms have received decades of attention inthe text retrieval community; and more recent attention from the bioinformatics community.Some simple examples of tools that are not defined for real-valued sequences but aredefined for symbolic approaches include hashing; Markov models; suffix trees; decisiontrees etc. There is; however; a simple explanation for the data mining communitys lack ofinterest in string manipulation as a supporting technique for mining time series.

Proc. Fifth International Conference on Flexible Query Answering Systems (October 27-29; 2002; Copenhagen; Denmark); Springer-Verlag; in the series Lecture Not...,E Keogh; H Hochheiser; B Shneiderman,Relatively few query tools exist for data exploration and pattern identifi-cation in time seriesdata sets. In previous work we introduced Timeboxes. Time-boxes are rectangular; direct-manipulation queries for studying time-series datasets. We demonstrated how Timeboxescan be used to support interactive exploration via dynamic queries; along with overviews ofquery results and drag-and-drop support for query-by-example. In this paper; we extend ourwork by introducing Variable Time Timeboxes (VTT). VTTs are a natural generalization ofTimeboxes; which permit the specification of queries that allow a degree of uncertainty in thetime axis. We carefully motivate the need for these more expressive queries; and demon-strate the utility of our approach on several data sets.,Proc.

Algorithms for Learning Augmented Bayesian Classifiers,Eamonn J Keogh; Michael J Pazzani,Abstract. The naïve Bayes classifier is built on the assumption of conditional independencebetween the attributes given the class. The algorithm has been shown to be surprisinglyrobust to obvious violations of this condition; but it is natural to ask if it is possible to furtherimprove the accuracy by relaxing this assumption. We examine an approach where naïveBayes is augmented by the addition of correlation arcs between attributes. We explore twomethods for finding the set of augmenting arcs; a greedy hill-climbing search; and a novel;more computationally efficient algorithm that we call SuperParent. We compare thesemethods to TAN; a state-of the-art distribution-based approach to finding the augmentingarcs.,Proceedings of Seventh International Workshop on AI and Statistics,1999,*

Generalized Dynamic Time Warping: Unleashing the Warping Power Hidden in Point-Wise Distances,Rodica Neamtu; Ramoza Ahsan; Elke A Rundensteiner; Gabor Sarkozy; Eamonn Keogh; Hoang Anh Dau; Cuong Nguyen; Charles Lovering,Abstract—Domain-specific distances preferred by analysts for exploring similarities amongtime series tend to be “point-topoint” distances. Unfortunately; this point-wise nature limitstheir ability to perform meaningful comparisons between sequences of different lengths andwith temporal mis-alignments. Analysts instead need “elastic” alignment tools such asDynamic Time Warping (DTW) to perform such flexible comparisons. However; the existingalignment tools are limited in that they do not incorporate diverse distances. To address thisshortcoming; our work introduces the first conceptual framework called GeneralizedDynamic Time Warping (GDTW) that supports now alignment (warping) of a large array ofdomain-specific distances in a uniform manner. While the classic DTW and its priorextensions focus on the Euclidean Distance; our GDTW is the first method that …,*,*,*

Detecting Time Series Motifs Under Uniform Scaling ABSTRACT,Dragomir Yankov; Eamonn Keogh; Jose Medina; Bill Chiu; Victor Zordan,Abstract Time series motifs are approximately repeated patterns found within the data. Suchmotifs have utility for many data mining algorithms; including rule-discovery; novelty-detection; summarization and clustering. Since the formalization of the problem and theintroduction of efficient linear time algorithms; motif discovery has been successfully appliedto many domains; including medicine; motion capture; robotics and meteorology. In this workwe show that most previous applications of time series motifs have been severely limited bythe definition's brittleness to even slight changes of uniform scaling; the speed at which thepatterns develop. We introduce a new algorithm that allows discovery of time series motifswith invariance to uniform scaling; and show that it produces objectively superior results inseveral important domains. Apart from being more general than all other motif discovery …,*,*,*

Indexing Multi-Dimensional Time-Series Michail Vlachos Computer Science Department University of California; Riverside mvlachos@ cs. ucr. edu,Eamonn Keogh; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract While most time-series data mining research has concentrated on providingsolutions for a single distance function; in this work we motivate the need for a single indexstructure that can support multiple distance measures. Our specific area of interest is theefficient retrieval and analysis of trajectory similarities. Trajectory datasets are very commonin environmental applications; mobility experiments; video surveillance and are especiallyimportant for the discovery of certain biological patterns. Our primary similarity measure isbased on the Longest Common Subsequence (LCSS) model; which offers enhancedrobustness; particularly for noisy data; which are encountered very often in real worldapplications. However; our index is able to accommodate other distance measures as well;including the ubiquitous Euclidean distance; and the increasingly popular Dynamic Time …,*,*,*

MIREX 2016: SiMPle-BASED COVER SONG IDENTIFICATION USING SMOOTHED CRP FEATURES,Diego Furtado Silva; Chin-Chia Michael Yeh; Gustavo EAPA Batista; Eamonn Keogh,ABSTRACT This document presents a solution to the Audio Cover Identification tasksubmitted to the Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange (MIREX) 2016. Ourmethod uses a recent proposed primitive to assess similarity between music recordings:Similarity Matrix Profile (SiMPle). The first step is to describe the songs by extracting ChromaDCT-Reduced log Pitch (CRP) features; which is a timbre-invariant chroma representation.Given that SiMPle is based on local similarities; we applied smoothing techniques to theCRP to provide tempo invariance. Then; we transpose one of the feature vectors in order toprovide key invariance; by applying the Optimal Transposition Index (OTI). Finally; thesimilarity between two tracks is given the median value of the SiMPle obtained by comparingthe query to the reference recording.,*,*,*

However; this problem becomes harder in the casewhere the motifs of interest are rare or when faced with a never-ending stream of data.

The Use of Suffix Tries to Detect Randomly Created Datasets,Isaac Espinoza; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract In the past suffix tries have been proven to be a useful tool for string matchingapplications. There are several instances where a lengthy stream of data is given with novisually apparent recurrences of sequences. The ability to notice these recurring sequencescan be very important when involving certain topics such as a time series or bioinformatics.This tool will also be able to be used for finding a distinction between randomly createddatasets and pseudorandomly created datasets. Randomly created datasets with nodependence relations and of equal independent probability will have no bias or tendenciesamong all of its subsequences. Pseudo-randomly created datasets; on the other hand; willhave these predispositions or tendencies and it will be more evident on the dataset's suffixtrie.

Towards a Minimum Description Length Based Stopping Criterion for Semi-Supervised Time Series Classification,Nurjahan Begum Bing Hu Thanawin Rakthanmanon; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract In the last decade the plunging costs of sensors/storage have made it possible toobtain vast amounts of medical telemetry. However for this data to be useful; it must beannotated. This annotation; requiring the attention of medical experts is very expensive andtime consuming; and remains the critical bottleneck in medical analysis. Semisupervisedlearning is an obvious way to mitigate the need for human labor; however; most suchalgorithms are designed for intrinsically discrete objects; and do not work well in thisdomain; which requires the ability to deal with real-valued objects arriving in a streamingfashion. In this work we make two contributions. First; we demonstrate that in many casesjust a handful of human annotated examples are sufficient to perform accurate classification.Second; we devise a novel parameter-free stopping criterion for semi-supervised learning …,*,*,*

Group SAX: Extending the Notion of Contrast Sets to Multimedia Data,Jessica Lin; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract In this work; we take the traditional notation of contrast sets and extend them toother data types; in particular time series and by extension; images. In the traditional sense;contrast-set mining identifies attributes; values and instances that differ significantly acrossgroups; and helps user understand the differences between groups of data. We reformulatethe notion of contrastsets for time series data; and define it to be the key pattern (s) that aremaximally different from the other set of data. We propose a fast and exact algorithm to findthe contrast sets; and demonstrate its utility in several diverse domains; ranging frommanufacturing to anthropology. We show that our algorithm achieves 3 orders of magnitudespeedup from the brute-force algorithm; while producing exact solutions.,*,*,*
