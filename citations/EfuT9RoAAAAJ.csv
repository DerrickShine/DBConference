TRBAC: A temporal role-based access control model,Elisa Bertino; Piero Andrea Bonatti; Elena Ferrari,Abstract Role-based access control (RBAC) models are receiving increasing attention as ageneralized approach to access control. Roles may be available to users at certain timeperiods; and unavailable at others. Moreover; there can be temporal dependencies amongroles. To tackle such dynamic aspects; we introduce Temporal-RBAC (TRBAC); anextension of the RBAC model. TRBAC supports periodic role enabling and disabling---possibly with individual exceptions for particular users---and temporal dependencies amongsuch actions; expressed by means of role triggers. Role trigger actions may be eitherimmediately executed; or deferred by an explicitly specified amount of time. Enabling anddisabling actions may be given a priority; which is used to solve conflicting actions. A formalsemantics for the specification language is provided; and a polynomial safeness check is …,ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC),2001,1072

We also propose a classification hierarchy that sets thebasis for analyzing the work which has been performed in this context. A detailed review ofthe work accomplished in this area is also given; along with the coordinates of each work tothe classification hierarchy. A brief evaluation is performed; and some initial conclusions aremade.,ACM Sigmod Record,2004,907
A generalized temporal role-based access control model,James BD Joshi; Elisa Bertino; Usman Latif; Arif Ghafoor,Role-based access control (RBAC) models have generated a great interest in the securitycommunity as a powerful and generalized approach to security management. In manypractical scenarios; users may be restricted to assume roles only at predefined time periods.Furthermore; roles may only be invoked on prespecified intervals of time depending uponwhen certain actions are permitted. To capture such dynamic aspects of a role; a temporalRBAC (TRBAC) model has been recently proposed. However; the TRBAC model addressesthe role enabling constraints only. In This work; we propose a generalized temporal role-based access control (GTRBAC) model capable of expressing a wider range of temporalconstraints. In particular; the model allows expressing periodic as well as durationconstraints on roles; user-role assignments; and role-permission assignments. In an …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2005,711
The specification and enforcement of authorization constraints in workflow management systems,Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Vijay Atluri,Abstract In recent years; workflow management systems (WFMSs) have gained popularity inboth research and commercial sectors. WFMSs are used to coordinate and streamlinebusiness processes. Very large WFMSs are often used in organizations with users in therange of several thousands and process instances in the range of tens and thousands. Tosimplify the complexity of security administration; it is common practice in many businessesto allocate a role for each activity in the process and then assign one or more users to eachrole—granting an authorization to roles rather than to users. Typically; security policies areexpressed as constraints (or rules) on users and roles; separation of duties is a well-knownconstraint. Unfortunately; current role-based access control models are not adequate tomodel such constraints. To address this issue we (1) present a language to express both …,ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC),1999,694
Association rule hiding,Vassilios S Verykios; Ahmed K Elmagarmid; Elisa Bertino; Yücel Saygin; Elena Dasseni,Large repositories of data contain sensitive information that must be protected againstunauthorized access.

GEO-RBAC: a spatially aware RBAC,Maria Luisa Damiani; Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania; Paolo Perlasca,Abstract Securing access to data in location-based services and mobile applicationsrequires the definition of spatially aware access-control systems. Even if some approacheshave already been proposed either in the context of geographic database systems orcontext-aware applications; a comprehensive framework; general and flexible enough todeal with spatial aspects in real mobile applications; is still missing. In this paper; we makeone step toward this direction and present GEO-RBAC; an extension of the RBAC modelenhanced with spatial-and location-based information. In GEORBAC; spatial entities areused to model objects; user positions; and geographically bounded roles. Roles areactivated based on the position of the user. Besides a physical position; obtained from agiven mobile terminal or a cellular phone; users are also assigned a logical and device …,ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC),2007,518
Disclosure limitation of sensitive rules,Mike Atallah; Elisa Bertino; Ahmed Elmagarmid; Mohamed Ibrahim; Vassilios Verykios,Data products (macrodata or tabular data and micro-data or raw data records); are designedto inform public or business policy; and research or public information. Securing theseproducts against unauthorized accesses has been a long-term goal of the database securityresearch community and the government statistical agencies. Solutions to this problemrequire combining several techniques and mechanisms. Recent advances in data miningand machine learning algorithms have; however; increased the security risks one may incurwhen releasing data for mining from outside parties. Issues related to data mining andsecurity have been recognized and investigated only recently. This paper deals with theproblem of limiting disclosure of sensitive rules. In particular it is attempted to selectivelyhide some frequent itemsets from large databases with as little as possible impact on …,Knowledge and Data Engineering Exchange; 1999.(KDEX'99) Proceedings. 1999 Workshop on,1999,494
Database security-concepts; approaches; and challenges,Elisa Bertino; Ravi Sandhu,As organizations increase their reliance on; possibly distributed; information systems fordaily business; they become more vulnerable to security breaches even as they gainproductivity and efficiency advantages. Though a number of techniques; such as encryptionand electronic signatures; are currently available to protect data when transmitted acrosssites; a truly comprehensive approach for data protection must also include mechanisms forenforcing access control policies based on data contents; subject qualifications andcharacteristics; and other relevant contextual information; such as time. It is well understoodtoday that the semantics of data must be taken into account in order to specify effectiveaccess control policies. Also; techniques for data integrity and availability specificallytailored to database systems must be adopted. In this respect; over the years; the …,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and secure computing,2005,477
A model of authorization for next-generation database systems,Fausto Rabitti; Elisa Bertino; Won Kim; Darrell Woelk,Abstract The conventional models of authorization have been designed for databasesystems supporting the hierarchical; network; and relational models of data. However; thesemodels are not adequate for next-generation database systems that support richer datamodels that include object-oriented concepts and semantic data modeling concepts. Rabitti;Woelk; and Kim [14] presented a preliminary model of authorization for use as the basis ofan authorization mechanism in such database systems. In this paper we present a fullermodel of authorization that fills a few major gaps that the conventional models ofauthorization cannot fill for next-generation database systems. We also further formalize thenotion of implicit authorization and refine the application of the notion of implicitauthorization to object-oriented and semantic modeling concepts. We also describe a …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1991,461
Secure and selective dissemination of XML documents,Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari,Abstract XML (eXtensible Markup Language) has emerged as a prevalent standard fordocument representation and exchange on the Web. It is often the case that XML documentscontain information of different sensitivity degrees that must be selectively shared by(possibly large) user communities. There is thus the need for models and mechanismsenabling the specification and enforcement of access control policies for XML documents.Mechanisms are also required enabling a secure and selective dissemination of documentsto users; according to the authorizations that these users have. In this article; we makeseveral contributions to the problem of secure and selective dissemination of XMLdocuments. First; we define a formal model of access control policies for XML documents.Policies that can be defined in our model take into account both user profiles; and …,ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC),2002,448
Composite objects revisited,Won Kim; Elisa Bertino; Jorge F Garza,Abstract In object-oriented systems; an object may recursively reference any number of otherobjects. The references; however; do not capture any special relationships between objects.An important semantic relationship which may be superimposed on a reference is the IS-PART-OF relationship between a pair of objects. A set of objects related by the IS-PART-OFrelationship is collectively called a composite object. An earlier paper [KIM87b] presented amodel of composite objects which has been implemented in the ORION object-orienteddatabase system at MCC. Although the composite-object feature has been found quiteuseful; the model suffers from a number of serious shortcomings; primarily because itoverloads a number of orthogonal semantics on the references. In this paper; first wepresent a more general model of composite objects which does not suffer from these …,ACM Sigmod Record,1989,408
A unified framework for enforcing multiple access control policies,Sushil Jajodia; Pierangela Samarati; VS Subrahmanian; Eliza Bertino,Abstract Although several access control policies can be devised for controlling access toinformation; all existing authorization models; and the corresponding enforcementmechanisms; are based on a specific policy (usually the closed policy). As a consequence;although different policy choices are possible in theory; in practice only a specific policy canbe actually applied within a given system. However; protection requirements within a systemcan vary dramatically; and no single policy may simultaneously satisfy them all. In this paperwe present a flexible authorization manager (FAM) that can enforce multiple access controlpolicies within a single; unified system. FAM is based on a language through which userscan specify authorizations and access control policies to be applied in controlling executionof specific actions on given objects. We formally define the language and properties …,ACM Sigmod Record,1997,396
Indexing techniques for queries on nested objects,Elisa Bertino; Won Kim,Three index organizations are introduced for use in the evaluation of a query in an object-oriented or nested relational database. Detailed models of the three indexes are developed.Using the models; the storage cost; retrieval cost; and update cost of these indexes areevaluated; and a number of observations are made about the use of these indexes forevaluating queries for object-oriented or nested relational databases. A comparison of thecombined retrieval and update costs for the three indexes is also included. It is shown thatthe degree of reference sharing among objects for the various classes in the path influencesboth the retrieval and update costs.,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering,1989,381
Hiding association rules by using confidence and support,Elena Dasseni; Vassilios S Verykios; Ahmed K Elmagarmid; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Large repositories of data contain sensitive information which must be protectedagainst unauthorized access. Recent advances; in data mining and machine learningalgorithms; have increased the disclosure risks one may encounter when releasing data tooutside parties. A key problem; and still not sufficiently investigated; is the need to balancethe confidentiality of the disclosed data with the legitimate needs of the data users. Everydisclosure limitation method affects; in some way; and modifies true data values andrelationships. In this paper; we investigate confidentiality issues of a broad category of rules;which are called association rules. If the disclosure risk of some of these rules are above acertain privacy threshold; those rules must be characterized as sensitive. Sometimes;sensitive rules should not be disclosed to the public since; among other things; they may …,International Workshop on Information Hiding,2001,356
Privacy-aware role-based access control,Qun Ni; Elisa Bertino; Jorge Lobo; Carolyn Brodie; Clare-Marie Karat; John Karat; Alberto Trombeta,Abstract In this article; we introduce a comprehensive framework supporting a privacy-awareaccess control mechanism; that is; a mechanism tailored to enforce access control to datacontaining personally identifiable information and; as such; privacy sensitive. The keycomponent of the framework is a family of models (P-RBAC) that extend the well-knownRBAC model in order to provide full support for expressing highly complex privacy-relatedpolicies; taking into account features like purposes and obligations. We formally define thenotion of privacy-aware permissions and the notion of conflicting permission assignments inP-RBAC; together with efficient conflict-checking algorithms. The framework also includes aflexible authoring tool; based on the use of the SPARCLE system; supporting the high-levelspecification of P-RBAC permissions.

Preserving user location privacy in mobile data management infrastructures,Reynold Cheng; Yu Zhang; Elisa Bertino; Sunil Prabhakar,Abstract Location-based services; such as finding the nearest gas station; require users tosupply their location information. However; a user's location can be tracked without herconsent or knowledge. Lowering the spatial and temporal resolution of location data sent tothe server has been proposed as a solution. Although this technique is effective in protectingprivacy; it may be overkill and the quality of desired services can be severely affected. In thispaper; we suggest a framework where uncertainty can be controlled to provide high qualityand privacy-preserving services; and investigate how such a framework can be realized inthe GPS and cellular network systems. Based on this framework; we suggest a data model toaugment uncertainty to location data; and propose imprecise queries that hide the locationof the query issuer and yields probabilistic results. We investigate the evaluation and …,International Workshop on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,2006,315
A logical framework for reasoning about access control models,Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania; Elena Ferrari; Paolo Perlasca,Abstract The increased awareness of the importance of data protection has made accesscontrol a relevant component of current data management systems. Moreover; emergingapplications and data models call for flexible and expressive access control models. Thishas led to an extensive research activity that has resulted in the definition of a variety ofaccess control models that differ greatly with respect to the access control policies theysupport. Thus; the need arises for developing tools for reasoning about the characteristics ofthese models. These tools should support users in the tasks of model specification; analysisof model properties; and authorization management. For example; they must be able toidentify inconsistencies in the model specification and must support the administrator incomparing the expressive power of different models. In this paper; we make a first step in …,ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC),2003,314
A view mechanism for object-oriented databases,Elisa Bertino,Abstract In this paper; we present a view model for object-oriented databases that extends invarious directions view models typical of relational databases. In particular; the definitionlanguage allows views to be defined that augment class definitions (by adding propertiesand methods); and that support a wide spectrum of schema modifications. Therefore; viewsrepresent a unified mechanism able to provide several functions; such as query shorthand;definitions of dynamic sets and partitions of classes; authorizations; schema changes andversions; object perspectives.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,1992,313
Efficient k-anonymization using clustering techniques,Ji-Won Byun; Ashish Kamra; Elisa Bertino; Ninghui Li,Abstract k-anonymization techniques have been the focus of intense research in the last fewyears. An important requirement for such techniques is to ensure anonymization of datawhile at the same time minimizing the information loss resulting from data modifications. Inthis paper we propose an approach that uses the idea of clustering to minimize informationloss and thus ensure good data quality. The key observation here is that data records thatare naturally similar to each other should be part of the same equivalence class. We thusformulate a specific clustering problem; referred to as k-member clustering problem. Weprove that this problem is NP-hard and present a greedy heuristic; the complexity of which isin O (n 2). As part of our approach we develop a suitable metric to estimate the informationloss introduced by generalizations; which works for both numeric and categorical data.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,312
Purpose based access control of complex data for privacy protection,Ji-Won Byun; Elisa Bertino; Ninghui Li,Abstract As privacy becomes a major concern for both consumers and enterprises; manyresearch efforts have been devoted to the development of privacy protecting technology. Werecently proposed a privacy preserving access control model for relational databases; wherepurpose information associated with a given data element specifies the intended use of thedata element. In this paper; we extend our previous work to handle other advanced datamanagementsystems; such as the ones based on XML and the ones based on the object-relational data model. Another contribution of our paper isthat we address the problem ofhow to determine the purpose forwhich certain data are accessed by a given user. Ourproposedsolution relies on the well-known RBAC model as well as the notionof conditionalrole which is based on the notions of role attributeand system attribute.,Proceedings of the tenth ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2005,302
Trust-/spl Xscr/;: a peer-to-peer framework for trust establishment,Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Anna Cinzia Squicciarini,We present Trust-/spl Xscr/;; a comprehensive XML-based framework for trust negotiations;specifically conceived for a peer-to-peer environment. Trust negotiation is a promisingapproach for establishing trust in open systems like the Internet; where sensitive interactionsmay often occur between entities at first contact; with no prior knowledge of each other. Theframework we propose takes into account all aspects related to negotiations; from thespecification of the profiles and policies of the involved parties to the selection of the beststrategy to succeed in the negotiation. Trust-/spl Xscr/; presents a number of innovativefeatures; such as the support for protection of sensitive policies; the use of trust tickets tospeed up the negotiation; and the support of different strategies to carry on a negotiation.

An access control model supporting periodicity constraints and temporal reasoning,Elisa Bertino; Claudio Bettini; Elena Ferrari; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Access control models; such as the ones supported by commercial DBMSs; are notyet able to fully meet many application needs. An important requirement derives from thetemporal dimension that permissions have in many real-world situations. Permissions areoften limited in time or may hold only for specific periods of time. In this article; we present anaccess control model in which periodic temporal intervals are associated withauthorizations. An authorization is automatically granted in the specified intervals andrevoked when such intervals expire. Deductive temporal rules with periodicity and orderconstraints are provided to derive new authorizations based on the presence or absence ofother authorizations in specific periods of time. We provide a solution to the problem ofensuring the uniqueness of the global set of valid authorizations derivable at each instant …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1998,297
Securing XML documents with Author-X,Elisa Bertino; Silvana Castano; Elena Ferrari,Author-X is a Java-based system that addresses the security issues of access control andpolicy design for XML document administration. Author-X supports the specification ofpolicies at varying granularity levels and the specification of user credentials as a way toenforce access control. Access control is available according to both push and pulldocument distribution policies; and document updates are distributed through a combinationof hash functions and digital signature techniques. The Author-X approach to distributedupdates allows a user to verify a document's integrity without contacting the documentserver.,IEEE Internet Computing,2001,281
Specifying and enforcing access control policies for XML document sources,Elisa Bertino; Silvana Castano; Elena Ferrari; Marco Mesiti,Abstract The Web is becoming the main information dissemination means in private andpublic organizations. As a consequence; several applications at both internet and intranetlevel need mechanisms to support a selective access to data available over the Web. In thiscontext; developing an access control model; and related mechanisms; in terms of XML(eXtensible Markup Language) is an important step; because XML is increasingly used asthe language for representing information exchanged over the Web. In this paper; wepropose access control policies and an associated model for XML documents; addressingpeculiar protection requirements posed by XML. A first requirement is that varying protectiongranularity levels should be supported to guarantee a differentiated protection of documentcontents. A second requirement arises from the fact that XML documents do not always …,World Wide Web,2000,272

The basic concepts of an object-oriented datamodel are discussed. They are objects and object identifiers; aggregation; classes andinstantiation mechanisms; metaclasses; and inheritance. Object-oriented models arecompared with semantic; relational; and Codasyl models. Object-oriented query languagesand query processing are considered. Some operational aspects of data management inobject-oriented systems are examined. Schema evolution is discussed.,Computer,1991,260
A trust-based context-aware access control model for web-services,Rafae Bhatti; Elisa Bertino; Arif Ghafoor,Abstract A key challenge in Web services security is the design of effective access controlschemes that can adequately meet the unique security challenges posed by the Webservices paradigm. Despite the recent advances in Web based access control approachesapplicable to Web services; there remain issues that impede the development of effectiveaccess control models for Web services environment. Amongst them are the lack of context-aware models for access control; and reliance on identity or capability-based access controlschemes. Additionally; the unique service access control features required in Web servicestechnology are not captured in existing schemes. In this paper; we motivate the design of anaccess control scheme that addresses these issues; and propose an extended; trust-enhanced version of our XML-based Role Based Access Control (X-RBAC) framework …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2005,251
Secure interoperation in a multidomain environment employing RBAC policies,Basit Shafiq; James BD Joshi; Elisa Bertino; Arif Ghafoor,Multidomain application environments where distributed multiple organizations interoperatewith each other are becoming a reality as witnessed by emerging Internet-based enterpriseapplications. Composition of a global coherent security policy that governs information andresource accesses in such environments is a challenging problem. In this paper; wepropose a policy integration framework for merging heterogeneous role-based accesscontrol (RBAC) policies of multiple domains into a global access control policy. A keychallenge in composition of this policy is the resolution of conflicts that may arise among theRBAC policies of individual domains. We propose an integer programming (IP)-basedapproach for optimal resolution of such conflicts. The optimality criterion is to maximizeinterdomain role accesses without exceeding the autonomy losses beyond the …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2005,242
Object-oriented query languages: The notion and the issues,Elisa Bertino; Mauro Negri; Giuseppe Pelagatti; Licia Sbattella,The authors describe how the characteristics of an object-oriented data model; such asobject identity; complex object structure; methods; and class hierarchies; have an impact onthe design of a query language. They also point out major differences with respect torelational query languages. The discussion is supported through the definition of OOPC; aformal object-oriented query language based on predicate calculus; which incorporates in aconsistent formal notation most features of existing object-oriented query languages.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1992,223
Secure anonymization for incremental datasets,Ji-Won Byun; Yonglak Sohn; Elisa Bertino; Ninghui Li,Abstract Data anonymization techniques based on the k-anonymity model have been thefocus of intense research in the last few years. Although the k-anonymity model and therelated techniques provide valuable solutions to data privacy; current solutions are limitedonly to static data release (ie; the entire dataset is assumed to be available at the time ofrelease). While this may be acceptable in some applications; today we see databasescontinuously growing everyday and even every hour. In such dynamic environments; thecurrent techniques may suffer from poor data quality and/or vulnerability to inference. In thispaper; we analyze various inference channels that may exist in multiple anonymizeddatasets and discuss how to avoid such inferences. We then present an approach tosecurely anonymizing a continuously growing dataset in an efficient manner while …,Workshop on Secure Data Management,2006,215

Privacy-preserving digital identity management for cloud computing.,Elisa Bertino; Federica Paci; Rodolfo Ferrini; Ning Shang,Abstract Digital identity management services are crucial in cloud computing infrastructuresto authenticate users and to support flexible access control to services; based on useridentity properties (also called attributes) and past interaction histories. Such servicesshould preserve the privacy of users; while at the same time enhancing interoperabilityacross multiple domains and simplifying management of identity verification. In this paperwe propose an approach addressing such requirements; based on the use of high-levelidentity verification policies expressed in terms of identity attributes; zero-knolwedge proofprotocols; and semantic matching techniques.

Detecting anomalous access patterns in relational databases,Ashish Kamra; Evimaria Terzi; Elisa Bertino,Abstract A considerable effort has been recently devoted to the development of DatabaseManagement Systems (DBMS) which guarantee high assurance and security. An importantcomponent of any strong security solution is represented by Intrusion Detection (ID)techniques; able to detect anomalous behavior of applications and users. To date; however;there have been few ID mechanisms proposed which are specifically tailored to functionwithin the DBMS. In this paper; we propose such a mechanism. Our approach is based onmining SQL queries stored in database audit log files. The result of the mining process isused to form profiles that can model normal database access behavior and identify intruders.We consider two different scenarios while addressing the problem. In the first case; weassume that the database has a Role Based Access Control (RBAC) model in place …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2008,182
A framework for evaluating privacy preserving data mining algorithms,Elisa Bertino; Igor Nai Fovino; Loredana Parasiliti Provenza,Abstract Recently; a new class of data mining methods; known as privacy preserving datamining (PPDM) algorithms; has been developed by the research community working onsecurity and knowledge discovery. The aim of these algorithms is the extraction of relevantknowledge from large amount of data; while protecting at the same time sensitiveinformation. Several data mining techniques; incorporating privacy protection mechanisms;have been developed that allow one to hide sensitive itemsets or patterns; before the datamining process is executed. Privacy preserving classification methods; instead; prevent aminer from building a classifier which is able to predict sensitive data. Additionally; privacypreserving clustering techniques have been recently proposed; which distort sensitivenumerical attributes; while preserving general features for clustering analysis.

Selective and authentic third-party distribution of XML documents,Elisa Bertino; Barbara Carminati; Elena Ferrari; Bhavani Thuraisingham; Amar Gupta,Third-party architectures for data publishing over the Internet today are receiving growingattention; due to their scalability properties and to the ability of efficiently managing largenumber of subjects and great amount of data. In a third-party architecture; there is adistinction between the Owner and the Publisher of information. The Owner is the producerof information; whereas Publishers are responsible for managing (a portion of) the Ownerinformation and for answering subject queries. A relevant issue in this architecture is howthe Owner can ensure a secure and selective publishing of its data; even if the data aremanaged by a third-party; which can prune some of the nodes of the original document onthe basis of subject queries and access control policies. An approach can be that ofrequiring the Publisher to be trusted with regard to the considered security properties …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2004,177
An advanced commit protocol for MLS distributed database systems,Indrajit Ray; Elisa Bertino; Sushil Jajodia; Luigi Mancini,Abstract The classical Early Prepare commit protocol (EP); used in many commercialsystems; is not suitable for use in multilevel secure distributed database systems that employa locking protocol for concurrency control. This is because EP requires that read locks be notreleased by a subtransaction during its window of uncertainty; however; it is not possible fora locking protocol to provide this guarantee in a multilevel secure system (since read lock ofa higher level transaction on a lower level data object must be released whenever a lowerlevel transaction wants to write it). The Secure Early Prepare protocol (SEP) overcomes thisdifficulty by aborting those distributed transactions that release their low level read locksprematurely. We see this approach as being too restrictive. One of the major benefits ofdistributed processing is its robustness to failures; and SEP fails to take advantage of this …,Proceedings of the 3rd ACM conference on Computer and communications security,1996,173
Indexing techniques for advanced database systems,Elisa Bertino; Beng Chin Ooi; Ron Sacks-Davis; Kian-Lee Tan; Justin Zobel; Boris Shidlovsky; Daniele Andronico,Recent years have seen an explosive growth in the use of new database applications suchas CAD/CAM systems; spatial information systems; and multimedia information systems. Theneeds of these applications are far more complex than traditional business applications.They call for support of objects with complex data types; such as images and spatial objects;and for support of objects with wildly varying numbers of index terms; such as documents.Traditional indexing techniques such as the B-tree and its variants do not efficiently supportthese applications; and so new indexing mechanisms have been developed. As a result ofthe demand for database support for new applications; there has been a proliferation of newindexing techniques.

XACML policy integration algorithms,Pietro Mazzoleni; Bruno Crispo; Swaminathan Sivasubramanian; Elisa Bertino,Abstract XACML is the OASIS standard language specifically aimed at the specification ofauthorization policies. While XACML fits well with the security requirements of a singleenterprise (even if large and composed by multiple departments); it does not address therequirements of virtual enterprises in which several autonomous subjects collaborate bysharing their resources to provide better services to customers. In this article we highlightsuch limitation; and we propose an XACML extension; the policy integration algorithms; toaddress them. In the article we also present the implementation of a system that makes useof the policy integration algorithms to securely replicate information in a P2P-likeenvironment. In our solution; the data replication process considers the policies specified byboth the owners of the data shared and the peers sharing data storage.,ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC),2008,165
A flexible authorization mechanism for relational data management systems,Elisa Bertino; Sushil Jajodia; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract In this article; we present an authorization model that can be used to express anumber of discretionary access control policies for relational data management systems.The model permits both positive and negative authorizations and supports exceptions at thesame time. The model is flexible in that the users can specify; for each authorization theygrant; whether the authorization can allow for exceptions or whether it must be stronglyobeyed. It provides authorization management for groups with exceptions at any level of thegroup hierarchy; and temporary suspension of authorizations. The model supportsownership together with decentralized administration of authorizations.

Animportant component of any strong security solution is represented by intrusion detection(ID) systems; able to detect anomalous behavior by applications and users. To date;however; there have been very few ID mechanisms specifically tailored to databasesystems. In this paper; we propose such a mechanism. The approach we propose to ID isbased on mining database traces stored in log files. The result of the mining process is usedto form user profiles that can model normal behavior and identify intruders. An additionalfeature of our approach is that we couple our mechanism with role based access control(RBAC). Under a RBAC system permissions are associated with roles; usually grouping …,Computer security applications conference; 21st annual,2005,159
An extended authorization model for relational databases,Elisa Bertino; Pierangela Samarati; Sushil Jajodia,We propose two extensions to the authorization model for relational databases definedoriginally by PG Griffiths and B. Wade (1976). The first extension concerns a new type ofrevoke operation; called noncascading revoke operation. The original model contains asingle; cascading revoke operation; meaning that when a privilege is revoked from a user; arecursive revocation takes place that deletes all authorizations granted by this user that donot have other supporting authorizations. The new type of revocation avoids the recursiverevocation of authorizations. The second extension concerns negative authorization whichpermits specification of explicit denial for a user to access an object under a particular mode.We also address the management of views and groups with respect to the proposedextensions.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1997,159
A content-based authorization model for digital libraries,Nabil R Adam; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari,Digital libraries (DLs) introduce several challenging requirements with respect to theformulation; specification and enforcement of adequate data protection policies. Unlikeconventional database environments; a DL environment is typically characterized by adynamic user population; often making accesses from remote locations; and by anextraordinarily large amount of multimedia information; stored in a variety of formats.Moreover; in a DL environment; access policies are often specified based on userqualifications and characteristics; rather than on user identity (eg a user can be given accessto an R-rated video only if he/she is more than 18 years old). Another crucial requirement isthe support for content-dependent authorizations on digital library objects (eg all documentscontaining discussions on how to operate guns must be made available only to users …,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2002,158
A temporal access control mechanism for database systems,Elisa Bertino; Claudio Bettini; Elena Ferrari; Pierangela Samarati,The paper presents a discretionary access control model in which authorizations containtemporal intervals of validity. An authorization is automatically revoked when the associatedtemporal interval expires. The proposed model provides rules for the automatic derivation ofnew authorizations from those explicitly specified. Both positive and negative authorizationsare supported. A formal definition of those concepts is presented; together with the semanticinterpretation of authorizations and derivation rules as clauses of a general logic program.Issues deriving from the presence of negative authorizations are discussed. We also allownegation in rules: it is possible to derive new authorizations on the basis of the absence ofother authorizations. The presence of this type of rule may lead to the generation of differentsets of authorizations; depending on the evaluation order. An approach is presented …,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering,1996,158
Provenance-based trustworthiness assessment in sensor networks,Hyo-Sang Lim; Yang-Sae Moon; Elisa Bertino,Abstract As sensor networks are being increasingly deployed in decision-makinginfrastructures such as battlefield monitoring systems and SCADA (Supervisory Control andData Acquisition) systems; making decision makers aware of the trustworthiness of thecollected data is a crucial. To address this problem; we propose a systematic method forassessing the trustworthiness of data items. Our approach uses the data provenance as wellas their values in computing trust scores; that is; quantitative measures of trustworthiness. Toobtain trust scores; we propose a cyclic framework which well reflects the inter-dependencyproperty: the trust score of the data affects the trust score of the network nodes that createdand manipulated the data; and vice-versa. The trust scores of data items are computed fromtheir value similarity and provenance similarity. The value similarity comes from the …,Proceedings of the Seventh International Workshop on Data Management for Sensor Networks,2010,157
A matching algorithm for measuring the structural similarity between an XML document and a DTD and its applications,Elisa Bertino; Giovanna Guerrini; Marco Mesiti,Abstract In this paper we propose a matching algorithm for measuring the structural similaritybetween an XML document and a DTD. The matching algorithm; by comparing thedocument structure against the one the DTD requires; is able to identify commonalities anddifferences. Differences can be due to the presence of extra elements with respect to thosethe DTD requires and to the absence of required elements. The evaluation of commonalitiesand differences gives raise to a numerical rank of the structural similarity. Moreover; in thepaper; some applications of the matching algorithm are discussed. Specifically; the matchingalgorithm is exploited for the classification of XML documents against a set of DTDs; theevolution of the DTD structure; the evaluation of structural queries; the selectivedissemination of XML documents; and the protection of XML document contents.,Information Systems,2004,157
Supporting multiple access control policies in database systems,Elisa Bertino; Sushil Jajodia; Pierangela Samarati,Although there are several choices of policies for protection of information; access controlmodels have been developed for a fixed set pre-defined access control policies that are thenbuilt into the corresponding access control mechanisms. This becomes a problem; however;if the access control requirements of an application are different from the policies built into amechanism. In most cases; the only solution is to enforce the requirements as part of theapplication code; but this makes verification; modification; and adequate enforcement ofthese policies impossible. In this paper; we propose a flexible authorization mechanism thatcan support different security policies. The mechanism enforces a general authorizationmodel onto which multiple access control policies can be mapped. The model permitsnegative and positive authorizations; authorizations that must be strongly obeyed and …,Security and Privacy; 1996. Proceedings.; 1996 IEEE Symposium on,1996,157
On specifying security policies for web documents with an XML-based language,Elisa Bertino; Silvana Castano; Elena Ferrari,Abstract The rapid growth of the Web and the ease with which data can be accessedfacilitate the distribution and sharing of information. Information dissemination often takesthe form of documents that are made available at Web servers; or that are activelybroadcasted by Web servers to interested clients. In this paper; we present an XML-compliant formalism for specifying security-related information for Web document protection.In particular; we introduce X-Sec; an XML-based language for specifying subject credentialsand security policies and for organizing them into subject profiles and policy bases;respectively. The language is complemented by a set of subscription-based schemes foraccessing distributed Web documents; which rely on defined XML subject profiles and XMLpolicy bases.,Proceedings of the sixth ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2001,155
Privacy preserving policy-based content sharing in public clouds,Mohamed Nabeel; Ning Shang; Elisa Bertino,An important problem in public clouds is how to selectively share documents based on fine-grained attribute-based access control policies (acps). An approach is to encrypt documentssatisfying different policies with different keys using a public key cryptosystem such asattribute-based encryption; and/or proxy re-encryption. However; such an approach hassome weaknesses: it cannot efficiently handle adding/revoking users or identity attributes;and policy changes; it requires to keep multiple encrypted copies of the same documents; itincurs high computational costs. A direct application of a symmetric key cryptosystem; whereusers are grouped based on the policies they satisfy and unique keys are assigned to eachgroup; also has similar weaknesses. We observe that; without utilizing public keycryptography and by allowing users to dynamically derive the symmetric keys at the time …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2013,151
Mining roles with semantic meanings,Ian Molloy; Hong Chen; Tiancheng Li; Qihua Wang; Ninghui Li; Elisa Bertino; Seraphin Calo; Jorge Lobo,Abstract With the growing adoption of role-based access control (RBAC) in commercialsecurity and identity management products; how to facilitate the process of migrating a non-RBAC system to an RBAC system has become a problem with significant business impact.Researchers have proposed to use data mining techniques to discover roles to complementthe costly top-down approaches for RBAC system construction. A key problem that has notbeen adequately addressed by existing role mining approaches is how to discover roleswith semantic meanings. In this paper; we study the problem in two settings with differentinformation availability. When the only information is user-permission relation; we propose todiscover roles whose semantic meaning is based on formal concept lattices. We argue thatthe theory of formal concept analysis provides a solid theoretical foundation for mining …,Proceedings of the 13th ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2008,151
Privacy preserving schema and data matching,Monica Scannapieco; Ilya Figotin; Elisa Bertino; Ahmed K Elmagarmid,Abstract In many business scenarios; record matching is performed across different datasources with the aim of identifying common information shared among these sources.However such need is often in contrast with privacy requirements concerning the data storedby the sources. In this paper; we propose a protocol for record matching that preservesprivacy both at the data level and at the schema level. Specifically; if two sources need toidentify their common data; by running the protocol they can compute the matching of theirdatasets without sharing their data in clear and only sharing the result of the matching. Theprotocol uses a third party; and maps records into a vector space in order to preserve theirprivacy. Experimental results show the efficiency of the matching protocol in terms ofprecision and recall as well as the good computational performance.,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,144
Privacy preserving multi-factor authentication with biometrics,Abhilasha Bhargav-Spantzel; Anna C Squicciarini; Shimon Modi; Matthew Young; Elisa Bertino; Stephen J Elliott,Abstract An emerging approach to the problem of identity theft is represented by theadoption of biometric authentication systems. Such systems however present severalchallenges; related to privacy; reliability and security of the biometric data. Inter-operability isalso required among the devices used for authentication. Moreover; very often biometricauthentication in itself is not sufficient as a conclusive proof of identity and has to becomplemented with multiple other proofs of identity such as passwords; SSN; or other useridentifiers. Multi-factor authentication mechanisms are thus required to enforce strongauthentication based on the biometric and identifiers of other nature.,Journal of Computer Security,2007,143
Integrating XML and databases,Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania,XML is becoming a standard for data communication over the Internet. Like HTML; it is amarkup language; but it supports a richer set of features; such as user-defined tags thatallow both data and descriptive information about data to be represented within a singledocument. At the same time; presentation aspects remain decoupled from datarepresentation. XML's flexibility lets it serve as a metalanguage for defining other markuplanguages specialized for specific contexts. A document type definition (DTD) describes thetags documents can use; customized to the specific semantic requirements of the applicationcontext; and the rules connecting tags with their contents. These capabilities make XML acommon data format for data interchange between computer systems and betweenapplications. XML's proliferation raises the question of how data transferred by XML …,IEEE Internet Computing,2001,143
A flexible model supporting the specification and enforcement of role-based authorization in workflow management systems,Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Vijayalakshmi Atluri,Abstract In recent years; workflow management systems (WFMSs) have gained popularityboth in research as well as in commercial sectors. WFMSs are used to coordinate andstreamline business processes of an organization. Often; very large WFMSs are used inorganizations with users in the range of several thousands and number of process instancesin the range of tens of thousands. To simplify the complexity of security administration; it is acommon practice in many business organizations to allocate a role to perform each activityin the process and then assign one or more users to each role; and granting anauthorization to roles rather than to users. Typically the security policies of the organizationare expressed as constraints on users and roles. a well-known constraint is separation ofduties. Unfortunately; current role-based access control models are not adequate to …,Proceedings of the second ACM workshop on Role-based access control,1997,141

Temporal hierarchies and inheritance semantics for GTRBAC,James BD Joshi; Elisa Bertino; Arif Ghafoor,Abstract A Generalized Temporal Role Based Access Control (GTRBAC) model that allowsspecification of a comprehensive set of temporal constraint for access control has recentlybeen proposed. The model constructs allow one to specify various temporal constraints onrole; user-role assignments and role-permission assignments. However; Temporalconstraints on role enablings and role activations can have various implications on a rolehierarchy. In this paper; we present an analysis of the effects of GTRBAC temporalconstraints on a role hierarchy and introduce various kinds of temporal hierarchies. Inparticular; we show that there are certain distinctions that need to be made in permissioninheritance and role activation semantics in order to capture all the effects of GTRBACconstraints such as role enablings and role activations on a role hierarchy.,Proceedings of the seventh ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2002,134
Privacy and ownership preserving of outsourced medical data,Elisa Bertino; Beng Chin Ooi; Yanjiang Yang; Robert H Deng,The demand for the secondary use of medical data is increasing steadily to allow for theprovision of better quality health care. Two important issues pertaining to this sharing of datahave to be addressed: one is the privacy protection for individuals referred to in the data; theother is copyright protection over the data. In this paper; we present a unified framework thatseamlessly combines techniques of binning and digital watermarking to attain the dual goalsof privacy and copyright protection. Our binning method is built upon an earlier approach ofgeneralization and suppression by allowing a broader concept of generalization. To ensuredata usefulness; we propose constraining binning by usage metrics that define maximalallowable information loss; and the metrics can be enforced off-line. Our watermarkingalgorithm watermarks the binned data in a hierarchical manner by leveraging on the very …,Data Engineering; 2005. ICDE 2005. Proceedings. 21st International Conference on,2005,133
A privacy-preserving approach to policy-based content dissemination,Ning Shang; Mohamed Nabeel; Federica Paci; Elisa Bertino,We propose a novel scheme for selective distribution of content; encoded as documents;that preserves the privacy of the users to whom the documents are delivered and is basedon an efficient and novel group key management scheme. Our document broadcastingapproach is based on access control policies specifying which users can access whichdocuments; or subdocuments. Based on such policies; a broadcast document is segmentedinto multiple subdocuments; each encrypted with a different key. In line with modern attribute-based access control; policies are specified against identity attributes of users. However ourbroadcasting approach is privacy-preserving in that users are granted access to a specificdocument; or subdocument; according to the policies without the need of providing in clearinformation about their identity attributes to the document publisher.

Watermarking relational databases using optimization-based techniques,Mohamed Shehab; Elisa Bertino; Arif Ghafoor,Proving ownership rights on outsourced relational databases is a crucial issue in today'sinternet-based application environments and in many content distribution applications. Inthis paper; we present a mechanism for proof of ownership based on the secure embeddingof a robust imperceptible watermark in relational data. We formulate the watermarking ofrelational databases as a constrained optimization problem and discuss efficient techniquesto solve the optimization problem and to handle the constraints. Our watermarking techniqueis resilient to watermark synchronization errors because it uses a partitioning approach thatdoes not require marker tuples. Our approach overcomes a major weakness in previouslyproposed watermarking techniques.

An approach to evaluate data trustworthiness based on data provenance,Chenyun Dai; Dan Lin; Elisa Bertino; Murat Kantarcioglu,Abstract Today; with the advances of information technology; individual people andorganizations can obtain and process data from different sources. It is critical to ensure dataintegrity so that effective decisions can be made based on these data. An importantcomponent of any solution for assessing data integrity is represented by techniques andtools to evaluate the trustworthiness of data provenance. However; few efforts have beendevoted to investigate approaches for assessing how trusted the data are; based in turn onan assessment of the data sources and intermediaries. To bridge this gap; we propose adata provenance trust model which takes into account various factors that may affect thetrustworthiness and; based on these factors; assigns trust scores to both data and dataproviders. Such trust scores represent key information based on which data users may …,Workshop on Secure Data Management,2008,124
Private record matching using differential privacy,Ali Inan; Murat Kantarcioglu; Gabriel Ghinita; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Private matching between datasets owned by distinct parties is a challengingproblem with several applications. Private matching allows two parties to identify the recordsthat are close to each other according to some distance functions; such that no additionalinformation other than the join result is disclosed to any party. Private matching can besolved securely and accurately using secure multi-party computation (SMC) techniques; butsuch an approach is prohibitively expensive in practice. Previous work proposed the releaseof sanitized versions of the sensitive datasets which allows blocking; ie; filtering out sub-setsof records that cannot be part of the join result. This way; SMC is applied only to a smallfraction of record pairs; reducing the matching cost to acceptable levels. The blocking step isessential for the privacy; accuracy and efficiency of matching.

The PROBE Framework for the Personalized Cloaking of Private Locations.,Maria Luisa Damiani; Elisa Bertino; Claudio Silvestri,Abstract. The widespread adoption of location-based services (LBS) raises increasingconcerns for the protection of personal location information. A common strategy; referred toas obfuscation (or cloaking); to protect location privacy is based on forwarding the LBSprovider a coarse user location instead of the actual user location. Conventionalapproaches; based on such technique; are however based only on geometric methods andtherefore are unable to assure privacy when the adversary is aware of the geographicalcontext; in particular of the semantic locations and the statistical distribution of positions inthe given space. This paper provides a comprehensive solution to this problem. We presenta novel privacy model and an architectural framework for the personalized cloaking ofsemantic locations. In our model; a cloaked location is an uncertainty region which …,Trans. Data Privacy,2010,119
An authorization model for a distributed hypertext system,Pierangela Samarati; Elisa Bertino; Sushil Jajodia,Digital libraries support quick and efficient access to a large number of information sourcesthat are distributed but interlinked. As the amount of information to be shared grows; theneed to restrict access only to specific users or for specific usage will surely arise. Theprotection of information in digital libraries; however; is difficult because of the peculiarity ofthe hypertext paradigm which is generally used to represent information in digital libraries;together with the fact that related data in a hypertext are often distributed at different sites.We present an authorization model for distributed hypertext systems. Our model supportsauthorizations at different granularity levels; takes into consideration different types of dataand the relationships among them; and allows administrative privileges to be delegated.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data engineering,1996,118

Controlled access and dissemination of XML documents,Elisa Bertino; Silvana Castano; Elena Ferrari; Marco Mesiti,Abstract XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is becoming the most relevant standardizationeffort in the area of document representation through markup languages. Through XML; it ispossible to define complex documents; containing information at different degrees ofsensitivity. Moreover; the processes of document exchange and acquisition; which can bevery frequent in Web-based information systems; are simplified and standardized. In thisscenario; there is a strong need for policies to control and regulate the access anddissemination of XML documents. In the paper; we discuss main protection requirementsposed by XML documents and we present a set of authorization and dissemination policiesthat enable both a controlled access to XML documents in a given source and the exchangeof XML documents across different sources.,Proceedings of the 2nd international workshop on Web information and data management,1999,115

Risk-based access control systems built on fuzzy inferences,Qun Ni; Elisa Bertino; Jorge Lobo,Abstract Fuzzy inference is a promising approach to implement risk-based access controlsystems. However; its application to access control raises some novel problems that havenot been yet investigated. First; because there are many different fuzzy operations; one mustchoose the fuzzy operations that best address security requirements. Second; risk-basedaccess control; though it improves information flow and better addresses requirements fromcritical organizations; may result in damages by malicious users before mitigating steps aretaken. Third; the scalability of a fuzzy inference-based access control system isquestionable. The time required by a fuzzy inference engine to estimate risks may be quitehigh especially when there are tens of parameters and hundreds of fuzzy rules. However; anaccess control system may need to serve hundreds or thousands of users. In this paper …,Proceedings of the 5th ACM Symposium on Information; Computer and Communications Security,2010,109

An important aspect in the design of such algorithms is the identification ofsuitable evaluation criteria and the development of related benchmarks. Recent research inthe area has devoted much effort to determine a trade-off between the right to privacy andthe need of knowledge discovery. It is often the case that no privacy preserving algorithmexists that outperforms all the others on all possible criteria.

Information flow control in object-oriented systems,Pierangela Samarati; Elisa Bertino; Alessandro Ciampichetti; Sushil Jajodia,We describe a high assurance discretionary access control model for object orientedsystems. The model not only ensures protection against Trojan horses leaking information;but provides the flexibility of discretionary access control at the same time. The basic idea ofour approach is to check all information flows among objects in the system in order to blockpossible illegal flows. An illegal flow arises when information is transmitted from one objectto another object in violation of the security policy. The interaction modes among objects aretaken into account in determining illegal flows. We consider three different interaction modesthat are standard interaction modes found in the open distributed processing models. Thepaper presents formal definitions and proof of correctness of our flow control algorithm.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1997,109

A critique of the ANSI standard on role-based access control,Ninghui Li; Ji-Won Byun; Elisa Bertino,In 2004; the American National Standards Institute approved the Role-Based Access Controlstandard to fulfill" a need among government and industry purchasers of informationtechnology products for a consistent and uniform definition of role based access control(RBAC) features". Such uniform definitions give IT product vendors and customers acommon and unambiguous terminology for RBAC features; which can lead to wideradoption of RBAC and increased productivity. However; the current ANSI RBAC Standardhas several limitations; design flaws; and technical errors that; it unaddressed; could lead toconfusions among IT product vendors and customers and to RBAC implementations withdifferent semantics; thus defeating the standard's purpose.,IEEE Security & Privacy,2007,106
Access control policy combining: theory meets practice,Ninghui Li; Qihua Wang; Wahbeh Qardaji; Elisa Bertino; Prathima Rao; Jorge Lobo; Dan Lin,Abstract Many access control policy languages; eg; XACML; allow a policy to containmultiple sub-policies; and the result of the policy on a request is determined by combiningthe results of the sub-policies according to some policy combining algorithms (PCAs).Existing access control policy languages; however; do not provide a formal language forspecifying PCAs. As a result; it is difficult to extend them with new PCAs. While severalformal policy combining algebras have been proposed; they did not address importantpractical issues such as policy evaluation errors and obligations; furthermore; they cannotexpress PCAs that consider all sub-policies as a whole (eg; weak majority or strongmajority).

By federation we mean a group of organizations or service providers which havebuilt trust among each other and enable sharing of user identity information amongstthemselves. Our solution supports a step by step approach according to which an individualcan first establish a digital identity followed by a secure and protected use of such identity.We first introduce a flexible approach to establish a single sign-on (SSO) ID in a federation.Then we show how a user can leverage this SSO ID to establish certified and uncertifieduser identity attributes without the dependence on PKI for user authentication. This makesthe process more usable and enhances privacy. The major contribution of this paper is anovel solution for protection against identity theft of these identity attributes.

Preventing velocity-based linkage attacks in location-aware applications,Gabriel Ghinita; Maria Luisa Damiani; Claudio Silvestri; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Mobile devices with positioning capabilities allow users to participate in novel andexciting location-based applications. For instance; users may track the whereabouts of theiracquaintances in location-aware social networking applications; eg; GoogleLatitude.Furthermore; users can request information about landmarks in their proximity. Suchscenarios require users to report their coordinates to other parties; which may not be fullytrusted. Reporting precise locations may result in serious privacy violations; such asdisclosure of lifestyle details; sexual orientation; etc. A typical approach to preserve locationprivacy is to generate a cloaking region (CR) that encloses the user position. However; iflocations are continuously reported; an attacker can correlate CRs from multiple timestampsto accurately pinpoint the user position within a CR.

Security analysis of the SASI protocol,Tianjie Cao; Elisa Bertino; Hong Lei,The ultralightweight RFID protocols only involve simple bit-wise operations (like XOR; AND;OR; etc.) on tags. In this paper; we show that the ultralightweight strong authentication andstrong integrity (SASI) protocol has two security vulnerabilities; namely denial-of-service(DoS) and anonymity tracing based on a compromised tag. The former permanentlydisables the authentication capability of a RFID tag by destroying synchronization betweenthe tag and the RFID reader. The latter links a compromised tag with past actions performedon this tag.,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and secure Computing,2009,101
Introduction,Zoltán Dörnyei,Abstract The study of motivation to learn a second language (L2) or foreign language has ahistory over 4 decades. It is; in fact; one of the most thoroughly examined areas of secondlanguage acquisition; with several books and literally hundreds of research articles andbook chapters written on it. Yet in spite of this wealth of theorizing and research findings; it issurprising how uneven and inconsistent our knowledge of the subject is. This; I believe; hastwo main explanations:,Language learning,2003,101
On the correctness criteria of fine-grained access control in relational databases,Qihua Wang; Ting Yu; Ninghui Li; Jorge Lobo; Elisa Bertino; Keith Irwin; Ji-Won Byun,Abstract Databases are increasingly being used to store information covered byheterogeneous policies; which require support for access control with great flexibility. Thishas led to increasing interest in using fine-grained access control; where different cells in arelation may be governed by different access control rules. Although several proposals havebeen made to support fine-grained access control; there currently does not exist a formalnotion of correctness regarding the query answering procedure. In this paper; we proposesuch a formal notion of correctness in fine-grained database access control; and discusswhy existing approaches fall short in some circumstances. We then propose a labelingapproach for masking unauthorized information and a query evaluation algorithm whichbetter supports fine-grained access control. Finally; we implement our algorithm using …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,100
Temporal synchronization models for multimedia data,Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari,Multimedia information systems are considerably more complex than traditional ones in thatthey deal with very heterogeneous data such as text; video; and audio-characterized bydifferent characteristics and requirements. One of the central characteristics of multimediadata is that of being heavily time-dependent; in that they are usually related by temporalrelationships that must be maintained during playout. We discuss problems related tomodeling temporal synchronization specifications for multimedia data. We investigate thecharacteristics that a model must possess to properly express the timing relationshipsamong multimedia data; and we provide a classification for the various models proposed inthe literature. For each devised category; several examples are presented; whereas themost representative models of each category are illustrated in detail. Then; the presented …,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering,1998,99
Dependencies and separation of duty constraints in GTRBAC,James BD Joshi; Basit Shafiq; Arif Ghafoor; Elisa Bertino,Abstract A Generalized Temporal Role Based Access Control (GTRBAC) model thatcaptures an exhaustive set of temporal constraint needs for access control has recently beenproposed. GTRBAC's language constructs allow one to specify various temporal constraintson role; user-role assignments and role-permission assignments. In this paper; we identifyvarious time-constrained cardinality; control flow dependency and separation of dutyconstraints (SoDs). Such constraints allow specification of dynamically changing accesscontrol requirements that are typical in today's large systems. In addition to allowingspecification of time; the constraints introduced here also allow expressing access controlpolicies at a finer granularity. The inclusion of control flow dependency constraints allowsdefining much stricter dependency requirements that are typical in workflow types of …,Proceedings of the eighth ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2003,97
Author-χ: A Java-Based System For XML Data Protection,Elisa Bertino; M Braun; Silvana Castano; Elena Ferrari; Marco Mesiti,Abstract Author-χ is a Java-based system for access control to XML documents. Author-χimplements a discretionary access control model specifically tailored to the characteristics ofXML documents. In particular; our system allows (i) a set-oriented and single-orienteddocument protection; by supporting authorizations both at document type and documentlevel;(ii) a differentiated protection of document/document type contents by supporting multi-granularity protection objects and positive/negative authorizations;(iii) a controlledpropagation of authorizations among protection objects; by enforcing multiple propagationoptions.,*,2002,97
Secure data aggregation technique for wireless sensor networks in the presence of collusion attacks,Mohsen Rezvani; Aleksandar Ignjatovic; Elisa Bertino; Sanjay Jha,Due to limited computational power and energy resources; aggregation of data from multiplesensor nodes done at the aggregating node is usually accomplished by simple methodssuch as averaging. However such aggregation is known to be highly vulnerable to nodecompromising attacks. Since WSN are usually unattended and without tamper resistanthardware; they are highly susceptible to such attacks. Thus; ascertaining trustworthiness ofdata and reputation of sensor nodes is crucial for WSN. As the performance of very lowpower processors dramatically improves; future aggregator nodes will be capable ofperforming more sophisticated data aggregation algorithms; thus making WSN lessvulnerable. Iterative filtering algorithms hold great promise for such a purpose. Suchalgorithms simultaneously aggregate data from multiple sources and provide trust …,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,2015,95
Detecting mobile malware threats to homeland security through static analysis,Seung-Hyun Seo; Aditi Gupta; Asmaa Mohamed Sallam; Elisa Bertino; Kangbin Yim,Abstract Recent years have seen the significant increase in the popularity of smartphones.This popularity has been accompanied with an equally alarming rise in mobile malware.Recently released mobile malware targeting Android devices have been found tospecifically focus on root exploits to obtain root-level access and execute instructions from aremote server. Thus; this kind of mobile malware presents a significant threat to HomelandSecurity. This is possible because smartphones can serve as zombie devices which arethen controlled by hackers' via a C&C server. In this paper; we discuss the definingcharacteristics inherent in mobile malware and show mobile attack scenarios which arefeasible against Homeland Security. We also propose a static analysis tool; DroidAnalyzer;which identifies potential vulnerabilities of Android apps and the presence of root exploits …,Journal of Network and Computer Applications,2014,95
Access control and authorization constraints for WS-BPEL,Elisa Bertino; Jason Crampton; Federica Paci,Computerized workflow systems have attracted considerable research interest. Morerecently; there have been several XML-based languages proposed for specifying andorchestrating business processes; culminating in WS-BPEL. A significant omission from WS-BPEL is the ability to specify authorization information associating users with activities in thebusiness process and authorization constraints on the execution of activities such asseparation of duty. In this paper; we address these deficiencies by developing the RBAC-WS-BPEL and BPCL languages. The first of these provides for the specification of authorizationinformation associated with a business process specified in WS-BPEL; while BPCL providesfor the articulation of authorization constraints,Web Services; 2006.

An algebra for fine-grained integration of XACML policies,Prathima Rao; Dan Lin; Elisa Bertino; Ninghui Li; Jorge Lobo,Abstract Collaborative and distributed applications; such as dynamic coalitions andvirtualized grid computing; often require integrating access control policies of collaboratingparties. Such an integration must be able to support complex authorization specificationsand the fine-grained integration requirements that the various parties may have. In thispaper; we introduce an algebra for fine-grained integration of sophisticated policies. Thealgebra; which consists of three binary and two unary operations; is able to support thespecification of a large variety of integration constraints. To assess the expressive power ofour algebra; we introduce a notion of completeness and prove that our algebra is completewith respect to this notion. We then propose a framework that uses the algebra for the fine-grained integration of policies expressed in XACML. We also present a methodology for …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2009,94
A hybrid approach to private record linkage,Ali Inan; Murat Kantarcioglu; Elisa Bertino; Monica Scannapieco,Real-world entities are not always represented by the same set of features in different datasets. Therefore matching and linking records corresponding to the same real-world entitydistributed across these data sets is a challenging task. If the data sets contain privateinformation; the problem becomes even harder due to privacy concerns. Existing solutions ofthis problem mostly follow two approaches: sanitization techniques and cryptographictechniques. The former achieves privacy by perturbing sensitive data at the expense ofdegrading matching accuracy. The later; on the other hand; attains both privacy and highaccuracy under heavy communication and computation costs. In this paper; we propose amethod that combines these two approaches and enables users to trade off betweenprivacy; accuracy and cost. Experiments conducted on real data sets show that our …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,93
XML and data integration,Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari,XML is rapidly becoming a standard for data representation and exchange. It provides acommon format for expressing both data structures and contents. As such; it can help inintegrating structured; semistructured; and unstructured data over the Web. Still; it is wellrecognized that XML alone cannot provide a comprehensive solution to the articulatedproblem of data integration. There are still several challenges to face; including: developinga formal foundation for Web metadata standards; developing techniques and tools for thecreation; extraction; and storage of metadata; investigating the area of semanticinteroperability frameworks; and developing semantic-based tools for knowledge discovery.,IEEE internet computing,2001,92
Providing flexibility in information flow control for object oriented systems,Elena Ferrari; Pierangela Samarati; Elisa Bertino; Sushil Jajodia,This paper presents an approach to control information flow in object-oriented systems thattakes into account; besides authorizations on objects; also how the information has beenobtained and/or transmitted. These aspects are considered by allowing exceptions to therestrictions stated by the authorizations. Exceptions are specified by means of waiversassociated with methods. Two kinds of waivers are supported: invoke-waivers; specifyingexceptions applicable during a method's execution; and reply-waivers; specifyingexceptions applicable to the information returned by a method. Information flowing from oneobject into another object is subject to the different waivers of the methods enforcing thetransmission. We formally characterize information transmission and flow in a transactiontaking into consideration different interaction modes among objects. We then define …,Security and Privacy; 1997.

Integration of heterogeneous data repositories by using object-oriented views,Elisa Bertino,A discussion is given on how object-oriented techniques can be used to solve the problemof integrating semantically heterogeneous schemas. The author defines an object-orientedview mechanism which allows integrated views to be defined starting from local views whichare expressed in a uniform object-oriented data model; but still semantically heterogeneous.A view model based on the object-oriented paradigm has several advantages; since it is asemantically rich model and allows object behavior to be described by using methods. Thisallows several semantic conflicts to be solved on a structural basis; that is; the modelnaturally supports the structural mapping approach traditionally used in heterogeneousdistributed database systems. Moreover; the usage of methods allows complex mapping tobe defined; when the structural mapping cannot be used. The proposed view model uses …,Interoperability in Multidatabase Systems; 1991. IMS'91.

Supporting rbac with xacml+ owl,Rodolfo Ferrini; Elisa Bertino,Abstract XACML does not natively support RBAC and even the pecialized XACML profilesare not able to support many relevant constraints such as static and dynamic separation ofduty. Extending XACML to support such constraints; however; is an issue that requiresextensions not only to the XACML language but also to the XACML reference architectureand engine. In this paper we introduce XACML+ OWL; a framework that integrates OWLontologies and XACML policies for supporting RBAC. The basic idea is to decouple thedesign of an RBAC system by modeling the role hierarchy and the constraints with an OWLontology and the authorization policies with XACML. In doing this; we introduce newfunctions that extend policies with semantic reasoning services based on the OWL ontology.As part of such extension; we extend the reference architecture of XACML and the …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2009,89

A practical and flexible key management mechanism for trusted collaborative computing,Xukai Zou; Y-S Dai; Elisa Bertino,Trusted collaborative computing (TCC) is a new research and application paradigm. Twoimportant challenges in such a context are represented by secure information transmissionamong the collaborating parties and selective differentiated access to data among membersof collaborating groups. Addressing such challenges requires; among other things;developing techniques for secure group communication (SGQ); secure dynamicconferencing (SDC); differential access control (DIF-AC); and hierarchical access control(HAC). Cryptography and key management have been intensively investigated and widelyapplied in order to secure information. However; there is a lack of key managementmechanisms which are general and flexible enough to address all requirements arising frominformation transmission and data access.

A logical framework for reasoning on data access control policies,Elisa Bertino; Francesco Buccafurri; Elena Ferrari; Pasquale Rullo,We propose a logic formalism that naturally supports the encoding of complex securityspecifications. This formalism relies on a hierarchically structured domain made of subjects;objects and privileges. Authorizations are expressed by logic rules. The formalism supportsboth negation by failure (possibly unstratified) and true negation. The latter is used toexpress negative authorizations. It turns out that conflicts may result from a set ofauthorization rules. Dealing with such conflicts requires the knowledge of the domainstructure; such as grantor priorities and object/subject hierarchies; which is used in thedeductive process to determine which authorization prevails; if any; on the others. Often;however; conflicts are unsolvable; as they express intrinsic ambiguities. We have devisedtwo semantics as an extension of the well-founded and the stable model semantics of …,Computer Security Foundations Workshop; 1999. Proceedings of the 12th IEEE,1999,85
Database security: research and practice,Elisa Bertino; Sushil Jajodia; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract As an increasing number of organizations become dependent on access to theirdata over the Internet; the need for adequate security measures is becoming more and morecritical. The most popular security measure these days is a firewall. However; a firewall is notimmune to penetration; and it does not provide any protection of internal resources frominsiders and successful intruders. One of the requirements for the protection of internalresources is access control to ensure that all accesses are authorized according to somespecified policy. In this paper; we survey the state of the art in access control for databasesystems; discuss the main research issues; and outline possible directions for futureresearch.,*,1995,84
Structural signatures for tree data structures,Ashish Kundu; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Data sharing with multiple parties over a third-party distribution framework requiresthat both data integrity and confidentiality be assured. One of the most widely used dataorganization structures is the tree structure. When such structures encode sensitiveinformation (such as in XML documents); it is crucial that integrity and confidentiality beassured not only for the content; but also for the structure. Digital signature schemes arecommonly used to authenticate the integrity of the data. The most widely used suchtechnique for tree structures is the Merkle hash technique; which however is known to be"not hiding"; thus leading to unauthorized leakage of information. Most techniques in theliterature are based on the Merkle hash technique and thus suffer from the problem ofunauthorized information leakages.

Integration of heterogeneous database applications through an object-oriented interface,Elisa Bertino; Mauro Negri; Giuseppe Pelagatti; Licia Sbattella,Abstract The integration of different application environments; especially in the areas ofoffice automation and CIM; requires integration of data stored not only in traditionaldatabases but also in specialized file structures for graphics and complex texts. This paperproposes an approach to the development of integrated applications which is based on thecreation of an object-oriented interface on top of each data repository to be integrated. Thisapproach is shown to be more powerful than traditional approaches; and in particular to becapable of dealing with data stored in complex file structures. The feasibility of this approachis demonstrated by describing the main features of a “generalized”“integration system”based on it; and by showing how this system has been used in the integration of a complexapplication.,Information systems,1989,82
Privacy-preserving and content-protecting location based queries,Russell Paulet; Md Golam Kaosar; Xun Yi; Elisa Bertino,In this paper we present a solution to one of the location-based query problems. Thisproblem is defined as follows:(i) a user wants to query a database of location data; known asPoints Of Interest (POIs); and does not want to reveal his/her location to the server due toprivacy concerns;(ii) the owner of the location data; that is; the location server; does not wantto simply distribute its data to all users. The location server desires to have some controlover its data; since the data is its asset. We propose a major enhancement upon previoussolutions by introducing a two stage approach; where the first step is based on ObliviousTransfer and the second step is based on Private Information Retrieval; to achieve a securesolution for both parties. The solution we present is efficient and practical in many scenarios.We implement our solution on a desktop machine and a mobile device to assess the …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2014,81
Objects with multiple most specific classes,Elisa Bertino; Giovanna Guerrini,Abstract In most object-oriented data models objects must belong to a single most specificclass. This exclusive link between an instance and a class is often not adequate to modelreal-world situations. In this paper; we present an approach where objects can belong toseveral most specific classes. We formally address how the resulting conflicts can behandled; both for structural and behavioral components of objects. In particular; we formalizea notion of context and characterize the state of an object in terms of the set of its mostspecific classes. Moreover; we discuss two different dispatching approaches; one allowingcontext-dependent behavior; the other one ensuring behavior identity.,European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming,1995,81
An indexing techniques for object-oriented databases,Elisa Bertino,The basic characteristics of object-oriented data models and query languages aresummarized. An indexing technique is presented that supports an efficient evaluation ofnested predicates for queries involving class hierarchies. A preliminary comparison of theproposed indexing technique with other techniques is presented. A first extension of thiswork is to define cost formulas for the proposed index organization and to compare it withother organizations; such as the multi-index and inherited-multi-index organizations. Asecond extension is to define indexing techniques to support alternative predicates onproperties that are semantically equivalent. In addition to these; an important issue concernsindexing support for the use of methods in queries.,Data Engineering; 1991. Proceedings. Seventh International Conference on,1991,81

Thelanguage provides a flexible way of qualifying the parties involved in the negotiation; whichrelies on a distinction between credentials and declarations. Additionally; it provides anexpressive XML encoding of disclosure policies; where a disclosure policy regulates thedisclosure of a resource by imposing conditions on both credentials and negotiations. Thelanguage we provide has been especially conceived for handling multiple andheterogeneous credentials and it is flexible enough to express a wide range of protectionrequirements.

PP-trust-X: A system for privacy preserving trust negotiations,Anna Squicciarini; Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Federica Paci; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract Trust negotiation is a promising approach for establishing trust in open systems; inwhich sensitive interactions may often occur between entities with no prior knowledge ofeach other. Although; to date several trust negotiation systems have been proposed; none ofthem fully address the problem of privacy preservation. Today; privacy is one of the majorconcerns of users when exchanging information through the Web and thus we believe thattrust negotiation systems must effectively address privacy issues in order to be widelyapplicable. For these reasons; in this paper; we investigate privacy in the context of trustnegotiations. We propose a set of privacy-preserving features for inclusion in any trustnegotiation system; such as the support for the P3P standard; as well as a number ofinnovative features; such as a novel format for encoding digital credentials specifically …,ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC),2007,78

In today's increasingly competitive business environment; more and moreleading organizations are building Web-based infrastructures to gain the strategicadvantages of collaborative networking. However; to facilitate collaboration and fully exploitsuch infrastructures; organizations must identify each user in the collaborative network aswell as the resources each user is authorized to access.

Using anonymized data for classification,Ali Inan; Murat Kantarcioglu; Elisa Bertino,In recent years; anonymization methods have emerged as an important tool to preserveindividual privacy when releasing privacy sensitive data sets. This interest in anonymizationtechniques has resulted in a plethora of methods for anonymizing data under differentprivacy and utility assumptions. At the same time; there has been little research addressinghow to effectively use the anonymized data for data mining in general and for distributeddata mining in particular. In this paper; we propose a new approach for building classifiersusing anonymized data by modeling anonymized data as uncertain data. In our method; wedo not assume any probability distribution over the data. Instead; we propose collecting allnecessary statistics during anonymization and releasing these together with the anonymizeddata. We show that releasing such statistics does not violate anonymity.

An approach to evaluate policy similarity,Dan Lin; Prathima Rao; Elisa Bertino; Jorge Lobo,Abstract Recent collaborative applications and enterprises very often need to efficientlyintegrate their access control policies. An important step in policy integration is to analyzethe similarity of policies. Existing approaches to policy similarity analysis are mainly basedon logical reasoning and boolean function comparison. Such approaches arecomputationally expensive and do not scale well for large heterogeneous distributedenvironments (like Grid computing systems). In this paper; we propose a policy similaritymeasure as a filter phase for policy similarity analysis. This measure provides a lightweightapproach to pre-compile a large amount of policies and only return the most similar policiesfor further evaluation. In the paper we formally define the measure; by taking into accountboth the case of categorical attributes and numeric attributes.

A formal model of views for object-oriented database systems,Giovanna Guerrini; Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania; Jesus Garcia-Molina,The de nition of a view mechanism is an important issue for object-oriented databasesystems; in order to provide a number of features that are crucial for the development ofadvanced applications. Due to the complexity of the data model; the object-orientedparadigm introduces new problems in the de nition of a view mechanism. Severalapproaches have been de ned; each de ning a particular view mechanism tailored to a setof functionalities that the view mechanism should support. In particular; views can be usedas shorthand in queries; can support the de nition of external schemas; can be used forcontent-dependent authorization; and; nally; can support some form of schema evolution.

RBAC models—concepts and trends,Elisa Bertino,Abstract A key function in any information security infrastructure is represented by accesscontrol which concerns the ways according to which users can access resources in acomputer systems. Access control is one of the most pervasive security mechanisms in usetoday and is present in almost all systems; from operating systems to database managementsystems. Access control is usually based on access permits; also called authorizations;specifying which subjects can access which objects for performing which actions. Accesscontrol; however; imposes great administrative and architectural challenges and alsorequires careful design. In particular; a relevant problem; especially when dealing with largesystems; is represented by the complexity of access control administration.

In such acontext; a fundamental role is played by the access control system (ACS) that establisheswhich subjects are authorized to perform which operations on which objects. Subjects areindividuals or programs or other entities requiring access to the protected resources. Whendealing with protection of information; the resources of interest are typically objects thatrecord information; such as files in an operating system; tuples in a relational database; or acomplex object in an object database.

Privacy preserving delegated access control in public clouds,Mohamed Nabeel; Elisa Bertino,Current approaches to enforce fine-grained access control on confidential data hosted in thecloud are based on fine-grained encryption of the data. Under such approaches; dataowners are in charge of encrypting the data before uploading them on the cloud and re-encrypting the data whenever user credentials change. Data owners thus incur highcommunication and computation costs. A better approach should delegate the enforcementof fine-grained access control to the cloud; so to minimize the overhead at the data owners;while assuring data confidentiality from the cloud. We propose an approach; based on twolayers of encryption; that addresses such requirement. Under our approach; the data ownerperforms a coarse-grained encryption; whereas the cloud performs a fine-grained encryptionon top of the owner encrypted data.

An access control language for a general provenance model,Qun Ni; Shouhuai Xu; Elisa Bertino; Ravi Sandhu; Weili Han,Abstract Provenance access control has been recognized as one of the most importantcomponents in an enterprise-level provenance system. However; it has only received littleattention in the context of data security research. One important challenge in provenanceaccess control is the lack of an access control language that supports its specificrequirements; eg; the support of both fine-grained policies and personal preferences; anddecision aggregation from different applicable policies. In this paper; we propose an accesscontrol language tailored to these requirements.,Workshop on Secure Data Management,2009,70

Collaboration enables domains to effectively share resources; however it introducesseveral security and privacy challenges. Managing security in the absence of a centralmediator is even more challenging. In this paper; we propose a distributed secureinteroperability framework for mediator-free collaboration environments. We introduce theidea of secure access paths which enables domains to make localized access controldecisions without having global view of the collaboration. We also present a pathauthentication technique for proving path authenticity. Furthermore; we present both aproactive and on-demand path discovery algorithms that enable domains to securelydiscover paths in the collaboration environment.,Proceedings of the 12th ACM conference on Computer and communications security,2005,69

A temporal authorization model,Elisa Bertino; Claudio Bettini; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract This paper presents a discretionary access control model in which authorizationscontain temporal information. This information can be used to specify temporal intervals ofvalidity for authorizations and temporal dependencies among authorizations. A formaldefinition of those concepts is presented in the paper; in terms of their interpretation in firstorder logic.

Mining roles with multiple objectives,Ian Molloy; Hong Chen; Tiancheng Li; Qihua Wang; Ninghui Li; Elisa Bertino; Seraphin Calo; Jorge Lobo,Abstract With the growing adoption of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in commercialsecurity and identity management products; how to facilitate the process of migrating a non-RBAC system to an RBAC system has become a problem with significant business impact.Researchers have proposed to use data mining techniques to discover roles to complementthe costly top-down approaches for RBAC system construction. An important problem is howto construct RBAC systems with low complexity. In this article; we define the notion ofweighted structural complexity measure and propose a role mining algorithm that minesRBAC systems with low structural complexity. Another key problem that has not beenadequately addressed by existing role mining approaches is how to discover roles withsemantic meanings. In this article; we study the problem in two primary settings with …,ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC),2010,68
An efficient time-bound hierarchical key management scheme for secure broadcasting,Elisa Bertino; Ning Shang; Samuel S Wagstaff Jr,In electronic subscription and pay TV systems; data can be organized and encrypted usingsymmetric key algorithms according to predefined time periods and user privileges and thenbroadcast to users. This requires an efficient way of managing the encryption keys. In thisscenario; time-bound key management schemes for a hierarchy were proposed by Tzengand Chien in 2002 and 2005; respectively. Both schemes are insecure against collusionattacks. In this paper; we propose a new key assignment scheme for access control; which isboth efficient and secure. Elliptic-curve cryptography is deployed in this scheme. We alsoprovide the analysis of the scheme with respect to security and efficiency issues.,IEEE transactions on dependable and secure computing,2008,68
Access control enforcement for conversation-based web services,Massimo Mecella; Mourad Ouzzani; Federica Paci; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Service Oriented Computing is emerging as the main approach to build distributedenterprise applications on the Web. The widespread use of Web services is hindered by thelack of adequate security and privacy support. In this paper; we present a novel frameworkfor enforcing access control in conversation-based Web services. Our approach takes intoaccount the conversational nature of Web services. This is in contrast with existingapproaches to access control enforcement that assume a Web service as a set ofindependent operations. Furthermore; our approach achieves a tradeoff between the needto protect Web service's access control policies and the need to disclose to clients theportion of access control policies related to the conversations they are interested in. This isimportant to avoid situations where the client cannot progress in the conversation due to …,Proceedings of the 15th international conference on World Wide Web,2006,68
X-gtrbac admin: A decentralized administration model for enterprise-wide access control,Rafae Bhatti; Basit Shafiq; Elisa Bertino; Arif Ghafoor; James BD Joshi,Abstract The modern enterprise spans several functional units or administrative domainswith diverse authorization requirements. Access control policies in an enterpriseenvironment typically express these requirements as authorization constraints. Whiledesirable for access control; constraints can lead to conflicts in the overall policy in amultidomain environment. The administration problem for enterprise-wide access control;therefore; not only includes authorization management for users and resources within asingle domain but also conflict resolution among heterogeneous access control policies ofmultiple domains to allow secure interoperation within the enterprise.

A temporal key management scheme for secure broadcasting of XML documents,Elisa Bertino; Barbara Carminati; Elena Ferrari,Abstract Secure broadcasting of web documents is becoming a crucial need for many web-based applications. Under the broadcast document dissemination strategy a web documentsource periodically broad-casts (portions of) its documents to a possibly large community ofsubjects; without the need of explicit subject requests. By secure broadcasting we mean thatthe delivery of information to sub-jects must obey the access control policies of the documentsource. Since different subjects may have the right to access different portions of the samedocument; enforcing secure broadcasting requires to efficiently manage a large number ofdifferent physical views of the requested document and sending them to the proper subjects.In this paper we present an approach to secure broadcasting of web documents; based onthe use of encryption techniques; and supporting the specification of fine-grained …,Proceedings of the 9th ACM conference on Computer and communications security,2002,67
An efficient certificateless encryption for secure data sharing in public clouds,Seung-Hyun Seo; Mohamed Nabeel; Xiaoyu Ding; Elisa Bertino,We propose a mediated certificateless encryption scheme without pairing operations forsecurely sharing sensitive information in public clouds. Mediated certificateless public keyencryption (mCL-PKE) solves the key escrow problem in identity based encryption andcertificate revocation problem in public key cryptography. However; existing mCL-PKEschemes are either inefficient because of the use of expensive pairing operations orvulnerable against partial decryption attacks. In order to address the performance andsecurity issues; in this paper; we first propose a mCL-PKE scheme without using pairingoperations. We apply our mCL-PKE scheme to construct a practical solution to the problemof sharing sensitive information in public clouds. The cloud is employed as a secure storageas well as a key generation center. In our system; the data owner encrypts the sensitive …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,66
A provenance based mechanism to identify malicious packet dropping adversaries in sensor networks,Salmin Sultana; Elisa Bertino; Mohamed Shehab,Malicious packet dropping attack is a major security threat to the data traffic in the sensornetwork; since it reduces the legal network throughput and may hinder the propagation ofsensitive data. Dealing with this attack is challenging since the unreliable wirelesscommunication feature and resource constraints of the sensor network may causecommunication failure and mislead to the incorrect decision about the presence of suchattack. In this paper; we propose a data provenance based mechanism to detect the attackand identify the source of attack ie the malicious node. For this purpose; we utilize thecharacteristics of the watermarking based secure provenance transmission mechanism thatwe proposed earlier and rely on the inter-packet timing characteristics after the provenanceembedding. The scheme consists of three phases (i) Packet Loss Detection (ii) …,Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW); 2011 31st International Conference on,2011,66
Conditional privacy-aware role based access control,Qun Ni; Dan Lin; Elisa Bertino; Jorge Lobo,Abstract Privacy is considered critical for all organizations needing to manage individualrelated information. As such; there is an increasing need for access control models whichcan adequately support the specification and enforcement of privacy policies. In this paper;we propose a model; referred to as Conditional Privacy-aware Role Based Access Control(P-RBAC); which supports expressive condition languages and flexible relations amongpermission assignments for more complex privacy policies. Efficient algorithms for detectingconflicts; redundancies; and indeterminism for a set of permission assignments arepresented. In the paper we also extend Conditional P-RBAC to Universal P-RBAC by takinginto account hierarchical relations among roles; data and purposes. In comparison withother approaches; such as P3P; EPAL; and XACML; our work has achieved both …,European Symposium on Research in Computer Security,2007,66

Achieving privacy in trust negotiations with an ontology-based approach,Anna Cinzia Squicciarini; Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Indrakshi Ray,The increasing use of Internet in a variety of distributed multiparty interactions andtransactions with strong real-time requirements has pushed the search for solutions to theproblem of attribute-based digital interactions. A promising solution today is represented byautomated trust negotiation systems. Trust negotiation systems allow subjects in differentsecurity domains to securely exchange protected resources and services. These trustnegotiation systems; however; by their nature; may represent a threat to privacy in thatcredentials; exchanged during negotiations; often contain sensitive personal information thatmay need to be selectively released. In this paper; we address the problem of preservingprivacy in trust negotiations.

A privacy-enhancing content-based publish/subscribe system using scalar product preserving transformations,Sunoh Choi; Gabriel Ghinita; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Users of content-based publish/subscribe systems (CBPS) are interested inreceiving data items with values that satisfy certain conditions. Each user submits a list ofsubscription specifications to a broker; which routes data items from publishers to users.When a broker receives a notification that contains a value from a publisher; it forwards itonly to the subscribers whose requests match the value. However; in many applications; thedata published are confidential; and their contents must not be revealed to brokers.Furthermore; a user's subscription may contain sensitive information that must be protectedfrom brokers. Therefore; a difficult challenge arises: how to route publisher data to theappropriate subscribers without the intermediate brokers learning the plain text values of thenotifications and subscriptions. To that extent; brokers must be able to perform operations …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2010,64
D-algebra for composing access control policy decisions,Qun Ni; Elisa Bertino; Jorge Lobo,Abstract This paper proposes a D-algebra to compose decisions from multiple accesscontrol policies. Compared to other algebra-based approaches aimed at policy composition;D-algebra is the only one that satisfies both functional completeness (any possible decisionmatrix can be expressed by a D-algebra formula) and computational effectiveness (aformula can be computed efficiently given any decision matrix). The D-algebra has severalrelevant applications in the context of access control policies; namely the analysis of policylanguages decision mechanisms; and the development of tools for policy authoring andenforcement.,Proceedings of the 4th International Symposium on Information; Computer; and Communications Security,2009,64
An access-control framework for WS-BPEL,Federica Paci; Elisa Bertino; Jason Crampton,Abstract Business processes; the next-generation workflows; have attracted considerableresearch interest in the last 15 years. More recently; several XML-based languages havebeen proposed for specifying and orchestrating business processes; resulting in the WS-BPEL language. Even if WS-BPEL has been developed to specify automated businessprocesses that orchestrate activities of multiple Web services; there are many applicationsand situations requiring that people be considered as additional participants who caninfluence the execution of a process. Significant omissions from WS-BPEL are thespecification of activities that require interactions with humans to be completed; calledhuman activities; and the specification of authorization information associating users withhuman activities in a WS-BPEL business process and authorization constraints; such as …,International Journal of Web Services Research,2008,64

A security punctuation framework for enforcing access control on streaming data,Rimma V Nehme; Elke A Rundensteiner; Elisa Bertino,The management of privacy and security in the context of data stream management systems(DSMS) remains largely an unaddressed problem to date. Unlike in traditional DBMSswhere access control policies are persistently stored on the server and tend to remainstable; in streaming applications the contexts and with them the access control policies onthe real-time data may rapidly change. A person entering a casino may want to immediatelyblock others from knowing his current whereabouts. We thus propose a novel" stream-centric" approach; where security restrictions are not persistently stored on the DSMS server;but rather streamed together with the data. Here; the access control policies are expressedvia security constraints (called security punctuations; or short; sps) and are embedded intodata streams. The advantages of the sp model include flexibility; dynamicity and speed of …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,63
Profiling database application to detect sql injection attacks,Elisa Bertino; Ashish Kamra; James P Early,Countering threats to an organization's internal databases from database applications is animportant area of research. In this paper; we propose a novel framework based on anomalydetection techniques; to detect malicious behaviour of database application programs.Specifically; we create a fingerprint of an application program based on SQL queriessubmitted by it to a database. We then use association rule mining techniques on thisfingerprint to extract useful rules. These rules succinctly represent the normal behaviour ofthe database application. We then apply an anomaly detection algorithm to detect queriesthat do not conform to these rules. We further demonstrate how this model can be used todetect SQL Injection attacks on databases. We show the validity and usefulness of ourapproach on synthetically generated datasets and SQL Injected queries. Experimental …,Performance; Computing; and Communications Conference; 2007.

Effective key management in dynamic wireless sensor networks,Seung-Hyun Seo; Jongho Won; Salmin Sultana; Elisa Bertino,Recently; wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been deployed for a wide variety ofapplications; including military sensing and tracking; patient status monitoring; traffic flowmonitoring; where sensory devices often move between different locations. Securing dataand communications requires suitable encryption key protocols. In this paper; we propose acertificateless-effective key management (CL-EKM) protocol for secure communication indynamic WSNs characterized by node mobility. The CL-EKM supports efficient key updateswhen a node leaves or joins a cluster and ensures forward and backward key secrecy. Theprotocol also supports efficient key revocation for compromised nodes and minimizes theimpact of a node compromise on the security of other communication links.

EXAM: a comprehensive environment for the analysis of access control policies,Dan Lin; Prathima Rao; Elisa Bertino; Ninghui Li; Jorge Lobo,Abstract Policy integration and inter-operation is often a crucial requirement when partieswith different access control policies need to participate in collaborative applications andcoalitions. Such requirement is even more difficult to address for dynamic large-scalecollaborations; in which the number of access control policies to analyze and compare canbe quite large. An important step in policy integration and inter-operation is to analyze thesimilarity of policies. Policy similarity can sometimes also be a pre-condition for establishinga collaboration; in that a party may enter a collaboration with another party only if thepolicies enforced by the other party match or are very close to its own policies. Existingapproaches to the problem of analyzing and comparing access control policies are verylimited; in that they only deal with some special cases. By recognizing that a suitable …,International Journal of Information Security,2010,61
Robust multi-factor authentication for fragile communications,Xinyi Huang; Yang Xiang; Elisa Bertino; Jianying Zhou; Li Xu,In large-scale systems; user authentication usually needs the assistance from a remotecentral authentication server via networks.

This has raised serious concerns in systems which need robust authentication inemergency situations. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. In a slow connectionsituation; we present a secure generic multi-factor authentication protocol to speed up thewhole authentication process.

Anonymous geo-forwarding in manets through location cloaking,Xiaoxin Wu; Jun Liu; Xiaoyan Hong; Elisa Bertino,In this paper; we address the problem of destination anonymity for applications in mobile adhoc networks where geographic information is ready for use in both ad hoc routing andInternet services. Geographic forwarding becomes a lightweight routing protocol in favor ofthe scenarios. Traditionally the anonymity of an entity of interest can be achieved by hiding itamong a group of other entities with similar characteristics; ie; an anonymity set. In mobilead hoc networks; generating and maintaining an anonymity set for any ad hoc node ischallenging because of the node mobility; consequently the dynamic network topology. Wepropose protocols that use the destination position to generate a geographic area called ananonymity zone (AZ). A packet for a destination is delivered to all the nodes in the AZ; whichmake up the anonymity set. The size of the anonymity set may decrease because nodes …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2008,60
Efficient privacy preserving content based publish subscribe systems,Mohamed Nabeel; Ning Shang; Elisa Bertino,Abstract The ability to seamlessly scale on demand has made Content-Based Publish-Subscribe (CBPS) systems the choice of distributing messages/documents produced byContent Publishers to many Subscribers through Content Brokers. Most of the currentsystems assume that Content Brokers are trusted for the confidentiality of the data publishedby Content Publishers and the privacy of the subscriptions; which specify their interests;made by Subscribers. However; with the increased use of technologies; such as serviceoriented architectures and cloud computing; essentially outsourcing the broker functionalityto third-party providers; one can no longer assume the trust relationship to hold. Theproblem of providing privacy/confidentiality in CBPS systems is challenging; since thesolution to the problem should allow Content Brokers to make routing decisions based on …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies,2012,59
Towards privacy preserving access control in the cloud,Mohamed Nabeel; Elisa Bertino; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham,It is very costly and cumbersome to manage database systems in-house especially for smallor medium organizations. Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) hosted in the cloud provides anattractive solution; which is flexible; reliable; easy and economical to operate; for suchorganizations. However security and privacy issues concerning the storage of the data in thecloud and access via the Internet have been major concerns for many organizations. Thedata and the human resources are the life blood of any organization. Hence; they should bestrongly protected. In this paper; we identify the challenges in securing DaaS model andpropose a system called CloudMask that lays the foundation for organizations to enjoy allthe benefits of hosting their data in the cloud while at the same time supporting fine-grainedand flexible access control for shared data hosted in the cloud.,Collaborative Computing: Networking; Applications and Worksharing (CollaborateCom); 2011 7th International Conference on,2011,59

We present the notion of differenttypes of role hierarchies based on the permission-inheritance and role activation semantics.In particular; we look at how new hierarchical relations between a pair of roles that are notdirectly related can be derived through other well-defined hierarchically related roles.

Single-database private information retrieval from fully homomorphic encryption,Xun Yi; Mohammed Golam Kaosar; Russell Paulet; Elisa Bertino,Private Information Retrieval (PIR) allows a user to retrieve the ith bit of an n-bit databasewithout revealing to the database server the value of i. In this paper; we present a PIRprotocol with the communication complexity of O (γ logn) bits; where-y is the ciphertext size.Furthermore; we extend the PIR protocol to a private block retrieval (PBR) protocol; a naturaland more practical extension of PIR in which the user retrieves a block of bits; instead ofretrieving single bit. Our protocols are built on the state-of-the-art fully homomorphicencryption (FHE) techniques and provide privacy for the user if the underlying FHE schemeis semantically secure. The total communication complexity of our PBR is O (γ logm+ γn/m)bits; where m is the number of blocks. The total computation complexity of our PBR is O (mlogm) modular multiplications plus O (n= 2) modular additions.

Privacy preserving delegated access control in the storage as a service model,Mohamed Nabeel; Elisa Bertino,Current approaches for enforcing fine-grained access control and confidentiality to sensitivedata hosted in the cloud are based on selectively encrypting the data before uploading it tothe cloud. In such an approach; organizations have to enforce authorization policies throughencryption. They thus incur high communication and computation cost to manage keys andencryptions whenever user credentials or organizational authorization policies change.Ideally; organizations should use encryption only in order to hide the data from the cloud;whereas the cloud should be in charge of enforcing authorization policies on the hiddendata in order to minimize the overhead at organizations. In this paper; we propose a novelapproach for delegating privacy-preserving fine-grained access enforcement to the cloud.Our approach is based on a recent key management scheme that allows users whose …,Information Reuse and Integration (IRI); 2012 IEEE 13th International Conference on,2012,56
Approximate and exact hybrid algorithms for private nearest-neighbor queries with database protection,Gabriel Ghinita; Panos Kalnis; Murat Kantarcioglu; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Mobile devices with global positioning capabilities allow users to retrieve points ofinterest (POI) in their proximity. To protect user privacy; it is important not to disclose exactuser coordinates to un-trusted entities that provide location-based services. Currently; thereare two main approaches to protect the location privacy of users:(i) hiding locations insidecloaking regions (CRs) and (ii) encrypting location data using private information retrieval(PIR) protocols. Previous work focused on finding good trade-offs between privacy andperformance of user protection techniques; but disregarded the important issue of protectingthe POI dataset D. For instance; location cloaking requires large-sized CRs; leading toexcessive disclosure of POIs (O (| D|) in the worst case).

A hierarchical access control model for video database systems,Elisa Bertino; Jianping Fan; Elena Ferrari; Mohand-Said Hacid; Ahmed K Elmagarmid; Xingquan Zhu,Abstract Content-based video database access control is becoming very important; but itdepends on the progresses of the following related research issues:(a) efficient videoanalysis for supporting semantic visual concept representation;(b) effective video databaseindexing structure;(c) the development of suitable video database models; and (d) thedevelopment of access control models tailored to the characteristics of video data. In thispaper; we propose a novel approach to support multilevel access control in videodatabases.

An approach to authorization modeling in object-oriented database systems,Elisa Bertino; Hans Weigand,Abstract Authorization is an important functionality that every data management systemshould provide. An authorization mechanism allows different access rights on data items tobe selectively assigned to users. Authorization models and mechanisms have been widelyinvestigated in the framework of traditional database systems. The extension of thosemodels and mechanisms to advanced data management systems is quite complex; becausethose systems are characterized by data models with a larger number of semantic constructsthan traditional models; like the relational one. A first authorization model defined for object-oriented (and semantic) database systems has been presented in [20]. In this paper wepresent an authorization model that substantially extends and revises that model. The mostsignificant extension concerns the support for content-dependent authorization; which …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,1994,56
Secure provenance transmission for streaming data,Salmin Sultana; Mohamed Shehab; Elisa Bertino,Many application domains; such as real-time financial analysis; e-healthcare systems;sensor networks; are characterized by continuous data streaming from multiple sources andthrough intermediate processing by multiple aggregators. Keeping track of data provenancein such highly dynamic context is an important requirement; since data provenance is a keyfactor in assessing data trustworthiness which is crucial for many applications. Provenancemanagement for streaming data requires addressing several challenges; including theassurance of high processing throughput; low bandwidth consumption; storage efficiencyand secure transmission. In this paper; we propose a novel approach to securely transmitprovenance for streaming data (focusing on sensor network) by embedding provenance intothe interpacket timing domain while addressing the above mentioned issues.

Fine-grained role-based delegation in presence of the hybrid role hierarchy,James BD Joshi; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Delegation of authority is an important process that needs to be captured by anyaccess control model. In role-based access control models; delegation of authority involvesdelegating roles that a user can assume or the set of permissions that he can acquire; toother users. Several role-based delegation models have been proposed in the literature.However; these models consider delegation in presence of the general hierarchy type.Multiple hierarchy types have been proposed in the context of Generalized Temporal Role-based Access Control (GTRBAC) model; where it has been shown that multiple hierarchysemantics is desirable to express fine-grained access control policies.

A multigranular spatiotemporal data model,Elena Camossi; Michela Bertolotto; Elisa Bertino; Giovanna Guerrini,Abstract A large percentage of data managed by a variety of different application domainshas spatiotemporal characteristics. Unfortunately; traditional geographical informationsystems do not allow for an easy representation of temporal aspects of spatial data.Moreover; they do not usually support the representation of data at multiple levels ofgranularity. In this paper we present a multigranular spatiotemporal data model. Our modelextends the ODMG model with multiple spatial and temporal granularities. In particular; themodel allows for an uniform management of two kinds of spatiotemporal objects: movingentities (eg cars; planes; etc.) and temporal maps (ie; maps representing the change overtime of a given geographic area). It also provides a framework for mapping the movement ofan entity such as a car onto an underlying geographic area.

Homomorphic encryption and applications,Xun Yi; Russell Paulet; Elisa Bertino,Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that allows specific types of computations tobe carried out on ciphertext and generate an encrypted result that; when decrypted; matchesthe result of operations performed on the plaintext. This is a desirable feature in moderncommunication system architectures. The homomorphic property of various cryptosystemscan be used to create secure voting systems and private information retrieval schemes andenable widespread use of cloud computing by ensuring the confidentiality of processeddata.

Enforcing spatial constraints for mobile RBAC systems,Michael S Kirkpatrick; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Proposed models for spatially-aware extensions of role-based access control(RBAC) combine the administrative and security advantages of RBAC with the dynamicnature of mobile and pervasive computing systems. However; implementing systems thatenforce these models poses a number of challenges. As a solution; we propose anarchitecture for designing such a system. The architecture is based on an enhanced RBACmodel that supports location-based access control policies by incorporating spatialconstraints. Enforcing spatially-aware RBAC policies in a mobile environment requiresaddressing several challenges. First; one must guarantee the integrity of a user's locationduring an access request. We adopt a proximity-based solution using Near-FieldCommunication (NFC) technology.

Index configuration in object-oriented databases,Elisa Bertino,Abstract In relational databases; an attribute of a relation can have only a single primitivevalue; making it cumbersome to model complex objects. The object-oriented paradigmremoves this difficulty by introducing the notion of nested objects; which allows the value ofan object attribute to be another object or a set of other objects. This means that a classconsists of a set of attributes; and the values of the attributes are objects that belong to otherclasses; that is; the definition of a class forms a hierarchy of classes. All attributes of thenested classes are nested attributes of the root of the hierarchy. A branch of such hierarchyis called a path. In this article; we address the problem of index configuration for a givenpath. We first summarize some basic concepts; and introduce the concept of indexconfiguration for a path. Then we present cost formulas to evaluate the costs of the …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,1994,53
Path-index: An approach to the efficient execution of object-oriented queries,Elisa Bertino; Carmine Guglielmina,Abstract This paper addresses the prolem of efficiently evaluating nested predicates inobject-oriented databases. In a previous paper [4] we have introduced the notion of pathindex that associates the values of a nested attribute with the instances of the class root of agiven aggregation hierarchy. In that paper we have evaluated the performance of the pathindex in the case of queries containing a single predicate. In the present paper we considerthe use of the path index in the framework of more general queries containing severalpredicates.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,1993,53
The SCIFC model for information flow control in web service composition,Wei She; I-Ling Yen; Bhavani Thuraisingham; Elisa Bertino,Existing web service access control models focus on individual web services; and do notconsider service composition. In composite services; a major issue is information flowcontrol. Critical information may flow from one service to another in a service chain throughrequests and responses and there is no mechanism for verifying that the flow complies withthe access control policies. In this paper; we propose an innovative access control model toempower the services in a service chain to control the flow of their sensitive information. Ourmodel supports information flow control through a back-check procedure and pass-oncertificates. We also introduce additional factors such as the carry-along policy; securityclass; and transformation factor; to improve the protocol efficiency. A formal analysis is alsopresented to show the power and complexity of our protocol.,Web Services; 2009. ICWS 2009. IEEE International Conference on,2009,52
A system to specify and manage multipolicy access control models,Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania; Elena Ferrari; Paolo Perlasca,This paper describes the architecture and the core specification language of an extensibleaccess control system; called MACS-Multipolicy Access Control System. Several accesscontrol models are supported. by the proposed system; including the mandatory model; aflexible discretionary model; and RBAC. In addition; by using the core specificationlanguage; users can define their own access control models. The language iscomplemented by a number of tools supporting users in the tasks of model specification andanalysis; and authorization management. The proposed system is a multipolicy system inthat it allows one to apply different policies to different partitions of the set of objects to beprotected. Therefore; different access control policies can co-exist; thus enhancing theflexibility of the system.,Policies for Distributed Systems and Networks; 2002. Proceedings. Third International Workshop on,2002,52
High assurance discretionary access control for object bases,Elisa Bertino; Pierangela Samarati; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract Discretionary access control; based on checking access requests against users'authorizations; does not provide any way of restricting the usage of information once it hasbeen “legally” accessed. This makes discretionary systems vulnerable to Trojan Horsesmaliciously leaking information. Therefore the need arises for providing additional controlslimiting the indiscriminate flow of information in the system. This paper proposes a messagefilter complementing discretionary authorization control in object-oriented systems to limit thevulnerability of authorization systems to Trojan Horses. The encapsulation property of theobject-oriented data model; which requires that access to objects be possible only throughdefined methods; makes information flow in such systems have a very concrete and naturalembodiment in the form of messages and their replies. As a result; information information …,Proceedings of the 1st ACM conference on Computer and communications security,1993,51
Context-based access control systems for mobile devices,Bilal Shebaro; Oyindamola Oluwatimi; Elisa Bertino,Mobile Android applications often have access to sensitive data and resources on the userdevice. Misuse of this data by malicious applications may result in privacy breaches andsensitive data leakage. An example would be a malicious application surreptitiouslyrecording a confidential business conversation. The problem arises from the fact thatAndroid users do not have control over the application capabilities once the applicationshave been granted the requested privileges upon installation. In many cases; however;whether an application may get a privilege depends on the specific user context and thus weneed a context-based access control mechanism by which privileges can be dynamicallygranted or revoked to applications based on the specific context of the user. In this paper wepropose such an access control mechanism. Our implementation of context differentiates …,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,2015,50

Design and implementation of an intrusion response system for relational databases,Ashish Kamra; Elisa Bertino,The intrusion response component of an overall intrusion detection system is responsible forissuing a suitable response to an anomalous request. We propose the notion of databaseresponse policies to support our intrusion response system tailored for a DBMS. Ourinteractive response policy language makes it very easy for the database administrators tospecify appropriate response actions for different circumstances depending upon the natureof the anomalous request. The two main issues that we address in context of such responsepolicies are that of policy matching; and policy administration. For the policy matchingproblem; we propose two algorithms that efficiently search the policy database for policiesthat match an anomalous request. We also extend the PostgreSQL DBMS with our policymatching mechanism; and report experimental results. The experimental evaluation …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2011,48
A framework for specification and verification of generalized spatio-temporal role based access control model,Arjmand Samuel; Arif Ghafoor; Elisa Bertino,Abstract We are witnessing an exponential growth in the use of mobile computing devicessuch as laptops; PDAs and mobile phones; accessing critical data while on the move. Theneed to safeguard against unauthorized access to data in a mobile world is a pressingrequirement. Access to critical data depends on users' identity as well as environmentalparameters such as time and location. While temporal based access control models are wellsuited for enforcing access control decisions on fixed users; they loose their effectivenesswhen users employing mobile computing devices are not fixed in space and are movingfrom a secure locale to an insecure one; or vice versa.

Exception-based information flow control in object-oriented systems,Elisa Bertino; Sabrina De Capitani Di Vimercati; Elena Ferrari; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract We present an approach to control information flow in object-oriented systems. Thedecision of whether an information flow is permitted or denied depends on both theauthorizations specified on the objects and the process by which information is obtained andtransmitted. Depending on the specific computations; a process accessing sensitiveinformation could still be allowed to release information to users who are not allowed todirectly access it. Exceptions to the permissions and restrictions stated by the authorizationsare specified by means of exceptions associated with methods. Two kinds of exceptions areconsidered: invoke exceptions; applicable during a mehtod execution and reply exceptionsapplicable to the information returned by a method. Information flowing from one object intoanother or returned to the user is subject to the different exceptions specified for the …,ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC),1998,48
Towards a logical-object oriented programming language for databases,Elisa Bertino; Danilo Montesi,Abstract This paper presents an approach for the integration of logic and object-orientedparadigms. A hierarchy of languages is defined starting from a logical notion of object;based on the concept of evolving theory. They are based on LDL language; which capturesthe notion of state evolution. In order to achieve the mapping from object-oriented paradigmto a logical-object oriented programming language; the notions of object; message passing;class and inheritance are reinterpreted in the context of logic programming.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,1992,48
Privacy-preserving incremental data dissemination,Ji-Won Byun; Tiancheng Li; Elisa Bertino; Ninghui Li; Yonglak Sohn,Abstract Although the k-anonymity and ℓ-diversity models have led to a number of valuableprivacy-protecting techniques and algorithms; the existing solutions are currently limited tostatic data release. That is; it is assumed that a complete dataset is available at the time ofdata release. This assumption implies a significant shortcoming; as in many applicationsdata collection is rather a continual process. Moreover; the assumption entails “one-time”data dissemination; thus; it does not adequately address today's strong demand forimmediate and up-to-date information. In this paper; we consider incremental datadissemination; where a dataset is continuously incremented with new data. The key issuehere is that the same data may be anonymized and published multiple times; each of thetime in a different form. Thus; static anonymization (ie; anonymization which does not …,Journal of Computer Security,2009,47
Privacy-preserving trust negotiations,Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Anna Cinzia Squicciarini,Abstract Trust negotiation is a promising approach for establishing trust in open systems;where sensitive interactions may often occur between entities with no prior knowledge ofeach other. Although several proposals today exist of systems for the management of trustnegotiations none of them addresses in a comprehensive way the problem of privacypreservation. Privacy is today one of the major concerns of users exchanging informationthrough the Web and thus we believe that trust negotiation systems must effectively addressprivacy issues to be widely acceptable. For these reasons; in this paper we investigateprivacy in the context of trust negotiations. More precisely; we propose a set of privacypreserving features to be included in any trust negotiation system; such as the support forthe P3P standard; as well as different formats to encode credentials.,International Workshop on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,2004,47
Manipulating spatial data in constraint databases,Alberto Belussi; Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania,Abstract Constraint databases have recently been proposed as a powerful framework tomodel and retrieve spatial data. In a constraint database; a spatial object is represented as aquantifier free conjunction of (usually linear) constraints; called generalized tuple. The set ofsolutions of such quantifier free formula represents the set of points belonging to theextension of the object. The relational algebra can be easily extended to deal withgeneralized relations. However; such algebra has some limitations when it is used formodeling spatial data. First of all; there is no explicit way to deal with the set of pointsrepresenting a spatial object as a whole. Rather; only point-based computations can beperformed using this algebra. Second; practical constraint database languages typically uselinear constraints. This allows to use efficient algorithms but; at the same time; some …,International Symposium on Spatial Databases,1997,47
Policy decomposition for collaborative access control,Dan Lin; Prathima Rao; Elisa Bertino; Ninghui Li; Jorge Lobo,Abstract With the advances in web service techniques; new collaborative applications haveemerged like supply chain arrangements and coalition in government agencies. In suchapplications; the collaborating parties are responsible for managing and protectingresources entrusted to them. Access control decisions thus become a collaborative activity inwhich a global policy must be enforced by a set of collaborating parties withoutcompromising the autonomy or confidentiality requirements of these parties. Unfortunately;none of the conventional access control systems meets these new requirements. To supportcollaborative access control; in this paper; we propose a novel policy-based access controlmodel. Our main idea is based on the notion of policy decomposition and we propose anextension to the reference architecture for XACML. We present algorithms for …,Proceedings of the 13th ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2008,46
Measuring the structural similarity among XML documents and DTDs,Elisa Bertino; Giovanna Guerrini; Marco Mesiti,Abstract Measuring the structural similarity between an XML document and a DTD has manyrelevant applications that range from document classification and approximate structuralqueries on XML documents to selective dissemination of XML documents and documentprotection. The problem is harder than measuring structural similarity among documents;because a DTD can be considered as a generator of documents. Thus; the problem is toevaluate the similarity between a document and a set of documents. An effective structuralsimilarity measure should face different requirements that range from considering thepresence and absence of required elements; as well as the structure and level of themissing and extra elements to vocabulary discrepancies due to the use of synonymous orsyntactically similar tags. In the paper; starting from these requirements; we provide a …,Journal of Intelligent Information Systems,2008,46

They have posedmany new challenges to existing underlying database technologies; such as therequirements of supporting big volume data; preserving data transition path and handlingnew types of queries. In this paper; we propose an efficient method to manage RFID data.We explore and take advantage of the containment relationships in the relational tables inorder to support special queries in the RFID applications.

A multigranular object‐oriented framework supporting spatio‐temporal granularity conversions,Elena Camossi; Michela Bertolotto; Elisa Bertino,Several application domains require handling spatio‐temporal data. However; traditionalGeographic Information Systems (GIS) and database models do not adequately supporttemporal aspects of spatial data. A crucial issue relates to the choice of the appropriategranularity. Unfortunately; while a formalisation of the concept of temporal granularity hasbeen proposed and widely adopted; no consensus exists on the notion of spatial granularity.In this paper; we address these open problems; by proposing a formal definition of spatialgranularity and by designing a spatio‐temporal framework for the management of spatialand temporal information at different granularities. We present a spatio‐temporal extensionof the ODMG type system with specific types for defining multigranular spatio‐temporalproperties. Granularity conversion functions are introduced to obtain attributes values at …,International Journal of Geographical Information Science,2006,46
Micro-views; or on how to protect privacy while enhancing data usability: concepts and challenges,Ji-Won Byun; Elisa Bertino,Abstract The large availability of repositories storing various types of information aboutindividuals has raised serious privacy concerns over the past decade. Nonetheless;database technology is far from providing adequate solutions to this problem that requires adelicate balance between an individual's privacy and convenience and data usability byenterprises and organizations-a database which is rigid and over-protective may renderdata of little value. Though these goals may seem odd; we argue that the development ofsolutions able to reconcile them will be an important challenge to be addressed in the nextfew years. We believe that the next wave of database technology will be represented by aDBMS that provides high-assurance privacy and security. In this paper; we elaborate onsuch challenges. In particular; we argue that we need to provide different views of data at …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2006,46
An extended algebra for constraint databases,Alberto Belussi; Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania,Constraint relational databases use constraints to both model and query data. A constraintrelation contains a finite set of generalized tuples. Each generalized tuple is represented bya conjunction of constraints on a given logical theory and; depending on the logical theoryand the specific conjunction of constraints; it may possibly represent an infinite set ofrelational tuples. For their characteristics; constraint databases are well suited to modelmultidimensional and structured data; like spatial and temporal data. The definition of analgebra for constraint relational databases is important in order to make constraintdatabases a practical technology. We extend the previously defined constraint algebra(called generalized relational algebra). First; we show that the relational model is not theonly possible semantic reference model for constraint relational databases and we show …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1998,46
On modeling cost functions for object-oriented databases,Elisa Bertino; Paola Foscoli,In this paper; we present a set of parameters able to exactly model topologies of objectreferences in object-oriented databases. These parameters are important since they areused to model query execution strategy costs for optimization. The model we presentconsiders also the cases of multivalued attributes and null references. Moreover; a set ofderived parameters are introduced and their mathematical derivations are shown. Thesederived parameters are important; since they allow selectivity of nested predicates to beestimated. Moreover; they are used in estimating storage; access; and update costs for anumber of access structures specifically tailored to efficiently support object-orientedqueries.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1997,46
Practical k nearest neighbor queries with location privacy,Xun Yi; Russell Paulet; Elisa Bertino; Vijay Varadharajan,In mobile communication; spatial queries pose a serious threat to user location privacybecause the location of a query may reveal sensitive information about the mobile user. Inthis paper; we study k nearest neighbor (kNN) queries where the mobile user queries thelocation-based service (LBS) provider about k nearest points of interest (POIs) on the basisof his current location. We propose a solution for the mobile user to preserve his locationprivacy in kNN queries. The proposed solution is built on the Paillier public-key cryptosystemand can provide both location privacy and data privacy. In particular; our solution allows themobile user to retrieve one type of POIs; for example; k nearest car parks; without revealingto the LBS provider what type of points is retrieved. For a cloaking region with n× n cells andm types of points; the total communication complexity for the mobile user to retrieve a type …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,45
An analysis of expressiveness and design issues for the generalized temporal role-based access control model,James BD Joshi; Elisa Bertino; Arif Ghafoor,The generalized temporal role-based access control (GTRBAC) model provides acomprehensive set of temporal constraint expressions which can facilitate the specificationof fine-grained time-based access control policies. However; the issue of the expressivenessand usability of this model has not been previously investigated. In this paper; we present ananalysis of the expressiveness of the constructs provided by this model and illustrate that itsconstraints-set is not minimal. We show that there is a subset of GTRBAC constraints that issufficient to express all the access constraints that can be expressed using the full set. Wealso illustrate that a nonminimal GTRBAC constraint set can provide better flexibility andlower complexity of constraint representation. Based on our analysis; a set of designguidelines for the development of GTRBAC-based security administration is presented.,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,2005,45

Relevant features of Author-X are both a set-oriented anda document-oriented credential-based document protection; a differentiated protection ofdocument/document type contents through the support of multi-granularity protection objectsand positive/negative authorizations; and the support for different access control strategies.In this paper; we focus on the strategies we have developed for enforcing access control …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2002,45
An access control model for video database systems,Elisa Bertino; Moustafa A Hammad; Walid G Aref; Ahmed K Elmagarmid,ABSTRACT A novel approach for modeling access control in video databases is presented.The proposed access control mechanism uses both the semantics and the structuralcomposition of video data. The unit of authorization; a video element; can either be asequence of video frames or a video object that appears as part of a frame; eg; the face of ananonymous person in an interview. The components of the access control model are thevideo elements; the potential users; and the mode of operation; eg; viewing; or editing.Video elements are specified either explicitly by their identifiers or implicitly by their semanticcon tents; while users are characterized by the user credentials. An algorithm is presentedthat determines the authorized portions of a video that a given user may acquire; given theuser's creden tials; the video content descriptions; and the type of requested video …,Proceedings of the ninth international conference on Information and knowledge management,2000,45
On the selection of optimal index configuration in OO databases,Sunil Choenni; Elisa Bertino; Henk M Blanken; Thiel Chang,An operation in object-oriented databases gives rise to the processing of a path. Severaldatabase operations may result into the same path. The authors address the problem ofoptimal index configuration for a single path. As it is shown an optimal index configurationfor a path can be achieved by splitting the path into subpaths and by indexing each subpathwith the optimal index organization. The authors present an algorithm which is able to selectan optimal index configuration for a given path. The authors consider a limited number ofexisting indexing techniques (simple index; inherited index; nested inherited index; multi-index; and multi-inherited index) but the principles of the algorithm remain the same addingmore indexing techniques.,Data Engineering; 1994.

A hybrid technique for private location-based queries with database protection,Gabriel Ghinita; Panos Kalnis; Murat Kantarcioglu; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Mobile devices with global positioning capabilities allow users to retrieve points ofinterest (POI) in their proximity. To protect user privacy; it is important not to disclose exactuser coordinates to un-trusted entities that provide location-based services. Currently; thereare two main approaches to protect the location privacy of users:(i) hiding locations insidecloaking regions (CRs) and (ii) encrypting location data using private information retrieval(PIR) protocols. Previous work focused on finding good trade-offs between privacy andperformance of user protection techniques; but disregarded the important issue of protectingthe POI dataset D. For instance; location cloaking requires large-sized CRs; leading toexcessive disclosure of POIs (O (| D|) in the worst case). PIR; on the other hand; reduces thisbound to O(|D|); but at the expense of high processing and communication overhead. We …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2009,44
X-FEDERATE: a policy engineering framework for federated access management,Rafae Bhatti; Elisa Bertino; Arif Ghafoor,Policy-based management (PBM) has been considered as a promising approach for designand enforcement of access management policies for distributed systems. The increasingshift toward federated information sharing in the organizational landscape; however; calls forrevisiting current PBM approaches to satisfy the unique security requirements of thefederated paradigm. This presents a twofold challenge for the design of a PBM approach;where; on the one hand; the policy must incorporate the access management needs of theindividual systems; while; on the other hand; the policies across multiple systems must bedesigned in such a manner that they can be uniformly developed; deployed; and integratedwithin the federated system.

An authorization model for geographical maps,Alberto Belussi; Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania; Maria Luisa Damiani; Andrea Nucita,Abstract Access control is an important component of any database management system.Several access control models have been proposed for conventional databases. However;these models do not seem adequate for geographical databases; due to the peculiarities ofgeographical data. Previous work on access control models for geographical data mainlyconcerns raster maps (images). In this paper; we present a discretionary access controlmodel for geographical maps. We assume that each map is composed of a set of features.Each feature is represented in one or more maps by spatial objects; described by means ofdifferent spatial properties: geometric properties; describing the shape; extension andlocation of the objects; and topological properties; describing the topological relationshipsexisting among objects.

Method precomputation in object-oriented databases,Elisa Bertino,Abstract The query language represents an important component of any Data BaseManagement System (DBMS). Therefore; advanced object-oriented DBMSS(O ODBMSS)provide query capabilities for content-based access to objects; in addition to IIaV&atiOIIa]access based on object references. Very often; these two types of access are usedcomplementarily. Object-oriented query languages have several differences with respect torelational query languages. These differences require that new optimization techniques bedeveloped and/or that techniques defined for relational DBMSS be reexamined andextended to effectively support object-oriented queries. One such difference is that methodscan be invoked in queries. The result of a method execution is an object (either primitive ornon-primitive). Therefore; predicates can be applied to it. In this paper; we describe an …,ACM SIGOIS Bulletin,1991,44
Mechanisms for database intrusion detection and response,Ashish Kamra; Elisa Bertino; Guy Lebanon,Abstract Data represent today a valuable asset for companies and organizations and mustbe protected. Most of an organization's sensitive and proprietary data resides in a DatabaseManagement System (DBMS). The focus of this thesis is to develop advanced securitysolutions for protecting the data residing in a DBMS. Our strategy is to develop an IntrusionDetection (ID) mechanism; implemented within the database server; that is capable ofdetecting anomalous user requests to a DBMS. The key idea is to learn profiles of users andapplications interacting with a database. A database request that deviates from theseprofiles is then termed as anomalous. A major component of this work involves prototypeimplementation of this ID mechanism in the Post-greSQL database server. We also proposeto augment the ID mechanism with an Intrusion Response engine that is capable of …,Proceedings of the 2nd SIGMOD PhD workshop on Innovative database research,2008,43
Continuous intersection joins over moving objects,Rui Zhang; Dan Lin; Kotagiri Ramamohanarao; Elisa Bertino,The continuous intersection join query is computationally expensive yet important for variousapplications on moving objects. No previous study has specifically addressed this querytype. We can adopt a naive algorithm or extend an existing technique (TP-Join) to processthe query. However; they compute the answer for either too long or too short a time interval;which results in either a very large computation cost per object update or too frequentanswer updates; respectively. This motivates us to optimize the query processing in the timedimension. In this study; we achieve this optimization by introducing the new concept of time-constrained (TC) processing. Further; TC processing enables a set of effective improvementtechniques on traditional intersection join algorithms.

Efficient privacy-aware record integration,Mehmet Kuzu; Murat Kantarcioglu; Ali Inan; Elisa Bertino; Elizabeth Durham; Bradley Malin,Abstract The integration of information dispersed among multiple repositories is a crucialstep for accurate data analysis in various domains. In support of this goal; it is critical todevise procedures for identifying similar records across distinct data sources. At the sametime; to adhere to privacy regulations and policies; such procedures should protect theconfidentiality of the individuals to whom the information corresponds. Various private recordlinkage (PRL) protocols have been proposed to achieve this goal; involving secure multi-party computation (SMC) and similarity preserving data transformation techniques. SMCmethods provide secure and accurate solutions to the PRL problem; but are prohibitivelyexpensive in practice; mainly due to excessive computational requirements.

A game-theoretic approach for high-assurance of data trustworthiness in sensor networks,Hyo-Sang Lim; Gabriel Ghinita; Elisa Bertino; Murat Kantarcioglu,Sensor networks are being increasingly deployed in many application domains ranging fromenvironment monitoring to supervising critical infrastructure systems (eg; the power grid).Due to their ability to continuously collect large amounts of data; sensor networks representa key component in decisionmaking; enabling timely situation assessment and response.However; sensors deployed in hostile environments may be subject to attacks byadversaries who intend to inject false data into the system. In this context; datatrustworthiness is an important concern; as false readings may result in wrong decisions withserious consequences (eg; large-scale power outages). To defend against this threat; it isimportant to establish trust levels for sensor nodes and adjust node trustworthiness scores toaccount for malicious interferences.

Access control for databases: concepts and systems,Elisa Bertino; Gabriel Ghinita; Ashish Kamra,Abstract As organizations depend on; possibly distributed; information systems foroperational; decisional and strategic activities; they are vulnerable to security breachesleading to data theft and unauthorized disclosures even as they gain productivity andefficiency advantages. Though several techniques; such as encryption and digitalsignatures; are available to protect data when transmitted across sites; a trulycomprehensive approach for data protection must include mechanisms for enforcing accesscontrol policies based on data contents; subject qualifications and characteristics; and otherrelevant contextual information; such as time. It is well understood today that the semanticsof data must be taken into account in order to specify effective access control policies. Toaddress such requirements; over the years the database security research community …,Foundations and Trends® in Databases,2011,41
A risk management approach to RBAC,Ebru Celikel; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Even if Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is employed properly; distributeddatabase environments are still prone to illegitimate access attempts: in RBAC; userspotentially carry the risk of illegal access attempts via credentials violation; or unintentional/intentional incorrect use of already granted permissions via role misuse/abuse. Weintroduce a probabilistic risk management model for enhanced access control in suchdatabases. We incorporate failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) scheme formeasuring user risks in our design. We combine components as credentials; queries; rolehistory logs and expected utility for a probabilistic formulation of risk. We presentexperimental results that we obtained on real world database.

MPGS: An interactive tool for the specification and generation of multimedia presentations,Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Marco Stolf,Multimedia presentations are composed of objects belonging to different data types such asvideo; audio; text and image. An important aspect is that; quite often; the user defining apresentation needs to express sophisticated temporal and spatial constraints among theobjects composing the presentation. We present a system (called MPGS-MultimediaPresentation Generator System) which supports the specification of constraints amongmultimedia objects and the generation of multimedia presentations according to thespecified constraints. The constraint model provided by MPGS is very flexible and powerfulin terms of the kinds of object constraints it can represent. A large number of innovativefeatures are supported including: asynchronous and simultaneous spatial constraints;components of interest and priority levels; motion functions.

Privacy-preserving detection of sensitive data exposure,Xiaokui Shu; Danfeng Yao; Elisa Bertino,Statistics from security firms; research institutions and government organizations show thatthe number of data-leak instances have grown rapidly in recent years. Among various data-leak cases; human mistakes are one of the main causes of data loss. There exist solutionsdetecting inadvertent sensitive data leaks caused by human mistakes and to provide alertsfor organizations. A common approach is to screen content in storage and transmission forexposed sensitive information. Such an approach usually requires the detection operation tobe conducted in secrecy. However; this secrecy requirement is challenging to satisfy inpractice; as detection servers may be compromised or outsourced. In this paper; we presenta privacy-preserving data-leak detection (DLD) solution to solve the issue where a specialset of sensitive data digests is used in detection. The advantage of our method is that it …,IEEE transactions on information forensics and security,2015,39
Authentication and key management for advanced metering infrastructures utilizing physically unclonable functions,Mohamed Nabeel; Sam Kerr; Xiaoyu Ding; Elisa Bertino,Conventional utility meters are increasingly being replaced with smart meters as smart meterbased AMIs (Advanced Metering Infrastructures) provide many benefits over conventionalpower infrastrucutures. However; security issues pertaining to the data transmissionbetween smart meters and utility servers have been a major concern. With large scale AMIdeployments; addressing these issues is challenging. In particular; as data travels throughseveral networks; secure end-to-end communication based on strong authenticationmechanisms and a robust and scalable key management schemes are crucial for assuringthe confidentiality and the integrity of this data. In this paper; we propose an approach basedon PUF (physically unclonable function) technology for providing strong hardware basedauthentication of smart meters and efficient key management to assure the confidentiality …,Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm); 2012 IEEE Third International Conference on,2012,39
Reputation management in crowdsourcing systems,Mohammad Allahbakhsh; Aleksandar Ignjatovic; Boualem Benatallah; Elisa Bertino; Norman Foo,Worker selection is a significant and challenging issue in crowdsourcing systems. Suchselection is usually based on an assessment of the reputation of the individual workersparticipating in such systems. However; assessing the credibility and adequacy of suchcalculated reputation is a real challenge. In this paper; we propose a reputationmanagement model which leverages the values of the tasks completed; the credibility of theevaluators of the results of the tasks and time of evaluation of the results of these tasks inorder to calculate more dependable quality metrics for workers and evaluators. The modelhas been implemented and experimentally validated.,Collaborative Computing: Networking; Applications and Worksharing (CollaborateCom); 2012 8th International Conference on,2012,39
Protecting location privacy against spatial inferences: the PROBE approach,Maria Luisa Damiani; Elisa Bertino; Claudio Silvestri,Abstract The widespread adoption of location-based services (LBS) raises increasingconcerns for the protection of personal location information. A common strategy; referred toas obfuscation; to protect location privacy is based on forwarding the LSB provider a coarseuser location instead of the actual user location. Conventional approaches; based on suchtechnique; are however based only on geometric methods and therefore are unable toassure privacy when the adversary is aware of the geographical context. This paperprovides a comprehensive solution to this problem. Our solution presents a novel approachthat obfuscates the user location by taking into account the geographical context and user'sprivacy preferences. We define several theoretical notions underlying our approach. Wethen propose a strategy for generating obfuscated spaces and an efficient algorithm …,Proceedings of the 2nd SIGSPATIAL ACM GIS 2009 International Workshop on Security and Privacy in GIS and LBS,2009,39
Multi-domain and privacy-aware role based access control in ehealth,Lorenzo D Martino; Qun Ni; Dan Lin; Elisa Bertino,Information Technology-supported Heathcare (eHealth) is crucial in order to reducehealthcare costs; and improve quality of care and patient safety. Among technologies ineHealth; Electronic Medical/Health Records (EMR/EHR) enabling communication of patientdata between different healthcare professionals (eg specialists; pharmacy); is the mostimportant and sensitive. There are three crucial requirements when accessing EMRs: suchaccess must be both secure and privacy preserving; such access must be allowed toindividuals from different organizations; such access should be confined based on metainformation about the EMRs. In this paper; we propose a multi-domain privacy-aware rolebased access control meeting these requirements.,Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare; 2008. PervasiveHealth 2008.

Secure knn query processing in untrusted cloud environments,Sunoh Choi; Gabriel Ghinita; Hyo-Sang Lim; Elisa Bertino,Mobile devices with geo-positioning capabilities (eg; GPS) enable users to accessinformation that is relevant to their present location. Users are interested in querying aboutpoints of interest (POI) in their physical proximity; such as restaurants; cafes; ongoing events;etc. Entities specialized in various areas of interest (eg; certain niche directions in arts;entertainment; travel) gather large amounts of geo-tagged data that appeal to subscribedusers. Such data may be sensitive due to their contents. Furthermore; keeping suchinformation up-to-date and relevant to the users is not an easy task; so the owners of suchdata sets will make the data accessible only to paying customers. Users send their currentlocation as the query parameter; and wish to receive as result the nearest POIs; ie; nearest-neighbors (NNs).

User tasks and access control overweb services,Jacques Thomas; Federica Paci; Elisa Bertino; Patrick Eugster,Web services are a successful technology for enterprise information management; wherethey are used to expose legacy applications on the corporate intranet or in business-to-business scenarios.

Now; the technology used to buildapplications based on Web services; a process known as orchestration; is also maturingaround the Web Services Business Process Execution Language (WS-BPEL). WS-BPELfalls short on one feature though: as it is focused on orchestration of fully automatic Web-services; WS-BPEL does not provide means for specifying human interactions; even lesstheir access-control requirements.

Securing XML data in third-party distribution systems,Barbara Carminati; Elena Ferrari; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Web-based third-party architectures for data publishing are today receiving growingattention; due to their scalability and the ability to efficiently manage large numbers of usersand great amounts of data. A third-party architecture relies on a distinction between theOwner and the Publisher of information. The Owner is the producer of information; whereasPublisher provides data management services and query processing functions for (a portionof) the Owner's information. In such architecture; there are important security concernsespecially if we do not want to make any assumption on the trustworthy of the Publishers.Although approaches have been proposed [4; 5] providing partial solutions to this problem;no comprehensive framework has been so far developed able to support all the mostimportant security properties in the presence of an untrusted Publisher.

P-hera: Scalable fine-grained access control for p2p infrastructures,Bruno Crispo; Swaminathan Sivasubramanian; Pietro Mazzoleni; Elisa Bertino,In this paper; we present P-Hera; a peer-to-peer (P2P) infrastructure for scalable and securecontent hosting. P-Hera allows the users and content owners to dynamically establish trustusing fine-grained access control. In P-Hera; resource owners can specify fine-grainedrestrictions on who can access their resources and which user can access which part ofdata. We differentiate our work with traditional works of fine-grained access control on Webservices; as our system in addition to handling access constraints of the service provider(which is the case in Web services); it also handles security constraints regarding actionsperformed on data: replication and modification. We believe this is of immense significancefor wide-range of applications such as data grids; information grids and Web contentdelivery networks.

Privacy of outsourced k-means clustering,Dongxi Liu; Elisa Bertino; Xun Yi,Abstract It is attractive for an organization to outsource its data analytics to a service providerwho has powerful platforms and advanced analytics skills. However; the organization (dataowner) may have concerns about the privacy of its data. In this paper; we present a methodthat allows the data owner to encrypt its data with a homomorphic encryption scheme andthe service provider to perform k-means clustering directly over the encrypted data.However; since the ciphertexts resulting from homomorphic encryption do not preserve theorder of distances between data objects and cluster centers; we propose an approach thatenables the service provider to compare encrypted distances with the trapdoor informationprovided by the data owner. The efficiency of our method is validated by extensiveexperimental evaluation.,Proceedings of the 9th ACM symposium on Information; computer and communications security,2014,36
Towards mechanisms for detection and prevention of data exfiltration by insiders: keynote talk paper,Elisa Bertino; Gabriel Ghinita,Abstract Data represent an extremely important asset for any organization. Confidential datasuch as military secrets or intellectual property must never be disclosed outside theorganization. Therefore; one of the most severe threats in the case of cyber-insider attacks isthe loss of confidential data due to exfiltration. A malicious insider who has the propercredentials to access the organization databases may; over time; send data outside theorganization network through a variety of channels; such as email; crafted HTTP requeststhat encapsulate data; etc. Existing security tools for detection of cyber-attacks focus onprotecting the boundary between the organization and the outside world.

Our approach is based on the notion of encrypted postorder numbers thatsupport the integrity and confidentiality requirements of XML content as well as facilitateefficient identification; extraction; and distribution of selected content portions. By using suchnotion; we develop a structure-based routing scheme that prevents information leaks in theXML data dissemination; and assures that content is delivered to users according to theaccess control policies; that is; policies specifying which users can receive which portions ofthe contents.

A semantic-based execution model for multilevel secure workflows,Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Wei-Kuang Huang; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Workflow management systems (WFMS) support the modeling and coordinatedexecution of processes within an organization. To coordinate the execution of the variousactivities (or tasks) in a workflow; task dependencies are specified among them. Asadvances in workflow management take place; they are also required to support security. Ina multilevel secure (MLS) workflow; tasks may belong to different security levels.

Extending the ODMG object model with composite objects,Elisa Bertino; Giovanna Guerrini,Abstract In this paper we extend the ODMG object data model with composite objects. Acomposite object is an object built by aggregating other component objects. Exclusivenessand dependency constraints; as well as referential integrity; can be associated withcomposition relationships among objects. Our composite object model is developed in theframework of the ODMG object database standard data model; but can be used in bothobject-oriented and object-relational database systems. In the paper; we propose alanguage for defining composite objects and we define the semantics of update operationson composite objects.,ACM SIGPLAN Notices,1998,36

Transactions and updates in deductive databases,Danilo Montesi; Elisa Bertino; Maurizio Martelli,In this paper; we develop a new approach that provides a smooth integration of extensionalupdates and declarative query languages for deductive databases. The approach is basedon a declarative specification of updates in rule bodies. Updates are not executed as soonas evaluated. Instead; they are collected and then applied to the database when the queryevaluation is completed. We call this approach nonimmediate update semantics. We providea top-down and equivalent bottom-up semantics which reflect the correspondingcomputation models. We also package set of updates into transactions and we provide aformal semantics for transactions. Then; in order to handle complex transactions; we extendthe transaction language with control constructors still preserving formal semantics andsemantics equivalence.,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,1997,36
A decentralized privacy preserving reputation protocol for the malicious adversarial model,Omar Hasan; Lionel Brunie; Elisa Bertino; Ning Shang,Users hesitate to submit negative feedback in reputation systems due to the fear ofretaliation from the recipient user. A privacy preserving reputation protocol protects users byhiding their individual feedback and revealing only the reputation score. We present aprivacy preserving reputation protocol for the malicious adversarial model. The malicioususers in this model actively attempt to learn the private feedback values of honest users aswell as to disrupt the protocol. Our protocol does not require centralized entities; trusted thirdparties; or specialized platforms; such as anonymous networks and trusted hardware.Moreover; our protocol is efficient. It requires an exchange of messages; where and are thenumber of users in the protocol and the environment; respectively.,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2013,35
An access control system for a web map management service,Elisa Bertino; Maria Luisa Damiani; Davide Momini,In this paper; we present an access control model for spatial data on Web. Such a model isbased on the following assumptions: first; spatial data consist of objects with sharpboundaries located in a geographical space; second; data are manipulated through theoperations provided by a Web map management service. The goal of the system is to controlthe way data are accessed by users having different profiles. We propose an extension ofclassical models based on authorization rules by assigning authorizations a geographicalscope. In such a way; the operations users may execute on spatial data may vary;depending on user identity and object position.,Research Issues on Data Engineering: Web Services for e-Commerce and e-Government Applications; 2004.

A nested transaction model for multilevel secure database management systems,Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania; Elena Ferrari,Abstract This article presents an approach to concurrency control for transactions in aMultilevel Secure Database Management System (MLS/DBMS). The major problem is thatconcurrency control mechanisms used in traditional DBMSs are not adequate in aMLS/DBMS; since they may be exploited to establish covert channels. The approachpresented in this article; which uses single-version data items; is based on the use of nestedtransactions; application-level recovery; and notification-based locking protocols. All thesefeatures allow us to develop a concurrency control mechanism that is free of timing channelsand avoids many of the shortcomings of the concurrency control mechanisms so fardeveloped for conventional (ie; flat) transactions; such as transaction starvation andresource wastage.,ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC),2001,35
Optimization of queries using nested indices,Elisa Bertino,Abstract The notion of nested object is a basic concept of the object-oriented paradigm. Itallows the value of an object attribute to be another object or a set of other objects. Thismeans that a class consists of a set of attributes; and the values of the attributes are objectsthat belong to other classes; that is; the definition of a class forms a hierarchy of classes. Allattributes of the nested classes are nested attributes of the root of the hierarchy. In aprevious paper [Bert 89]; we have introduced the notion of nested index that associates thevalues of a nested attribute with the objects instances of the root of the hierarchy. In thatpaper; we have evaluated the performance of this indexing mechanism in the case ofqueries containing a single predicate. In the present paper; we consider the usage of nestedindices in the framework of more general queries containing several predicates.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,1990,35

Advanced transaction processing in multilevel secure file stores,Elisa Bertino; Sushil Jajodia; Luigi Mancini; Indrajit Ray,The concurrency control requirements for transaction processing in a multilevel secure filesystem are different from those in conventional transaction processing systems. In particular;there is the need to coordinate transactions at different security levels avoiding bothpotential timing covert channels and the starvation of transactions at higher security levels.Suppose a transaction at a lower security level attempts to write a data item that is beingread by a transaction at a higher security level. On the one hand; a timing covert channelarises if the transaction at the lower security level is either delayed or aborted by thescheduler. On the other hand; the transaction at the high security level may be subjected toan indefinite delay if it is forced to abort repeatedly.

Modeling and language support for the management of pattern-bases,Manolis Terrovitis; Panos Vassiliadis; Spiros Skiadopoulos; Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania; Anna Maddalena; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract Information overloading is today a serious concern that may hinder the potential ofmodern web-based information systems. A promising approach to deal with this problem isrepresented by knowledge extraction methods able to produce artifacts (also calledpatterns) that concisely represent data. Patterns are usually quite heterogeneous andvoluminous. So far; little emphasis has been posed on developing an overall integratedenvironment for uniformly representing and querying different types of patterns. In this paperwe consider the larger problem of modeling; storing; and querying patterns; in a database-like setting and use a Pattern-Base Management System (PBMS) for this purpose.Specifically;(a) we formally define the logical foundations for the global setting of patternmanagement through a model that covers data; patterns; and their intermediate mappings …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2007,33

Subjects; objects and authorization types are organizedinto hierarchies; supporting a more adequate representation of their semantics. From theauthorizations explicitly specified; additional authorizations are automatically derived by thesystem based on those hierarchies. The combination of all the above features results in apowerful yet flexible access control mechanism. The specification language of the system isan extension of Ordered Logic with ordered domains.

Access controls in object-oriented database systems—Some approaches and issues,Elisa Bertino; Sushil Jajodia; Pierangela Samarati,Object-oriented database management systems (OODBMSs) today represent one of themost active areas in both academic and industrial worlds.

The need for these systems has been driven by several advanced applications; suchas CAD/CAM; cartography; multimedia; for which relational systems have been provedinadequate. A serious problem with these systems is that they do not provide adequateaccess control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information. They do notprovide for the mandatory security [146] and; in most cases; do not even provide adequatediscretionary authorization facilities (a notable exception is presented by the ORION/ITASCAsystem [460]).

Preserving privacy of feedback providers in decentralized reputation systems,Omar Hasan; Lionel Brunie; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Reputation systems make the users of a distributed application accountable for theirbehavior. The reputation of a user is computed as an aggregate of the feedback provided byother users in the system. Truthful feedback is clearly a prerequisite for computing areputation score that accurately represents the behavior of a user. However; it has beenobserved that users often hesitate in providing truthful feedback; mainly due to the fear ofretaliation. We present a decentralized privacy preserving reputation protocol that enablesusers to provide feedback in a private and thus uninhibited manner. The protocol has linearmessage complexity; which is an improvement over comparable decentralized reputationprotocols. Moreover; the protocol allows users to quantify and maximize the probability thattheir privacy will be preserved.,Computers & Security,2012,32

How to authenticate graphs without leaking,Ashish Kundu; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Secure data sharing in multi-party environments requires that both authenticity andconfidentiality of the data be assured. Digital signature schemes are commonly employed forauthentication of data. However; no such technique exists for directed graphs; even thoughsuch graphs are one of the most widely used data organization structures. Existing schemesfor DAGs are authenticity-preserving but not confidentiality-preserving; and lead to leakageof sensitive information during authentication. In this paper; we propose two schemes onhow to authenticate DAGs and directed cyclic graphs without leaking; which are the firstsuch schemes in the literature. It is based on the structure of the graph as defined by depth-first graph traversals and aggregate signatures.

However; the open collaboration of nodes introduces privacy and securityissues. Therefore; ensuring privacy in wireless sensor networks is a challenging task. Basedon a multilevel security paradigm; in this paper we present a hierarchical key generation anddistribution protocol for wireless sensor networks. We show by simulation results that our keygeneration scheme outperforms the existing hierarchical key generation schemes thus it issuitable for sensor networks with limited computation and energy capabilities. Furthermore;we present an energy efficient key diffusion protocol. We also discuss the possible securitythreats involved with the proposed protocol and provide suitable solutions to such threats.,Sensor and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks; 2005.

This article proposes PPDL; an extension of PDL with preferences thatallows the specification of user-defined preferences on how to apply monitors. The newlanguage adopts Brewka's approach to preferences introducing the"/spl times/" ordereddisjunction connective. We illustrate the feature of PPDL in two interesting applicationexamples: i) the specification of" separation of duties" constraints on user/role assignmentsin a workflow scenario and ii) an architecture for Web services selection. Since PPDL (aswell as PDL) policy specifications can be computed by means of translation into answer …,Policies for Distributed Systems and Networks; 2005.

A framework for data mining pattern management,Barbara Catania; Anna Maddalena; Maurizio Mazza; Elisa Bertino; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract To represent and manage data mining patterns; several aspects have to be takeninto account:(i) patterns are heterogeneous in nature;(ii) patterns can be extracted from rawdata by using data mining tools (a-posteriori patterns) but also defined by the users andused for example to check how well they represent some input data source (a-prioripatterns);(iii) since source data change frequently; issues concerning pattern validity andsynchronization are very important;(iv) patterns have to be manipulated and queriedaccording to specific languages. Several approaches have been proposed so far to dealwith patterns; however all of them lack some of the previous characteristics. The aim of thispaper is to present an overall framework to cope with all these features.,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2004,32
Trigger inheritance and overriding in an active object database system,Elisa Bertino; Giovanna Guerrini; Isabella Merlo,An active database is a database in which some operations are automatically executedwhen specified events happen and particular conditions are met. Several systemssupporting active rules in an object oriented data model have been proposed. However;several issues related to the integration of triggers with object oriented modeling conceptshave not been satisfactorily addressed. We discuss issues related to trigger inheritance andrefinement in the context of the Chimera active object oriented data model. In particular; weintroduce a semantics for an active object language that takes into account triggerinheritance and supports trigger overriding. Moreover; we state conditions on triggeroverriding ensuring that trigger semantics is preserved in subclasses.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2000,32
An approach to classify semi-structured objects,Elisa Bertino; Giovanna Guerrini; Isabella Merlo; Marco Mesiti,Abstract Several advanced applications; such as those dealing with the Web; need tohandle data whose structure is not known a-priori. Such requirement severely limits theapplicability of traditional database techniques; that are based on the fact that the structureof data (eg the database schema) is known before data are entered into the database.Moreover; in traditional database systems; whenever a data item (eg a tuple; an object; andso on) is entered; the application specifies the collection (eg relation; class; and so on) thedata item belongs to. Collections are the basis for handling queries and indexing andtherefore a proper classification of data items in collections is crucial. In this paper; weaddress this issue in the context of an extended object-oriented data model. We propose anapproach to classify objects; created without specifying the class they belong to; in the …,European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming,1999,32
Identidroid: Android can finally wear its anonymous suit,Bilal Shebaro; Oyindamola Oluwatimi; Daniele Midi; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Because privacy today is a major concern for mobile applications; networkanonymizers are widely available on smartphones; such as Android. However despite theuse of such anonymizers; in many cases applications are still able to identify the user andthe device by different means than the IP address. The reason is that very often applicationsrequire device services and information that go beyond the capabilities of anonymousnetworks in protecting users' identity and privacy. In this paper; we propose two solutionsthat address this problem. The first solution is based on an approach that shadows user andapplication data; device information; and resources that can reveal the user identity. Datashadowing is executed when the smartphone switches to the “anonymous modality”. Oncethe smartphone returns to work in the normal (ie non-anonymous) modality; application …,*,2014,31
Prox-RBAC: a proximity-based spatially aware RBAC,Michael S Kirkpatrick; Maria Luisa Damiani; Elisa Bertino,Abstract As mobile computing devices are becoming increasingly dominant in enterpriseand government organizations; the need for fine-grained access control in theseenvironments continues to grow. Specifically; advanced forms of access control can bedeployed to ensure authorized users can access sensitive resources only when in trustedlocations. One technique that has been proposed is to augment role-based access control(RBAC) with spatial constraints. In such a system; an authorized user must be in adesignated location in order to exercise the privileges associated with a role. In this work; weextend spatially aware RBAC systems by defining the notion of proximity-based RBAC. Inour approach; access control decisions are not based solely on the requesting user'slocation. Instead; we also consider the location of other users in the system. For instance …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2011,31
A conditional purpose-based access control model with dynamic roles,Md Enamul Kabir; Hua Wang; Elisa Bertino,Abstract This paper presents a model for privacy preserving access control which is basedon variety of purposes. Conditional purpose is applied along with allowed purpose andprohibited purpose in the model. It allows users using some data for certain purpose withconditions. The structure of conditional purpose-based access control model is defined andinvestigated through dynamic roles. Access purpose is verified in a dynamic behavior;based on subject attributes; context attributes and authorization policies. Intended purposesare dynamically associated with the requested data object during the access decision. Analgorithm is developed to achieve the compliance computation between access purposesand intended purposes and is illustrated with Role-based access control (RBAC) in adynamic manner to support conditional purpose-based access control. According to this …,Expert Systems with Applications,2011,31

StreamShield: a stream-centric approach towards security and privacy in data stream environments,Rimma V Nehme; Hyo-Sang Lim; Elisa Bertino; Elke A Rundensteiner,Abstract We propose to demonstrate the StreamShield; a system designed to address theproblem of security and privacy in the context of Data Stream Management Systems(DSMSs). In StreamShield; continuous access control is enforced by taking a novel" stream-centric" approach towards security. Security policies are not persistently stored on theserver; but rather are depicted by security metadata; called" security punctuations"; and getembedded into streams together with the data. We distinguish between two types of securitypunctuations:(1) the" data security punctuations"(dsps) describing the data-side securitypolicies; and (2) the" query security punctuations"(qsps) representing the query-side securitypolicies. The advantages of such stream-centric security model include flexibility; dynamicityand speed of enforcement. Furthermore; DSMSs can adapt to not only data-related but …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,31

A formal definition of the chimera object-oriented data model,Giovanna Guerrini; Elisa Bertino; René Bal,Abstract In this paper we formalize the object-oriented data model of the Chimera language.This language supports all the common features of object-oriented data models such asobject identity; complex objects and user-defined operations; classes; inheritance.Constraints may be defined by means of deductive rules; used also to specify derivedattributes. In addition; class attributes; operations; and constraints that collectively apply toclasses are supported. The main contribution of our work is to define a complete formalmodel for an object-oriented data model; and to address on a formal basis several issuesderiving from the introduction of rules into an object-oriented data model.,Journal of Intelligent Information Systems,1998,31
Transaction processing in multilevel secure databases with kernelized architecture: Challenges and solutions,Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Sushil Jajodia; Elisa Bertino,Multilevel security poses many challenging problems for transaction processing. Thechallenges are due to the conflicting requirements imposed by confidentiality; integrity; andavailability-the three components of security. We identify these requirements on transactionprocessing in Multilevel Secure (MLS) database management systems (DBMSs) and surveythe efforts of a number of researchers to meet these requirements. While our emphasis isprimarily on centralized systems based on kernelized architecture; we briefly overview theresearch in the distributed MLS DBMSs as well.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1997,31
Privacy-preserving updates to anonymous and confidential databases,Alberto Trombetta; Wei Jiang; Elisa Bertino; Lorenzo Bossi,Suppose Alice owns a k-anonymous database and needs to determine whether herdatabase; when inserted with a tuple owned by Bob; is still k-anonymous. Also; suppose thataccess to the database is strictly controlled; because for example data are used for certainexperiments that need to be maintained confidential. Clearly; allowing Alice to directly readthe contents of the tuple breaks the privacy of Bob (eg; a patient's medical record); on theother hand; the confidentiality of the database managed by Alice is violated once Bob hasaccess to the contents of the database. Thus; the problem is to check whether the databaseinserted with the tuple is still k-anonymous; without letting Alice and Bob know the contentsof the tuple and the database; respectively. In this paper; we propose two protocols solvingthis problem on suppression-based and generalization-based k-anonymous and …,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,2011,30
Efficient systematic clustering method for k-anonymization,Md Enamul Kabir; Hua Wang; Elisa Bertino,Abstract This paper presents a clustering (Clustering partitions record into clusters such thatrecords within a cluster are similar to each other; while records in different clusters are mostdistinct from one another.) based k-anonymization technique to minimize the informationloss while at the same time assuring data quality. Privacy preservation of individuals hasdrawn considerable interests in data mining research. The k-anonymity model proposed bySamarati and Sweeney is a practical approach for data privacy preservation and has beenstudied extensively for the last few years. Anonymization methods via generalization orsuppression are able to protect private information; but lose valued information. Thechallenge is how to minimize the information loss during the anonymization process.

Automating role-based provisioning by learning from examples,Qun Ni; Jorge Lobo; Seraphin Calo; Pankaj Rohatgi; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Role-based provisioning has been adopted as a standard component in leadingIdentity Management products due to its low administration cost. However; the cost ofadjusting existing roles to entitlements from newly deployed applications is usually veryhigh. In this paper; a learning-based approach to automate the provisioning process isproposed and its effectiveness is verified by real provisioning data. Specific learning issuesrelated to provisioning are identified and relevant solutions are presented.,Proceedings of the 14th ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2009,30
Security and privacy for geospatial data: concepts and research directions,Elisa Bertino; Bhavani Thuraisingham; Michael Gertz; Maria Luisa Damiani,Abstract Geospatial data play a key role in a wide spectrum of critical data managementapplications; such as disaster and emergency management; environmental monitoring; landand city planning; and military operations; often requiring the coordination among diverseorganizations; their data repositories; and users with different responsibilities. Although avariety of models and techniques are available to manage; access and share geospatialdata; very little attention has been paid to addressing security concerns; such as accesscontrol; security and privacy policies; and the development of secure and in particularinteroperable GIS applications.

A lava flow simulation model for the development of volcanic hazard maps for Mount Etna (Italy),Maria Luisa Damiani; Gianluca Groppelli; Gianluca Norini; Elisa Bertino; A Gigliuto; Andrea Nucita,Abstract Volcanic hazard assessment is of paramount importance for the safeguard of theresources exposed to volcanic hazards. In the paper we present ELFM; a lava flowsimulation model for the evaluation of the lava flow hazard on Mount Etna (Sicily; Italy); themost important active volcano in Europe. The major contributions of the paper are:(a) adetailed specification of the lava flow simulation model and the specification of an algorithmimplementing it;(b) the definition of a methodological framework for applying the model tothe specific volcano. For what concerns the former issue; we propose an extended version ofan existing stochastic model that has been applied so far only to the assessment of thevolcanic hazard on Lanzarote and Tenerife (Canary Islands). Concerning themethodological framework; we claim model validation is definitely needed for assessing …,Computers & geosciences,2006,30
A logic-based approach for enforcing access control 1,Elisa Bertino; Francesco Buccafurri; Elena Ferrari; Pasquale Rullo,Abstract This paper describes an advanced authorization mechanism based on a logicformalism. The model supports both positive and negative authorizations. It also supportsderivation rules by which an authorization can be granted on the basis of the presence orabsence of other authorizations. Subjects; objects and authorization types are organizedinto hierarchies; supporting a more adequate representation of their semantics. From theauthorizations explicitly specified; additional authorizations are automatically derived by thesystem; based on those hierarchies. The combination of all the above features results in apowerful yet flexible access control mechanism.,Journal of Computer Security,2000,30
Deductive object databases,Elisa Bertino; Giovanna Guerrini; Danilo Montesi,Abstract This paper proposes a new approach to model deductive object databases. Eachobject database is described by means of a Datalog language extended with extensionalupdates; called U-Datalog. Each object can change its state and cooperate with otherobjects. We introduce an extension of U-Datalog to approach the problem of compositionamong object databases. It can be used for modular database design and for cooperationamong databases. The resulting language has a clear semantics for the evolution of objectsand for modeling the transactional behavior of the resulting database. Finally; we describesome architectural issues of the prototype which has been developed.,European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming,1994,30
Using automated individual white-list to protect web digital identities,Weili Han; Ye Cao; Elisa Bertino; Jianming Yong,Abstract The theft attacks of web digital identities; eg; phishing; and pharming; could result insevere loss to users and vendors; and even hold users back from using online services; e-business services; especially. In this paper; we propose an approach; referred to asautomated individual white-list (AIWL); to protect user's web digital identities. AIWLleverages a Naïve Bayesian classifier to automatically maintain an individual white-list of auser. If the user tries to submit his or her account information to a web site that does notmatch the white-list; AIWL will alert the user of the possible attack. Furthermore; AIWL keepstrack of the features of login pages (eg; IP addresses; document object model (DOM) pathsof input widgets) in the individual white-list. By checking the legitimacy of these features;AIWL can efficiently defend users against hard attacks; especially pharming; and even …,Expert Systems with Applications,2012,29
Fine-grained integration of access control policies,Prathima Rao; Dan Lin; Elisa Bertino; Ninghui Li; Jorge Lobo,Abstract Collaborative and distributed applications; such as dynamic coalitions andvirtualized grid computing; often require integrating access control policies of collaboratingparties. Such an integration must be able to support complex authorization specificationsand the fine-grained integration requirements that the various parties may have. In thispaper; we introduce an algebra for fine-grained integration of sophisticated policies. Thealgebra; which consists of three binary and two unary operations; is able to support thespecification of a large variety of integration constraints. For ease of use; we also introduce aset of derived operators and provide guidelines for users to edit a policy with desiredproperties. To assess the expressive power of our algebra; we define notion ofcompleteness and prove that our algebra is complete and minimal with respect to the …,Computers & Security,2011,29
ID-based group password-authenticated key exchange,Xun Yi; Raylin Tso; Eiji Okamoto,Abstract Password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocols are designed to be secureeven when the secret key used for authentication is a human-memorable password. In thispaper; we consider PAKE protocols in the group scenario; in which a group of clients; eachof them shares his password with an “honest but curious” server; intend to establish acommon secret key (ie; a group key) with the help of the server. In this setting; the keyestablished is known to the clients only and no one else; including the server. Each clientneeds to remember the password only while the server keeps passwords in addition toprivate keys related to its identity. Towards our goal; we present a compiler that transformsany group key exchange (KE) protocol which is secure against a passive eavesdropping toa group PAKE which is secure against an active adversary who controls all …,International Workshop on Security,2009,29
Improving scalability of software cloud for composite web services,Jian Wu; Qianhui Liang; Elisa Bertino,Most of the work on cloud scalability has focused on the granularity of applications andsystems deployed on the cloud and on how to adjust their resource assignment according tothe scale or volume of the requests. In this paper; we present a scheme for improving thescalability of service-based applications in a cloud from the granularity of the constituentservices and their individual placement in the cloud. The approach we take is to analyze thecommunication patterns among the service operations of service-based applications and toanalyze the assignment of the involved services to the available servers. We define a notionof scalability for service-based applications in a cloud and a framework to measure thescalability. We then propose an optimized assignment strategy to improve the scalability ofcomposite Web services in terms of the productivity of such services. We report …,Cloud Computing; 2009. CLOUD'09.

Password policy simulation and analysis,Richard Shay; Abhilasha Bhargav-Spantzel; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Passwords are an ubiquitous and critical component of many security systems. Asthe information and access guarded by passwords become more necessary; we becomeever more dependent upon the security passwords provide. The creation and managementof passwords is crucial; and for this we must develop and deploy password policies. Thispaper focuses on defining and modeling password policies for the entire password policylifecycle. The paper first discusses a language for specifying password policies. Then; asimulation model is presented with a comprehensive set of variables and the algorithm forsimulating a password policy and its impact. Finally; the paper presents several simulationresults using the password policy simulation tool.,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM workshop on Digital identity management,2007,29
Active-U-Datalog: Integrating active rules in a logical update language,Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania; Vincenzo Gervasi; Alessandra Raffaetà,Abstract Deductive database technology represents an important step towards the goal ofdeveloping highly-declarative database programming languages. In order to makedeductive databases a practical technology; deductive rules have to be extended to providea dynamic behavior. In particular; current applications require not only a support for updatesand transactions but also the ability to automatically react to the occurrence of particularevents. This is possible by integrating typical deductive rules; whose execution is user-dependent; with active rules; whose execution is event-dependent. Current solutions to thisproblem are not completely satisfactory. In particular; they often lack a clear semantics;guaranteeing termination; confluence and efficient evaluation. The aim of this paper is topropose a new language for integrating active rules; deductive rules and updates in a …,Workshop on (Trans) Actions and Change in Logic Programming and Deductive Databases,1997,29

Fence: Continuous access control enforcement in dynamic data stream environments,Rimma V Nehme; Hyo-Sang Lim; Elisa Bertino,Abstract In this paper; we address the problem of continuous access control enforcement indynamic data stream environments; where both data and query security restrictions maypotentially change in real-time. We present FENCE framework that ffectively addresses thisproblem. The distinguishing characteristics of FENCE include:(1) the stream-centricapproach to security;(2) the symmetric model for security settings of both continuous queriesand streaming data; and (3) two alternative security-aware query processing approachesthat can optimize query execution based on regular and security-related selectivities. InFENCE; both data and query security restrictions are modeled symmetrically in the form ofsecurity metadata; called" security punctuations" embedded inside data streams.

On practical specification and enforcement of obligations,Ninghui Li; Haining Chen; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Obligations are an important and indispensable part of many access controlpolicies; such as those in DRM (Digital Rights Management) and healthcare informationsystems. To be able use obligations in a real-world access control system; there must exist alanguage for specifying obligations. However; such a language is currently lacking. XACML(eXtensible Access Control Markup Language); the current de facto standard for specifyingaccess control policies; seems to integrate obligations as a part of it; but it treats obligationslargely as black boxes; without specifying what an obligation should include and how tohandle them. In this paper we examine the challenges in designing a practical approach forspecifying and handling obligations; and then propose a language for specifyingobligations; and an architecture for handling access control policies with these …,Proceedings of the second ACM conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy,2012,28
On the complexity of authorization in RBAC under qualification and security constraints,Yuqing Sun; Qihua Wang; Ninghui Li; Elisa Bertino; Mikhail Atallah,In practice; assigning access permissions to users must satisfy a variety of constraintsmotivated by business and security requirements. Here; we focus on Role-Based AccessControl (RBAC) systems; in which access permissions are assigned to roles and roles arethen assigned to users. User-role assignment is subject to role-based constraints; such asmutual exclusion constraints; prerequisite constraints; and role-cardinality constraints. Also;whether a user is qualified for a role depends on whether his/her qualification satisfies therole's requirements. In other words; a role can only be assigned to a certain set of qualifiedusers. In this paper; we study fundamental problems related to access control constraintsand user-role assignment; such as determining whether there are conflicts in a set ofconstraints; verifying whether a user-role assignment satisfies all constraints; and how to …,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,2011,28

Thus; choosing theappropriate VO partners is a crucial aspect. Ensuring trustworthiness of the members is alsofundamental for making the best decisions. In this paper; we show how trust negotiationrepresents an effective means to select the best possible members during different stages inthe VO lifecycle. We base our discussion on concrete application scenarios and illustrate thetools created by us that integrate trust negotiation with a VO Management toolkit.,Computer Standards & Interfaces,2011,28
Cryptanalysis of some RFID authentication protocols,Tianjie Cao; Peng Shen; Elisa Bertino,Abstract—Two effective attacks; namely de-synchronization attack and impersonation attack;against Ha et al.'s LCSS RFID authentication protocol; Song and Mitchell's protocol areidentified. The former attack can break the synchronization between the RFID reader and thetag in a single protocol run so that they can not authenticate each other in any followingprotocol run. The latter can impersonate a legal tag to spoof the RFID reader by extractingthe ID of a specific tag during the authentication process. An impersonation attack againstChen et al.'s RFID authentication scheme is also identified. By sending malicious queries tothe tag and collecting the response messages emitted by the tag; the attack allows anadversary to extract the secret information from the tag and further to impersonate the legaltag.,Journal of Communications,2008,28
Access control management in a distributed environment supporting dynamic collaboration,Basit Shafiq; Elisa Bertino; Arif Ghafoor,Abstract Ensuring secure and authorized access to remote services and informationresources in a dynamic collaborative environment is a challenging task. Two major issuesthat need to be addressed in this regard are: specification of access control requirementsand trust management. Specification of access control requirements for dynamiccollaboration is challenging mainly because of the limited or lack of knowledge aboutremote users' identities and affiliations. The access control policies and constraints definingusers' authorization over remote resources and services need to be specified in terms of theattributes and properties of the users. Moreover; the criteria for validating the attributes of theusers should also be specified as part of access control requirements.

An approach to model and query event-based temporal data,Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Giovanna Guerrini,Temporal database systems support all functions related to the management of largeamounts of constantly changing data. However; current temporal database systems supporta flat view of the history of data changes; in that all the changes are considered equallyrelevant and are; therefore; all stored in the database. However; many applications; such asmonitoring and planning applications; call for more flexibility. Monitoring applications; inparticular; may require that the history of a data item is stored only whenever a certain eventoccurs. For other applications; the history of data changes may be less important than theevent causing the changes. In this paper; we propose an event-based temporal objectmodel which allows us to keep track of selected values within the history of a data objectattribute. The portions within the history of a data object which are actually stored in the …,Temporal Representation and Reasoning; 1998. Proceedings. Fifth International Workshop on,1998,28

Collusion detection in online rating systems,Mohammad Allahbakhsh; Aleksandar Ignjatovic; Boualem Benatallah; Elisa Bertino; Norman Foo,Abstract Online rating systems are subject to unfair evaluations. Users may try to individuallyor collaboratively promote or demote a product. Collaborative unfair rating; ie; collusion; ismore damaging than individual unfair rating. Detecting massive collusive attacks as well ashonest looking intelligent attacks is still a real challenge for collusion detection systems. Inthis paper; we study impact of collusion in online rating systems and asses theirsusceptibility to collusion attacks. The proposed model uses frequent itemset miningtechnique to detect candidate collusion groups and sub-groups. Then; several indicators areused for identifying collusion groups and to estimate how damaging such colluding groupsmight be. The model has been implemented and we present results of experimentalevaluation of our methodology.,Asia-Pacific Web Conference,2013,27
Sine: Cache-friendly integrity for the web,Camille Gaspard; Sharon Goldberg; Wassim Itani; Elisa Bertino; Cristina Nita-Rotaru,In this paper we present SINE; a cache-friendly protocol for integrity-enforced webdocuments. SINE operates by decoupling integrity from confidentiality and provides webdocuments with an integrity-enforcement authentication tag that can be incrementallyverified by multiple parties. We developed a prototype implementation of SINE with minimalchanges to the standard web client/server architecture and conducted experiments using thestandard Squid web proxy. Our experimental results show that SINE provides the requiredintegrity services to web pages while maintaining the standard caching mechanisms.Moreover; by taking advantage of caching; SINE shows a performance gain that reached afactor of 5 over SSL/TLS.,Secure Network Protocols; 2009.

Location privacy in moving-object environments,Dan Lin; Elisa Bertino; Reynold Cheng; Sunil Prabhakar,The expanding use of location-based services has profound implications on the privacy ofpersonal information. If no adequate protection is adopted; information about movements ofspecific individuals could be disclosed to unauthorized subjects or organizations; thusresulting in privacy breaches. In this paper; we propose a framework for preserving locationprivacy in moving-object environments. Our approach is based on the idea of sending to theservice provider suitably modified location information. Such modifications; that includetransformations like scaling; are performed by agents interposed between users and serviceproviders. Agents execute data transformation and the service provider directly processesthe transformed dataset. Our technique not only prevents the service provider from knowingthe exact locations of users; but also protects information about user movements and …,Transactions on Data Privacy,2009,27
Formal foundations for hybrid hierarchies in GTRBAC,James BD Joshi; Elisa Bertino; Arif Ghafoor; Yue Zhang,Abstract A role hierarchy defines permission acquisition and role-activation semanticsthrough role--role relationships. It can be utilized for efficiently and effectively structuringfunctional roles of an organization having related access-control needs. The focus of thispaper is the analysis of hybrid role hierarchies in the context of the generalized temporalrole-based access control (GTRBAC) model that allows specification of a comprehensive setof temporal constraints on role; user-role; and role-permission assignments. We introducethe notion of uniquely activable set (UAS) associated with a role hierarchy that indicates theaccess capabilities of a user resulting from his membership to a role in the hierarchy.Identifying such a role set is essential; while making an authorization decision aboutwhether or not a user should be allowed to activate a particular combination of roles in a …,ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC),2008,27

In Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) technology; Web Services are emerging asthe enabling technology that bridges decoupled systems across various platforms;programming languages; and applications. The benefits of Web Services and SOA come atthe expense of introducing new level of complexity to the environments where theseservices are deployed. This complexity is compounded by the freedom to compose WebServices to address requirements such as quality of service (QoS); availability; security;reliability; and cost. The complexity of composing services compounds the task of securing;testing; and managing the quality of the deployed services. This chapter identifies the …,*,2007,27

Modeling spatio-temporal constraints for multimedia objects,Yong-Moo Kwon; Elena Ferrari; Elisa Bertino,Abstract The presentation of multimedia data is not only characterized by precise temporalconstraints; also spatial constraints must be taken into account. An important requirement inmultimedia systems is thus the integrated modeling of spatio-temporal constraints.Moreover; it is important to devise methods for checking the consistency of the specifiedconstraints. In this paper; we first propose a spatio-temporal object graph (STOG) model thatprovides an integrated and graphical representation of spatio-temporal constraints. Second;we investigate consistency conditions between spatial and temporal constraints expressedin the STOG model.

Indexing techniques so far proposed can be classifiedinto three groups: inheritance indexing techniques; whose goal is to support queries alonginheritance hierarchies; aggregation indexing techniques; dealing with the efficientevaluation of nested predicates; integrated techniques. The aim of this paper is to analyzetwo techniques providing an integrated support; the path index and the nested-inheritedindex; with respect to traditional techniques; such as the multi-index and the inherited multi-index. The analysis is performed assuming that multi-valued attributes; as well as instanceswith null attribute values; are present in the database. For this purpose; the paper first …,Information Systems,1998,27

Beyond k-anonymity: A decision theoretic framework for assessing privacy risk,Guy Lebanon; Monica Scannapieco; Mohamed R Fouad; Elisa Bertino,Abstract An important issue any organization or individual has to face when managing datacontaining sensitive information; is the risk that can be incurred when releasing such data.Even though data may be sanitized; before being released; it is still possible for anadversary to reconstruct the original data by using additional information that may beavailable; for example; from other data sources. To date; however; no comprehensiveapproach exists to quantify such risks. In this paper we develop a framework; based onstatistical decision theory; to assess the relationship between the disclosed data and theresulting privacy risk. We relate our framework with the k-anonymity disclosure method; wemake the assumptions behind k-anonymity explicit; quantify them; and extend them inseveral natural directions.,International Conference on Privacy in Statistical Databases,2006,26
An adaptive access control model for web services,Elisa Bertino; Anna C Squicciarini; Lorenzo Martino; Federica Paci,Abstract This paper presents an innovative access control model; referred to as Web serviceAccess Control Version 1 (Ws-AC1); specifically tailored to Web services. The mostdistinguishing features of this model are the flexible granularity in protection objects andnegotiation capabilities. Under Ws-AC1; an authorization can be associated with a singleservice and can specify for which parameter values the service can be authorized for use;thus providing a fine access control granularity. Ws-AC1 also supports coarse granularitiesin protection objects in that it provides the notion of service class under which severalservices can be grouped. Authorizations can then be associated with a service class andautomatically propagated to each element in the class. The negotiation capabilities of Ws-AC1 are related to the negotiation of identity attributes and the service parameters …,International Journal of Web Services Research,2006,26
Access control for XML documents and data,Elisa Bertino; Barbara Carminati; Elena Ferrari,Abstract Protecting data over the web is today a crucial need for many companies andorganizations. This requires not only the use of cryptographic and digital signaturetechniques for protecting data during transmission; but also the development of suitableaccess control models and mechanisms able to support the specification and enforcement ofa variety of access control policies. In this paper; we first discuss which are the main accesscontrol requirements for web data; and compare some of the most important researchproposals with respect to these requirements. We then present Author-X [6] as an exampleof comprehensive system for controlling access to web data.,Information Security Technical Report,2004,26

Efficient and accurate strategies for differentially-private sliding window queries,Jianneng Cao; Qian Xiao; Gabriel Ghinita; Ninghui Li; Elisa Bertino; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Regularly releasing the aggregate statistics about data streams in a privacy-preserving way not only serves valuable commercial and social purposes; but also protectsthe privacy of individuals. This problem has already been studied under differential privacy;but only for the case of a single continuous query that covers the entire time span; eg;counting the number of tuples seen so far in the stream. However; most real-worldapplications are window-based; that is; they are interested in the statistical information aboutstreaming data within a window; instead of the whole unbound stream. Furthermore; a DataStream Management System (DSMS) may need to answer numerous correlated aggregatedqueries simultaneously; rather than a single one. To cope with these requirements; we studyhow to release differentially private answers for a set of sliding window aggregate queries …,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2013,25
A role-involved purpose-based access control model,Md Enamul Kabir; Hua Wang; Elisa Bertino,Abstract This paper presents a role-involved purpose-based access control (RPAC) model;where a conditional purpose is defined as the intention of data accesses or usages undercertain conditions. RPAC allows users using some data for a certain purpose withConditions (For instance; Tony agrees that his income information can be used for marketingpurposes by removing his name). The structure of RPAC model is investigated after definingaccess purposes; intended purposes and conditional purposes. An algorithm is developedwith role-based access control (RBAC) to achieve the compliance computation betweenaccess purposes (related to data access) and intended purposes (related to data objects).Access purpose authorization and authentication in the RPAC model are studied with thehierarchical purpose structure. According to the model; more information from data …,Information Systems Frontiers,2012,25
Data security in location-aware applications: an approach based on RBAC,Maria Luisa Damiani; Elisa Bertino; Paolo Perlasca,Data security in a mobile context is a critical issue. Over the last few years a new category oflocation-based services; the Enterprise LBS (ELBS); has emerged focusing on the demandsof mobility in organisations. These applications pose challenging requirements; includingthe need of selective access to ELBS based on the position of mobile users and spatiallybounded organisational roles. To deal with these requirements a novel access controlsystem; named GEO-RBAC; has been developed. GEO-RBAC extends the NIST RBAC(Role-Based Access Control) standard with the notions of spatial role; role-dependentposition; role schema and role instance. Further; roles become enabled/disabled based onthe position of the user. In the paper we present GEO-RBAC; a full-fledged RBAC-basedmodel; consisting; like RBAC; of three distinct components: the Core GEO-RBAC; the …,International Journal of Information and Computer Security,2007,25
Controlled and cooperative updates of XML documents in byzantine and failure-prone distributed systems,Giovanni Mella; Elena Ferrari; Elisa Bertino; Yunhua Koglin,Abstract This paper proposes an infrastructure and related algorithms for the controlled andcooperative updates of XML documents. Key components of the proposed system are a setof XML-based languages for specifying access-control policies and the path that thedocument must follow during its update. Such path can be fully specified before the updateprocess begins or can be dynamically modified by properly authorized subjects while beingtransmitted. Our approach is fully distributed in that each party involved in the process canverify the correctness of the operations performed until that point on the document withoutrelying on a central authority. More importantly; the recovery procedure also does not needthe participation of a central authority. Our approach is based on the use of some specialcontrol information that is transmitted together with the document and a suite of protocols …,ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC),2006,25
The indispensability of dispensable indexes,Elisa Bertino; Beng Chin Ooi,The design of new indexes has been driven by many factors; such as data types; operations;and application environment. The increasing demand for database systems to support newapplications such as online analytical processing (OLAP); spatial databases; and temporaldatabases has continued to fuel the development of new indexes. In this paper; wesummarize the major considerations in developing new indexes; paying particular attentionto progress made in the design of indexes for spatial; temporal databases; and object-oriented databases (OODB). Our discussion focuses on the general concepts or features ofthese indexes; thus presenting the building blocks for meeting the challenges of designingnew indexes for novel applications to be encountered in the future.,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering,1999,25
Applications of object-oriented technology to the integration of heterogeneous database systems,Elisa Bertino; Mauro Negri; Giuseppe Pelagatti; Licia Sbattella,Abstract The object-oriented paradigm has several features that facilitate the integration ofheterogeneous data management systems. One of the main problems in the integration is toprovide users with the same data model and language to access very different systems. Thisproblem exists in all kinds of distributed heterogeneous data management systems;independently from their integration architecture (like classical distributed databases;federated databases; multidatabases). This paper shows that the use of an object-orienteddata model for building a “uniform” view of several databases can greatly simplify this task;and actually extends the scope of integration towards two directions. The first concerns theintegration of data management systems to which traditional integration techniques; basedon mappings among data models; cannot be applied. The second direction moves the …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,1994,25
Modeling multilevel entities using single level objects,Elisa Bertino; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract An earlier paper by Jajodia and Kogan [5] introduced an approach for buildingmultilevel secure object-oriented database systems based on a secure message filteringmechanism. Under this approach each object has a unique security level and; therefore;multilevel objects are not supported. In the present paper; we discuss an approach; basedon composite objects; that allows multilevel entities to be represented in terms of single levelobjects. The main qualifying aspect of our approach is that the object interfaces can beprovided to users as if multilevel objects were directly supported.,International Conference on Deductive and Object-Oriented Databases,1993,25

Differentially private k-means clustering,Dong Su; Jianneng Cao; Ninghui Li; Elisa Bertino; Hongxia Jin,Abstract There are two broad approaches for differentially private data analysis. Theinteractive approach aims at developing customized differentially private algorithms forvarious data mining tasks. The non-interactive approach aims at developing differentiallyprivate algorithms that can output a synopsis of the input dataset; which can then be used tosupport various data mining tasks. In this paper we study the effectiveness of the twoapproaches on differentially private k-means clustering. We develop techniques to analyzethe empirical error behaviors of the existing interactive and non-interactive approaches.Based on the analysis; we propose an improvement of DPLloyd which is a differentiallyprivate version of the Lloyd algorithm. We also propose a non-interactive approach EUGkMwhich publishes a differentially private synopsis for k-means clustering.

Privacy-preserving enforcement of spatially aware RBAC,Michael S Kirkpatrick; Gabriel Ghinita; Elisa Bertino,Several models for incorporating spatial constraints into role-based access control (RBAC)have been proposed; and researchers are now focusing on the challenge of ensuring suchpolicies are enforced correctly. However; existing approaches have a major shortcoming; asthey assume the server is trustworthy and require complete disclosure of sensitive locationinformation by the user. In this work; we propose a novel framework and a set of protocols tosolve this problem. Specifically; in our scheme; a user provides a service provider with roleand location tokens along with a request. The service provider consults with a role authorityand a location authority to verify the tokens and evaluate the policy. However; none of theservers learn the requesting user's identity; role; or location. In this paper; we define theprotocols and the policy enforcement scheme; and present a formal proof of a number of …,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,2012,24
Location-based access control systems for mobile users: concepts and research directions,Elisa Bertino; Michael S Kirkpatrick,Abstract Many organizations require that sensitive information only be accessed on theorganization premises or in secure locations. Access to certain information is thus allowed toauthorized users; provided that these users are in specific locations when accessing theinformation. The GEO-RBAC model addresses such requirement. It is based on the notion ofa spatial role; that is; a geographically bounded organizational function. The boundary of arole is defined as a geographical feature; such as a hospital or a classified facility; itspecifies the spatial extent in which the user must be located in order to use the role.Besides a physical position obtained from a mobile terminal; users are assigned a logicaland device independent position; representing the feature where the user is located. Logicalpositions are computed from real positions by specific mapping functions. If the user is …,Proceedings of the 4th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Security and Privacy in GIS and LBS,2011,24
Responding to anomalous database requests,Ashish Kamra; Elisa Bertino; Rimma Nehme,Abstract Organizations have recently shown increased interest in database activitymonitoring and anomaly detection techniques to safeguard their internal databases. Oncean anomaly is detected; a response from the database is needed to contain the effects of theanomaly. However; the problem of issuing an appropriate response to a detected databaseanomaly has received little attention so far. In this paper; we propose a framework and policylanguage for issuing a response to a database anomaly based on the characteristics of theanomaly. We also propose a novel approach to dynamically change the state of the accesscontrol system in order to contain the damage that may be caused by the anomalousrequest. We have implemented our mechanisms in PostgreSQL and in the paper we discussrelevant implementation issues. We have also carried out an experimental evaluation to …,Workshop on Secure Data Management,2008,24

Achieving k-anonymity in mobile ad hoc networks,Xiaoxin Wu; Elisa Bertino,A zone-based K-anonymity routing protocol is proposed and investigated; the goal of whichis to achieve destination anonymity in positioning routing algorithms. Under this protocol; thesource sends the data to an anonymity zone; where the destination node and a number ofother nodes are located. The data is flooded within the anonymity zone so that to a tracer isnot able to guess which is the destination node. The paper presents the details of theprotocol design and proposes two approaches for anonymity zone management. Inparticular; we have found out that initially setting anonymity zone large can help to meet thedestination anonymity requirement for longer time at a relatively low control overhead.,Secure Network Protocols; 2005.(NPSec). 1st IEEE ICNP Workshop on,2005,24
An infrastructure for managing secure update operations on xml data,Elisa Bertino; Giovanni Mella; Gianluca Correndo; Elena Ferrari,Abstract Secure exchange of data over the web is becoming more and more importanttoday. By secure data exchange we mean that privacy and integrity are ensured whendocuments flow among different parties. A key issue in this scenario is how to ensure thatweb documents; when moving among different parties; are modified only according to thestated access control policies. To cope with such an issue; in this paper we propose adistributed infrastructure that enable subjects to verify; upon receiving a document; whetherthe update operations performed on the document till that point are correct with respect tothe stated access control policies; without interacting; in most cases; with the documentserver.,Proceedings of the eighth ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2003,24

Security-aware service composition with fine-grained information flow control,Wei She; I-Ling Yen; Bhavani Thuraisingham; Elisa Bertino,Enforcing access control in composite services is essential in distributed multidomainenvironment. Many advanced access control models have been developed to secure webservices at execution time. However; they do not consider access control validation atcomposition time; resulting in high execution-time failure rate of composite services due toaccess control violations. Performing composition-time access control validation is notstraightforward. First; many candidate compositions need to be considered and validatingthem can be costly. Second; some service composers may not be trusted to accessprotected policies and validation has to be done remotely. Another major issue with existingmodels is that they do not consider information flow control in composite services; whichmay result in undesirable information leakage. To resolve all these problems; we develop …,IEEE Transactions on services computing,2013,23
A comprehensive simulation tool for the analysis of password policies,Richard Shay; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Modern organizations rely on passwords for preventing illicit access to valuabledata and resources.

We present a password policy simulation model whichincorporates such factors as simulated users; accounts; and services. This model and itsimplementation enable administrators responsible for creating and managing passwordpolicies to test them before giving them to actual users. It also allows researchers to test howdifferent password policy factors impact security; without the time and expense of actualhuman studies.

Protecting location privacy through semantics-aware obfuscation techniques,Maria Luisa Damiani; Elisa Bertino; Claudio Silvestri,The widespread adoption of location-based services (LBS) raises increasing concerns forthe protection of personal location information. To protect location privacy the usual strategyis to obfuscate the actual position of the user with a coarse location and then forward theobfuscated location to the LBS provider. Existing techniques for location obfuscation areonly based on geometric methods. We state that such techniques do not protect againstprivacy attacks rooted in the knowledge of the spatial context. We thus present a novelframework for the safeguard of sensitive locations comprehensive of a privacy model and analgorithm for the computation of obfuscated locations,IFIP International Conference on Trust Management,2008,23
An analysis study on zone-based anonymous communication in mobile ad hoc networks,Xiaoxin Wu; Elisa Bertino,A zone-based anonymous positioning routing protocol for ad hoc networks; enablinganonymity of both source and destination; is proposed and analyzed. According to theproposed algorithm; a source sends data to an anonymity zone; where the destination nodeand a number of other nodes are located. The data is then flooded within the anonymityzone so that a tracer is not able to determine the actual destination node. Source anonymityis also enabled because the positioning routing algorithms do not require the source ID or itsposition for the correct routing. We develop anonymity protocols for both routeless and route-based data delivery algorithms. To evaluate anonymity; we propose a" measure ofanonymity;" and we develop an analytical model to evaluate it. By using this model; weperform an extensive analysis of the anonymity protocols to determine the parameters …,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,2007,23

Semantic assumptions and query evaluation in temporal databases,Claudio Bettini; X Sean Wang; Elisa Bertino; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract When querying a temporal database; a user often makes certain semanticassumptions on stored temporal data. This paper formalizes and studies two types ofsemantic assumptions: point-based and interval-based. The point-based assumptionsinclude those assumptions that use interpolation methods; while the interval-basedassumptions include those that involve different temporal types (time granularities). Eachassumption is viewed as a way to derive certain implicit data from the explicit data stored inthe database. The database system must use all explicit as well as (possibly infinite) implicitdata to answer user queries. This paper introduces a new method to facilitate such queryevaluations. A user query is translated into a system query such that the answer of thissystem query over the explicit data is the same as that of the user query over the explicit …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1995,23
Marlin: A fine grained randomization approach to defend against ROP attacks,Aditi Gupta; Sam Kerr; Michael S Kirkpatrick; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Code-reuse attacks; such as return-oriented programming (ROP); bypass defensesagainst code injection by repurposing existing executable code toward a malicious end. Acommon feature of these attacks is the reliance on the knowledge of the layout of theexecutable code. We propose a fine grained randomization based approach that modifiesthe layout of executable code and hinders code-reuse attack. Our solution; Marlin;randomizes the internal structure of the executable code; thereby denying the attacker thenecessary a priori knowledge of instruction addresses for constructing the desired exploitpayload. Our approach can be applied to any ELF binary and every execution of this binaryuses a different randomization. Our work shows that such an approach is feasible andsignificantly increases the level of security against code-reuse based attacks.,International Conference on Network and System Security,2013,22
Multi-route query processing and optimization,Rimma V Nehme; Karen Works; Chuan Lei; Elke A Rundensteiner; Elisa Bertino,Abstract A modern query optimizer typically picks a single query plan for all data based onoverall data statistics. However; many have observed that real-life datasets tend to have non-uniform distributions. Selecting a single query plan may result in ineffective query executionfor possibly large portions of the actual data. In addition most stream query processingsystems; given the volume of data; cannot precisely model the system state much lessaccount for uncertainty due to continuous variations. Such systems select a single queryplan based upon imprecise statistics. In this paper; we present “Query Mesh”(or QM); apractical alternative to state-of-the-art data stream processing approaches. The main idea ofQM is to compute multiple routes (ie; query plans); each designed for a particular subset ofthe data with distinct statistical properties.

An authorization system for digital libraries,Elena Ferrari; Nabil R Adam; Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Elisa Bertino; Ugo Capuozzo,Abstract. Digital Libraries (DLs) introduce several challenging requirements with respect tothe formulation; specification; and enforcement of adequate data protection policies. Unlikeconventional database environments; a DL environment typically is characterized by adynamic subject population; often making accesses from remote locations; and by anextraordinarily large amount of multimedia information; stored in a variety of formats.Moreover; in a DL environment; access policies are often specified based on subjectqualifications and characteristics; rather than subject identity. Traditional authorizationmodels are not adequate to meet access control requirements of DLs. In this paper; wepresent a Digital Library Authorization System (DLAS).

Temporal authorization bases: From specification to integration,Elisa Bertino; Piero Andrea Bonatti; Elena Ferrari; Maria Luisa Sapino,Abstract In this paper we present a powerful authorization mechanism which providessupport for:(1) periodic authorizations (both positive and negative); that is; authorizationsthat hold only in specific periods of time;(2) user-defined deductive temporal rules; by whichnew authorizations can be derived from those explicitly specified;(3) a hierarchicalorganization of subjects and objects; supporting a more adequate representation of theirsemantics. From the authorizations explicitly specified; additional authorizations areautomatically derived by the system based on those hierarchies. The resulting model istherefore very flexible in terms of the kinds of protection requirements that it can represent.The flexibility provided to the users requires a non trivial underlying formal model wheretemporal constraints; derivation rules and object and subject hierarchies can be …,Journal of Computer Security,2000,22
A constraint-based approach to shape management in multimedia databases,Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania,Abstract. Shape management is an important functionality in multimedia databases. Shapeinformation can be used in both image acquisition and image retrieval. Several approacheshave been proposed to deal with shape representation and matching. Among them; the data-driven approach supports searches for shapes based on indexing techniques.Unfortunately; efficient data-driven approaches are often defined only for specific types ofshape. This is not sufficient in contexts in which arbitrary shapes should be represented.Constraint databases use mathematical theories to finitely represent infinite sets of relationaltuples. They have been proved to be very useful in modeling spatial objects. In this paper;we apply constraint-based data models to the problem of shape management in multimediadatabases. We first present the constraint model and some constraint languages. Then …,Multimedia Systems,1998,22

Supporting periodic authorizations and temporal reasoning in database access control,Elisa Bertino; Claudio Bettini; Elena Ferrari; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Several formal models for database access control have been proposed. However;little attention has been paid to temporal issues like authorizations with limited validity orobtained by deductive reasoning with temporal constraints. We present an access controlmodel in which authorizations contain periodic temporal intervals of validity. Anauthorization is automatically granted in the time intervals speci ed by a periodic expressionand revoked when such intervals expire. Deductive temporal rules with periodicity and orderconstraints are provided to derive new authorizations based on the presence or absence ofother authorizations in speci c periods of time. We prove the uniqueness of the set of implicitauthorizations derivable at a given instant from the explicit ones; and we propose analgorithm to compute the global set of valid authorizations. The resulting model provides …,VLDB,1996,22

Often; they wish to see thissubset structured in a way which reflects their particular needs. Since it is not generallypossible to structure a database so as to please aU of its users; some mechanism is neededwhereby each user can view the data according to his (her) own requirements. Therepresentation of the data structure as seen by a user is often referred to as an externalschema; the view mechanism is a means by which a DBMS can support various externalschemas.,*,1983,22
Practical approximate k nearest neighbor queries with location and query privacy,Xun Yi; Russell Paulet; Elisa Bertino; Vijay Varadharajan,In mobile communication; spatial queries pose a serious threat to user location privacybecause the location of a query may reveal sensitive information about the mobile user. Inthis paper; we study approximate k nearest neighbor (kNN) queries where the mobile userqueries the location-based service (LBS) provider about approximate k nearest points ofinterest (POIs) on the basis of his current location. We propose a basic solution and ageneric solution for the mobile user to preserve his location and query privacy inapproximate kNN queries. The proposed solutions are mainly built on the Paillier public-keycryptosystem and can provide both location and query privacy. To preserve query privacy;our basic solution allows the mobile user to retrieve one type of POIs; for example;approximate k nearest car parks; without revealing to the LBS provider what type of points …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,21
A similarity measure for comparing XACML policies,Dan Lin; Prathima Rao; Rodolfo Ferrini; Elisa Bertino; Jorge Lobo,Assessing similarity of policies is crucial in a variety of scenarios; such as finding the cloudservice providers which satisfy users' privacy concerns; or finding collaborators which havematching security and privacy settings. Existing approaches to policy similarity analysis aremainly based on logical reasoning and Boolean function comparison. Such approaches arecomputationally expensive and do not scale well for large heterogeneous distributedenvironments (like the cloud). In this paper; we propose a policy similarity measure as alightweight ranking approach to help one party quickly locate parties with potentially similarpolicies. In particular; given a policy P; the similarity measure assigns a ranking (similarityscore) to each policy compared with P. We formally define the measure by taking intoaccount various factors and prove several important properties of the measure. Our …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2013,21
Leakage-free redactable signatures,Ashish Kundu; Mikhail J Atallah; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Redactable signatures for linear-structured data such as strings have already beenstudied in the literature. In this paper; we propose a formal security model for leakage-freeredactable signatures (LFRS) that is general enough to address authentication of not onlytrees but also graphs and forests. LFRS schemes have several applications; especially inenabling secure data management in the emerging cloud computing paradigm as well as inhealthcare; finance and biological applications. We have also formally defined the notion ofsecure names. Such secure names facilitate leakage-free verification of ordering betweensiblings/nodes. The paper also proposes a construction for secure names; and aconstruction for leakagefree redactable signatures based on the secure naming scheme.The proposed construction computes a linear number of signatures with respect to the …,Proceedings of the second ACM conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy,2012,21
Private searching for single and conjunctive keywords on streaming data,Xun Yi; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Current solutions for private searching on streaming data only support searchingfor" OR" of keywords or" AND" of two sets of keywords. In this paper; we extend the types ofprivate queries to support searching on streaming data for an" OR" of a set of both singleand conjunctive keywords. Our protocol is built on Boneh et al.'s result for the evaluation of 2-DNF formulas on ciphertexts. The size of our encrypted dictionary is O (| D|) only; which ismuch less than| D| 2; the size of the encrypted dictionary if conjunctive keywords is treatedas single keyword.,Proceedings of the 10th annual ACM workshop on Privacy in the electronic society,2011,21

Privacy-preserving matching of spatial datasets with protection against background knowledge,Gabriel Ghinita; Carmen Ruiz Vicente; Ning Shang; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Private matching (or join) of spatial datasets is crucial for applications where distinctparties wish to share information about nearby geo-tagged data items. To protect eachparty's data; only joining pairs of points should be revealed; and no additional informationabout non-matching items should be disclosed. Previous research efforts focused on privatematching for relational data; and rely either on space-embedding or on SMC techniques.Space-embedding transforms data points to hide their exact attribute values before matchingis performed; whereas SMC protocols simulate complex digital circuits that evaluate thematching condition without revealing anything else other than the matching outcome.However; existing solutions have at least one of the following drawbacks:(i) they fail toprotect against adversaries with background knowledge on data distribution;(ii) they …,Proceedings of the 18th SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2010,21
Self-tuning query mesh for adaptive multi-route query processing,Rimma V Nehme; Elke A Rundensteiner; Elisa Bertino,Abstract In real-life applications; different subsets of data may have distinct statisticalproperties; eg; various websites may have diverse visitation rates; different categories ofstocks may have dissimilar price fluctuation patterns. For such applications; it can be fruitfulto eliminate the commonly made single execution plan assumption and instead execute aquery using several plans; each optimally serving a subset of data with particular statisticalproperties. Furthermore; in dynamic environments; data properties may changecontinuously; thus calling for adaptivity. The intriguing question is: can we have an executionstrategy that (1) is plan-based to leverage on all the benefits of traditional plan-basedsystems;(2) supports multiple plans each customized for different subset of data; and yet (3)is as adaptive as" plan-less" systems like Eddies?

A service-oriented approach to security-concepts and issues,Elisa Bertino; Lorenzo D Martino,Various mechanisms for authentication and access control have been developed over time.Operating systems and DBMS implement such mechanisms and support quite rich accesscontrol models. A major limitation; however; of such mechanisms is that they are notextensible; thus whenever an application domain requires more sophisticated accesscontrols or authentication; the applications must include logics for such controls. Such anapproach leads to increased costs in application development and maintenance. For thesereasons; models and mechanisms apt to separate those functions have emerged; alsofostered by XML and Web services. At the same time; the need to drive the behaviour ofsecurity through clearly stated and machine-processable policies has fostered thedevelopment of various policy models and policy management mechanisms.

Protecting information on the Web,Elisa Bertino; Elena Pagani; Gian Paolo Rossi; Pierangela Samarati,Data access protection is generally governed by rules establishing accesses to be allowedor denied. The definition of these rules; which generally take the form of authorizations;requires the establishment of subjects to which access can be granted/denied; objects towhich access can be granted/denied; and actions for which access can be granted/denied.Each data-access request is checked against specified authorizations and granted only ifauthorized. To ensure that authorizations are correctly evaluated; the identity of the subjectrequesting access must be verified. Each access request must be accompanied by adeclaration and a proof of identity. The most common forms of identification and identityproofs are the login and password that users enter to sign into the system.

Towards Deductice Object Databases,Elisa Bertino; Giovanna Guerrini; Danilo Montesi,This paper proposes a new approach to model deductive object databases. Each objectdatabase is described by means of a Datalog language extended with extensional updates;called U-Datalog. Objects can change state and cooperate. We introduce an extension of U-Datalog to approach the problem of composition among object databases. It can be used formodular database design and for cooperation among deductive objects. The resultinglanguage has a clear semantics for the evolution of objects and for modeling thetransactional behavior of the resulting database. Finally; we describe some architecturalissues of the prototype which has been developed.,TAPOS,1995,21

Elementary updates are expressed in a declarative style bymeans of a constraint language. The constraint logic programming framework is used toprovide a declarative query-update language. Its semantics is defined in two steps. In suchframework an update query behaves as a transaction. A transactional behaviour of updatequeries is provided.,*,1993,21

Privacy-preserving association rule mining in cloud computing,Xun Yi; Fang-Yu Rao; Elisa Bertino; Athman Bouguettaya,Abstract Recently; the paradigm of data mining-as-a-service in cloud computingenvironment has been attracting interests. In this paradigm; a company (data owner); lackingdata storage; computational resources and expertise; stores its data in the cloud andoutsources its mining tasks to the cloud service provider (server). In order to protect theprivacy of the outsourced database and the association rules mined; k-anonymity; k-support;and k-privacy techniques have been proposed to perturb the data before it is uploaded tothe server. These techniques are computationally expensive. If the data owner hasresources to use these techniques; then it is often able to execute association rule mininglocally. In this paper; we consider a scenario where a user (data owner) encrypts its dataand stores it in the cloud. To mine association rules from its data; the user outsources the …,Proceedings of the 10th ACM symposium on information; computer and communications security,2015,20
Adaptive data protection in distributed systems,Anna Cinzia Squicciarini; Giuseppe Petracca; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Security is an important barrier to wide adoption of distributed systems for sensitivedata storage and management. In particular; one unsolved problem is to ensure thatcustomers data protection policies are honored; regardless of where the data is physicallystored and how often it is accessed; modified; and duplicated. This issue calls for tworequirements to be satisfied. First; data should be managed in accordance to both owners'preferences and to the local regulations that may apply. Second; although multiple copiesmay exist; a consistent view across copies should be maintained. Toward addressing theseissues; in this work we propose innovative policy enforcement techniques for adaptivesharing of users' outsourced data.

Software techniques to combat drift in puf-based authentication systems,Michael S Kirkpatrick; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Physically unclonable functions (PUFs) provide a mechanism for uniquelyidentifying a hardware device based on the intrinsic variations of physical components.Common applications for PUFs include generating or binding cryptographic keys in a securemanner. In recent work; though; we have examined the possibility of incorporating PUFsdirectly into certain cryptographic protocols as part of an access control mechanism. Theseprotocols rely on the ability of the PUF to produce an identical binary value at every attempt.One challenge with using PUFs in these authentication protocols is that device behavior canchange as the device ages. This change is called drift. Although short-term drift can behandled by applying error-correcting codes; longterm drift requires a more robust solution. Inthis work; we propose two software-based schemes for addressing drift. Our approaches …,Workshop on Secure Component and System Identification (SECSI 2010),2010,20

Towards a fine-grained access control model and mechanisms for semantic databases,Stefano Franzoni; Pietro Mazzoleni; Stefano Valtolina; Elisa Bertino,A growing number of domains are adopting semantic models as a centralized gateway toheterogeneous data sources; or directly for modeling and managing relevant information. Insuch contexts; it is crucial to grant access to the semantic model and its data only to theauthorized users. In this paper; we present a fine-grained access control model specificallytailored to semantic models. One of the relevant features of the model is the granularity ofthe resources that can be protected. Access control can be enforced at the level of both themodel's concepts and the concepts' instances by means of a query rewriting strategy. Theproposed model has been implemented adopting the XACML standard and the SeRQLquery language; services exposed by the implementation can be used to trans-paretlyintegrate authorization into existing systems.,Web Services; 2007.

Securing dbms: characterizing and detecting query floods,Elisa Bertino; Teodoro Leggieri; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Current multi-tiered Web-based applications are very often characterized by the useof a database system. Database systems are thus not any longer confined to well-protectedenvironments. In this paper; we focus on a specific type of attack; known as query flood.Under such an attack; a subject; or a colluding set of subjects; floods the database with avery large number of requests thus making the database unable to serve; with adequateresponse time; requests from honest subjects. The approach we propose is based onmodeling access profiles and using these profiles to detect unusual behaviors in thesubjects accessing the database. Our approach supports varying granularities in that onecan build a single profile for the entire database or build specialized profiles for each table inthe database. We employ our techniques both in misuse and anomaly detection settings …,International Conference on Information Security,2004,20
Towards supporting fine-grained access control for Grid Resources,Elisa Bertino; Pietro Mazzoleni; Bruno Crispo; Swaminathan Sivasubramanian,The heterogeneous nature and independent administration of geographically dispersedresources in a Grid demand the need for access control using fine-grained policies. In thispaper; we investigate the problem of fine-grained access control in the context of resourceallocation in the Grid; as we believe it is the first and key step in developing access controlmethods specifically tailored for Grid systems. To perform this access control; we design asecurity component (to be part of a meta-scheduler service) that finds the list of nodes wherea user is authorized to run his/her jobs. The security component is designed in an effort toreduce the number of rules that need to be evaluated for each user request. We believesuch a fine-grained policy-based access control would help the adoption of the Grid to ahigher extent into new avenues such as desktop Grids; as the resource owners are given …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2004.

A temporal object-oriented data model with multiple granularities,Isabella Merlo; Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Giovanna Guerrini,We investigate some issues arising from the introduction of multiple temporal granularities inan object-oriented data model. Although issues concerning temporal granularities havebeen investigated in the context of temporal relational database systems; no comparableamount of work has been done in the context of object-oriented models. Moreover; the maindrawback of the existing proposals is the lack of a formal basis-which we believe is essentialto manage the inherent complexity of the object-oriented data model. We provide a completetemporal object-oriented type system supporting multiple temporal granularities and weformally define the set of legal values for our type system.

A formal proximity model for RBAC systems,Aditi Gupta; Michael S Kirkpatrick; Elisa Bertino,Abstract To combat the threat of information leakage through pervasive access; researchershave proposed several extensions to the popular role-based access control (RBAC) model.Such extensions can incorporate contextual features; such as location; into the policydecision in an attempt to restrict access to trustworthy settings. In many cases; though; suchextensions fail to reflect the true threat; which is the presence or absence of other users;rather than absolute locations. For instance; for location-aware separation of duty; it is moreimportant to ensure that two people are in the same room; rather than in a designated; pre-defined location. Prox-RBAC was proposed as an extension to consider the relativeproximity of other users with the help of a pervasive monitoring infrastructure. However; thatwork offered only an informal view of proximity; and unnecessarily restricted the domain …,Computers & Security,2014,19
A hybrid approach to private record matching,Ali Inan; Murat Kantarcioglu; Gabriel Ghinita; Elisa Bertino,Real-world entities are not always represented by the same set of features in different datasets. Therefore; matching records of the same real-world entity distributed across these datasets is a challenging task. If the data sets contain private information; the problem becomeseven more difficult. Existing solutions to this problem generally follow two approaches:sanitization techniques and cryptographic techniques. We propose a hybrid technique thatcombines these two approaches and enables users to trade off between privacy; accuracy;and cost. Our main contribution is the use of a blocking phase that operates over sanitizeddata to filter out in a privacy-preserving manner pairs of records that do not satisfy thematching condition. We also provide a formal definition of privacy and prove that theparticipants of our protocols learn nothing other than their share of the result and what …,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,2012,19
Elimination of subjectivity from trust recommendation,Omar Hasan; Lionel Brunie; Jean-Marc Pierson; Elisa Bertino,Abstract In many distributed applications; a party who wishes to make a transaction requiresthat it has a certain level of trust in the other party. It is frequently the case that the parties areunknown to each other and thus share no pre-existing trust. Trust-based systems enableusers to establish trust in unknown users through trust recommendation from known users.For example; Bob may choose to trust an unknown user Carol when he receives arecommendation from his friend Alice that Carol's trustworthiness is 0.8 on the interval [0; 1].In this paper we highlight the problem that when a trust value is recommended by one userto another it may lose its real meaning due to subjectivity. Bob may regard 0.8 as a very highvalue of trust but it is possible that Alice perceived this same value as only average. Wepresent a solution for the elimination of subjectivity from trust recommendation. We run …,IFIP International Conference on Trust Management,2009,19

Position transformation: a location privacy protection method for moving objects,Dan Lin; Elisa Bertino; Reynold Cheng; Sunil Prabhakar,Abstract The expanding use of location-based services has profound implications on theprivacy of personal information. In this paper; we propose a framework for preservinglocation privacy based on the idea of sending to the service provider suitably modifiedlocation information. Agents execute data transformation and the service provider directlyprocesses the transformed dataset. Our technique not only prevents the service providerfrom knowing the exact locations of users; but also protects information about usermovements and locations from being disclosed to other users who are not authorized toaccess this information. We also define a privacy model to analyze our framework; andexamine our approach experimentally.,Proceedings of the SIGSPATIAL ACM GIS 2008 International Workshop on Security and Privacy in GIS and LBS,2008,19

Policy mapper is an administrative tool that helps defineaccess control at conceptual and logical levels to carry out constraint specification andenforcement. The tool also provides an interface definition language that couples the twolevels.

Access control policy analysis and visualization tools for security professionals,Kami Vaniea; Qun Ni; Lorrie Cranor; Elisa Bertino,ABSTRACT Managing large sets of access-control rules is a complex task for securityadministrators. Each addition; deletion or modification of a rule causes many potential andunknown side effects ranging from rule conflicts to security breaches. Security researchershave attempted to alleviate this problem by proposing algorithms and tools which analyzelists of rules and provide administrators with the information they need to better manage theirrules. Unfortunately few of these analysis tools connect a policy problem and the source ofthe problem clearly. In this work we discuss an interface that visualizes the output of policyanalysis and the source of the output in terms of the rule list and shows administrators theeffect of their changes.,USM'08: Workshop on Usable IT Security Management,2008,19

Systematic control and management of data integrity,Ji-Won Byun; Yonglak Sohn; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Integrity has long been considered a fundamental requirement for securecomputerized systems; and especially today's demand for data integrity is stronger than everas many organizations are in-creasing their reliance on data and information systems. Anumber of recently enacted data privacy regulations also require high in-tegrity for personaldata. In this paper; we discuss various issues concerning systematic control andmanagement of data integrity with a primary focus on access control. We first examine somepreviously proposed integrity models and define a set of integrity requirements. We thenpresent an architecture for comprehensive integrity control systems; which has its basis ondata validation and metadata management. We also provide an integrity control policylanguage that we believe is flexible and intuitive.,Proceedings of the eleventh ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2006,19
Supporting delegation in secure workflow management systems,Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Pietro Mazzoleni,Abstract Workflow systems are today used in numerous business application domainsincluding office automation; finance and banking; as well as in scientific applicationdomains; for automating their day-to-day applications; Often; organizations establish a set ofsecurity policies that regulate how the business process and resources should be managed.For reasons of ease in management; these security policies are expressed in terms of roles.In addition to simple authorization rules specifying which subject/role can execute a task in aworkflow; many business processes require support for more complex authorizationconstraints; such as separation of duties.

T-ODMG: an ODMG compliant temporal object model supporting multiple granularity management,Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Giovanna Guerrini; Isabella Merlo,Abstract In this paper we investigate some issues arising from the introduction of multipletemporal granularities in an object-oriented data model. Although issues concerningtemporal granularities have been investigated in the context of temporal relational databasesystems; no comparable amount of work has been done in the context of object-orientedmodels. Moreover; the main drawback of the existing proposals is the lack of a formal basis—which we believe is essential to manage the inherent complexity of the object-oriented datamodel. In this paper; we define a comprehensive temporal object-oriented data modelsupporting multiple temporal granularities. We formally define the main notions of the datamodel such as types; legal values; classes; and objects. We address issues related toinheritance; type refinement; and substitutability.

A reference framework for integrating multiple representations of geographical maps,Alberto Belussi; Barbara Catania; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Geographical maps can be represented and manipulated using different datamodels; each dealing with different map properties: geometrical properties; describing theshape; extension and location of the objects composing the map; combinatorial properties;interpreting the map as a set of disjoint elements satisfying a certain set of combinatorialconstraints; and topological properties; describing the topological relationships existingamong map objects. These different representations (that we call layers) are typicallysupported in most geographical systems. However; all existing systems are downwardclosed; meaning that if some information A is contained in the combinatorial (topological)layer; the information required to compute A must be contained in the geometrical(combinatorial/geometrical) layer. Several applications do not require this closure. Rather …,Proceedings of the 11th ACM international symposium on Advances in geographic information systems,2003,19
A graph-theoretic approach to indexing in object-oriented databases,Boris Shidlovsky; Elisa Bertino,A graph theoretic approach to the path indexing problem is proposed. We represent theindexing relationships supported by indices allocated in the classes in the path in the form ofa directed graph. All the previous approaches directly fit into the scheme and form ahierarchy of complexity with respect to the time required for selection of the optimal indexconfiguration. Based on the general scheme; we develop a new approach to the pathindexing problem exploiting the notion of visibility graph. We introduce a generalized nestedinherited index; give algorithms for retrieval and update operations and compare thebehavior of the new structure with previous approaches.,Data Engineering; 1996.

Optimization of object-oriented queries using path indices,Elisa Bertino; Claudia Guglielmina,This paper addresses the problem of efficiently evaluating nested predicates in object-oriented databases. The authors have previously introduced the notion of path index (E.Bertino et al.; 1989) that associates the values of a nested attribute with the instances of theclass root of a given aggregation hierarchy. They evaluated the performance of the pathindex in the case of queries containing a single predicate. Here they consider the usage ofthe path index in the framework of more general queries containing several predicates.,Research Issues on Data Engineering; 1992: Transaction and Query Processing; Second International Workshop on,1992,19
Specification and enforcement of flexible security policy for active cooperation,Yuqing Sun; Bin Gong; Xiangxu Meng; Zongkai Lin; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Interoperation and services sharing among different systems are becoming newparadigms for enterprise collaboration. To keep ahead in strong competition environments;an enterprise should provide flexible and comprehensive services to partners and supportactive collaborations with partners and customers. Achieving such goals requiresenterprises to specify and enforce flexible security policies for their information systems.Although the area of access control has been widely investigated; current approaches stilldo not support flexible security policies able to account for different weighs that typicallycharacterize the various attributes of the requesting parties and transactions and reflect theaccess control criteria that are relevant for the enterprise.

Privacy-preserving filtering and covering in content-based publish subscribe systems,Mohamed Nabeel; Ning Shang; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Content-Based Publish-Subscribe (CBPS) is an asynchronous messagingparadigm that supports a highly dynamic and many-to-many communication pattern basedon the content of the messages themselves. In general; a CBPS system has three distinctparties-Content Publishers; Content Brokers; and Subscribers-working in a highlydecoupled fashion. The ability to seamlessly scale on demand has made CBPS systems thechoice of distributing messages/documents produced by Content Publishers to manySubscribers through Content Brokers.

A policy-based authorization framework for web services: Integrating xgtrbac and ws-policy,Rafae Bhatti; Daniel Sanz; Elisa Bertino; Arif Ghafoor,Authorization and access control in Web services is complicated by the unique requirementsof the dynamic Web services paradigm. Current authentication mechanisms for Webservices do not differentiate between users in terms of fine-grained access privileges. Thisresults in an all-or-nothing access which is not flexible enough for modern day businessprocesses using Web services to execute. In this paper; we present a policy-basedauthorization framework to address this requirement. We have designed a profile of the well-known WS-policy specification tailored to meet the access control requirements in Webservices by integrating WS-policy with an access control policy specification language; X-GTRBAC. The design of the profile is aimed at bridging the gap between available policystandards for Web services and existing policy specification languages for access control …,Web Services; 2007.

Supporting robust and secure interactions in open domains through recovery of trust negotiations,Anna Cinzia Squicciarini; Alberto Trombetta; Elisa Bertino,Trust negotiation supports authentication and access control across multiple securitydomains by allowing parties to use non-forgeable digital credentials to establish trust. Bytheir nature trust negotiation systems are used in environments that are not always reliable.In particular; it is important not only to protect negotiations against malicious attacks; but alsoagainst failures and crashes of the parties or of the communication means. To address theproblem of failures and crashes; we propose an efficient and secure recovery mechanism.The mechanism includes two recovery protocols; one for each of the two main negotiationphases. In fact; because of the requirements that both services and credentials have to beprotected on the basis of the associated disclosure policies; most approaches distinguishbetween a phase of disclosure policy evaluation from a phase devoted to actual …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2007.

Security in SOA and Web services,Elisa Bertino; Lorenzo Martino,Security is today a relevant requirement for any distributed application; and in particular forthese enabled by the Web such as e-health; e-commerce; and e-learning. It is thus crucialthat the use of Web services; stand-alone or composed; provide strong security guarantees.Web services security encompasses several requirements that can be described along thewell known security dimensions; that is: integrity; whereby a message must remain unalteredduring transmission; confidentiality; whereby the contents of a message cannot be viewedwhile in transit; except by authorized services; availability; whereby a message is promptlydelivered to the intended recipient; thus ensuring that legitimate users receive the servicesthey are entitled to. Moreover; each Web service must protect its own resources againstunauthorized access. This in turn requires suitable means for: identification; whereby the …,Services Computing; 2006. SCC'06.

A constraint-based approach for the authoring of multi-topic multimedia presentations,Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Andrea Perego; Diego Santi,Synchronized multimedia applications play an important role in a digital library environment;since they allow one to efficiently disseminate knowledge among differently skilled usersthrough an approach; which is more direct than the classic'static'documents. In this paper;we propose a new authoring approach based on an innovative presentation structure and anew class of content-based constraints. Thanks to a flexible heuristic process; such featuresallow the author to easily combine several multimedia objects into a multi-topic presentation;whose different contents can be freely chosen by end users according to their preferences orskills,Multimedia and Expo; 2005.

An object-oriented data model for distributed office applications,Elisa Bertino; M Negri; G Pelagatti; L Sbattella,Abstract The object-oriented paradigm is becoming very popular for database applicationsand several object-oriented DBMSs have been developed. A basic notion in this paradigm isthe inheritance hierarchy that allows the users to define objects and the associatedoperations starting from already defined objects. However; in database applications theinheritance hierarchy must provide a conceptual modeling function; in addition to the re-usability function. Another important requirement is to provide support for data distribution in(possibly) heterogeneous environments. This means that object implementation may differdepending on the object location. This paper presents a model that decouples these twoaspects; modeling vs implementation; by using the concept of abstract and implementationclasses. An abstract class specifies properties and methods for a set of similar objects …,ACM SIGOIS Bulletin,1990,18
A roadmap for privacy-enhanced secure data provenance,Elisa Bertino; Gabriel Ghinita; Murat Kantarcioglu; Dang Nguyen; Jae Park; Ravi Sandhu; Salmin Sultana; Bhavani Thuraisingham; Shouhuai Xu,Abstract The notion of data provenance was formally introduced a decade ago and hassince been investigated; but mainly from a functional perspective; which follows thehistorical pattern of introducing new technologies with the expectation that security andprivacy can be added later. Despite very recent interests from the cyber security communityon some specific aspects of data provenance; there is no long-haul; overarching; systematicframework for the security and privacy of provenance. The importance of secure provenanceR&D has been emphasized in the recent report on Federal game-changing R&D for cybersecurity especially with respect to the theme of Tailored Trustworthy Spaces. Secure dataprovenance can significantly enhance data trustworthiness; which is crucial to variousdecision-making processes. Moreover; data provenance can facilitate accountability and …,Journal of Intelligent Information Systems,2014,17
Building access control policy model for privacy preserving and testing policy conflicting problems,Hua Wang; Lili Sun; Elisa Bertino,Abstract This paper proposes a purpose-based access control model in distributedcomputing environment for privacy preserving policies and mechanisms; and describesalgorithms for policy conflicting problems. The mechanism enforces access policy to datacontaining personally identifiable information. The key component is purpose involvedaccess control models for expressing highly complex privacy-related policies with variousfeatures. A policy refers to an access right that a subject can have on an object; based onattribute predicates; obligation actions; and system conditions. Policy conflicting problemsmay arise when new access policies are generated that are possible to be conflicted toexisting policies. As a result of the policy conflicts; private information cannot be wellprotected. The structure of purpose involved access control policy is studied; and efficient …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2014,17
Privacy-preserving authentication of trees and graphs,Ashish Kundu; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Secure data sharing in third-party environments such as the cloud requires thatboth authenticity and confidentiality of the data be assured; especially when such structuresencode sensitive information (such as in XML documents). Existing authentication schemesfor trees and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are authenticity-preserving; but notconfidentiality-preserving; and lead to leakage of sensitive information during authentication.In this paper; we propose a family of three leakage-free authentication schemes for (1) treedata structures;(2) directed acyclic graphs (DAGs); and (3) graphs (with cycles); which arealso efficient. This family of schemes referred to as the “structural signatures” is based on thestructure of the tree as defined by tree traversals and aggregate signatures. We also showthrough complexity and performance analysis that our scheme is practical in terms of the …,International journal of information security,2013,17
Privacy preserving context aware publish subscribe systems,Mohamed Nabeel; Stefan Appel; Elisa Bertino; Alejandro Buchmann,Abstract Modern pub/sub systems perform message routing based on the message contentand allow subscribers to receive messages related to their subscriptions and the currentcontext. Both content and context encode sensitive information which should be protectedfrom third-party brokers that make routing decisions. In this work; we address this issue byproposing an approach that assures the confidentiality of the messages being publishedand subscriptions being issued while allowing the brokers to make routing decisions withoutdecrypting individual messages and subscriptions; and without learning the context. Further;subscribers with a frequently changing context; such as location; are able to issue andupdate subscriptions without revealing the subscriptions in plaintext to the broker andwithout the need to contact a trusted third party for each subscription change resulting …,International Conference on Network and System Security,2013,17
Elliptic curve cryptography based certificateless hybrid signcryption scheme without pairing,S Seo; Elisa Bertino,Signcryption is a scheme that provides confidentiality and authentication while keepingcosts low in comparison to independent encryption and message sign ing. Since Zheng [13]introduced the concept of signcryption; a variety of schemes have been presented in [6–11].We can divide the schemes in two ways to construct the signcryption scheme such as apublic signcryption and a hy brid signcryption. In the public signcryption scheme; theprocess of encryption and signing are performed utilizing the public key operation. However;in the hybrid signcryption scheme; only the signing process uses the public key oper ationwhile the symmetric key setting is used for the encryption. That is; we can construct thehybrid signcryption scheme by combining two methods:(1) an asymmetric part; takes aprivate and a public key as the input and outputs a suitably sized random symmetric key …,CERIAS; West Lafayette; IN; USA; Tech.

Privacy preserving olap over distributed xml data: A theoretically-sound secure-multiparty-computation approach,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Privacy Preserving Distributed OLAP is becoming a critical challenge for next-generation Business Intelligence (BI) scenarios; due to the “natural suitability” of OLAP inanalyzing distributed massive BI repositories in a multidimensional and multi-granularitymanner. In particular; in these scenarios XML-formatted BI repositories play a dominant role;due to the well-know amenities of XML in modeling and representing distributed businessdata. However; while Privacy Preserving Distributed Data Mining has been widelyinvestigated; the problem of effectively and efficiently supporting privacy preserving OLAPover distributed collections of XML documents; which is relevant in practice; has beenneglected so far. In order to fulfill this gap; we propose a novel Secure MultipartyComputation (SMC)-based privacy preserving OLAP framework for distributed collections …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2011,17
Group-based negotiations in p2p systems,Anna C Squicciarini; Federica Paci; Elisa Bertino; Alberto Trombetta; Stefano Braghin,In P2P systems; groups are typically formed to share resources and/or to carry on joint tasks.In distributed environments formed by a large number of peers conventional authenticationtechniques are inadequate for the group joining process; and more advanced ones areneeded. Complex transactions among peers may require more elaborate interactions basedon what peers can do or possess instead of peers' identity. In this work; we propose a novelpeer group joining protocol. We introduce a highly expressive resource negotiationlanguage; able to support the specification of a large variety of conditions applying to singlepeers or groups of peers. Moreover; we define protocols to test such resource availabilitycustomized to the level of assurance required by the peers. Our approach has been testedand evaluated on an extension of the JXTA P2P platform. Our results show the …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2010,17
Tagging stream data for rich real-time services,Rimma V Nehme; Elke A Rundensteiner; Elisa Bertino,Abstract In recent years; data streams have become ubiquitous as technology is improvingand the prices of portable devices are falling; eg; sensor networks; location-based services.Most data streams transmit only data tuples based on which continuous queries areevaluated. In this paper; we propose to enrich data streams with a new type of metadatacalled streaming tags or short tick-tags. The fundamental premise of tagging is that userscan label data using uncontrolled vocabulary; and these tags can be exploited in a widevariety of applications; such as data exploration; data search; and to produce" enriched" withadditional semantics; thus more informative query results. In this paper we focus primarily onthe problem of continuous query processing with streaming tags and tagged objects; andaddress the tick-tag semantic issues as well as efficiency concerns.

Multi-granular spatio-temporal object models: concepts and research directions,Elisa Bertino; Elena Camossi; Michela Bertolotto,Abstract The capability of representing spatio-temporal objects is fundamental whenanalysing and monitoring the changes in the spatial configuration of a geographical areaover a period of time. An important requirement when managing spatio-temporal objects isthe support for multiple granularities. In this paper we discuss how the modelling constructsof object data models can be extended for representing and querying multi-granular spatio-temporal objects. In particular; we describe object-oriented formalizations for granularities;granules; and multi-granular values; exploring the issues of value conversions. Furthermore;we formally define an object-oriented multi-granular query language; and discuss dynamicmulti-granularity. Finally; we discuss open research issues.,International Conference on Object Databases,2009,17

Private updates to anonymous databases,Alberto Trombetta; Elisa Bertino,Suppose that Alice; owner of a k-anonymous database; needs to determine whether herdatabase; when adjoined with a tuple owned by Bob; is still k-anonymous. Supposemoreover that access to the database is strictly controlled; because for example data areused for experiments that need to be maintained confidential. Clearly; allowing Alice todirectly read the contents of the tuple breaks the privacy of Bob; on the other hand; theconfidentiality of the database managed by Alice is violated once Bob has access to thecontents of the database. Thus the problem is to check whether the database adjoined withthe tuple is still k-anonymous; without letting Alice and Bob know the contents of;respectively; the tuple and the database. In this paper; we propose two protocols solving thisproblem.,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06. Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on,2006,17
Querying multiple temporal granularity data,Isabella Merlo; Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Shashi Gadia; Giovanna Guerrini,Managing and querying information with varying temporal granularities is an importantproblem in databases. Although there is a substantial body of work on temporal granularitiesfor the relational data model (Snodgrass; 1995); a comprehensive framework is lacking forthe object-oriented paradigm. To the best of our knowledge; a formal treatment of temporalqueries with multiple granularities has not been considered in the literature. We make a stepin this direction. We formally introduce the syntax and semantics of expressions involvingdata with multiple granularities; comparison between data with different granularities; andconversion of data from one granularity to another. We believe that this is an important steptowards the development of an object-oriented query language that supports multiplegranularities.,Temporal Representation and Reasoning; 2000. TIME 2000.

Towards optimal two-dimensional indexing for constraint databases,Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania; Boris Shidlovsky,Abstract We address the problem of indexing conjunctions of linear constraints with twovariables. We show how containment and intersection selection problems for constraintdatabases can be reduced to the point location problem by using a dual transformation. Theproposed representation is then used to develop an efficient secondary storage solution forone important particular indexing case.,Information Processing Letters,1997,17
A theoretical formulation for degrees of isolation in databases,Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Elisa Bertino; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract Although isolation is one of the desirable properties; most commercial databasemanagement systems do not provide complete isolation to transactions. They offer differentdegrees—0; 1; 2; or 3—of isolation; to transactions. By providing lower degrees of isolation;response time of a database system can be improved; although at the expense ofconsistency. Originally different degrees of isolation were defined in terms of lock-basedprotocols. This paper formulates these different degrees of isolation in terms of histories; asin the case of the usual serialization theory and proposes timestamp-based protocols fordifferent degrees of isolation.,Information and Software Technology,1997,17
Transaction Optimization in Rule Databases,Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania; Giovanna Guerrini; Danilo Montesi,The authors propose an approach to transection optimization in rule databases. It is basedon a new technique to express updates in rule languages based on a non-immediateupdate execution. This technique is used to statically characterize some properties of therules and transactions. Those properties are used at run-time to detect and removeredundant/complementary updates which are useless; hence increasing the efficiency oftransaction execution.,Research Issues in Data Engineering; 1994.

The effects of two-phase locking on the performance of a distributed database management system,Costantino Thanos; Elisa Bertino; Carlo Carlesi,Abstract In this paper; the effects of two-phase locking on the performance of a distributeddatabase management system are evaluated. In particular; the relationship between theaverage transaction response time for four concurrency control algorithms based on two-phase locking has been established with respect to the static degree of interference for agiven multiprogramming level; database size; and transaction size. The increase in averageprobability of one lock request conflicting with another has been measured with respect tothe static degree of interference and the percentage of aborted transactions has beenmeasured for each algorithm. In addition; the impact of a number of parameters (eg datareplication; lock predeclaration; time-out; local processing time; degree of locality ofreferences; interarrival time; number of nodes and transmission time) on the performance …,Performance Evaluation,1988,17
Protecting outsourced data in cloud computing through access management,Hua Wang; Xun Yi; Elisa Bertino; Lili Sun,Summary Data outsourcing is a major component for cloud computing because data ownersare able to distribute resources to external services for sharing with users and organizations.A crucial problem for owners is how to secure sensitive information accessed by legitimateusers only using the trusted services. We address the problem with access control methodsto enforce selective access to outsourced data without involving the owner in authorization.The basic idea is to combine cryptography with authorizations; and data owners assign keysto roles that will enforce access via encryption. A formal access model is designed toanalyze the translating an authorization policy into an equivalent encryption policy. Thepaper also investigates the effect of role hierarchy structure in the authorization process.

A secure communication protocol for drones and smart objects,Jongho Won; Seung-Hyun Seo; Elisa Bertino,Abstract In many envisioned drone-based applications; drones will communicate with manydifferent smart objects; such as sensors and embedded devices. Securing suchcommunications requires an effective and efficient encryption key establishment protocol.However; the design of such a protocol must take into account constrained resources ofsmart objects and the mobility of drones. In this paper; a secure communication protocolbetween drones and smart objects is presented. To support the required security functions;such as authenticated key agreement; non-repudiation; and user revocation; we propose anefficient Certificateless Signcryption Tag Key Encapsulation Mechanism (eCLSC-TKEM).eCLSC-TKEM reduces the time required to establish a shared key between a drone and asmart object by minimizing the computational overhead at the smart object.

Detanom: Detecting anomalous database transactions by insiders,Syed Rafiul Hussain; Asmaa M Sallam; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Database Management Systems (DBMSs) provide access control mechanisms thatallow database administrators (DBA) to grant application programs access privileges todatabases. However; securing the database alone is not enough; as attackers aiming atstealing data can take advantage of vulnerabilities in the privileged applications and makeapplications to issue malicious database queries. Therefore; even though the access controlmechanism can prevent application programs from accessing the data to which theprograms are not authorized; it is unable to prevent misuse of the data to which applicationprograms are authorized for access. Hence; we need a mechanism able to detect maliciousbehavior resulting from previously authorized applications. In this paper; we design andimplement an anomaly detection mechanism; DetAnom; that creates a profile of the …,Proceedings of the 5th ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy,2015,16
A supermodularity-based differential privacy preserving algorithm for data anonymization,Mohamed R Fouad; Khaled Elbassioni; Elisa Bertino,Maximizing data usage and minimizing privacy risk are two conflicting goals. Organizationsalways apply a set of transformations on their data before releasing it. While determining thebest set of transformations has been the focus of extensive work in the database community;most of this work suffered from one or both of the following major problems: scalability andprivacy guarantee. Differential Privacy provides a theoretical formulation for privacy thatensures that the system essentially behaves the same way regardless of whether anyindividual is included in the database. In this paper; we address both scalability and privacyrisk of data anonymization. We propose a scalable algorithm that meets differential privacywhen applying a specific random sampling. The contribution of the paper is two-fold: 1) wepropose a personalized anonymization technique based on an aggregate formulation …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,16

Publishing time-series data under preservation of privacy and distance orders,Yang-Sae Moon; Hea-Suk Kim; Sang-Pil Kim; Elisa Bertino,Abstract In this paper we address the problem of preserving mining accuracy as well asprivacy in publishing sensitive time-series data. For example; people with heart disease donot want to disclose their electrocardiogram time-series; but they still allow mining of someaccurate patterns from their time-series. Based on this observation; we introduce the relatedassumptions and requirements. We show that only randomization methods satisfy allassumptions; but even those methods do not satisfy the requirements. Thus; we discuss therandomization-based solutions that satisfy all assumptions and requirements. For thispurpose; we use the noise averaging effect of piecewise aggregate approximation (PAA);which may alleviate the problem of destroying distance orders in randomly perturbed time-series. Based on the noise averaging effect; we first propose two naive solutions that use …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2010,16
Assessing the trustworthiness of location data based on provenance,Chenyun Dai; Hyo-Sang Lim; Elisa Bertino; Yang-Sae Moon,Abstract Trustworthiness of location information about particular individuals is of particularinterest in the areas of forensic science and epidemic control. In many cases; locationinformation is not precise and may include fraudulent information. With the growth of mobilecomputing and positioning systems; eg; GPS and cell phones; it has become possible totrace the location of moving objects. Such Systems provide us an opportunity to find out thetrue locations of individuals. In this paper; we present a model to compute trustworthiness ofthe location information of an individual based on different evidences from different sources.We also introduce a collusion attack that may bias the computation. Based on the analysis ofthe attack; we present the algorithm to detect and reduce the effect of collusion attacks. Ourexperimental results show the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.,Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2009,16
A characterization of the problem of secure provenance management,Shouhuai Xu; Qun Ni; Elisa Bertino; Ravi Sandhu,Data (or information) provenance has many important applications. However; prior work ondata provenance management almost exclusively focused on the collection; representation;query; and storage of provenance data. In contrast; the security aspect of provenancemanagement has not been understood nor adequately addressed. A natural question thenis: What would a secure provenance management system-perhaps as an analogy to securedatabase management systems-look like? In this paper; we explore the problem space ofsecure provenance management systems with an emphasis on the security requirements forsuch systems; and characterize desired solutions for tackling the problem. We believe thatthis paper makes a significant step towards a comprehensive solution to the problem ofsecure provenance management.,Intelligence and Security Informatics; 2009. ISI'09.

ARUBA: A risk-utility-based algorithm for data disclosure,Mohamed R Fouad; Guy Lebanon; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Dealing with sensitive data has been the focus of much of recent research. On onehand data disclosure may incur some risk due to security breaches; but on the other handdata sharing has many advantages. For example; revealing customer transactions at agrocery store may be beneficial when studying purchasing patterns and market demand.However; a potential misuse of the revealed information may be harmful due to privacyviolations. In this paper we study the tradeoff between data disclosure and data retention.Specifically; we address the problem of minimizing the risk of data disclosure whilemaintaining its utility above a certain acceptable threshold. We formulate the problem as adiscrete optimization problem and leverage the special monotonicity characteristics for bothrisk and utility to construct an efficient algorithm to solve it. Such an algorithm determines …,Workshop on Secure Data Management,2008,16

Data security in such a framework isan important problem and crucial for many Web applications. In this paper; we propose anapproach that addresses data integrity and confidentiality in content adaptation and cachingby intermediaries. Our approach permits multiple intermediaries to simultaneously performcontent services on different portions of the data. Our protocol supports decentralized proxyand key management and flexible delegation of services. Our experimental results show thatour approach is efficient and minimizes the amount of data transmitted across the network.,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2008,16
Trust evaluation of data provenance,Chenyun Dai; Dan Lin; Elisa Bertino; Murat Kantarcioglu,Abstract With the increased need of data sharing among multiple organizations likegovernment organizations; financial corporations; medical hospitals and academicinstitutions; it is critical to ensure data integrity so that effective decisions can be made basedon these data. An important component of any solution for assessing data integrity isrepresented by techniques and tools to evaluate the trustworthiness of data provenance.However; few efforts have been devoted to investigate approaches for assessing howtrusted the data are; based in turn on an assessment of the data sources and intermediaries.To bridge this gap; we propose a data provenance trust model.

Auth-sl-a system for the specification and enforcement of quality-based authentication policies,Anna C Squicciarini; Abhilasha Bhargav-Spantzel; Elisa Bertino; Alexei B Czeksis,Abstract This paper develops a language and a reference architecture supporting themanagement and enforcement of authentication policies. Such language directly supportsmulti-factor authentication and the high level specification of authentication factors; in termsof conditions against the features of the various authentication mechanisms and modules. Inaddition the language supports a rich set of constraints; by using these constraints; one canspecify for example that a subject must be authenticated by two credentials issued bydifferent authorities.

An object-relational approach to the representation of multi-granular spatio-temporal data,Elisa Bertino; Dolores Cuadra; Paloma Martínez,Abstract The notion of spatio-temporal multi-granularity is fundamental when modelingobjects in GIS applications in that it supports the representation of the temporal evolutions ofthese objects. Concepts and issues in multi-granular spatio-temporal representations havebeen widely investigated by the research community. However; despite the large number oftheoretical investigations; no comprehensive approaches; have been proposed dealing withthe representation of multi-granular spatio-temporal objects in commercially availableDBMSs. The goal of the work that we report in this paper is to address this gap. To achieve it;the paper first introduces an object-relational model based on OpenGis specificationsdescribed in SQL3.

A framework for contractual resource sharing in coalitions,Babak Sadighi Firozabadi; Marek Sergot; A Squicciarin; Elisa Bertino,We develop a framework for specifying and reasoning about policies for sharing resourcesin coalitions; focussing here on a particular; common type of contract in which coalitionmembers agree to make available some total amount of specified resource over a given timeperiod. The main part of the framework is a policy language with two basicelements:'obligations'(of a member enterprise to provide a total amount of resource over agiven time period) express the coalition policy; and'entitlements'(granted by an enterprise toother coalition members) express the local policies of the coalition members. We discuss theconditions under which a local policy can be said to be in compliance with; or meet; theobligations of a coalition policy; and the conditions under which an obligation; and byextension a contract; can be said to be violated or fulfilled.,Policies for Distributed Systems and Networks; 2004.

The specific application we dealt with is the analysis ofdata concerning the wafer production process with the goal of determining possible causesfor errors; resulting in lots of faulty wafers. Even though our application is very specific anddeals with a specific manufacturing sector (eg semiconductor fabrication); we believe thatour experience can be relevant to other manufacturing sectors and provide significantfeedback on the use of data mining techniques.,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,1999,16

Encryption key management for secure communication in smart advanced metering infrastructures,Seung-Hyun Seo; Xiaoyu Ding; Elisa Bertino,Smart grid technology can improve environmental sustainability and increase the efficiencyof energy management. Because of these important benefits; conventional power gridsystems are being replaced with new; advanced smart grid systems utilizing AdvancedMetering Infrastructures (AMIs). These smart grid systems rely on current information andcommunication technology (ICT) to provide enhanced services to both users and utilitycompanies. However; the increased use of ICT makes smart grid systems vulnerable tocyber-attacks; such as spoofing; eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. A majorsecurity concern is related to secure data transmission between the smart meters and theutility. Encryption techniques are typically used for such purpose.

Demonstrating a lightweight data provenance for sensor networks,Bilal Shebaro; Salmin Sultana; Shakthidhar Reddy Gopavaram; Elisa Bertino,Abstract The popularity of sensor networks and their many uses in critical domains such asmilitary and healthcare make them more vulnerable to malicious attacks. In such contexts;trustworthiness of sensor data and their provenance is critical for decision-making. In thisdemonstration; we present an efficient and secure approach for transmitting provenanceinformation about sensor data. Our provenance approach uses light-weight in-packet Bloomfilters that are encoded as sensor data travels through intermediate sensor nodes; and aredecoded and verified at the base station. Our provenance technique is also able to defendagainst malicious attacks such as packet dropping and allows one to detect the responsiblenode for packet drops. As such it makes possible to modify the transmission route to avoidnodes that could be compromised or malfunctioning.

However; in order for analysts and decision makers to produceaccurate analysis and make effective decisions and take actions; data must be trustworthy.Therefore; it is critical that data trustworthiness issues; which also include data quality;provenance and lineage; be investigated for organizational data sharing; situationassessment; multi-sensor data integration and numerous other functions to support decisionmakers and analysts. The problem of providing trustworthy data to users is an inherentlydifficult problem that requires articulated solutions combining different methods andtechniques. In the paper we first elaborate on the data trustworthiness challenge and …,Workshop on Secure Data Management,2010,15
Identity-based long running negotiations,Anna C Squicciarini; Alberto Trombetta; Elisa Bertino; Stefano Braghin,Abstract Identity based negotiations are convenient protocols to closely control users'personal data; that empower users to negotiate the trust of unknown counterparts bycarefully governing the disclosure of their identities. Such type of negotiations presents;however; unique challenges; mainly caused by the way identity attributes are distributed andmanaged. In this paper we present novel approach for conducting long running negotiationsin the context of digital identity management systems. We propose some major extensions toan existing trust negotiation protocol to support negotiations that are conducted duringmultiple sessions. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first time a protocol for conductingtrust negotiations over multiple sessions is presented.,Proceedings of the 4th ACM workshop on Digital identity management,2008,15
Approach to supporting continuity of usage in location-based access control,Maria Luisa Damiani; Elisa Bertino; Claudio Silvestri,In location-based access control systems; the location of subjects is a relevant parameter inaccess control decisions. Those systems however fail in controlling the location ofsubjectsalong the period of use of the objects and this can lead to security breaches. To ensure astronger protection of objects; a continuous control over the movement of subjectsis thusneeded. To address this requirement; we have developed GEO-RBAC_C a location-basedaccess control model supporting continuous usage control capabilities. In the paper; we firstpresent the basic concepts of the model and then discuss how the continuous control can beactually enforced.,Future Trends of Distributed Computing Systems; 2008.

End-to-end accountability in grid computing systems for coalition information sharing,Elisa Bertino; Wonjun Lee; Anna C Squicciarini; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract Accountability is crucial for any computer system. It assures that every actionexecuted in the system can be traced back to some entity. Accountability for grid computingsystems is even more crucial given the very large number of users and active entities inthese systems. However; so far no comprehensive approach to accountability for gridsystems exists. Our work addresses such lack by developing a comprehensiveaccountability system driven by policies and supported by accountability agents. This paperfirst discusses the requirements that have driven the design of our accountability system. Itthen presents the key elements of our approach; namely the accountability data; theaccountability policy language; and the agents.,Proceedings of the 4th annual workshop on Cyber security and information intelligence research: developing strategies to meet the cyber security and information intelligence challenges ahead,2008,15
Receipt management-transaction history based trust establishment,Abhilasha Bhargav-Spantzel; Jungha Woo; Elisa Bertino,Abstract In a history-based trust-management system; users and service providers useinformation about past transactions to make trust-based decisions concerningcurrenttransactions. One category of such systems is represented by the reputation systems.However; despite the growing body of experience in building reputation systems; there areseveral limitations on how they are typically implemented. They often rely on scores that areevaluated by service providers and are often not reliable or well understood. We believe thatreputation hasto be based on objective and reliable information. In such context; transactionhistories play an important role. In this paper; we present the VeryIDX systemthatimplements an electronic receipt infrastructure and supports protocols to build and manageonline transaction history of users. The receipt protocols are shown to have several …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM workshop on Digital identity management,2007,15
Secure third party distribution of xml data,Barbara Carminati; Elena Ferrari; Elisa Bertino,Web-based third-party architectures for data publishing are today receiving growingattention; due to their scalability and the ability of efficiently managing large numbers ofusers and great amounts of data. In such architecture security is a primary challenge. Mainsecurity properties that should be considered are: confidentiality; integrity; and authenticity.Additionally to these traditional security requirements; we are interested in a further securityproperty; that is; completeness. By completeness we mean that the user receiving a portionof data can verify whether he/she has received all the information is allowed to seeaccording to the specified access control policies. In this paper; we propose acomprehensive framework for a secure third party distribution of XML data. In particular; theframework is able to enforce all the above-mentioned properties; by exploiting encryption …,Data Engineering; 2005. ICDE 2005. Proceedings. 21st International Conference on,2005,15
A controlled access to spatial data on web,Elisa Bertino; M Damiani,SUMMARY The proliferation of Geographical Information services on the Web is creatingunprecedented opportunities for the shared use of geographical information and at the sametime an increasing need of controlled access to spatial data. In the paper we present anapproach to the definition of an access control system for spatial data on the Web. The goalis to provide a mechanism for controlling what spatial data can be accessed by whom; fordoing what and where. For that purpose; we propose an access control model based on aspatially extended notion of authorization rule. An architectural framework for enclosing sucha model into a Geographical Information service has been developed and applied to a casestudy.,Conference on Geographic Information Science (AGILE),2004,15
Alternative correctness criteria for concurrent execution of transactions in multilevel secure databases,Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Sushil Jajodia; Elisa Bertino,Investigates issues related to transaction concurrency control in multilevel securedatabases. This paper demonstrates how the conflicts between the correctnessrequirements and the secrecy requirements can be reconciled by proposing two differentsolutions. It first explores the correctness criteria that are weaker than one-copyserializability. Each of these weaker criteria; though not as strict as one-copy serializability;is required to preserve database consistency in some meaningful way; and moreover; itsimplementation does not require the scheduler to be trusted. It proposes three different;increasingly stricter notions of serializability (level-wise serializability; one-item readserializability and pair-wise serializability) that can serve as substitutes for one-copyserializability. The paper then investigates secure concurrency control protocols that …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1996,15
A Bottom-Up Interpreter for a Database Language with Updates and Transactions.,Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania; Giovanna Guerrini; Maurizio Martelli; Danilo Montesi,Abstract Deductive databases with updates in rule bodies do not allow bottom-up executionmodel. This is due to the introduction of control in rule bodies. However; bottom-upexecution models are very important due to the set oriented queryanswering process ofdatabase systems. In 4] we have proposed a rule language to avoid the above drawbackand to provide transaction optimization through transaction transformation. In this paper wedescribe a prototype that provide a bottom-up meta interpreter for the database rulelanguage and will allow to check the validity of future extensions theoretical conjectureabout transaction optimization and integrity constraints. The experience in the use of KBMS1as a tool to develop a run time support for the rule language is reported together with anoverview of the system architecture.,GULP-PRODE (2),1994,15
An analytical model of object-oriented query costs,Elisa Bertino; Paola Foscoli,Abstract In this paper we present a model of costs for object-oriented queries. These costsare based on a set of parameters able to exactly model topologies of object references inobject-oriented databases. The model we present considers also the cases of multi-valuedattributes and null references. Moreover; the usage of reverse references among objects isconsidered. The query strategies considered are based on different methods for visiting thequery graph. We consider both forward and reverse traversal methods. Those visitingstrategies are then combined with two different approaches for retrieving instances from thevisited classes. Those approaches are the nested-loop technique and the merge-jointechnique. Therefore; four possible basic strategies are considered.,*,1993,15
DBSAFE—an anomaly detection system to protect databases from exfiltration attempts,Asmaa Sallam; Elisa Bertino; Syed Rafiul Hussain; David Landers; R Michael Lefler; Donald Steiner,Attempts by insiders to exfiltrate data have become a severe threat to the enterprise.Conventional data security techniques; such as access control and encryption; must beaugmented with techniques to detect anomalies in data access that may indicate exfiltrationattempts. In this paper; we present the design and evaluation of DBSAFE; a system to detect;alert on; and respond to anomalies in database access designed specifically for relationaldatabase management systems (DBMS). The system automatically builds and maintainsprofiles of normal user and application behavior; based on their interaction with themonitored database during a training phase. The system then uses these profiles to detectanomalous behavior that deviates from normality. Once an anomaly is detected; the systemuses predetermined policies guiding automated and/or human response to the anomaly …,IEEE Systems Journal,2017,14
DBMask: fine-grained access control on encrypted relational databases,Muhammad I Sarfraz; Mohamed Nabeel; Jianneng Cao; Elisa Bertino,Abstract For efficient data management and economic benefits; organizations areincreasingly moving towards the paradigm of" database as a service" by which their data aremanaged by a database management system (DBMS) hosted in a public cloud. However;data are the most valuable asset in an organization; and inappropriate data disclosure putsthe organization's business at risk. Therefore; data are usually encrypted in order topreserve their confidentiality. Past research has extensively investigated query processingon encrypted data. However; a naive encryption scheme negates the benefits provided bythe use of a DBMS. In particular; past research efforts have not adequately addressedflexible cryptographically enforced access control on encrypted data at different granularitylevels which is critical for data sharing among different users and applications.

Privacy-preserving complex query evaluation over semantically secure encrypted data,Bharath Kumar Samanthula; Wei Jiang; Elisa Bertino,Abstract In the last decade; several techniques have been proposed to evaluate differenttypes of queries (eg; range and aggregate queries) over encrypted data in a privacy-preserving manner. However; solutions supporting the privacy-preserving evaluation ofcomplex queries over encrypted data have been developed only recently. Such recenttechniques; however; are either insecure or not feasible for practical applications. In thispaper; we propose a novel privacy-preserving query processing framework that supportscomplex queries over encrypted data in the cloud computing environment and addressesthe shortcomings of previous approaches. At a high level; our framework utilizes bothhomomorphic encryption and garbled circuit techniques at different stages in queryprocessing to achieve the best performance; while at the same time protecting the …,European Symposium on Research in Computer Security,2014,14
Private searching on streaming data based on keyword frequency,Xun Yi; Elisa Bertino; Jaideep Vaidya; Chaoping Xing,Private searching on streaming data is a process to dispatch to a public server a program;which searches streaming sources of data without revealing searching criteria and thensends back a buffer containing the findings. From an Abelian group homomorphicencryption; the searching criteria can be constructed by only simple combinations ofkeywords; for example; disjunction of keywords. The recent breakthrough in fullyhomomorphic encryption has allowed us to construct arbitrary searching criteriatheoretically. In this paper; we consider a new private query; which searches for documentsfrom streaming data on the basis of keyword frequency; such that the frequency of a keywordis required to be higher or lower than a given threshold. This form of query can help us infinding more relevant documents. Based on the state of the art fully homomorphic …,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,2014,14

Privacy-preserving similarity measurement for access control policies,Eun Cho; Gabriel Ghinita; Elisa Bertino,Abstract The emergence of global-scale infrastructures for outsourcing data and content toservice providers (eg; cloud computing) creates unprecedented opportunities for dataowners to expand their operations and increase their customer base. On the other hand;each data owner (DO) has a certain set of access control policies; which may be differentthan those of the service providers (SP). Therefore; to enable effective outsourcing; it isimportant for the DOs to choose SPs with similar access control policies. Several techniquesthat measure policy similarity have been proposed in previous work; but they assume thatpolicies are publicly accessible. However; in a global-scale environment without well-established relationships of trust; participants may not be willing to reveal their policies toevery other stakeholder. Therefore; the need arises to perform policy similarity in a …,Proceedings of the 6th ACM workshop on Digital identity management,2010,14
A secure multiparty computation privacy preserving OLAP framework over distributed XML data,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Privacy Preserving Distributed OLAP is becoming a critical challenge for next-generation Business Intelligence (BI) scenarios; due to the" natural suitability" of OLAP inanalyzing distributed massive BI repositories in a multidimensional and multigranularitymanner. In particular; in these scenarios XML-formatted BI repositories play a dominant role;due to the wellknow amenities of XML in modeling and representing distributed businessdata. However; while Privacy Preserving Distributed Data Mining has been widelyinvestigated; very few efforts have focused on the problem of effectively and efficientlysupporting privacy preserving OLAP over distributed collections of XML documents. In orderto fulfill this gap; we propose a novel Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC)-based privacypreserving OLAP framework for distributed collections of XML documents. The framework …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM symposium on applied computing,2010,14
Minimal credential disclosure in trust negotiations,Federica Paci; David Bauer; Elisa Bertino; Douglas M Blough; Anna Squicciarini; Aditi Gupta,Abstract The secure release of identity attributes is a key enabler for electronic businessinteractions. Users should have the maximum control possible over the release of theiridentity attributes and should state under which conditions these attributes can be disclosed.Moreover; users should disclose only the identity attributes that are actually required for thetransactions at hand. In this paper we present an approach for the controlled release ofidentity attributes that addresses such requirements. The approach is based on theintegration of trust negotiation and minimal credential disclosure techniques. Trustnegotiation supports selective and incremental disclosure of identity attributes; whileminimal credential disclosure guarantees that only the attributes necessary to complete theon-line interactions are disclosed.,Identity in the Information Society,2009,14
High-assurance integrity techniques for databases,Elisa Bertino; Chenyun Dai; Hyo-Sang Lim; Dan Lin,Abstract With the increased need of data sharing among multiple organizations; such asgovernment organizations; financial corporations; medical hospitals and academicinstitutions; it is critical to ensure data integrity so that effective decisions can be made basedon these data. In this paper; we first present an architecture for a comprehensive integritycontrol system based on data validation and metadata management. We then discuss animportant issue in the data validation; that is; the evaluation of data provenance and proposea trust model for estimating the trustworthiness of data and data providers. By taking intoaccount confidence about data provenance; we introduce an approach for policy observingquery evaluation as a complement to the integrity control system.,British National Conference on Databases,2008,14
Workflow authorisation in mediator-free environments,Mohamed Shehab; Elisa Bertino; Arif Ghafoor,WorkFlow Management Systems (WFMS) coordinate and streamline business processes.Acquiring workflow authorisations and managing workflow authorisation constraints is achallenging problem. Current WFMSs assume a centralised global workflow authorisationmodel. In this paper; we propose a distributed workflow authorisation model with no centralauthorisation manager for a mediator-free environment. We provide an on-demand taskdiscovery protocol that enables domains to discover tasks available in other domains. Weformulate the workflow authorisation problem as a constraint satisfaction problem to selectaccess paths that satisfy all the workflow authorisation constraints. We propose the WorkflowMinimal Authorisation Problem (WMAP); which selects minimal authorisations required toexecute the workflowtasks. In addition; we investigate access path overlaps to allow tasks …,International Journal of Security and Networks,2006,14
Efficient integration of fine-grained access control in large-scale grid services,Pietro Mazzoleni; Bruno Crispo; Swaminathan Sivasubramanian; Elisa Bertino,In this paper; we present a scalable authorization service; based on the concept of fine-grained access control (FGAC); for large-scale grid infrastructures that span multipleindependent domains. FGAC enables participating resource owners to specify fine-grainedpolicies concerning which user can access can their resources under which mode. Weargue that such an authorization service must be integrated with the resource broker serviceto avoid scheduling requests onto resources which do not authorize the user request. Forthis reason; we develop a novel resource broker service that integrates access control withresource scheduling. In our system; both resource owners and users define their resourceaccess and usage policies. The resource broker schedules a user request only within the setof resources whose policies match the user credentials (and vice-versa).

Merkle tree authentication in uddi registries,Elisa Bertino; Barbara Carminati; Elena Ferrari,Abstract UDDI registries are today the standard way of publishing information on Webservices. They can be thought of as a structured repository of information that can be queriedby clients to find the Web services that better fit their needs. Even if; at the beginning; UDDIhas been mainly conceived as a public registry without specific facilities for security; todaysecurity issues are becoming more and more crucial; due to the fact that data published inUDDI registries may be highly strategic and sensitive. In this paper; we focus on authenticityissues by proposing a method based on Merkle Hash Trees; which does not require theparty managing the UDDI to be trusted with authenticity. In the paper; besides giving all thedetails of the proposed solution; we show its benefit with standard digital signaturetechniques.,International Journal of Web Services Research (IJWSR),2004,14
Towards a Language for Pattern Manipulation and Querying.,Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania; Anna Maddalena,Abstract. Patterns are concise; but rich in semantic; representation of data. The approachesproposed in the literature to cope with pattern management problems usually deal with asingle type of knowledge artifact and mainly concern pattern extraction issues. Littleemphasis has been posed in defining an overall environment to represent and efficientlymanage different types of patterns. The first general approach to deal with patterns has beenproposed in the context of the PANDA project [1]. In this paper; we discuss some basicrequirements for pattern manipulation and retrieval; represented according to the PANDAmodel. The proposed languages extend previous proposals and represent the basis for thedevelopment of an efficient pattern query processor.,PaRMa,2004,14
Handling expiration of multigranular temporal objects,Elena Camossi; Elisa Bertino; Marco Mesiti; Giovanna Guerrini,Abstract A well-known problem of temporal databases is that the amount of stored datatends to increase very fast. Moreover; detailed data are useful when they are acquired butthey often become less relevant after some time. In most cases; after a period of time onlysummarized data need to be kept; whereas detailed data expire and can be removed fromthe database. Multigranular temporal databases enhance the expressive power of temporaldatabases by supporting temporal attributes at different levels of detail. However; in existingapproaches the level of detail of an attribute; that is its granularity; depends only on theattribute semantics and does not depend on how recent the attribute values are. This paperproposes an approach supporting the aggregation of different portions of the value of atemporal attribute at different levels of detail; and the deletion or the transfer to tertiary …,Journal of Logic and Computation,2004,14
Max: An access control system for digital libraries and the web,Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Andrea Perego,Digital libraries (DLs) introduce several challenging requirements with respect to theformulation; specification and enforcement of adequate access control policies. Unlikeconventional database environments; a DL typically is characterised by a dynamic subjectpopulation; often making accesses from remote locations; and by an extraordinarily largeamount of information; stored in a variety of formats. Additionally; protecting a DL does notonly mean protecting documents that reside at the DL site; but also protecting accesses thatthe DL subscribers made to external Web documents. We present MaX; a comprehensivesystem for enforcing access control; specifically tailored to both DL and Web environments.Key features of MaX are the support for credential and content-based access control to DLand Web documents; and its full integration with standard Internet rating systems.,Computer Software and Applications Conference; 2002.

A discretionary access control model with temporal authorizations,Elisa Bertino; Claudio Bettini; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Conventional authorization models enforcing discretionary policies are based onauthorizations which specify; for each user or group of users in the system; the accesses heis allowed to execute on objects. We propose a new authorization model which allows toassociate with each authorization temporal constraints which restrict the validity of theauthorization. Moreover; in our model we allow the specification of temporal dependenciesamong authorizations. Temporal dependencies allow the derivation of new authorizationson the basis of the presence or of the absence of other authorizations in given time intervals.In the paper we present the main characteristics of our model and illustrate some researchissues we are currently investigating.,Proceedings of the 1994 workshop on New security paradigms,1994,14
Query optimization by using knowledge about data semantics,Elisa Bertino; Daniela Musto,Abstract In this paper we address the problem of using semantic properties of data within theprocess of query optimization. The discussion is in terms of the relational data model. Wepresent query transformation rules; called semantic transformation rules (or simply semanticrules); that are based on the database properties expressed by the integrity constraints. Thesemantic rules presented in the paper allow join elimination; clustering index introductionand empty query test according to the content of the integrity constraints. We provide aformal proof of the correction of such transformation rules. We also investigate the problemof using semantic rules within transactions; where any arbitrary sequence of queries andmodification operations may occur; and semantic integrity can be violated duringintermediate steps of processing. Conditions are provided under which the semantic rules …,Data & knowledge engineering,1992,14
An approach to support method invocations in object-oriented queries,Elisa Bertino; A Quarati,An indexing technique is presented supporting an efficient evaluation of query predicates onmethods. The technique is based on the precomputation of method results. Theprecomputed results are stored in an index that associates with a result v the list of objectidentifiers for which the method execution returns v. The evaluation of a predicate on theresults of a method simply requires an index search. The proposed organization keeps trackof changes that may influence the results of a method invocation. This mechanism is used toinvalidate the precomputed results of a method. The method is recomputed again upon nextinvocation.,Research Issues on Data Engineering; 1992: Transaction and Query Processing; Second International Workshop on,1992,14
Dictionary based secure provenance compression for wireless sensor networks,Changda Wang; Syed Rafiul Hussain; Elisa Bertino,Due to energy and bandwidth limitations of wireless sensor networks (WSNs); it is crucialthat data provenance for these networks be as compact as possible. Even if lossycompression techniques are used for encoding provenance information; the size of theprovenance increases with the number of nodes traversed by the network packets. Toaddress such issues; we propose a dictionary based provenance scheme. In our approach;each sensor node in the network stores a packet path dictionary. With the support of thisdictionary; a path index instead of the path itself is enclosed with each packet. Since thepacket path index is a code word of a dictionary; its size is independent of the number ofnodes present in the packet's path. Furthermore; as our scheme binds the packet and itsprovenance through an AM-FM sketch and uses a secure packet sequence number …,IEEE transactions on parallel and distributed systems,2016,13
On the properties of non-media digital watermarking: a review of state of the art techniques,Arezou Soltani Panah; Ron Van Schyndel; Timos Sellis; Elisa Bertino,Over the last 25 years; there has been much work on multimedia digital watermarking. In thisdomain; the primary limitation to watermark strength has been in its visibility. For multimediawatermarks; invisibility is defined in human terms (that is; in terms of human sensorylimitations). In this paper; we review recent developments in the non-media applications ofdata watermarking; which have emerged over the last decade as an exciting new sub-domain. Since by definition; the intended receiver should be able to detect the watermark;we have to redefine invisibility in an acceptable way that is often application-specific andthus cannot be easily generalized. In particular; this is true when the data is not intended tobe directly consumed by humans. For example; a loose definition of robustness might be interms of the resilience of a watermark against normal host data operations; and of …,IEEE Access,2016,13

Representation and querying of unfair evaluations in social rating systems,Mohammad Allahbakhsh; Aleksandar Ignjatovic; Boualem Benatallah; Norman Foo; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Social rating systems are subject to unfair evaluations. Users may try to individuallyor collaboratively promote or demote a product. Detecting unfair evaluations; mainlymassive collusive attacks as well as honest looking intelligent attacks; is still a realchallenge for collusion detection systems. In this paper; we study the impact of unfairevaluations in online rating systems. First; we study the individual unfair evaluations andtheir impact on the reputation of people calculated by social rating systems. We thenpropose a method for detecting collaborative unfair evaluations; also known as collusion.The proposed model uses frequent itemset mining technique to detect the candidatecollusion groups and sub-groups. We use several indicators to identify collusion groups andto estimate how destructive such colluding groups can be. The approaches presented in …,Computers & Security,2014,13

ACConv--An Access Control Model for Conversational Web Services,Federica Paci; Massimo Mecella; Mourad Ouzzani; Elisa Bertino,Abstract With organizations increasingly depending on Web services to build complexapplications; security and privacy concerns including the protection of access controlpolicies are becoming a serious issue. Ideally; service providers would like to make sure thatclients have knowledge of only portions of the access control policy relevant to theirinteractions to the extent to which they are entrusted by the Web service and withoutrestricting the client's choices in terms of which operations to execute. We propose ACConv;a novel model for access control in Web services that is suitable when interactions betweenthe client and the Web service are conversational and long-running.

In this paper we present a layeredarchitecture for addressing the end-to-end accountability problem. We introduce the conceptof {\em accountability agents}; entities in charge of collecting accountability data; keepingtrack of submitted jobs and their users. We present a simple yet effective language to specifythe relevant accountability data to be collected and selectively distributed by theaccountability agents. Additionally; we design a decentralized and scalable approach toaccountability; so to be able to monitor jobs workflow with relatively little intrusion.,Asia-Pacific Services Computing Conference; 2008.

Authorization and User Failure Resiliency for WS-BPEL business processes,Federica Paci; Rodolfo Ferrini; Yuqing Sun; Elisa Bertino,Abstract We investigate the problem of WS-BPEL processes resiliency in RBAC-WS-BPEL;an authorization model for WS-BPEL that supports the specification of authorizations for theexecution of WS-BPEL process activities by roles and users and authorization constraints;such as separation and binding of duty. The goal of resiliency is to guarantee that even ifsome users becomes unavailable during the execution of a WS-BPEL process; theremaining users can still complete the execution of the process. We extend RBAC-WS-BPELwith a new type of constraints called resiliency constraints and the notion of user failureresiliency for WS-BPEL processes and propose an algorithm to determine if a WS-BPELprocess is user failure resilient.,International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing,2008,13

Since Akl and Taylor proposed the first HAC scheme based onnumber theory in 1983; cryptographic key management techniques for HAC have appearedas a new and promising class of solutions to the HAC problem. Many cryptographic HACschemes have been proposed in the past two decades. One common feature associatedwith these schemes is that they basically limited dynamic operations at the node level. In thispaper; by introducing the innovative concept of 'access polynomial'and representing a keyvalue as the sum of two polynomials in a finite field; we propose a new key managementscheme for dynamic access hierarchy. The newly proposed scheme supports full dynamicsat both the node level and user level in a uniform yet efficient manner. Furthermore; the …,International Journal of Network Management,2007,13
Xjoin index: Indexing xml data for efficient handling of branching path expressions,Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania; Wen Qiang Wang,We consider the problem of indexing XML data for solving branching path expressions withthe aim of reducing the number of joins to be executed and we propose a simple yet efficientjoin indexing approach to shrink the twig before applying any structural join algorithm. Theindexing technique we propose; that we call XJoin Index; precomputes some structural(semi-) join results thus reducing the number of joins to be computed. Precomputed (semi-)joins support the following operations:(i) attribute selections; possibly involving severalattributes;(ii) detection of parent-child relationships;(ii) counting selections; like Find allbooks with at least 3 authors. Unlike other approaches; based on specialized data structuresXJoin Index is entirely based on B/sup+/-trees and can be coupled with any structural joinalgorithm proposed so far.,Data Engineering; 2004.

Local Closed-World Assumptions for reasoning about Semantic Web data.,Elisa Bertino; Alessandro Provetti; Franco Salvetti,Abstract The Semantic Web (SW) can be seen as abstract representation and exchange ofdata and metadata. Metadata is given in terms of data mark-up and reference to shared;Web-accessible ontologies. Several interesting languages are now available for theSemantic Web. They exploit XML allowing data/metadata communication; yet are endowedwith a logical semantics. Such languages allow compact descriptions by means ofinheritance mechanisms that permit one to describe an object as belonging to one or moreclasses whose hierarchy is already described on the Web. With few exceptions; SW logicallanguages are designed to be monotonic; thus they cannot employ the closed-worldassumption i) to make object description compact and most importantly ii) to prevent largeontologies from admitting inconsistency resulting from multiple inheritance. We address …,APPIA-GULP-PRODE,2003,13
Matching an XML Document against a Set of DTDs,Elisa Bertino; Giovanna Guerrini; Marco Mesiti,Abstract Sources of XML documents are proliferating on the Web and documents are moreand more frequently exchanged among sources. At the same time; there is an increasingneed of exploiting database tools to manage this kind of data. An important novelty of XML isthat information on document structures is available on the Web together with the documentcontents. However; in such an heterogeneous environment as the Web; it is not reasonableto assume that XML documents that enter a source always conform to a predefined DTD inthe source. In this paper we address the problem of document classification by proposing ametric for quantifying the structural similarity between an XML document and a DTD. Basedon such notion; we propose an approach to match a document entering a source against theset of DTDs available in the source; determining whether a DTD exists similar enough to …,International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems,2002,13

Integrated document and knowledge management for the knowledge-based enterprise,J McNaught; W Black; F Rinaldi; E Bertino; A Brasher; D Deavin; B Catania; D Silvestri; B Armani; A Persidis; G Semerano; F Esposito; V Candela; GP Zarri; L Gilardoni,Abstract The CONCERTO project is concerned with the creation and management ofknowledge repositories. The distinctive approach is to maintain an association between thetextual form in which knowledge is expressed in source documents; and an expressivenarrative knowledge representation language that supports inference and query operations.We first situate the CONCERTO approach in relation to current principles of knowledgemanagement; before exploring three aspects of the mechanisms that CONCERTO supports:document management; acquisition of knowledge from text; and annotation basemanagement. The concluding section gives an insight into how these mechanisms arebeing translated into changing working practices in a knowledge-based organisation withinthe CONCERTO consortium.,Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on the practical application of Knowledge Management,2000,13
Navigational accesses in a temporal object model,Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Giovanna Guerrini,A considerable research effort has been devoted in past years to query languages fortemporal data in the context of both the relational and the object oriented model. Objectoriented databases provide a navigational approach for data access based on objectreferences. We investigate the navigational approach to querying object oriented databases.We formally define the notion of temporal path expression; and we address on a formalbasis issues related to the correctness of such expressions. In particular; we focus on staticanalysis and give a set of conditions ensuring that an expression always results in a correctaccess at runtime.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1998,13

A key question is howthe notions of expertise and reputation will evolve as a consequence of the emergence andbroad use of social media. Addressing such questions is crucial for many different domains;from traditional academic settings and processes (eg; promotion procedures); to researchfunding (eg; assessing the impact of research results); homeland security and intelligence(eg; detecting campaigns aiming at spreading deceiving information); and healthcare(determining the source and credibility of health information on the Net).,*,2015,12
Secure data provenance compression using arithmetic coding in wireless sensor networks,Syed Rafiul Hussain; Changda Wang; Salmin Sultana; Elisa Bertino,Since data are originated and processed by multiple agents in wireless sensor networks;data provenance plays an important role for assuring data trustworthiness. However; thesize of the provenance tends to increase at a higher rate as it is transmitted from the sourceto the base station and is processed by many intermediate nodes. Due to bandwidth andenergy limitations of wireless sensor networks; such increasing of provenance size slowsdown the network and depletes the energy of sensor nodes. Therefore; compression of dataprovenance is an essential requirement. Existing lossy compression schemes based onBloom filters or probabilistic packet marking approaches have high error rates inprovenance-recovery. In this paper; we address this problem and propose a distributed andlossless arithmetic coding based compression technique which achieves a compression …,Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC); 2014 IEEE International,2014,12
Information-oriented trustworthiness evaluation in vehicular ad-hoc networks,Sashi Gurung; Dan Lin; Anna Squicciarini; Elisa Bertino,Abstract In Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs); applications are typically realized byforwarding and exchanging messages among vehicles. The integrity and trustworthiness ofmessages directly impacts the quality of the applications. Though there have been extensiveworks on authentication protocols in VANETs; authentication can only certify message originbut cannot guarantee that the identity holders will send truthful and accurate messages.Therefore; in this paper; we propose a novel trust model to directly evaluate thetrustworthiness of the content of a message received from other vehicles. The model is builtbased on various factors such as content similarity; content conflict and route similarity.Trustworthiness of message content will be evaluated at the individual vehicle level and willnot introduce any additional architectural assumptions. We have conducted extensive …,International Conference on Network and System Security,2013,12
Efficient tree pattern queries on encrypted xml documents,Jianneng Cao; Fang-Yu Rao; Mehmet Kuzu; Elisa Bertino; Murat Kantarcioglu,Abstract Outsourcing XML documents is a challenging task; because it encrypts thedocuments; while still requiring efficient query processing. Past approaches on this topiceither leak structural information or fail to support searching that has constraints on XMLnode content. In addition; they adopt a filtering-and-refining framework; which requires theusers to prune false positives from the query results. To address these problems; we presenta solution for efficient evaluation of tree pattern queries (TPQs) on encrypted XMLdocuments. We create a domain hierarchy; such that each XML document can beembedded in it. By assigning each node in the hierarchy a position; we create for eachdocument a vector; which encodes both the structural and textual information about thedocument. Similarly; a vector is created also for a TPQ. Then; the matching between a …,Proceedings of the Joint EDBT/ICDT 2013 workshops,2013,12
A file provenance system,Salmin Sultana; Elisa Bertino,Abstract A file provenance system supports the automatic collection and management ofprovenance ie the complete processing history of a data object. File system levelprovenance provides functionality unavailable in the existing provenance systems. In thispaper; we discuss the design objectives for a flexible and efficient file provenance systemand then propose the design of such a system; called FiPS. We design FiPS as a thinstackable file system for capturing provenance in a portable manner. FiPS can captureprovenance at various degrees of granularity; can transform provenance records into secureinformation; and can direct the resulting provenance data to various persistent storagesystems.,Proceedings of the third ACM conference on Data and application security and privacy,2013,12
PUF ROKs: A hardware approach to read-once keys,Michael S Kirkpatrick; Sam Kerr; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Cryptographers have proposed the notion of read-once keys (ROKs) as a beneficialtool for a number of applications; such as delegation of authority. The premise of ROKs isthat the key is destroyed by the process of reading it; thus preventing subsequent accesses.While the idea and the applications are well-understood; the consensus amongcryptographers is that ROKs cannot be produced by algorithmic processes alone. Rather; atrusted hardware mechanism is needed to support the destruction of the key. In this work; wepropose one such approach for using a hardware design to generate ROKs. Our approachis an application of physically unclonable functions (PUFs). PUFs use the intrinsicdifferences in hardware behavior to produce a random function that is unique to thathardware instance. Our design consists of incorporating the PUF in a feedback loop to …,Proceedings of the 6th ACM Symposium on Information; Computer and Communications Security,2011,12
Multifactor identity verification using aggregated proof of knowledge,Abhilasha Bhargav-Spantzel; Anna Cinzia Squicciarini; Rui Xue; Elisa Bertino,The problem of identity theft; that is; the act of impersonating others' identities by presentingstolen identifiers or proofs of identities; has been receiving increasing attention because ofits high financial and social costs. In this paper; we address the problem of verification ofsuch identifiers and proofs of identity. Our approach is based on the concept of privacypreserving multifactor verification of such identifiers and proofs achieved by thedevelopment of a new cryptographic primitive; which uses aggregate signatures oncommitments that are then used for aggregate zero-knowledge proof of knowledge (ZKPK)protocols. The resultant signatures are very short and the ZKPs are succinct and efficient.We prove the security of our scheme under the co-gap Diffie-Hellman (co-GDH) assumptionfor groups with bilinear maps.

Controlling data disclosure in computational PIR protocols,Ning Shang; Gabriel Ghinita; Yongbin Zhou; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocols allow users to learn data items storedat a server which is not fully trusted; without disclosing to the server the particular dataelement retrieved. Several PIR protocols have been proposed; which provide strongguarantees on user privacy. Nevertheless; in many application scenarios it is important toprotect the database as well. In this paper; we investigate the amount of data disclosed bythe the most prominent PIR protocols during a single run. We show that a malicious user canstage attacks that allow an excessive amount of data to be retrieved from the server.Furthermore; this vulnerability can be exploited even if the client follows the legitimate stepsof the PIR protocol; hence the malicious request can not be detected and rejected by theserver. We devise mechanisms that limit the PIR disclosure to a single data item.,Proceedings of the 5th ACM Symposium on Information; Computer and Communications Security,2010,12
TIAMAT: a tool for interactive analysis of microdata anonymization techniques,Chenyun Dai; Gabriel Ghinita; Elisa Bertino; Ji-Won Byun; Ninghui Li,Abstract Releasing detailed data (microdata) about individuals poses a privacy threat; due tothe presence of quasi-identifier (QID) attributes such as age or zip code. Several privacyparadigms have been proposed that preserve privacy by placing constraints on the value ofreleased QIDs. However; in order to enforce these paradigms; data publishers need tools toassist them in selecting a suitable anonymization method and choosing the right systemparameters. We developed TIAMAT; a tool for analysis of anonymization techniques whichallows data publishers to assess the accuracy and overhead of existing anonymizationtechniques. The tool performs interactive; head-to-head comparison of anonymizationtechniques; as well as QID change-impact analysis. Other features include collection ofattribute statistics; support for multiple information loss metrics and compatibility with …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,12
Tiupam: A framework for trustworthiness-centric information sharing,Shouhuai Xu; Ravi Sandhu; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Information is essential to decision making. Nowadays; decision makers are oftenoverwhelmed with large volumes of information; some of which may be inaccurate; incorrect;inappropriate; misleading; or maliciously introduced. With the advocated shift of informationsharing paradigm from “need to know” to “need to share” this problem will be furthercompounded. This poses the challenge of achieving assured information sharing so thatdecision makers can always get and utilize the up-to-date information for making the rightdecisions; despite the existence of malicious attacks and without breaching privacy ofhonest participants. As a first step towards answering this challenge this paper proposes asystematic framework we call TIUPAM; which stands for “Trustworthiness-centric Identity;Usage; Provenance; and Attack Management.” The framework is centered at the need of …,IFIP International Conference on Trust Management,2009,12

Multigranular spatio-temporal models: implementation challenges,Elena Camossi; Michela Bertolotto; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Multiple granularities provide an essential support for extracting significantknowledge from spatio-temporal datasets at different levels of details. They enable to zoom-in and zoom-out spatio-temporal datasets; thus enhancing the data modelling exibility andimproving the analysis of information. In this paper we investigate the implementation issuesarising when a data model and a query language are enriched with spatio-temporalmultigranularity. We introduce appropriate representations for space and time dimensions;granularities; granules; and multi-granular values. Finally; we discuss how multigranularspatio-temporal conversions affect data usability and how such important property may beguaranteed.,Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGSPATIAL international conference on Advances in geographic information systems,2008,12
Spatial domains for the administration of location-based access control policies,Maria Luisa Damiani; Elisa Bertino; Claudio Silvestri,Abstract In the last few years there has been an increasing interest for a novel category ofaccess control models known as location-based or spatially-aware role-based accesscontrol (RBAC) models. Those models advance classical RBAC models in that they regulatethe access to sensitive resources based on the position of mobile users. An issue that hasnot yet been investigated is how to administer spatially-aware access control policies. In thispaper we introduce GEO-RBAC Admin; the administration model for the location-based GEO-RBAC model. We discuss the concepts underlying such administrative model and present alanguage for the specification of GEO-RBAC policies.,Journal of Network and Systems Management,2008,12

Traceable and automatic compliance of privacy policies in federated digital identity management,Anna Squicciarini; Abhilasha Bhargav-Spantzel; Alexei Czeskis; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Digital identity is defined as the digital representation of the information knownabout a specific individual or organization. An emerging approach for protecting identities ofindividuals while at the same time enhancing user convenience is to focus on inter-organization management of identity information. This is referred to as federated identitymanagement. In this paper we develop an approach to support privacy controlled sharing ofidentity attributes and harmonization of privacy policies in federated environments. Policyharmonizations mechanisms make it possible to determine whether or not the transfer ofidentity attributes from one entity to another violate the privacy policies stated by the former.We also provide mechanisms for tracing the release of user's identity attributes within thefederation. Such approach entails a form of accountability since an entity non-compliant …,International Workshop on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,2006,12

Issues on modeling spatial granularities,Elena Camossi; Michela Bertolotto; Elisa Bertino; Giovanna Guerrini,Abstract The formalization of the spatial granularity concept is a topic that has recentlyreceived a growing interest; but none of the proposals presented so far has beenacknowledged by the spatial community as a reference definition. This is becausedeveloping such a formalization entails addressing a large number of issues; due to theintrinsic characteristics of spatial information. In this paper we discuss some of these issues;and we propose a formal definition of spatial granularity that addresses most of them. Ourdefinition supports the representation of spatial entities at multiple granularities by applyingmodel oriented map generalization principles. In particular; we consider a set ofgeneralization operators that guarantee topological consistency and their inverse functions;for performing; respectively; the conversions to coarser and to finer granularities.,COSIT,2003,12

We believe that PDL may be of interest as a specification language forintelligent systems. This article proposes an extension of PDL that allows user-definedpreferences on how to apply monitors.

Bertino et al.) is a policy engine developed for message dispatching in aUniversal Communication System. A user of the system has a unique identifier; namedUniversal Communication Identifier (UCI); independent from the actual communicationdevices the user owns. It is a task of the UCS-Router to properly route messages or phonecalls arriving at the UCI to the proper user devices. The routing process is performedaccording to policies the user specifies on the type of message; on the device capabilitiesand states; on the sender characteristics; and on the message sending time. We present adeclarative policy language developed for UCS-Router. Users of UCS-Router can use thislanguage for specifying message filtering and routing policies.

Towards optimal indexing for segment databases,Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania; Boris Shidlovsky,Abstract Segment databases store N non-crossing but possibly touching segments insecondary storage. Efficient data structures have been proposed to determine all segmentsintersecting a vertical line (stabbing queries). In this paper; we consider a more general typeof query for segment databases; determining intersections with respect to a generalizedsegment (a line; a ray; a segment) with a fixed angular coefficient. We propose two solutionsto solve this problem. The first solution has optimal O (N/B) space complexity; where N is thedatabase size and B is the page size; but the query time is far from optimal. The secondsolution requires O (N/B log 2 B) space; the query time is O (log BN/B (log BN/B+ log 2 B+IL*(B))+ T/B); which is very close to the optimal; and insertion amortized time is O (log BN/B+log 2 B+ 1/B log 2 BN/B); where T is the size of the query result; and IL*(B) is a small …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,1998,12

Correctness of semantic integrity checking in database management systems,Elisa Bertino; Daniela Musto,Summary Although today's applications are very demanding with regard to semanticintegrity; few database systems provide capabilities of this type. In this paper; a definition ofintegrity constraint is given in terms of Relational Algebra and certain aspects are thendiscussed concerning transaction management in the presence of such integrity constraints.In particular; the problem of when to enforce a set of integrity constraints during theexecution of a transaction is addressed. For this purpose the notion of Integrity EnforcementSchedule is introduced. An Integrity Enforcement Schedule represents the sequence ofintegrity checking actions performed during the execution of a transaction. A correctnesscriterion for the Integrity Enforcement Schedules is established; and a sufficient condition forthe correctness is provided.

Data security and privacy: concepts; approaches; and research directions,Elisa Bertino,Data are today an asset more critical than ever for all organizations we may think of. Recentadvances and trends; such as sensor systems; IoT; cloud computing; and data analytics; aremaking possible to pervasively; efficiently; and effectively collect data. However for data tobe used to their full power; data security and privacy are critical. Even though data securityand privacy have been widely investigated over the past thirty years; today we face newdifficult data security and privacy challenges. Some of those challenges arise fromincreasing privacy concerns with respect to the use of data and from the need of reconcilingprivacy with the use of data for security in applications such as homeland protection;counterterrorism; and health; food and water security.

DisARM: mitigating buffer overflow attacks on embedded devices,Javid Habibi; Ajay Panicker; Aditi Gupta; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Security of embedded devices today is a critical requirement for the Internet ofThings (IoT) as these devices will access sensitive information such as social securitynumbers and health records. This makes these devices a lucrative target for attacksexploiting vulnerabilities to inject malicious code or reuse existing code to alter theexecution of their software. Existing defense techniques have major drawbacks such asrequiring source code or symbolic debugging information; and high overhead; limiting theirapplicability. In this paper we propose a novel defense technique; DisARM; that protectsagainst both code-injection and code-reuse based buffer overflow attacks by breaking theability for attackers to manipulate the return address of a function. Our approach operates onarbitrary executable binaries and thus does not require compiler support. In addition it …,International Conference on Network and System Security,2015,11

Marlin: Mitigating code reuse attacks using code randomization,Aditi Gupta; Javid Habibi; Michael S Kirkpatrick; Elisa Bertino,Code-reuse attacks; such as return-oriented programming (ROP); are a class of bufferoverflow attacks that repurpose existing executable code towards malicious purposes.These attacks bypass defenses against code injection attacks by chaining togethersequence of instructions; commonly known as gadgets; to execute the desired attack logic. Acommon feature of these attacks is the reliance on the knowledge of memory layout of theexecutable code. We propose a fine grained randomization based approach that breaksthese assumptions by modifying the layout of the executable code and hinders code-reuseattack. Our solution; Marlin; randomizes the internal structure of the executable code byrandomly shuffling the function blocks in the target binary.

POSTER: A pairing-free certificateless hybrid sign-cryption scheme for advanced metering infrastructures,Seung Hyun Seo; Jongho Won; Elisa Bertino,Abstract CertificateLess Hybrid SignCryption (CL-HSC) scheme is useful for efficientlyencapsulating symmetric keys for secure communications. It solves the key escrow problemand the certificate management problem. However; the existing scheme is not suitable forAdvanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) networks because of the utilization of expensivepairing operations. As smart meter devices have limited computing power; we need efficientalgorithms for AMI networks. In this poster; we propose a novel CL-HSC scheme withoutpairing operations. In order to evaluate its performance; we implemented our CL-HSCscheme and conventional hybrid encryption approaches. The experimental results show thatour CL-HSC scheme is efficient and suitable for secure communications in AMI networks.,Proceedings of the 4th ACM conference on data and application security and privacy,2014,11
PostgreSQL anomalous query detector,Bilal Shebaro; Asmaa Sallam; Ashish Kamra; Elisa Bertino,Abstract We propose to demonstrate the design; implementation; and the capabilities of ananomaly detection (AD) system integrated with a relational database management system(DBMS). Our AD system is trained by extracting relevant features from the parse-treerepresentation of the SQL commands; and then uses the DBMS roles as the classes for thebayesian classifier. In the detection phase; the maximum apriori probability role is chosen bythe classifier which; if not matching the role associated with the SQL command; raises analarm.

A general framework for web content filtering,Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Andrea Perego,Abstract Web content filtering is a means to make end-users aware of the 'quality'of Webresources by evaluating their contents and/or characteristics against users' preferences.Although they can be used for a variety of purposes; Web content filtering tools are mainlydeployed as a service for parental control purposes; and for regulating the access to Webcontent by users connected to the networks of enterprises; libraries; schools; etc. CurrentWeb filtering tools are based on well established techniques; such as data mining andfirewall blocking; and they typically cater to the filtering requirements of very specific end-user categories. Therefore; what is lacking is a unified filtering framework able to support allthe possible application domains; and making it possible to enforce interoperability amongthe different filtering approaches and the systems based on them. In this paper; a multi …,World Wide Web,2010,11
Trustworthy information: concepts and mechanisms,Shouhuai Xu; Haifeng Qian; Fengying Wang; Zhenxin Zhan; Elisa Bertino; Ravi Sandhu,Abstract We used to treating information received (from recognized sources) as trustworthy;which is unfortunately not true because of attacks. The situation can get worse with theemerging shift of information sharing paradigm from “need to know” to “need to share.” Inorder to help information consumers make the “best” decision possible; it is imperative toformulate concepts; models; frameworks; architectures; and mechanisms to facilitateinformation trustworthiness management in distributed and decentralized environment. Inthis paper we initiate a study in this direction by proposing an abstraction called informationnetworks as well as two supporting mechanisms called provenance digital signatures andoptimal security hardening of information network.,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2010,11
Biometrics-based identifiers for digital identity management,Abhilasha Bhargav-Spantzel; Anna Squicciarini; Elisa Bertino; Xiangwei Kong; Weike Zhang,Abstract We present algorithms to reliably generate biometric identifiers from a user'sbiometric image which in turn is used for identity verification possibly in conjunction withcryptographic keys. The biometric identifier generation algorithms employ image hashingfunctions using singular value decomposition and support vector classification techniques.Our algorithms capture generic biometric features that ensure unique and repeatablebiometric identifiers. We provide an empirical evaluation of our techniques using 2569images of 488 different individuals for three types of biometric images; namely fingerprint;iris and face. Based on the biometric type and the classification models; as a result of theempirical evaluation we can generate biometric identifiers ranging from 64 bits up to 214bits. We provide an example use of the biometric identifiers in privacy preserving multi …,Proceedings of the 9th Symposium on Identity and Trust on the Internet,2010,11
Assessing the trustworthiness of streaming data,Hyo-Sang Lim; Yang-Sae Moon; Elisa Bertino,Abstract The notion of confidence policy is a novel notion that exploits trustworthiness ofdata items in data management and query processing. In this paper we address the problemof enforcing confidence policies in data stream management systems (DSMSs); which iscrucial in supporting users with different access rights; processing confidence-awarecontinuous queries; and protecting the secure streaming data. For the paper; we firstpropose a DSMS-based framework of confidence policy management and then present asystematic approach for estimating the trustworthiness of data items. Our approach uses thedata item provenance as well as their values. We introduce two types of data provenance:the physical provenance which represents the delivering history of each data item; and thelogical provenance which describes the semantic meaning of each data item.

Systematic clustering method for l-diversity model,Md Enamul Kabir; Hua Wang; Elisa Bertino; Yunxiang Chi,Abstract Nowadays privacy becomes a major concern and many research efforts have beendedicated to the development of privacy protecting technology. Anonymization techniquesprovide an efficient approach to protect data privacy. We recently proposed a systematicclustering method based on k-anonymization technique that minimizes the information lossand at the same time assures data quality. In this paper; we extended our previous work onthe systematic clustering method to l-diversity model that assumes that every group ofindistinguishable records contains at least l distinct sensitive attributes values. The proposedtechnique adopts to group similar data together with l-diverse sensitive values and thenanonymizes each group individually. The structure of systematic clustering problem for l-diversity model is defined; investigated through paradigm and is implemented in two …,Proceedings of the Twenty-First Australasian Conference on Database Technologies-Volume 104,2010,11
Query mesh: Multi-route query processing technology,Rimma V Nehme; Karen E Works; Elke A Rundensteiner; Elisa Bertino,Abstract We propose to demonstrate a practical alternative approach to the current state-of-the-art query processing techniques; called the" Query Mesh"(or QM; for short). The mainidea of QM is to compute multiple routes (ie; query plans); each designed for a particularsubset of data with distinct statistical properties. Based on the execution routes and the datacharacteristics; a classifier model is induced and is used to partition new data tuples toassign the best routes for their processing. We propose to demonstrate the QM framework inthe streaming context using our demo application; called the" Ubi-City". We will illustrate theinnovative features of QM; including: the QM optimization with the integrated machinelearning component; the QM execution using the efficient" Self-Routing Fabric"infrastructure; and finally; the QM adaptive component that performs the online adaptation …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,11
Managing risks in RBAC employed distributed environments,Ebru Celikel; Murat Kantarcioglu; Bhavani Thuraisingham; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Role Based Access Control (RBAC) has been introduced in an effort to facilitateauthorization in database systems. It introduces roles as a new layer in between users andpermissions. This not only provides a well maintained access granting mechanism; but alsoalleviates the burden to manage multiple users. While providing comprehensive accesscontrol; current RBAC models and systems do not take into consideration the possible risksthat can be incurred with role misuse. In distributed environments a large number of usersare a very common case; and a considerable number of them are first time users. This factmagnifies the need to measure risk before and after granting an access. We investigate themeans of managing risks in RBAC employed distributed environments and introduce aprobability based novel risk model. Based on each role; we use information about user …,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2007,11
Privacy requirements in identity management solutions,Abhilasha Bhargav-Spantzel; Anna C Squicciarini; Matthew Young; Elisa Bertino,Abstract In this paper we highlight the need for privacy of user data used in digital identitymanagement systems. We investigate the issues from the individual; business; andgovernment perspectives. We provide surveys related to the growing problem of identity theftand the sociological concerns of individuals with respect to the privacy of their identity data.We show the privacy concerns; especially with respect to health and biometric data; wherethe loss of privacy of that data may have serious consequences. Moreover; we also discusshow privacy concerns change according to the individual's disposition to provide the data.Voluntary disclosure of personal information is more acceptable to users than if informationdisclosure is involuntary; like in the case of surveillance.

Using spatial data access structures for filtering nearest neighbor queries,Alberto Belussi; Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania,Abstract The detection of the nearest neighbor object to a given point in the reference space(NN query) is a common problem in geographical information systems (GISs). Datastructures supporting range queries are not always adequate to support NN queries. For thisreason; additional data structures; mainly relying on the use of some kind of tree; have beenproposed. The main drawback of such solutions is that at least one tree path has to beanalyzed in order to determine the NN object. In this paper; we overcome this problem byconsidering information on the reference space to improve the search. In particular; wepropose a data structure that is obtained by integrating the R+-tree with a regular grid;indexed by using a hashing technique. The resulting data structure combines theadvantages of a rectangular decomposition of the space; typical of R+-trees; with a direct …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2002,11
ASEP: A secure and flexible commit protocol for MLS distributed database systems,Indrajit Ray; Luigi V Mancini; Sushil Jajodia; Elisa Bertino,The classical Early Prepare (EP) commit protocol; used in many commercial systems; is notsuitable for use in multi-level secure (MLS) distributed database systems that employ alocking protocol for concurrency control. This is because EP requires that read locks are notreleased by a participant during their window of uncertainty; however; it is not possible for alocking protocol to provide this guarantee in a MLS system (since the read lock of a higher-level transaction on a lower-level data object must be released whenever a lower-leveltransaction wants to write the same data). The only available work in the literature; namelythe Secure Early Prepare (SEP) protocol; overcomes this difficulty by aborting thosedistributed transactions that release their low-level read locks prematurely. We see thisapproach as being too restrictive. One of the major benefits of distributed processing is its …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2000,11
Decentralized administration for a temporal access control model,Elisa Bertino; Claudio Bettini; Elena Ferrari; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract In this paper we present a temporal access control model that provides fordecentralized administration of authorizations. Each access authorization; negative orpositive; is associated with a time interval limiting its validity. When the interval expires; theauthorization is automatically revoked. The model also permits the specification of rules;based on four different temporal operators; to derive additional authorizations from thepresence or absence of other authorizations. Users creating objects can retain completecontrol over their objects or delegate other users the privilege of administering accesses onthe objects. Delegation can also be selectively enforced with reference to specific accessmodes or time intervals. The resulting model provides a high degree of flexibility and allowsto express several protection requirements which cannot be expressed in traditional …,Information Systems,1997,11
Static analysis of intensional databases in U-Datalog,Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania,Abstract Static analysis of declarative languages deals with the detection; at compile time; ofprogram properties that can be used to better understand the program semantics and toimprove the efficiency of the program evaluation. In logical update languages; an interestingproblem is the detection of situations that may lead to inconsistent updates(insertion anddeletion of the same fact); generating non-deterministic behavior. The analysis of thisproblem for transactions based on set-oriented updates is not a simple task. In this paper;we investigate this topic in the context of the U-Datalog language; a set-oriented updatelanguage for deductive databases[BMM92]. We first formally define relevant properties of U-Datalog programs; mainly related to conflicts leading to non-deterministic results. Then} weprove that the presented prop erties are decidable.

A non-timestamped authorization model for data management systems,Elisa Bertino; Sushil Jajodia; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract There are two approaches to representing authorizations in data managementsystems. The first approach associates a timestamp with each authorization; semantics ofgrant and revoke operations on authorizations are based on the temporal relationshipsdetermined by these timestamps. The second approach differs from the first in that it doesnot assign timestamps to authorizations. Although the semantics of the grant and revokeoperation are different as a result; several systems have adopted this approach since it notonly simplifies management of authorizations; but appears to be more desirable from theuser's point of view as well. In this paper; we define a formal model for non-timestampedauthorizations that supports both positive and negative authorizations. We give thesemantics of the grant and revoke operations in terms of their effect on existing …,Proceedings of the 3rd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security,1996,11
ID2S password-authenticated key exchange protocols,Xun Yi; Fang-Yu Rao; Zahir Tari; Feng Hao; Elisa Bertino; Ibrahim Khalil; Albert Y Zomaya,In a two-server password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocol; a client splits itspassword and stores two shares of its password in the two servers; respectively; and the twoservers then cooperate to authenticate the client without knowing the password of the client.In case one server is compromised by an adversary; the password of the client is required toremain secure. In this paper; we present two compilers that transform any two-party PAKEprotocol to a two-server PAKE protocol on the basis of the identity-based cryptography;called ID2S PAKE protocol. By the compilers; we can construct ID2S PAKE protocols whichachieve implicit authentication. As long as the underlying two-party PAKE protocol andidentity-based encryption or signature scheme have provable security without randomoracles; the ID2S PAKE protocols constructed by the compilers can be proven to be …,IEEE Transactions on Computers,2016,10
Roles; Trust; and Reputation in Social Media Knowledge Markets,Elisa Bertino; Sorin Adam Matei,Specialized knowledge and expertise; especially of the kind that can shape public opinion;have been traditionally conceived to be the domain of individuals holding degrees awardedby higher learning institutions or occupying formal positions in notable organizations. Theirexpertise is validated by reputations established in an institutionalized marketplace of ideaswith a limited number of “available seats” and a stringent process of selection and retentionof names; ideas; topics; and facts of interest. However; the social media revolution; whichhas enabled over 2 billion Internet users not only to consume; but also to produceinformation and knowledge; has created a secondary and very active informal marketplaceof ideas and knowledge.

Authenticated top-k aggregation in distributed and outsourced databases,Sunoh Choi; Hyo-Sang Lim; Elisa Bertino,Top-k queries have attracted interest in many different areas like network and systemmonitoring; information retrieval; sensor networks; and so on. Since today many applicationsissue top-k queries on distributed and outsourced databases; authentication of top-k queryresults becomes more important. This paper addresses the problem of authenticated top-kaggregation queries (eg “find the k objects with the highest aggregate values”) in adistributed system. We propose a new algorithm; called Authenticated Three Phase UniformThreshold (A-TPUT); which provides not only efficient top-k aggregation over distributeddatabases but also authentication on the top-k results. We also introduce severalenhancements for A-TPUT to reduce both the computation cost and the communication cost.Finally; we confirm the efficiency of our solutions through an extensive experimental …,Privacy; Security; Risk and Trust (PASSAT); 2012 International Conference on and 2012 International Confernece on Social Computing (SocialCom),2012,10
A flexible approach to multisession trust negotiations,Anna Squicciarini; Elisa Bertino; Alberto Trombetta; Stefano Braghin,Trust Negotiation has shown to be a successful; policy-driven approach for automated trustestablishment; through the release of digital credentials. Current real applications requirenew flexible approaches to trust negotiations; especially in light of the widespread use ofmobile devices. In this paper; we present a multisession dependable approach to trustnegotiations. The proposed framework supports voluntary and unpredicted interruptions;enabling the negotiating parties to complete the negotiation despite temporary unavailabilityof resources. Our protocols address issues related to validity; temporary loss of data; andextended unavailability of one of the two negotiators. A peer is able to suspend an ongoingnegotiation and resume it with another (authenticated) peer. Negotiation portions andintermediate states can be safely and privately passed among peers; to guarantee the …,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and secure computing,2012,10
Towards a differentially private data anonymization,Mohamed R Fouad; Khaled Elbassioni; Elisa Bertino,ABSTRACT Maximizing data usage and minimizing privacy risk are two conflicting goals.Organizations always hide the owners' identities and then apply a set of transformations ontheir data before releasing it. While determining the best set of transformations has been thefocus of extensive work in the database community; most of this work suffered from one ortwo of the following major problems: scalability and pri vacy guarantee. To the best of ourknowledge; none of the proposed scalable anonymization techniques provides pri vacyguarantees supported with well-formulated theoretical foundation. Differential privacyprovides a theoretical for mulation for privacy that ensures that the system essentiallybehaves the same way regardless of whether any individual; or small group of individuals;are included in the database.

PEAR: a hardware based protocol authentication system,Sam Kerr; Michael S Kirkpatrick; Elisa Bertino,Abstract As users have to manage an increasing number of accounts; they have to balancepassword security and password usability. As such; many users use insecure passwordsresulting in their accounts and data being vulnerable to unauthorized accesses. In thispaper; we present Physically Enhanced Authentication Ring; or PEAR; a system thatalleviates this problem. We leverage Physically Unclonable Functions (PUF) to createunclonable hardware devices; which users use to authenticate. Using a hardware device;our system uses zero-knowledge proofs; which provide better security than traditionalpasswords; yet users must only enter a simple PIN. As such; our system is very usable andimposes little to no burden on end users and service providers.

k-shares: A privacy preserving reputation protocol for decentralized environments,Omar Hasan; Lionel Brunie; Elisa Bertino,Abstract A reputation protocol computes the reputation of an entity by aggregating thefeedback provided by other entities in the system. Reputation makes entities accountable fortheir behavior. Honest feedback is clearly a pre-requisite for accurate reputation scores.However; it has been observed that entities often hesitate in providing honest feedback;mainly due to the fear of retaliation. We present a privacy preserving reputation protocolwhich enables entities to provide feedback in a private and thus uninhibited manner. Theprotocol; termed k-shares; is oriented for decentralized environments. The protocol haslinear message complexity under the semi-honest adversarial model; which is animprovement over comparable reputation protocols.,IFIP International Information Security Conference,2010,10

Mask: a system for privacy-preserving policy-based access to published content,Mohamed Nabeel; Ning Shang; John Zage; Elisa Bertino,Abstract We propose to demonstrate Mask; the first system addressing the seemingly-unsolvable problem of how to selectively share contents among a group of users based onaccess control policies expressed as conditions against the identity attributes of these userswhile at the same time assuring the privacy of these identity attributes from the contentpublisher. Mask consists of three entities: a Content Publisher; Users referred to asSubscribers; and Identity Providers that issue certified identity attributes. The contentpublisher specifies access control policies against identity attributes of subscribersindicating which conditions the identity attributes of a subscriber must verify in order for thissubscriber to access a document or a subdocument. The main novelty of Mask is that; eventhough the publisher is able to match the identity attributes of the subscribers against its …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,10
Privacy-aware location-aided routing in mobile ad hoc networks,Gabriel Ghinita; Mehdi Azarmi; Elisa Bertino,Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) enable users in physical proximity to each other toexchange data without the need for expensive communication infrastructures. Each userrepresents a node in the network; and executes a neighbor discovery Typically; nodesbroadcast beacon messages that are received by other participants within the sender'scommunication range. Routing strategies are computed on-line based on the locations ofnearby nodes; and geocasting is employed to deliver data packets to their destinations.However; mobile users may be reluctant to share their exact locations with otherparticipants; since location can disclose private details about a person's lifestyle; religious orpolitical affiliations; etc. A common approach to protect location privacy is to replace exactcoordinates with coarser-grained regions; based on the privacy profile of each user.

PUF ROKs: generating read-once keys from physically unclonable functions,Michael S Kirkpatrick; Elisa Bertino; Sam Kerr,Abstract Cryptographers have proposed the notion of read-once keys (ROKs) as a beneficialtool for a number of applications; such as delegation of authority. The premise of ROKs isthat the key is destroyed by the process of reading it; thus preventing subsequent accesses.While the idea and the applications are well-understood; the consensus amongcryptographers is that ROKs cannot be produced by algorithmic processes alone. Rather; atrusted hardware mechanism is needed to support the destruction of the key. In this work; wepropose one such approach for using a hardware design to generate ROKs. Our approachis an application of physically unclonable functions (PUFs). PUFs use the intrinsicdifferences in hardware behavior to produce a random function that is unique to thathardware instance. Our design consists of incorporating the PUF in a feedback loop to …,Proceedings of the Sixth Annual Workshop on Cyber Security and Information Intelligence Research,2010,10
Repository management in an intelligent indexing approach for multimedia digital libraries,B Armani; B Catania; E Bertino; D Laradi; B Marin; Gian Piero Zarri,Metadata represent the vehicle by which digital documents can be efficiently indexed andretrieved. The need for such kind of information is particularly evident in multimedia digitallibraries; which store documents dealing with different types of media (text; images; sound;video). In this context; a relevant metadata function consists in superimposing some sort ofconceptual organization over the unstructured information space proper to these digitalrepositories; in order to facilitate the intelligent retrieval of the original documents. To thispurpose; the usage of conceptual annotations seems quite promising. In this paper; wepropose a two-steps annotation approach by which conceptual annotations; represented inNKRL [7];[8]; are associated with multimedia documents and used during retrievaloperations. We then discuss how documents and metadata can be stored and managed …,Foundations of Intelligent Systems,2010,10
Query processing techniques for compliance with data confidence policies,Chenyun Dai; Dan Lin; Murat Kantarcioglu; Elisa Bertino; Ebru Celikel; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract Data integrity and quality is a very critical issue in many data-intensive decision-making applications. In such applications; decision makers need to be provided with highquality data on which they can rely on with high confidence. A key issue is that obtaininghigh quality data may be very expensive. We thus need flexible solutions to the problem ofdata integrity and quality. This paper proposes one such solution based on four keyelements. The first element is the association of a confidence value with each data item inthe database. The second element is the computation of the confidence values of queryresults by using lineage propagation. The third element is the notion of confidence policies.Such a policy restricts access to the query results by specifying the minimum confidencelevel that is required for use in a certain task by a certain subject.

Achieving anonymity in mobile ad hoc networks using fuzzy position information,Xiaoxin Wu; Jun Liu; Xiaoyan Hong; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Traditionally the anonymity of an entity of interest can be achieved by hiding itamong a group of other entities with similar characteristics; ie; an anonymity set. In mobilead hoc networks; generating and maintaining such an anonymity set for any ad hoc nodeare challenging because of the node mobility and consequently of the dynamic networktopology. In this paper; we address the problem of the destination anonymity. We proposeprotocols that use fuzzy destination position to generate a geographic area called anonymityzone (AZ). A packet for a destination is delivered to all the nodes in the AZ; which;consequently; make up the anonymity set. The size of the anonymity set may decreasebecause nodes are mobile; yet the corresponding management on anonymity set is simple.We design techniques to further improve node anonymity.

Information driven evaluation of data hiding algorithms,Elisa Bertino; Igor Nai Fovino,Abstract Privacy is one of the most important properties an information system must satisfy. Arelatively new trend shows that classical access control techniques are not sufficient toguarantee privacy when datamining techniques are used. Privacy Preserving Data Mining(PPDM) algorithms have been recently introduced with the aim of modifying the database insuch a way to prevent the discovery of sensible information. Due to the large amount ofpossible techniques that can be used to achieve this goal; it is necessary to provide somestandard evaluation metrics to determine the best algorithms for a specific application orcontext. Currently; however; there is no common set of parameters that can be used for thispurpose.

An abstraction-based approach to measuring the structural similarity between two unordered XML documents,Marco Mesiti; Elisa Bertino; Giovanna Guerrini,Abstract Measuring the structural similarity between two document-centric XML documentsis a well-known problem. Many approaches have been proposed that; by fixing constraintsin the evaluation of similarity; compute the similarity with polynomial time complexity.Despite this huge activity for document-centric XML documents; no approaches have beenpresented so far for data-centric XML documents (ie; XML documents for which order amongelements is not relevant) mainly because this problem is; in general; NP-complete. In thispaper we propose an approach for measuring the structural similarity between two data-centric XML documents that; when the structure of elements with the same label is notheterogenous; is polynomial.,Proceedings of the 1st international symposium on Information and communication technologies,2003,10
An access control mechanism for large scale data dissemination systems,Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Evaggelia Pitoura,Automatic data dissemination systems are becoming increasingly relevant in Internet-basedinformation systems. In such systems; users subscribe to the dissemination service byproviding interest profiles. These profiles are then used to determine which informationshould be delivered to which users; whenever new information is entered into the system. Amain shortcoming of existing dissemination systems is the lack of any access controlmechanisms; enabling selective information dissemination based for example on security orother regulatory policies. We present an access control model suitable for disseminationsystems. The model is based on user profiles containing both user interests and usercredentials (ie; a set of attributes characterizing users for access control purposes).Information is then filtered before being delivered to users on the basis of both the user …,Research Issues in Data Engineering; 2001.

Object evolution in object databases,Elisa Bertino; Giovanna Guerrini; Luca Rusca,Abstract There are many aspects related to evolution in object-oriented databases. Not all ofthem have been investigated in sufficient depth. Generally speaking; one can distinguishbetween evolution of schemas—for example; modifying a class definition—and of instances—for example; the migration of an instance from one class to another. In the latter kind ofevolution; an instance modifies its own structure while maintaining the same identity. In thispaper we discuss instance evolution in the context of the Chimera object-oriented datamodel [11; 18]. However; though developed with reference to the Chimera data model; thediscussion is applicable to any object-oriented database system.

Unlike wired hosts; mobilehosts can be temporarily unreachable as a consequence of their moving across di erentcells; their energy limitation or unavailable wireless channels. Mobility forces mobile hosts toalternate connected and disconnected work. When connected; they perform personalcommunications and access shared data and services; when disconnected; they canprocess locally cached data objects. As for wired networks; data replication is the keyelement to ensure high data availability and to increase performance. However;disconnected work and the uncertainties of the underlying wireless network introduce newchallenging issues that have been recently discussed in the literature. There are three …,Kumar and Han,1992,10

Scalable end-to-end security for advanced metering infrastructures,Mohamed Nabeel; Xiaoyu Ding; Seung-Hyun Seo; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Conventional utility meters are increasingly being replaced with smart meters asAdvanced Metering Infrastructures (AMIs) provide many benefits over conventional powerinfrastructures. However; security issues pertaining to data transmission between smartmeters and utility servers are a major concern. In particular; as data travels through severalnetworks; scalable key management schemes are crucial for secure end-to-endcommunications. In this paper; we propose an approach based on physically unclonablefunction (PUF) technology for providing strong hardware based authentication of smartmeters and efficient key management to assure the confidentiality and integrity of messagesexchanged in AMIs. Our approach does not require modifications to the existing smart metercommunication. We have developed a proof-of-concept implementation of the proposed …,Information Systems,2015,9
Mavr: Code reuse stealthy attacks and mitigation on unmanned aerial vehicles,Javid Habibi; Aditi Gupta; Stephen Carlsony; Ajay Panicker; Elisa Bertino,As embedded systems have increased in performance and reliability; their applications haveexpanded into new domains such as automated drone-based delivery mechanisms.Security of these drones; also referred to as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs); is crucial dueto their use in many different domains. In this paper; we present a stealthy attack strategythat allows the attacker to change sensor values and modify the UAV navigation path. As theattack is stealthy; the system will continue to execute normally and thus the ground station orother monitoring entities and systems will not be able to detect that an attack is undergoing.With respect to defense; we propose a strategy that combines software and hardwaretechniques. At software level; we propose a fine grained randomization based approach thatmodifies the layout of the executable code and hinders code-reuse attack.

A hybrid private record linkage scheme: Separating differentially private synopses from matching records,Jianneng Cao; Fang-Yu Rao; Elisa Bertino; Murat Kantarcioglu,Private record linkage protocols allow multiple parties to exchange matching records; whichrefer to the same entities or have similar values; while keeping the non-matching onessecret. Conventional protocols are based on computationally expensive cryptographicprimitives and therefore do not scale. To address these scalability issues; hybrid protocolshave been recently proposed that combine differential privacy techniques with securemultiparty computation techniques. However; a drawback of such protocols is that theydisclose to the parties both the matching records and the differentially private synopses ofthe datasets involved in the linkage. Consequently; differential privacy is no longer alwayssatisfied. To address this issue; we propose a novel framework; which separates the privatesynopses from the matching records. The two parties do not access the synopses directly …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,9
Provenance-aware security risk analysis for hosts and network flows,Mohsen Rezvani; Aleksandar Ignjatovic; Elisa Bertino; Sanjay Jha,Detection of high risk network flows and high risk hosts is becoming ever more importantand more challenging. In order to selectively apply deep packet inspection (DPI) one has toisolate in real time high risk network activities within a huge number of monitored networkflows. To help address this problem; we propose an iterative methodology for asimultaneous assessment of risk scores for both hosts and network flows. The proposedapproach measures the risk scores of hosts and flows in an interdependent manner; thus;the risk score of a flow influences the risk score of its source and destination hosts; and alsothe risk score of a host is evaluated by taking into account the risk scores of flows initiated byor terminated at the host. Our experimental results show that such an approach not onlyeffective in detecting high risk hosts and flows but; when deployed in high throughput …,Network Operations and Management Symposium (NOMS); 2014 IEEE,2014,9
Multiparty privacy protection for electronic health records,Xun Yi; Yuan Miao; Elisa Bertino; Jan Willemson,Recently; the amount of personal medical information online is increasing exponentially;opening up new avenues for hackers to expose personal data that; unlike financialinformation; can result in a permanent violation of privacy. To protect the privacy of patientdata; such as electronic health records (EHRs); access control was used before andattributed-based encryption is used recently. These techniques can effectively prevent fromthe outside attacks; but are hard to withstand the inside attacks; where the databaseadministrator or the key manager is an attacker. In this paper; we provide a solution toprotect the privacy of patient data (EHRs) under the multi-party framework where all EHRsare encrypted with the common public key and an encrypted EHR can be decrypted only bythe cooperation of all parties. Based on the ElGamal threshold public key encryption …,Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM); 2013 IEEE,2013,9

However; assessing the credibility and adequacy of suchcalculated reputation is a real challenge. In this paper; we propose an analytic model whichleverages the values of the tasks completed; the credibility of the evaluators of the results ofthe tasks and time of evaluation of the results of these tasks in order to calculate an accurateand credible reputation rank of participating workers and fairness rank for evaluators. Themodel has been implemented and experimentally validated.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1211.3200,2012,9
Detecting; representing and querying collusion in online rating systems,Mohammad Allahbakhsh; Aleksandar Ignjatovic; Boualem Benatallah; Seyed-Mehdi-Reza Beheshti; Norman Foo; Elisa Bertino,Abstract: Online rating systems are subject to malicious behaviors mainly by posting unfairrating scores. Users may try to individually or collaboratively promote or demote a product.Collaborating unfair rating'collusion'is more damaging than individual unfair rating. Althoughcollusion detection in general has been widely studied; identifying collusion groups in onlinerating systems is less studied and needs more investigation. In this paper; we study impactof collusion in online rating systems and asses their susceptibility to collusion attacks. Theproposed model uses a frequent itemset mining algorithm to detect candidate collusiongroups. Then; several indicators are used for identifying collusion groups and for estimatinghow damaging such colluding groups might be. Also; we propose an algorithm for findingpossible collusive subgroup inside larger groups which are not identified as collusive …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1211.0963,2012,9
Marlin: making it harder to fish for gadgets,Aditi Gupta; Sam Kerr; Michael S Kirkpatrick; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Code-reuse attacks; including return-oriented programming (ROP) and jump-oriented programming; bypass defenses against code injection by repurposing existingexecutable code in application binaries and shared libraries toward a malicious end. Acommon feature of these attacks is the reliance on the knowledge of the layout of theexecutable code. We propose a fine grained randomization based approach that modifiesthe layout of executable code and hinders code-reuse attack. Our solution consists solely ofa modified dynamic loader that randomizes the internal structure of the executable code;thereby denying the attacker the necessary apriori knowledge for constructing the desiredsequence of gadgets. Our approach has the advantage that it can be applied to any ELFbinary and every execution of this binary uses a different randomization.

Efficient privacy preserving reputation protocols inspired by secure sum,Omar Hasan; Elisa Bertino; Lionel Brunie,The secure sum protocol is a well-known protocol for computing the sum of private inputsfrom distributed entities such that the inputs remain private. In this paper we presentprotocols for computing reputation in a privacy preserving manner that are inspired by thesecure sum protocol. We provide a protocol that is secure under the semi-honest adversarialmodel as well as one that is secure under the stronger non-disruptive malicious model.Although the protocols are inspired by secure sum; they do not suffer from the issues thatplague secure sum. Our protocols are resilient against colluding entities; which secure sumis not. The protocols that we develop are also efficient. We require an exchange of O (n)messages under the semi-honest model; where n is the number of feedback providers in theprotocol. This is the same complexity offered by secure sum.

Broadcast group key management with access control vectors,Ning Shang; Mohamed Nabeel; Elisa Bertino; Xukai Zou,Abstract Secure collaborative applications currently enabled by the Internet need flexibleand efficient mechanisms for managing and distributing group keys. The securetransmission of information among collaborating users should be efficient as well as flexiblein order to support access control models with different granularity levels for different kinds ofapplications such as secure group communication; secure dynamic conferencing; andselective/hierarchical access control disseminated information. In this paper; we propose thefirst provably secure broadcast Group Key Management (BGKM) scheme where each userin a group shares a secret with the trusted key server and the subsequent rekeying for join ordeparture of users requires only one broadcast message. Our scheme satisfies all therequirements laid down for an effective GKM scheme and requires no change to secret …,Department of Computer Science; Tech. Rep,2010,9
A distributed approach to enabling privacy-preserving model-based classifier training,Hangzai Luo; Jianping Fan; Xiaodong Lin; Aoying Zhou; Elisa Bertino,Abstract This paper proposes a novel approach for privacy-preserving distributed model-based classifier training. Our approach is an important step towards supportingcustomizable privacy modeling and protection. It consists of three major steps. First; eachdata site independently learns a weak concept model (ie; local classifier) for a given datapattern or concept by using its own training samples. An adaptive EM algorithm is proposedto select the model structure and estimate the model parameters simultaneously. Thesecond step deals with combined classifier training by integrating the weak concept modelsthat are shared from multiple data sites. To reduce the data transmission costs and thepotential privacy breaches; only the weak concept models are sent to the central site andsynthetic samples are directly generated from these shared weak concept models at the …,Knowledge and information systems,2009,9
Identity attribute-based role provisioning for human ws-bpel processes,Federica Paci; Rodolfo Ferrini; Elisa Bertino,The WS-BPEL specification focuses on business processes the activities of which areassumed to be interactions with Web services. However; WS-BPEL processes go beyondthe orchestration of activities exposed as Web services. There are cases in which peoplemust be considered as additional participants to the execution of a process. The inclusion ofhumans; in turn; requires solutions to support the specification and enforcement ofauthorizations to users for the execution of human activities while enforcing authorizationconstraints. In this paper; we extend RBAC-WS-BPEL; a role-based authorization frameworkfor WS-BPEL processes with an identity attribute-based role provisioning approach thatpreserves the privacy of the users who claim the execution of human activities.

Automatic compliance of privacy policies in federated digital identity management,Anna Squicciarini; Marco Casassa Mont; Abhilasha Bhargav-Spantzel; Elisa Bertino,Privacy in the digital world is an important problem which is becoming even more pressingas new collaborative applications are developed. The lack of privacy preservingmechanisms is particularly problematic in federated identity management contexts. In such acontext; users can seamlessly interact with a variety of federated web services; throughtheuse of single-sign-on mechanisms and the capability of sharing personal data amongthese web services. We argue that comprehensive privacy policies should be stated byfederated service providers and proactively checked by these providers; before disclosingusers' data to federated partners. To address such requirements; we introduce mechanismsand algorithms for policy compliance checking between federated service providers; basedon an innovative policy subsumption approach.

Secure delta-publishing of XML content,Mohamed Nabeel; Elisa Bertino,Many content distribution applications are characterized by frequent; incremental updates.Efficiency is not the only requirement in that security is also crucial for a large spectrum ofapplications. The goal of this work is to develop an approach for efficient and scalabledissemination of XML documents while assuring confidentiality; integrity and completenesswithout requiring the third-party publishers to be trusted. The key element of our approach toreduce the bandwidth requirements is to use delta messaging. Our approach takes everypossible measure to minimize indirect information leakage by making the rest of thestructure of XML documents to which clients do not have access oblivious. The experimentalresults show that our scheme is superior to conventional techniques of securing XMLdocuments when the percentage of updates with respect to original documents is low.,Data Engineering; 2008.

Now; travelers routinely print out e-tickets from their computers; and manycountries have started issuing e-passports with embedded biometric information. However;countries are taking different approaches to e-passports; raising concerns about howtravelers can replace them in the event they're lost or stolen. Travelers report the loss or theftof hundreds of thousands of passports each year. The Australian government estimates that30;000 of the 1 million passports it issues annually are lost or stolen (http://foreignminister.gov. au/releases/2005/fa083_05. html); and in 2006; the United Kingdom reported that morethan 290;000 passports were lost or stolen (http://press. home-office. gov. uk/press-releases/passport-warning? version= 1).,Computer,2007,9
A system for securing push-based distribution of XML documents,Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Federica Paci; Loredana Parasiliti Provenza,Abstract Push-based systems for distributing information through Internet are todaybecoming more and more popular and widely used. The widespread use of such systemsraises non trivial security concerns. In particular; confidentiality; integrity and authenticity ofthe distributed data must be ensured. To cope with such issues; we describe here a systemfor securing push distribution of XML documents; which adopts digital signature andencryption techniques to ensure the above mentioned properties and allows thespecification of both signature and access control policies. We also describe theimplementation of the proposed system and present an extensive performance evaluation ofits main components.,International Journal of Information Security,2007,9
A privacy preserving assertion based policy language for federation systems,Anna C Squicciarini; Ayca Azgin Hintoglu; Elisa Bertino; Yucel Saygin,Abstract Identity federation systems enable participating organizations to provide services toqualified individuals and manage their identity attributes at an inter-organizational level.Most importantly; they empower individuals with control over the usage of their attributeswithin the federation via enforcement of various policies. Among such policies; one of themost important yet immature one is the privacy policy. Existing frameworks proposed forprivacy-preserving federations lack the capability to support complex data-usagepreferences in the form of obligations; ie the privacy related actions that must be performedupon certain actions on a specific piece of information. Moreover; they do not account for thehistory of events resulting from the interactions among federation entities.

Decentralized authorization and data security in web content delivery,Danfeng Yao; Yunhua Koglin; Elisa Bertino; Roberto Tamassia,Abstract The fast development of web services; or more broadly; service-orientedarchitectures (SOAs); has prompted more organizations to move contents and applicationsout to the Web. Softwares on the web allow one to enjoy a variety of services; for exampletranslating texts into other languages and converting a document from one format to another.In this paper; we address the problem of maintaining data integrity and confidentiality in webcontent delivery when dynamic content modifications are needed. We propose a flexible andscalable model for secure content delivery based on the use of roles and role certificates tomanage web intermediaries. The proxies coordinate themselves in order to process anddeliver contents; and the integrity of the delivered content is enforced using a decentralizedstrategy.

An update protocol for XML documents in distributed and cooperative systems,Yunhua Koglin; Giovanni Mella; Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari,Securing data is becoming a crucial need for most Internet-based applications. Whereas theproblem of data confidentiality has been widely investigated; the problem of how to ensurethat data; when moving among different parties; are modified only according to the statedpolicies has been so far not deeply investigated. In this paper; the authors proposed anapproach supporting parallel and distributed secure updates to XML documents. Theapproach; based on the use of a security region-object parallel flow (S-RPF) graph protocol;is particularly suited for all environments requiring cooperative updates to XML documents. Itallows different users to simultaneously update different portions of the same document;according to the specified access control policies.

An approach to cooperative updates of XML documents in distributed systems,Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Giovanni Mella,Abstract Protection and secure exchange of Web documents is becoming a crucial need formany Internet-based applications. Securing Web documents entail addressing two mainissues: confidentiality and integrity. Ensuring document confidentiality means that documentcontents can only be disclosed to subjects authorized according to specified securitypolicies; whereas by document integrity we mean that the document contents are correctwith respect to a given application domain and that the document contents are modified onlyby authorized subjects. While the problem of document confidentiality has been widelyinvestigated in the literature; the problem of how to ensure that a document; when movingamong different parties; is modified only according to the stated policies still lackscomprehensive solutions. In this paper we present a solution to this problem by proposing …,Journal of Computer Security,2005,9
Grid based methods for estimating spatial join selectivity,Alberto Belussi; Elisa Bertino; Andrea Nucita,Abstract Spatial join is a fundamental operation for many spatial queries in GeographicalInformation Systems (GIS). Therefore; the query optimizer of a GIS needs to evaluate theselectivity of spatial joins; in order to find the best execution plan for a given query. Thissituation has made it necessary to find good and efficient estimators for spatial joinselectivity. In particular; spatial join estimation with respect to sets of rectangles is necessary.Indeed; in GIS sets of rectangles are generated in order to produce a syntheticrepresentation of real geometric values through the Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBR).Several methods for this estimation have been proposed in literature. One of the bestmethods is based on precalculated histograms; that describe the distribution of rectangles inthe reference space using grid based data structures.

This extension hasseveral implications; thus we make three different specific contributions. First; the definitionof a declarative data manipulation language for ODMG; which is missing in the currentversion of the standard; such a definition requires revisiting data manipulation in ODMG andalso addressing issues related to set-oriented versus instance-oriented computation. Then;the definition of a trigger language for ODMG; unifying also the SQL: 1999 proposal andproviding support for trigger inheritance and overriding.

Signature and access control policies for XML documents,Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Loredana Parasiliti Provenza,Abstract Information push is today an approach widely used for information dissemination indistributed systems. Under information push; a Web data source periodically (or wheneversome relevant event arises) broadcasts data to clients; without the need of an explicitrequest. In order to make information push usable in a large variety of application domains; itis however important that the authenticity and privacy requirements of both the receiversubjects and information owners be satisfied. Although the problem of confidentiality hasbeen widely investigated; no comparable amount of work has been done for authenticity. Inthis paper; we propose a model to specify signature policies; specifically conceived for XMLdata. The model allows the specification of credential-based signature policies; supportingboth single and joint signatures.

A secure publishing service for digital libraries of XML documents,Elisa Bertino; Barbara Carminati; Elena Ferrari,Abstract Secure publication over the Internet of XML data is becoming a crucial need asXML is rapidly becoming a standard for document representation and exchange over theWeb. Publishing services must have a mechanism that ensures that a user receives all andonly those portions of information he/she is entitled to access (for instance those for whichthe user has paid a subscription fee). Furthermore; such a mechanism must ensure thatthese contents are not eavesdropped during their transmission from the publishing serviceto the user. In this paper; we propose an architecture for secure publishing of XMLdocuments. Distinguishing features of our proposal is the flexibility the publishing serviceoffers both in terms of the way users can select the contents they are interested in and in theway the contents are delivered to users.

Enhancing the expressive power of the U-Datalog language,Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania; Roberta Gori,Abstract U-Datalog has been developed with the aim of providing a set-oriented logicalupdate language; guaranteeing update parallelism in the context of a Datalog-likelanguage. In U-Datalog; updates are expressed by introducing constraints (+ p (X); to denoteinsertion; and− p (X); to denote deletion) inside Datalog rules. A U-Datalog program can beinterpreted as a CLP program. In this framework; a set of updates (constraints) is satisfiable ifit does not represent an inconsistent theory; that is; it does not require the insertion and thedeletion of the same fact. This approach resembles a very simple form of negation. However;on the other hand; U-Datalog does not provide any mechanism to explicitly deal withnegative information; resulting in a language with limited expressive power. In this paper; weprovide a semantics; based on stratification; handling the use of negated atoms in U …,Theory and Practice of Logic Programming,2001,9

Node or link? Fine-grained analysis of packet-loss attacks in wireless sensor networks,Daniele Midi; Elisa Bertino,Abstract In wireless sensor networks; packet losses are often an indicator of possibleundergoing attacks. Therefore; security solutions aiming at providing comprehensiveprotection must include functions for packet-loss detection. Determining the actual cause ofthese losses is crucial to a quick and automated reaction to the attack; be it a simplereporting of the attack or a more sophisticated action such as packet rerouting andretransmission. Packet losses in wireless sensor networks can be caused by either attacksaffecting the nodes or attacks focused on the wireless links. The efficacy of the response tosuch attacks is highly dependent on an accurate identification of the actual attack cause.Therefore; approaches to correctly identifying the cause of packet losses are needed.

Private information retrieval,Xun Yi; Russell Paulet; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Download Free Sample This book deals with Private Information Retrieval (PIR); atechnique allowing a user to retrieve an element from a server in possession of a databasewithout revealing to the server which element is retrieved. PIR has been widely applied toprotect the privacy of the user in querying a service provider on the Internet. For example; byPIR; one can query a location-based service provider about the nearest car park withoutrevealing his location to the server. The first PIR approach was introduced by Chor;Goldreich; Kushilevitz and Sudan in 1995 in a multi-server setting; where the user retrievesinformation from multiple database servers; each of which has a copy of the same database.To ensure user privacy in the multi-server setting; the servers must be trusted not to collude.In 1997; Kushilevitz and Ostrovsky constructed the first single-database PIR.

A framework for verification and optimal reconfiguration of event-driven role based access control policies,Basit Shafiq; Jaideep S Vaidya; Arif Ghafoor; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Role based access control (RBAC) is the de facto model used for advanced accesscontrol due to its inherent richness and flexibility. Despite its great success at modeling avariety of organizational needs; maintaining large complex policies is a challengingproblem. Conflicts within policies can expose the underlying system to numerousvulnerabilities and security risks. Therefore; more comprehensive verification tools for RBACneed to be developed to enable effective access control. In this paper; we propose averification framework for detection and resolution of inconsistencies and conflicts in policiesmodeled through event-driven RBAC; an important subset of generalized temporal RBACapplicable to many domains; such as SCADA systems. We define the conflict resolutionproblem and propose an integer programming based heuristic.

User's identity consists of data; referred to asidentity attributes; that encode relevant-security properties of the users. Because identityattributes often convey sensitive information about users; they have to be protected. TheOblivious Commitment-Based Envelope (OCBE) protocols address the protectionrequirements of both users and service providers.

Physically restricted authentication with trusted hardware,Michael S Kirkpatrick; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Modern computer systems permit users to access protected information from remotelocations. In certain secure environments; it would be desirable to restrict this access to aparticular computer or set of computers. Existing solutions of machine-level authenticationare undesirable for two reasons. First; they do not allow fine-grained application layeraccess decisions. Second; they are vulnerable to insider attacks in which a trustedadministrator acts maliciously. In this work; we describe a novel approach using securehardware that solves these problems. In our design; multiple administrators are required forinstallation of a system. After installation; the authentication privileges are physically linkedto that machine; and no administrator can bypass these controls.

Visualization for access control policy analysis results using multi-level grids,Prathima Rao; Gabriel Ghinita; Elisa Bertino; Jorge Lobo,The rapid increase in deployment of policy-based access control systems faces securityadministrators with the daunting task of managing a large number of complex access controlpolicies. Several policy analysis types;(eg; policy similarity; policy conflict and change-impact) have been proposed to help administrators maintain consistent and conflict-freepolicy repositories. However; there has not been much focus on the presentation and theensuing interpretation of the results of such analyses; which greatly undermines the usabilityfactor. In this paper; we present a novel multi-level grid-based technique for visualizingresults of policy analysis. We implemented this technique; and we present a sample policysimilarity analysis scenario that highlights the advantages of the proposed resultvisualization method.,Policies for Distributed Systems and Networks; 2009.

Adaptive management of multigranular spatio-temporal object attributes,Elena Camossi; Elisa Bertino; Giovanna Guerrini; Michela Bertolotto,Abstract In applications involving spatio-temporal modelling; granularities of data may haveto adapt according to the evolving semantics and significance of data. In this paper wedefine ST 2 _ODMGe; a multigranular spatio-temporal model supporting evolutions; whichencompass the dynamic adaptation of attribute granularities; and the deletion of attributevalues. Evolutions are specified as Event-Condition-Action rules and are executed at run-time. The event; the condition; and the action may refer to a period of time and ageographical area. The evolution may also be constrained by the attribute values. The abilityof dynamically evolving the object attributes results in a more flexible management ofmultigranular spatio-temporal data but it requires revisiting the notion of object consistencywith respect to class definitions and access to multigranular object values. Both issues …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2009,8
Efficient integration of fine-grained access control and resource brokering in grid,Pietro Mazzoleni; Bruno Crispo; Swaminathan Sivasubramanian; Elisa Bertino,Abstract In this paper; we present a novel resource brokering service for grid systems whichconsiders authorization policies of the grid nodes in the process of selecting the resources tobe assigned to a request. We argue such an integration is needed to avoid schedulingrequests onto resources the policies of which do not authorize their execution. Our service;implemented in Globus as a part of Monitoring and Discovery Service (MDS); is based onthe concept of fine-grained access control (FGAC) which enables participating grid nodes tospecify fine-grained policies concerning the conditions under which grid clients can accesstheir resources. Since the process of evaluating authorization policies; in addition tochecking the resource requirements; can be a potential bottleneck for a large scale grid; wealso analyze the problem of the efficient evaluation of FGAC policies. In this context; we …,The Journal of Supercomputing,2009,8
Standards for web services security,Elisa Bertino; Lorenzo D Martino; Federica Paci; Anna C Squicciarini,Abstract Over time; different languages; mechanisms; and tools have been developed ondifferent software and hardware platforms for specifying and implementing a variety ofsecurity mechanisms; such as encryption and access control. In a Web service setting;security mechanisms protect the confidentiality and integrity of the so-called information intransit; that is; the data and messages exchanged between a client and aWeb service; andof the so-called information at rest; that is; the information stored in a Web host. Furthermore;protection of the information must not only consider simple two-way client-serverinteractions; but also extend to more complex interactions; as in the case of businessprocesses implemented through multiple Web services.,*,2009,8
XACML function annotations,Prathima Rao; Dan Lin; Elisa Bertino,XACML is being increasingly adopted in large enterprise systems for specifying accesscontrol policies. However; the efficient analysis and integration of multiple policies in suchlarge distributed systems still remains a difficult task. In this paper; we propose an annotationtechnique which is a simple extension to XACML; and may greatly benefit the policy analysisprocess. We also discuss an important consistency problem during XACML policytranslation and point out a few possible research directions.,Policies for Distributed Systems and Networks; 2007. POLICY'07.

Access control strategies for virtualized environments in grid computing systems,Anna Cinzia Squicciarini; Elisa Bertino; Sebastien Goasguen,The development of adequate security solutions and in particular of authentication andauthorization techniques for grid computing systems is a challenging task. Challenges arisefrom the heterogeneity of users; the presence of multiple security administration entities; theheterogeneity of security techniques used at the various grid hosts; the scalabilityrequirements; and the need for high-level policies concerning resource sharing. Recenttrends; like accessing grid through science gateways and the use of virtual organizations(VO) for managing user communities; further complicate the problem of security for gridcomputing systems. Currently; the GSI component developed as part of the Globus Toolkit;the de-facto standard for grid infrastructures is not fully suited to meet those challenges. Themain drawback of such an approach is that it relies on a low level identity-based …,Future Trends of Distributed Computing Systems; 2007. FTDCS'07. 11th IEEE International Workshop on,2007,8
PDL with maximum consistency monitors,Elisa Bertino; Alessandra Mileo; Alessandro Provetti,Abstract In the context of Network management; Chomicki; Lobo and Naqvi have defined thespecification language PDL (Policy Description Language) and later extended it byintroducing monitors: constraints on the actions that the network manager cannot executesimultaneously. We argue that PDL with monitors is an appealing language that can beapplied to specification and implementation of intelligent systems beyond networkmanagement. To do so; we discuss two extensions of it. In the first extension monitors aredefined as computing a maximum set of actions compatible with the constraints; rather thana maximal one. The inevitably higher computational complexity of this extension isassessed. In the second extension; negative events; a device already introduced byChomicki et al.; are treated as equivalent to regular events; thus allowing more intuitive …,International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems,2003,8

Refined rules termination analysis through transactions,Danilo Montesi; Elisa Bertino; Maria Bagnato,Abstract We propose two methods for rule termination analysis within active databases. Thefirst method relies on evolution graphs simulating rule processing statically and consideringboth rule activation and deactivation. The evolution graphs provide a more accurate analysisthan traditional graph-based approaches. The second method refines the former oneconsidering the updates forming transactions that trigger active rules. We show that severaltermination analysis methods are captured with our approaches. The algorithms testingrules termination (with and without transactions) are presented considering both event-preserving and event-consuming policies and immediate rule execution. The proposedapproaches turn out to be practical and general with respect to the various rule languagesand thus they may be applied to several database systems.,Information Systems,2003,8
A conceptual annotation approach to indexing in a web-based information system,Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania; Gian Piero Zarri,Abstract WWW objects are characterized by data with heterogeneous characteristics such astext; images; both still and moving; graphs and sound. One of the most important problems inthis context is to represent and query the content of WWW objects. All the specialists haveagreed that the possibility of adding to multimedia WWW objects some sort of conceptualannotations describing their information content would greatly contribute to solve theproblem of their intelligent indexing and retrieval. In this paper; we propose to associate withthe WWW objects not the final conceptual annotation; but a simple Natural Language (NL)caption; in the form of short texts representing a general; neutral description of theirinformational content. The NL caption is then converted into a conceptual annotation inNKRL (Narrative Knowledge Representation Language)[35; 36]; making use of a semi …,Netnomics,2000,8
A logical approach to cooperative information systems,Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania; Vincenzo Gervasi; Alessandra Raffaetà,Abstract “Cooperative information system management” refers to the capacity of severalcomputing systems to communicate and cooperate in order to acquire; store; manage; querydata and knowledge. Current solutions to the problem of cooperative informationmanagement are still far from being satisfactory. In particular; they lack the ability to fullymodel cooperation among heterogeneous systems according to a declarative style. The useof a logical approach to model all aspects of cooperation seems very promising. In thispaper; we define a logical language able to support cooperative queries; updates andupdate propagation. We model the sources of information as deductive databases; sharingthe same logical language to express queries and updates; but containing independent;even if possibly related; data. We use the Obj-U-Datalog (E. Bertino; G. Guerrini; D …,The Journal of Logic Programming,2000,8
Finitely representable nested relations,Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania; Limsoon Wong,Abstract Advanced temporal and spatial applications require both the representation ofcomplex objects and the ability to finitely represent infinite relations. Representing such datarequires combining the constraint relational model (allowing finite representation of infiniteinformation) and either the nested relational or the object-oriented model (allowingrepresentation of complex objects). In this paper; we extend the nested relational calculus todeal with finitely representable relations. The aim of the language we propose; called frNRC; is to provide the right formal foundations to analyze nested constraint querylanguages; overcoming some limitations of already existing languages. As an example ofthe theoretical foundations of fr NRC; we show that it is effectively computable and has lowdata complexity. Moreover; fr NRC queries are independent of the depth of set nesting in …,Information Processing Letters,1999,8
Mandatory security and object‐oriented systems: A multilevel entity model and its mapping onto a single‐level object model,Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract The application of mandatory security policies in object-oriented systems requireobjects to be single-level; ie; all information in an object must have the same securityclassification. However; real-world entities are often multilevel. Moreover; differentcoexistence options for property values at different levels are needed. In this paper wepresent a model for specifying multilevel entities. The proposed entity model supportsdifferent options by which users can specify whether low level values of entity properties areto be considered valid at higher levels or whether they represent cover stories not valid athigher levels. We then illustrate how entities expressed in this model can be mapped ontosingle-level objects. We also present a methodology and algorithms to automatically performsuch a mapping.© 1998 John Wiley & Sons; Inc.,Theory and Practice of Object Systems,1998,8
Flexible commit protocols for advanced transaction processing,Luigi Mancini; Indrajit Ray; Sushil Jajodia; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Although numerous extended models have been proposed to overcome thelimitations of the standard transaction model; most of these models have been proposedwith specific applications in mind and; therefore; they fail to support applications with slightlydifferent requirements. In this paper; we propose the H-transaction framework along with aset of powerful transaction control primitives to support a wide range of transactiondependencies including flexible commit. Our set of transaction control primitives can bebroadly classified into two types: basic primitives that are found in almost all conventionaltransaction processing systems and new primitives that lend expressive power andflexibility. These primitives can be used to separate the coding of the transactions from theapplication's control aspects needed for preserving cooperation and dependencies …,*,1997,8

Query decomposition in an object-oriented database system distributed on a local area network,Elisa Bertino,Several issues are discussed concerning query processing in the framework ofCOMANDOS. COMANDOS is an object-oriented system supporting the development ofdistributed advanced applications. We first summarize the data model and the querylanguage. Then we present the architectural aspects that are relevant for query processing.Finally we describe query decomposition and optimization. Two different strategies for joinexecution are discussed. The first is based on a distributed execution using semi-joinoperations. The second is based on first centralizing all relevant data on a server machine;and then executing all join operations locally at the server. The second strategy may beuseful when the data are distributed on a large number of nodes which have limitedprocessing power. In this case; it may be more efficient to use a dedicated server machine …,Research Issues in Data Engineering; 1995: Distributed Object Management; Proceedings. RIDE-DOM'95.

Performance evaluation of two concurrency control mechanisms in a distributed database system,Costantino Thanos; Carlo Carlesi; Elisa Bertino,Concurrency control (CC) mechanisms are an essential component of a distributeddatabase management system (DDBMS). Particular attention has thus been paid to thesemechanisms by researchers and there have been many different proposals forsynchronization algorithms. At the present; however; there is a need for an accurateevaluation to measure the impact that these algorithms have had on DDBMS performance.The studies conducted so far appear to be incomplete. This is because these studies havebeen restricted to an evaluation of the CC mechanisms independently of the DDBMS withinwhich they must operate and upon which their performance obviously has considerableimpact.

pCLSC-TKEM: a Pairing-free Certificateless Signcryption-tag Key Encapsulation Mechanism for a Privacy-Preserving IoT.,Seung-Hyun Seo; Jongho Won; Elisa Bertino,Abstract. Certificateless Signcryption Tag Key Encapsulation Mechanism (CLSC-TKEM) isan effective method for simultaneously providing key encapsulation and a digital signatureon the tag. It has applications in several security services such as communicationconfidentiality; integrity; authentication; and non-repudiation. Moreover; because CLSC-TKEM is based on certificateless public key cryptography (CL-PKC); it has the advantage ofnot requiring public key certificates. In addition it does not suffer from the key escrowproblem which is instead a major drawback of identity-based public key cryptography (ID-PKC). Unfortunately; current constructions of CLSC-TKEM rely on the use of bilinear pairing-based operations that are computationally very expensive for small IoT devices. In thispaper; we present a new construction of CLSC-TKEM that does not require bilinear …,Transactions on Data Privacy,2016,7

Resilient authenticated execution of critical applications in untrusted environments,Michael S Kirkpatrick; Gabriel Ghinita; Elisa Bertino,Modern computer systems are built on a foundation of software components from a variety ofvendors. While critical applications may undergo extensive testing and evaluationprocedures; the heterogeneity of software sources threatens the integrity of the executionenvironment for these trusted programs. For instance; if an attacker can combine anapplication exploit with a privilege escalation vulnerability; the operating system (OS) canbecome corrupted. Alternatively; a malicious or faulty device driver running with kernelprivileges could threaten the application. While the importance of ensuring applicationintegrity has been studied in prior work; proposed solutions immediately terminate theapplication once corruption is detected.

Though a number of techniques; suchas encryption and electronic signatures; are currently available to protect data whentransmitted across sites; a truly comprehensive approach for data protection must alsoinclude mechanisms for enforcing access control policies based on data contents; subjectqualifications and characteristics; and other relevant contextual information; such as time. Itis well understood today that the semantics of data must also be taken into account in orderto specify effective access control policies. Also; techniques for data integrity and availabilityspecifically tailored to database systems must be adopted.

However; while Web services are rapidly becoming afundamental paradigm for the development of complex Web applications; several securityissues still need to be addressed.

Different strategies can be applied; with respect toavailable data and to the preferences specified by the user on either accuracy or efficiencyin executing a query.

Integrity constraint checking in Chimera,Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania; Stéphane Bressan,Abstract Integrity constraints are general properties that a given database is expected tosatisfy. Integrity constraints can be implicit in the schema of the database or explicitlyexpressed as; for instance; logical formulae. Since the database is expected to be consistentwith respect to these properties; one important issue is the verification of integrity constraintsupon updates. Such a operation is called constraints verification or constraints checking.Constraint verification is potentially an expensive operation for all types of database and inparticular for deductive databases [34]; and deductive and object-oriented Databases(DOOD); where the modification of a single data can have a substantial impact on other databecause of the presence of deductive rules and inheritance.

A game of things: Strategic allocation of security resources for iot,Antonino Rullo; Daniele Midi; Edoardo Serra; Elisa Bertino,Abstract In many Internet of Thing (IoT) application domains security is a critical requirement;because malicious parties can undermine the effectiveness of IoT-based systems bycompromising single components and/or communication channels. Thus; a securityinfrastructure is needed to ensure the proper functioning of such systems even under attack.However; it is also critical that security be at a reasonable resource and energy cost; asmany IoT devices may not have sufficient resources to host expensive security tools. In thispaper; we focus on the problem of efficiently and effectively securing IoT networks bycarefully allocating security tools. We model our problem according to game theory; andprovide a Pareto-optimal solution; in which the cost of the security infrastructure; its energyconsumption; and the probability of a successful attack; are minimized.

First; an interdependency relationship among the riskscores of a network flow and its source and destination hosts. On the one hand; the riskscore of a host depends on risky flows initiated by or terminated at the host. On the otherhand; the risk score of a flow depends on the risk scores of its source and destination hosts.Second; which we call flow provenance; represents risk propagation among network flowswhich considers the likelihood that a particular flow is caused by the other flows.

To enhance security; various trust-based schemes have beenproposed that augment traditional cryptography-based security schemes. However; most ofthem use static and predefined trust thresholds for node misbehavior detection; withouttaking into consideration the network conditions locally at each node. Using static thresholdsfor misbehavior detection may result in high false positives; low malicious node detectionrate; and network partitioning.

In the shadows we trust: a secure aggregation tolerant watermark for data streams,Arezou Soltani Panah; Ron van Schyndel; Timos Sellis; Elisa Bertino,In many applications such as sensor networks; e-healthcare and environmental monitoring;data is continuously streamed and combined from multiple resources in order to makedecisions based on the aggregated data streams. One major concern in these applicationsis assuring high trustworthiness of the aggregated data stream for correct decision-making.For example; an adversary may compromise a few data-sources and introduce false datainto the aggregated data-stream and cause catastrophic consequences. In this work; wepropose a novel method for verifying data integrity by embedding several signature codeswithin data streams known as digital watermarking. Therefore; the integrity of the datastreams can be verified by decoding the embedded signatures even as the data go throughmultiple stages of aggregation process.

In several application scenarios; users define their ownproximity zones of interest (typically in the form of polygonal regions; such as a collection ofcity blocks); and want to find other users with whom they are in a mutual enclosurerelationship with respect to their respective proximity zones. This boils down to evaluatingtwo point-in-polygon enclosure conditions; which is easy to achieve for revealed userlocations and proximity zones.

Fine-grained analysis of packet losses in wireless sensor networks,Bilal Shebaro; Daniele Midi; Elisa Bertino,Packet losses in a wireless sensor network represent an indicator of possible attacks to thenetwork. Detecting and reacting to such losses is thus an important component of anycomprehensive security solution. However; in order to quickly and automatically react tosuch a loss; it is important to determine the actual cause of the loss. In a wireless sensornetwork; packet losses can result from attacks affecting the nodes or the wireless linksconnecting the nodes. Failure to identify the actual attack can undermine the efficacy of theattack responses. We thus need approaches to correctly identify the cause of packet losses.In this paper; we address this problem by proposing and building a fine-grained analysis(FGA) tool that investigates the causes of packet losses and reports the most likely cause ofthese losses.

Privacy-preserving assessment of social network data trustworthiness,Chenyun Dai; Fang-Yu Rao; Traian Marius Truta; Elisa Bertino,Extracting useful knowledge from social network datasets is a challenging problem. Whilelarge online social networks such as Facebook and LinkedIn are well known and gathermillions of users; small social networks are today becoming increasingly common. Manycorporations already use existing social networks to connect to their customers. Seeing theincreasing usage of small social networks; such companies will likely start to create in-houseonline social networks where they will own the data shared by customers. Thetrustworthiness of these online social networks is essentially important for decision makingof those companies. In this paper; our goal is to assess the trustworthiness of local socialnetwork data by referencing external social networks. To add to the difficulty of this problem;privacy concerns that exist for many social network datasets have restricted the ability to …,International Journal of Cooperative Information Systems,2014,6
RFID security and privacy,Yingjiu Li; Robert H Deng; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Download Free Sample As a fast-evolving new area; RFID security and privacy hasquickly grown from a hungry infant to an energetic teenager during recent years. Much of theexciting development in this area is summarized in this book with rigorous analyses andinsightful comments. In particular; a systematic overview on RFID security and privacy isprovided at both the physical and network level. At the physical level; RFID security meansthat RFID devices should be identified with assurance in the presence of attacks; while RFIDprivacy requires that RFID devices should be identified without disclosure of any valuableinformation about the devices. At the network level; RFID security means that RFIDinformation should be shared with authorized parties only; while RFID privacy furtherrequires that RFID information should be shared without disclosure of valuable RFID …,Synthesis Lectures on Information Security; Privacy; & Trust,2013,6
Fine-grained analysis of packet loss symptoms in wireless sensor networks,Bilal Shebaro; Daniele Midi; Elisa Bertino,Abstract In a wireless sensor networks; packet losses can result from attacks affecting thenodes or the wireless links connecting the nodes. Failure to identify the actual attack canundermine the efficacy of the attack responses. We thus need approaches to correctlyidentify the cause of packet losses. In this poster paper; we address this problem byproposing and building a fine-grained analysis (FGA) tool that investigates the causes ofpacket losses and reports the most likely cause of these losses. Our tool uses parameters;eg RSSI and LQI; transmitted with every received packet to profile the links between nodesand their corresponding neighborhood. Through real-world experiments; we have validatedour approach and shown that our tool is able to differentiate between the various attacks thatmay affect the nodes and the links.,Proceedings of the 11th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems,2013,6
Data Security–Challenges and Research Opportunities,Elisa Bertino,Abstract The proliferation of web-based applications and information systems; and recenttrends such as cloud computing and outsourced data management; have increased theexposure of data and made security more difficult.

Proactive defense of insider threats through authorization management,Yuqing Sun; Ninghui Li; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Among various attacks that may potentially target information systems; insider threatis recognized as an important factor of serious damage. In this paper; we investigate thisproblem from the view of authorizations in the context of access control. The objectives areto assess the sensitive authorizations in a system and to make appropriate arrangement forreducing the convenience of insider fraud. The proposed analytical framework takes thesecurity constraints and the user relationships into account besides the traditionalassessment of each independent user. Specially; different fraud patterns and insider attacksare formally modeled. These concerns are meaningful in practice since with the enforcementof security constraint like Separation of Duty; a single user only possesses partial privilegesfor a sensitive task. Thus a person who want to launch an attack need to adopt social …,Proceedings of 2011 international workshop on Ubiquitous affective awareness and intelligent interaction,2011,6
A new class of buffer overflow attacks,Ashish Kundu; Elisa Bertino,In this paper; we focus on a class of buffer overflow vulnerabilities that occur due to the"placement new''expression in C++." Placement new''facilitates placement of an object/arrayat a specific memory location. When appropriate bounds checking is not in place; objectoverflows may occur. Such overflows can lead to stack as well as heap/data/bss overflows;which can be exploited by attackers in order to carry out the entire range of attacksassociated with buffer overflow. Unfortunately; buffer overflows due to" placement new''haveneither been studied in the literature nor been incorporated in any tool designed to detectand/or address buffer overflows. In this paper; we show how the" placement new''expressionin C++ can be used to carry out buffer overflow attacks-on the stack as well asheap/data/bss. We show that overflowing objects and arrays can also be used to carry out …,Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS); 2011 31st International Conference on,2011,6
Privilege states based access control for fine-grained intrusion response,Ashish Kamra; Elisa Bertino,Abstract We propose an access control model specifically developed to support fine-grainedresponse actions; such as request suspension and request tainting; in the context of ananomaly detection system for databases. To achieve such response semantics; the modelintroduces the concept of privilege states and orientation modes in the context of a role-based access control system. The central idea in our model is that privileges; assigned to auser or role; have a state attached to them; thereby resulting in a privilege states basedaccess control (PSAC) system. In this paper; we present the design details and a formalmodel of PSAC tailored to database management systems (DBMSs). PSAC has beendesigned to also take into account role hierarchies that are often present in the accesscontrol models of current DBMSs. We have implemented PSAC in the PostgreSQL DBMS …,International Workshop on Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection,2010,6
Towards location-based access control in healthcare emergency response,Carmen Ruiz Vicente; Michael Kirkpatrick; Gabriel Ghinita; Elisa Bertino; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Recent advances in positioning and tracking technologies have led to theemergence of novel location-based applications that allow participants to access informationrelevant to their spatio-temporal context. Traditional access control models; such as role-based access control (RBAC); are not sufficient to address the new challenges introducedby these location-based applications. Several recent research efforts have enhanced RBACwith spatio-temporal features. Nevertheless; the state-of-the-art does not deal with mobility ofboth subjects and objects and does not support the utilization of complex access controldecisions based on spatio-temporal relationships among subjects and objects. Furthermore;such relationships change frequently in dynamic environments; requiring efficientmechanisms to monitor and re-evaluate access control decisions.

Exposing copy-paste-blur forgeries based on color coherence,Bo Wang; Xiangwei Kong; Bertino Elisa; Haiyan FU,Abstract—Exposing digital image forgeries is a major challenge for photographyauthentication and forensics investigation; which aims at proving the authenticity of digitalphotos. In this paper; we introduce a digital image forensics approach based on colorcoherence to exposing copy-paste-blur forgeries. We first discuss the inherent colorcoherence introduced by imaging pipeline; and then obtain several statistical features fromthe coherence characterization. Using the SVM classifier; we reveal traces of copy-paste-blur tampering in photographic forgeries. Experimental results indicate that the proposedmethod can effectively expose the copy-paste-blur forgeries and localize the tamperedregions with high accuracy.,Chinese Journal of Electronics,2009,6

Restricted authentication and encryption for cyber-physical systems,Michael S Kirkpatrick; Elisa Bertino; Frederick T Sheldon,Abstract Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are characterized by the close linkage ofcomputational resources and physical devices. These systems can be deployed in a numberof critical infrastructure settings. As a result; the security requirements of CPS are differentthan traditional computing architectures. For example; critical functions must be identifiedand isolated from interference by other functions. Similarly; lightweight schemes may berequired; as CPS can include devices with limited computing power. One approach thatoffers promise for CPS security is the use of lightweight; hardware-based authentication.Specifically; we consider the use of Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) to bind anaccess request to specific hardware with device-specific keys. PUFs are implemented inhardware; such as SRAM; and can be used to uniquely identify the device. This …,*,2009,6
Web services threats; vulnerabilities; and countermeasures,Elisa Bertino; Lorenzo D Martino; Federica Paci; Anna C Squicciarini,Abstract Securing a Web service requires us to protect; as far as possible; all of its basiccomponents; shown in Figure 3.1; and their interactions; along with the Web service lifecycle; from the design to the operational phase. This is a complex and difficult task; due tothe vulnerabilities which each software component may have; the large number of attacksthat can eventually exploit the vulnerabilities of a specific component; and to the interactionsbetween the components themselves. It requires us to combine and enhance methods;tools; and techniques for computers; networks; distributed systems; and application securityand adopt an engineered security process.

P-CDN: Extending access control capabilities of P2P systems to provide CDN services,Fatih Turkmen; Pietro Mazzoleni; Bruno Crispo; Elisa Bertino,New important emerging business paradigms; such as “service virtualization” can be madeeasy and convenient by the use of P2P systems. In these paradigms; often the owners of theservices are different (and independent) from the owners of the resources used to offer suchservices. In comparison to centralized servers; P2P systems can conveniently offer higheravailability and more bandwidth as they harness the computing and network resources ofthousands of hosts in a decentralized fashion. Despite these useful features and theirsuccess in the research community; P2P systems are still not very popular in the businessworld. The main reason for such a skepticism is their lack of proper security.,Computers and Communications; 2008. ISCC 2008. IEEE Symposium on,2008,6
Semantics-aware obfuscation for location privacy,Maria Luisa Damiani; Claudio Silvestri; Elisa Bertino,Abstract The increasing availability of personal location data pushed by the widespread useof location-sensing technologies raises concerns with respect to the safeguard of locationprivacy. To address such concerns location privacy-preserving techniques are beinginvestigated. An important area of application for such techniques is represented byLocation Based Services (LBS). Many privacy-preserving techniques designed for LBS arebased on the idea of forwarding to the LBS provider obfuscated locations; namely positioninformation at low spatial resolution; in place of actual userspositions. Obfuscationtechniques are generally based on the use of geometric methods. In this paper; we arguethat such methods can lead to the disclosure of sensitive location information and thus toprivacy leaks. We thus propose a novel method which takes into account the semantic …,Journal of Computing Science and Engineering,2008,6

Purpose based access control for privacy protection in database systems,Elisa Bertino,Abstract The development of privacy-preserving data management techniques has been thefocus of intense research in the last few years. Such research has resulted in importantnotions and techniques; such as the notions of Hippocratic database systems and k-anonymity; and various privacy-preserving data mining techniques. However; much workstill needs to be carried out to develop high assurance privacy-preserving databasemanagement systems. An important requirement in the development of such systems is theneed of providing comprehensive and accurate privacy-related metadata; such as datausage purposes. Such metadata represent the core of access control mechanismsspecifically tailored towards privacy. In this talk we address such issue.

Evolution specification of multigranular temporal objects,Elena Camossi; Elisa Bertino; Giovanna Guerrini; Marco Mesiti,The main key feature of temporal databases is to maintain all values taken by objectattributes over time. Since historical information may be needed at different levels of detail;multigranular temporal databases have been introduced; in which different attributes can bestored at different temporal granularities. An important issue that has not been addressed;however is that the required level of detail does not only depend on attribute semantics;rather it is often related to how recent the data are. It is quite natural that recent data areneeded at greater level of detail; whereas less detail is needed as data age. As an extremecase; data can also expire; that is; they are no longer needed after a certain period of time. Inthis paper we address the problem of evolution and expiration of historical data in amultigranular temporal object model.,Temporal Representation and Reasoning; 2002. TIME 2002. Proceedings.

Triggers in Java-based Databases,Elisa Bertino; Giovanna Guerrini; Isabella Merlo,ABSTRACT. JavaÌÅ is recently establishing itself as a very successful programminglanguage; and it is more and more widely used also in applications requiring persistencesupport and database technology. It has not; however; been conceived as a databaseprogramming language. One of the main limitations of Java with respect to the maturerelational database technology is the lack of integrity constraint support. An importantfunctionality supported by many of the most recent relational and object-relational databasesystems is represented by triggers; that enhance the database with reactive capabilities andwhich can be used to support integrity constraints.

A semantic based redesigning of distributed workflows,Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Wei-Kuang Huang; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Workflow management systems (WFMS) support the modeling and coordinatedexecution of processes within an organization. To coordinate the execution of the variousactivities (or tasks) in a workflow; task dependencies are specified among them. Often; theworkflow application domains are such that the workflow is a long-running activity and thevarious tasks that constitute the workflow need to be executed by systems that aredistributed and autonomous in nature; possibly owned by different organizations. In such anenvironment; it is desirable to minimize the number of communications among thedistributed sites and minimize the number of tasks that need to wait for their execution forthose at other sites. In this paper; we propose an approach that can automatically redesign aworkflow in such a way that the interference among sites is minimized.

Deadlock detection in the face of transaction and data dependencies,Elisa Bertino; Giovanni Chiola; Luigi V Mancini,Abstract Deadlock detection; which is fairly well-understood for the traditional transactionmodel used for concurrency control to databases; needs to be revisited when dealing withadvanced transaction models. This is because a transaction in these models is organized asa collection of tasks; specific decisions (such as commit or abort) about a task may be basedon the outcome or status of other tasks in the same transaction. Although this gives flexibilityto the application programmer; a set of concurrent transactions may contain two types ofdependencies: data and transaction dependencies. Commit and abort dependenciesspecifying constraints on transaction termination order are well-known examples oftransaction dependencies. Data dependencies arise when transactions concurrently accesscommon data items under conflicting modes. In this paper; we show that in the face of …,International Conference on Application and Theory of Petri Nets,1998,6

Both pure object-oriented DBMS (OODBMSs) and object-relational DBMS (ORDBMSs) have been developedbased on object-oriented concepts. Object-relational DBMS; in particular; extend the SQLlanguage by incorporating all the concepts of the object-oriented data model. A largenumber of products for both categories of DBMS is today available. In particular; all majorvendors of relational DBMSs are turning their products into ORDBMSs [Nori; 1996].,*,1997,6

Providing different degrees of recency options to transactions in multilevel secure databases,Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Elisa Bertino; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract Although several secure multiversion concurrency protocols have been proposedby researchers; only two protocols produce histories that are one-copy serializable—oneproposed by Keefe and Tsai and the other by Jajodia and Atluri. However; neither of theseare completely satisfactory. Keefe and Tsai protocol sacrifices recency for correctness byproviding a high transaction with very old versions of low data. Jajodia and Atluri protocol;on the other hand; sacrifices performance for correctness by making high transactions thatread low data wait before they can commit. The first contribution of this paper is to providedifferent recency options to transactions; where each transaction can receive data with adesired degree of recency. These options are provided without sacrificing one-copyserializability. In fact; we propose four types of degrees of recency and present protocols …,*,1996,6
Generalized relational algebra: Modeling spatial queries in constraint databases,Alberto Belussi; Elisa Bertino; Michela Bertolotto; Barbara Catania,Abstract The introduction of constraints in database languages is an appealing direction. Inthis paper we present a model for constraint databases; derived from the one proposed in[13]; and a family of generalized relational algebra languages; derived from the languageproposed in [12] and in [19]. Each language of the family is obtained by specifying a certainlogical theory for constraints and a particular application domain; by means of a set offunctions. We then analyze the issues concerning spatial data modeling in the proposedconstraint data model and the application of the proposed language to model spatialqueries. Indeed; constraint databases offer a powerful formalism to express sets of pointsembedded in n-dimensional spaces.,ESPRIT WG CONTESSA Workshop on Constraint Databases and Applications,1995,6

This paper proposes an approach to evaluate DQin multichannel sensor networks and systems with heterogeneous data sources. Theapproach integrates various DQ indicators ranging from traditional data accuracy metrics tonetwork security and business performance measures. It demonstrates the advantage ofincluding security metrics into the DQ evaluation for the design optimization of data fusionprocedures and even the whole data collection and communication systems. The DQmetrics composition and calculus are discussed. However; the major attention is paid to theanalysis of the relationship between conventional data accuracy metrics and networksecurity indicators.,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGSAC conference on Computer & communications security,2013,5

Hence; most of the desiredfunctionalities of the DBMS are lost; eg; consistency; recoverability; and efficient querying. Inthis paper; we address the challenges involved in enforcing the data privacy inside theDBMS. We implement the k-anonymity algorithm as a relational operator that interacts withother query operators to apply the privacy requirements while querying the data.

Beyond k-anonymity: A decision theoretic framework for assessing privacy risk,Guy Lebanon; Monica Scannapieco; Mohamed Fouad; Elisa Bertino,Abstract An important issue any organization or individual has to face when managing datacontaining sensitive information; is the risk that can be incurred when releasing such data.Even though data may be sanitized before being released; it is still possible for an adversaryto reconstruct the original data using additional information thus resulting in privacyviolations. To date; however; a systematic approach to quantify such risks is not available. Inthis paper we develop a framework; based on statistical decision theory; that assesses therelationship between the disclosed data and the resulting privacy risk. We model theproblem of deciding which data to disclose; in terms of deciding which disclosure rule toapply to a database. We assess the privacy risk by taking into account both the entityidentification and the sensitivity of the disclosed information. Furthermore; we prove that …,Transactions on Data Privacy,2009,5

In large-scale distributed collaborative applications like webservices; there is need for analyzing policy interaction and performing policy integration. Inthis demonstration; we present EXAM; a comprehensive environment for policy analysis andmanagement; which can be used to perform a variety of functions such as policy propertyanalyses; policy similarity analysis; policy integration. Our work focuses on analysis ofaccess control policies written in XACML (Extensible Access Control Markup Language).

Policy languages for digital identity management in federation systems,Elisa Bertino; Abhilasha Bhargav-Spantzel; Anna Cinzia Squicciarini,The goal of service provider federations is to support a controlled method by whichdistributed organizations can provide services to qualified individuals and manage theiridentity attributes at an inter-organizational level. In order to make access control decisionsthe history of activities should be accounted for; therefore it is necessary to recordinformation on interactions among the federation entities. To achieve these goals wepropose a comprehensive assertion language able to support description of static anddynamic properties of the federation system. The assertions are a powerful means todescribe the behavior of the entities interacting in the federation; and to define policiescontrolling access to services and privacy policies. We also propose a log-based approachfor capturing the history of activities within the federation implemented as a set of tables …,Policies for Distributed Systems and Networks; 2006. Policy 2006.

A semantic approach to build personalized interfaces in the cultural heritage domain,Stefano Valtolina; Pietro Mazzoleni; Stefano Franzoni; Elisa Bertino,Abstract In this paper we present a system we have built to disseminate cultural heritagedistributed across multiple museums. Our system addresses the requirements of twocategories of users: the end users that need to access information according to theirinterests and interaction preferences; and the domain experts and museum curators thatneed to develop thematic tours providing end users with a better understanding of the singleartefact or collection. In our approach we make use of a semantic representation of the givenheritage domain in order to build multiple visual interfaces; called" Virtual Wings"(VWs).Such interfaces allow users to navigate through data available from digital archives andthematic tours and to create their own personalized virtual visits.

Structural similarity measures in sources of XML documents,Giovanna Guerrini; Marco Mesiti; Elisa Bertino,Abstract This chapter discusses existing approaches to evaluate and measure structuralsimilarity in sources of XML documents. A relevant peculiarity of XML documents; indeed; isthat information on the document structure is available in the document itself. In the chapterwe present different approaches aiming at evaluating structural similarity at three differentlevels: among documents; between a document and a schema; and among schemas. Themost relevant applications of such measures are for document classification and schemaextraction; and for document and schema structural clustering; though other interestingapplications such as document change detection and structural querying can be devised;and will be discussed throughout the chapter.,Processing and Managing Complex Data for Decision Support,2006,5
Anonymity preserving techniques in trust negotiations,Indrakshi Ray; Elisa Bertino; Anna C Squicciarini; Elena Ferrari,Abstract Trust negotiation between two subjects require each one proving its properties tothe other. Each subject specifies disclosure policies stating the types of credentials andattributes the counterpart has to provide to obtain a given resource. The counterpart; inresponse; provides a disclosure set containing the necessary credentials and attributes. Ifthe counterpart wants to remain anonymous; its disclosure sets should not contain identityrevealing information. In this paper; we propose anonymization techniques using which asubject can transform its disclosure set into an anonymous one. Anonymization transforms adisclosure set into an alternative anonymous one whose information content is different fromthe original one. This alternative disclosure set may no longer satisfy the original disclosurepolicy causing the trust negotiation to fail. To address this problem; we propose that trust …,International Workshop on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,2005,5

An XML-based approach to document flow verification,Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Giovanni Mella,Abstract The paper proposes an XML-based approach for a controlled distribution ofdocuments; that must be subject to distributed and collaborative updates. In particular; theapproach we propose allows one to attach a flow policy to a document; that partially ortotally specifies the list of subjects that have to receive the document. Flow policiesassociated with documents can be dynamically changed during document transmission.Such modifications are regulated by a set of modification control rules; specified accordingto a model that we present in this paper. A key feature of the proposed solution is that asubject; upon receiving a document can also locally verify the correctness of the path and ofthe modification operations possibly performed over it; without interacting with other parties.In the paper; besides presenting the language to specify flow policies and modification …,International Conference on Information Security,2004,5

A database approach to quality of service specification in video databases,Elisa Bertino; Ahmed K Elmagarmid; Mohand-Saïd Hacid,Abstract Quality of Service (QoS) is defined as a set of perceivable attributes expressed in auser-friendly language with parameters that may be subjective or objective. Objectiveparameters are those related to a particular service and are measurable and verifiable.Subjective parameters are those based on the opinions of the end-users. We believe thatquality of service should become an integral part of multimedia database systems and usersshould be able to query by requiring a quality of service from the system. The specificationand enforcement of QoS presents an interesting challenge in multimedia systemsdevelopment. A deal of effort has been done on QoS specification and control at the systemand the network levels; but less work has been done at the application/user level. In thispaper; we propose a language; in the style of constraint database languages; for formal …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2003,5
St ODMG: A Multigranular Spatiotemporal Extension of ODMG Model,Elena Camossi; Michela Bertolotto; Elisa Bertino; Giovanna Guerrini,Abstract A large percentage of data managed by a variety of application domains hasspatiotemporal characteristics. Unfortunately; traditional geographical information systemsdo not allow to easily represent temporal aspects of spatial data. Moreover; they do notusually support the representation of data at multiple levels of detail. In this paper wepresent a multigranular spatiotemporal data model; that extends the ODMG model withmultiple spatial and temporal granularities. In particular; the model allows for a uniformmanagement of two kinds of spatiotemporal objects: moving entities (eg; cars; planes; etc.)and temporal maps (ie; maps representing the change over time of a given geographicarea). It also provides a framework for mapping the movement of an entity such as a car ontoan underlying geographic area. The model we propose relies on a standard definition of …,*,2003,5
Hierarchical data placement for navigational multimedia applications,Athena Vakali; Evimaria Terzi; Elisa Bertino; Ahmed Elmagarmid,Abstract Navigation has added interactivity in nowadays multimedia applications whichsupport effective accessing to objects of various formats and presentation requirements.Storage issues need to be reconsidered for the new type of navigational multimediaapplications; in order to improve system's performance. This paper addresses the problem ofmultimedia data storage towards improving data accessibility and request servicing undernavigational applications. A navigational graph-based model (for the multimedia datarepresentation) is proposed to guide the data placement under a hierarchical storagetopology. The multimedia data dependencies; access frequencies and timing constraints areused to characterize the graph nodes which correspond to multimedia objects allocated atthe tertiary storage level.

A structural similarity measure for XML documents: theory and applications,Marco Mesiti,Abstract XML (eXtendible Markup Language) has recently emerged as the most relevantstandardization effort in the area of markup languages; and it is increasingly used as thelanguage for information representation and exchange over the Web. An important feature ofXML is that information on document structures is available on the Web together with thedocument contents. This information can be exploited to improve document handling andquery processing. At the same time; XML databases on the Web are proliferating. Thepossibility of associating a kind of schema (either a DTD; an XML schema or others); allowsone to take advantage of the knowledge about document structures for storing; querying;protecting and indexing a set of documents. An important feature that should be guaranteedis the possibility of exchanging information among XML databases on the Web in order to …,*,2002,5
Trbac: A temporal role-based access control model,James BD Joshi; Elisa Bertino; Usman Latif; Arif Ghafoor,Abstract A temporal RBAC (TRBAC) model has recently been proposed that addresses thetemporal aspects of roles and trigger-based role enabling. However; it is limited toconstraints on enabling of roles only. We propose a Generalized Temporal Role BasedAccess Control model (GTRBAC) that is capable of expressing a wider range of temporalconstraints. GTRBAC is capable of expressing periodic as well as duration constraints onroles; user-role assignments and role-permission assignments. In GTRBAC; temporalconstraints on role enablings and role activations can be separately specified. A user-activated role can further be restricted to various activation constraints such as cardinalityconstraint or maximum active duration constraint within a specified interval. The GTRBACmodel extends the synta ctic structure of TRBAC model and its event and trigger …,ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC,2001,5
Indexing constraint databases by using a dual representation,Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania; Boris Chidlovskii,Linear constraint databases are a powerful framework to model spatial and temporal data.The use of constraint databases should be supported by access data structures that makeeffective use of secondary storage and reduce query processing time. Such structuresshould be able to store both finite and infinite objects and perform both containment (ALL)and intersection (EXIST) queries. As standard indexing techniques have certain limitationsin satisfying such requirements; we employ the concept of geometric duality for designingnew indexing techniques. In (Bertino et al.; 1997) we have used the dual transformation forpolyhedra to develop a dynamic optimal indexing solution based on B/sup+/-trees; to detectall objects contained in or intersecting a given half-plane; when the angular coefficientbelongs to a predefined set. We extend the previous solution to allow angular coefficients …,Data Engineering; 1999. Proceedings.; 15th International Conference on,1999,5
On Using Materialization Strategies for a Temporal Authorization Model.,Elena Ferrari; Elisa Bertino; Claudio Bettini; Alberto Motta; Pierangela Samarati,In this paper we show how materialization strategies can be successfully used for increasingthe e ciency of access control in a temporal authorization model [BBFS96a]. The temporalauthorization model allows to specify both temporal authorizations; that is; authorizationswith an interval of validity; and derivation rules; allowing new authorizations to be derived onthe basis of the presence or absence of other authorizations. These functionalities highlyincrease the expressive power of the model. However; they make the access control less ecient; as it may require the evaluation of several rules. For this reason an approach basedon materialization strategies has been adopted. Preliminary results on its performance areillustrated in this paper.

Research issues in authorization models for hypertext systems,Elisa Bertino; Pierangela Samarati,The proper characteristics of hypertext systems; such as absence of a schema; connectionsamong the different" chunks" of information; and the possibility of navigating in the hypertext;make conventional authorization models inadequate for their protection. Thesecharacteristics on the one hand raise new protection requirements; thus making the problemof protection much harder; while on the other hand; they provide a flexibility in thespecification of authorizations which is greater than in more structured data models. We arecurrently working on an authorization model for the protection of information in distributedhypertext systems. In this paper; we illustrate the new requirements that arise and discusssome of the issues we are currently investigating.,New Security Paradigms Workshop; 1995. Proceedings,1995,5
Generic Methods in Deductive Object Databases,Elisa Bertino; Giovanna Guerrini; Danilo Montesi,Abstract Deductive objects have been introduced in [3] to support declarative objectspecification in the database context taking advantage of the large body of results onDatalog-like language. However; the rigidity of logical languages does not reflect the flexibleprogramming style of object-oriented systems. For instance the application of the samemethod to different objects. In this paper we propose an extension based on variable labelsthat allow to express generic methods through rules. The semantics of this approach is stillbased on fixpoint computation.,*,1995,5

CLP (AD) can be seen as an extensionof Datalog with base relations updates and the notion of transaction. The semantics of thislanguage is given in two steps and is based on a notion of observable corresponding to thecomputed answer constraint.

Many apps;however; reveal sensitive user information such as location; movements; and habits1 and/orspread malware. 2 Network anonymization techniques alone don't ensure privacy becausethe OS together with the invoked mobile apps might still release information that reidentifiesusers or devices. Even when users are careful not to provide identifying data to smartphoneapps over anonymous connections; the apps can leak such information without userknowledge. Thus; we must devise accurate methods of checking apps for the presence ofmalware and spyware. Although third-party application markets exist; most users downloadapps from well-known markets such as Google Play; Amazon Appstore; iTunes App Store;and Windows Store.

Privacy-preserving protocols for shortest path discovery over outsourced encrypted graph data,Bharath K Samanthula; Fang-Yu Rao; Elisa Bertino; Xun Yi,Outsourcing data and computation to the cloud is increasingly common. However; the datato be outsourced is often privacy-sensitive (eg; geospatial data; social network data; andInternet network traffic data) and thus it is typically outsourced after being properlyencrypted. Graph is one of the most common ways to model and represent the data in manyapplications; including geospatial data in geographic information systems. In this paper; weconsider the following problem: given a graph G; representing for example road or socialnetworks; outsourced to a cloud in encrypted format; the user wants to privately retrieve fromG the shortest path from a source s to a destination t.

Secure and resilient proximity-based access control,Sunoh Choi; Christopher Gutierrez; Hyo-Sang Lim; Saurabh Bagchi; Elisa Bertino,Abstract The ubiquity of mobile devices has increased the convenience of communicationbut it has also introduced personal privacy concerns. In the domain of portable medicalrecords; it is vital to provide authentication which protects personal information fromunauthorized users who are located out of legitimate regions. To support such location-based authentication; one possible approach in medical systems is exploiting distance-bounding protocols which allow detecting a user's current location to determine whether theuser is in trusted physical locations such as a doctor's office. However; sensors that enabledistance-bounding protocols are expensive and not widely deployed yet since the requiredprotocols typically need special devices such as devices utilizing ultrasound.

Adaptive data management for self-protecting objects in cloud computing systems,Anna Cinzia Squicciarini; Giuseppe Petracca; Elisa Bertino,While Cloud data services are a growing successful business and computing paradigm;data privacy and security are major concerns. One critical problem is to ensure that dataowners' policies are honored; regardless of where the data is physically stored and howoften it is accessed; and modified. This scenario calls for an important requirement to besatisfied. Data should be managed in accordance to owners' preferences; Cloud providersservice agreements; and the local regulations that may apply. In this work we proposeinnovative policy enforcement techniques for adaptive sharing of users' outsourced data. Weintroduce the notion of autonomous security-aware objects; that by means of object-orientedprogramming techniques; encapsulate sensitive resources and assure their protection.

Profile-based selection of accountability policies in grid computing systems,Wonjun Lee; Anna C Squicciarini; Elisa Bertino,Accountability in grid computing systems is an important requirement; in that it makes itpossible to control activities of users and resource providers through the collection andanalysis of accountability data. The accountability policies specify what to collect and when;and more importantly how to coordinate the data collection among different administrativedomains. If elements of the data to be sent from a node to another are missing or differentfrom the ones required by the policy due to the insufficient capabilities of the node to collectdata; conflicts--inability to comply-may occur. To solve such conflicts and yet obtain flexibleaccountability processes; we propose a profile-based policy selection mechanism. We showhow by this mechanism we can adapt the accountability policies according to the specificfeatures of jobs and nodes; while at the same time achieving a minimum level of …,Policies for Distributed Systems and Networks (POLICY); 2011 IEEE International Symposium on,2011,4
A selective encryption approach to fine-grained access control for P2P file sharing,Aditi Gupta; Salmin Sultana; Michael Kirkpatrick; Elisa Bertino,As the use of peer-to-peer (P2P) services for distributed file sharing has grown; the need forfine-grained access control (FGAC) has emerged. Existing access control frameworks usean all-or-nothing approach that is inadequate for sensitive content that may be shared bymultiple users. In this paper; we propose a FGAC mechanism based on selective encryptiontechniques. Using this approach; the owner of a file specifies access control policies overvarious byte ranges in the file. The separate byte ranges are then encrypted and signed withdifferent keys. Users of the file only receive the encryption keys for the ranges they areauthorized to read and signing keys for the ranges they are authorized to write. We alsopropose an optional enhancement of the scheme where a file owner can hide location of thefile. Our approach includes a key distribution scheme based on a public key infrastructure …,Collaborative Computing: Networking; Applications and Worksharing (CollaborateCom); 2010 6th International Conference on,2010,4

Privacy-preserving techniques for location-based services,Elisa Bertino,Abstract Recent advances in positioning techniques; small devices; GIS-based services; andubiquitous connectivity; have enabled a large variety of location-based services able to tailorservices according to the location of the individual requiring the service. Locationinformation; however; if on one side is critical for providing customized services; on the otherhand; if misused; can lead to privacy breaches. By cross-referencing location informationabout an individual with other information and by exploiting domain knowledge; an attackermay infer sensitive information about the individual; such as healthcare or financialinformation. To address such problems; different techniques have been proposed that arebased on two main approaches: location cloaking; under which a suitable large region isreturned to the service provider instead of the precise user location [1]; location k …,SIGSPATIAL Special,2009,4

In this paper we address such problem byproposing an approach to manage user identity attributes by assuring their privacy-preserving usage. The approach is based on the concept of privacy preserving multi-factorauthentication achieved by a new cryptographic primitive which uses aggregate signatureson commitments that are then used for aggregate zero-knowledge proof of knowledge(ZKPK) protocols.

Trust negotiations with customizable anonymity,Anna Cinzia Squicciarini; Abhilasha Barghav-Spantzel; Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract Trust negotiation makes it possible for two parties to carry on secure transactions byfirst establishing trust through a bilateral; iterative process of requesting and disclosingdigital credentials and policies. Credentials; exchanged during trust negotiations; oftencontain sensitive attributes that attest to the properties of the credential owner. Uncontrolleddisclosure of such sensitive attributes may cause grave damage to the credential owner.Research has shown that disclosing non-sensitive attributes only can cause identity to berevealed as well. Consequently; we impose a stronger requirement: our negotiations shouldhave the k-anonymity property--the set of credentials submitted by a subject during anegotiation should be equal to k other such sets received by the counterpart during earliernegotiations. In this paper we propose a protocol that ensures k-anonymity. Our protocol …,Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE/WIC/ACM international conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology,2006,4

Web content filtering,Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Andrea Perego,Abstract The need to filter online information in order to protect users from possible harmfulcontent can be considered as one of the most compelling social issues derived from thetransformation of the Web into a public information space. Despite that Web rating andfiltering systems have been developed and made publicly available quite early; no effectiveapproach has been established so far; due to the inadequacy of the proposed solutions.Web filtering is then a challenging research area; needing the definition and enforcement ofnew strategies; considering both the current limitations and the future developments of Webtechnologies—in particular; the upcoming Semantic Web. In this chapter; we provide anoverview of how Web filtering issues have been addressed by the available systems;bringing in relief both their advantages and shortcomings; and outlining future trends.

User Preferences VS Minimality in PPDL.,Elisa Bertino; Alessandra Mileo; Alessandro Provetti,Abstract In the context of Network management; Chomicki et al. defined the specificationlanguage PDL (Policy Description Language) and later extended it by introducing monitors:constraints on the actions that the network manager cannot execute simultaneously. Wehave furtherly extended PDL by permitting specifying user preferences on how to enforceconstraints; that extension is called PPDL and it is based on Brewka's ordered disjunctionconnective. In this article we speculate on how the minimality requirement; stating thatconstraints on actions should affect action execution as little as possible; can be specifiedand implemented in PPDL theories. Minimal interference and maximal satisfaction of userpreferences are not always achievable and tend to interact in complex ways.,APPIA-GULP-PRODE,2003,4

Static analysis of logical languages with deferred update semantics,Barbara Catania; Elisa Bertino,Static analysis of declarative languages deals with the detection; at compile time; of programproperties that can be used to better understand the program semantics and to improve theefficiency of program evaluation. In logical update languages; an interesting problem is thedetection of conflicting updates; inserting and deleting the same fact; for transactions basedon set-oriented updates and active rules. In this paper; we investigate this topic in thecontext of the U-Datalog language; a set-oriented update language for deductive databases;based on a deferred semantics. We first formally define relevant properties of U-Datalogprograms; mainly related to update conflicts. Then; we prove that the defined properties aredecidable and we propose an algorithm to detect such conditions. Finally; we show how theproposed techniques can be applied to other logical update languages. Our results are …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2003,4
Issues on modelling spatial granularity,Elena Camossi; Michela Bertolotto; Elisa Bertino; Giovanna Guerrini,Abstract The formalization of the spatial granularity concept is a topic that has recentlyreceived a growing interest; but none of the proposals presented so far has beenacknowledged by the spatial community as a reference definition. This is becausedeveloping such a formalization entails addressing a large number of issues; due to theintrinsic characteristics of spatial information. In this paper we discuss some of these issues;and we propose a formal definition of spatial granularity that addresses most of them. Ourdefinition supports the representation of spatial entities at multiple granularities by applyingmodel oriented map generalization principles. In particular; we consider a set ofgeneralization operators that guarantee topological consistency and their inverse functions;for performing; respectively; the conversions to coarser and to finer granularities. 1,in Workshop on fundamental issues in spatial and geographic ontologies,2003,4

Fuzzy and presentation algebras for web and multimedia data,Elisa Bertino; Danilo Montesi; Alberto Trombetta,Web and multimedia data are becoming very important. A fundamental characteristic ofthese data is imprecision. Query languages for web and multimedia data must expressimprecision in features matching; similarity queries and user preferences. In addition specificoperators need to be introduced to organize the answers in a user friendly style. The aim ofthis work is to provide a formal framework in which to formulate very powerful queries andpresentations of the answers. To this end; a fuzzy algebra and a presentation algebra areintroduced. The fuzzy algebra extends the classical relational algebra over fuzzy relations.Both algebras allow user preferences in the form of weights to be attached to predicates andoperators. The effect of this weights is to alter the classic behaviour of query expressions tobetter suite user requirements. In addition; optimization issues are presented in the form …,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2000 International,2000,4

Introducing external functions in constraint query languages,Barbara Catania; Alberto Belussi; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Constraint databases use constraints to model and query data. In particular;constraints allow a finite representation of infinite sets of relational tuples (also calledgeneralized tuples). The choice of different logical theories to express constraints insiderelational languages leads to the definition of constraint languages with different expressivepower. Practical constraint database languages typically use linear constraints. This choiceallows the use of efficient algorithms but; at the same time; some useful queries; needed bythe considered application; may not be represented inside the resulting languages (forexample; the convex hull cannot be computed [19]). These additional queries can only bemodeled by changing the theory (thus; loosing the advantages of the linear theory); orextending the language; or using external functions.

An Approach to Integrate Multimedi Data in a Knowledge Representation System.,Elisa Bertino; Maria Damiani; Paolo Randi,Abstract This paper describes an approach to integrate multimedia data in the framework ofan advanced information management system based on knowledge representationtechniques. The guidelines of the approach are based on using a powerful data model toprovide conceptual descriptions of multimedia data; and on providing a multimedia objectmanager supporting all functionalities related to the physical organization. The multimediaobject manager has been designed following an object-oriented approach. The mainadvantage is to provide extensibility; thus allowing new types of media to dynamically addedto the system.,Advanced Visual Interfaces,1992,4
Query processing based on complex object types,Elisa Bertino; Fausto Rabitti,ABSTRACT In applscatwn areas where the data management system has to deal with alarge number of complex data objects with a wide variety of types; the system must be ableto process queries containing both conditions on the schema of the data objects and on thevalues of the data objects. In this paper we will focus on a particular phase in queryprocessing on a data base of complex objects called Type-Level Query Processing. In thisphase; the query is analyzed; completed; and transformed on the basis of the the definitionsof the complex object types. We will present; in particular; the techniques used in theESPRIT project MULTOS. In this project; a data server has been implemented in which dataobjects are constituted by multimedia documents with complex internal structures.,IEEE Database Eng. Bull.,1986,4

Real-time digital signatures for time-critical networks,Attila Altay Yavuz; Anand Mudgerikar; Ankush Singla; Ioannis Papapanagiotou; Elisa Bertino,The secure and efficient operation of time-critical networks; such as vehicular networks;smart-grid; and other smart-infrastructures; is of primary importance in today's society. It iscrucial to minimize the impact of security mechanisms over such networks so that the safeand reliable operations of time-critical systems are not being interfered. For instance; if thedelay introduced by the crypto operations negatively affects the time available for braking acar before a collision; the car may not be able to safely stop in time. In particular; as aprimary authentication mechanism; existing digital signatures introduce a significantcomputation and communication overhead; and therefore are unable to fully meet the real-time processing requirements of such time-critical networks.

Privacy preserving user-based recommender system,Shahriar Badsha; Xun Yi; Ibrahim Khalil; Elisa Bertino,With the rapid development of the social networks; Collaborative Filtering (CF)-basedrecommender systems have been increasingly prevalent and become widely accepted byusers. The CF-based techniques generate recommendations by collecting privacy sensitivedata from users. Usually; the users are sensitive to disclosure of personal information and;consequently; there are unavoidable security concerns since private information can beeasily misused by malicious third parties. In order to protect against breaches of personalinformation; it is necessary to obfuscate user information by means of an efficient encryptiontechnique while simultaneously generating the recommendation by making true informationinaccessible to service providers. Therefore; we propose a privacy preserving user-basedCF technique based on homomorphic encryption; which is capable of determining …,Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS); 2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on,2017,3
A System for Profiling and Monitoring Database Access Patterns by Application Programs for Anomaly Detection,Lorenzo Bossi; Elisa Bertino; Syed Rafiul Hussain,Database Management Systems (DBMSs) provide access control mechanisms that allowdatabase administrators (DBAs) to grant application programs access privileges todatabases. Though such mechanisms are powerful; in practice finer-grained access controlmechanism tailored to the semantics of the data stored in the DMBS is required as a firstclass defense mechanism against smart attackers. Hence; custom written applications whichaccess databases implement an additional layer of access control. Therefore; securing adatabase alone is not enough for such applications; as attackers aiming at stealing data cantake advantage of vulnerabilities in the privileged applications and make these applicationsto issue malicious database queries.

Memory Safety for Embedded Devices with nesCheck,Daniele Midi; Mathias Payer; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Applications for TinyOS; a popular operating system for embedded systems andwireless sensor networks; are written in nesC; a C dialect prone to the same type andmemory safety vulnerabilities as C. While availability and integrity are critical requirements;the distributed and concurrent nature of such applications; combined with the intrinsicunsafety of the language; makes those security goals hard to achieve. Traditional memorysafety techniques cannot be applied; due to the strict platform constraints and hardwaredifferences of embedded systems. We design nesCheck; an approach that combines staticanalysis and dynamic checking to automatically enforce memory safety on nesC programswithout requiring source modifications. nesCheck analyzes the source code; identifies theminimal conservative set of vulnerable pointers; finds static memory bugs; and …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2017,3
Provenance for wireless sensor networks: A survey,Changda Wang; Wenyi Zheng; Elisa Bertino,Abstract In wireless sensor networks (WSNs); provenance records the data source;forwarding; and aggregating information of data packets on their way to the base station.Provenance is critical for assessing the trustworthiness of the received data; diagnosingnetwork failures; detecting early signs of attacks; etc. However; because the provenancesize expands rapidly with the increase in packet transmission hops; the provenanceschemes developed for use in wired computer networks are not generally applicable toWSNs. Therefore; specific provenance techniques have been developed for WSNs that takeinto account the constrained resources of sensor nodes. In this paper; we survey suchtechniques. Special focus in the paper is devoted to a systematic and comprehensiveclassification of the solutions proposed in the literature. We review each solution by …,Data Science and Engineering,2016,3
Practical privacy-preserving user profile matching in social networks,Xun Yi; Elisa Bertino; Fang-Yu Rao; Athman Bouguettaya,In this paper; we consider a scenario where a user queries a user profile database;maintained by a social networking service provider; to find out some users whose profilesare similar to the profile specified by the querying user. A typical example of this applicationis online dating. Most recently; an online data site; Ashley Madison; was hacked; whichresults in disclosure of a large number of dating user profiles. This serious data breach hasurged researchers to explore practical privacy protection for user profiles in online dating. Inthis paper; we give a privacy-preserving solution for user profile matching in social networksby using multiple servers. Our solution is built on homomorphic encryption and allows a userto find out some matching users with the help of the multiple servers without revealing toanyone privacy of the query and the queried user profiles.

A collaborative reputation system based on credibility propagation in WSNs,Mohsen Rezvani; Aleksandar Ignjatovic; Elisa Bertino; Sanjay Jha,Trust and reputation systems are widely employed in WSNs to help decision makingprocesses by assessing trustworthiness of sensor nodes in a data aggregation process.However; in unattended and hostile environments; more sophisticated malicious attacks;such as collusion attacks; can distort the computed trust scores and lead to low quality ordeceptive service as well as undermine the aggregation results. In this paper we propose anovel; local; collaborative-based trust framework for WSNs that is based on the concept ofcredibility propagation which we introduce. In our approach; trustworthiness of a sensornode depends on the amount of credibility that such a node receives from other nodes. Inthe process we also obtain an estimates of sensors' variances which allows us to estimatethe true value of the signal using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation.

Distance-based trustworthiness assessment for sensors in wireless sensor networks,Jongho Won; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have been substituting for human senses tomake human lives better by monitoring the environment and providing intelligence.Collected sensor data are used to make decisions as a human does. Therefore; providingtrustworthy sensor data is crucial to make correct decisions. However; faulty sensors cangive incorrect information. In addition; since sensors are usually deployed in unattendedareas and can be compromised; cryptographic approaches are insufficient. To address thisproblem; we propose a distance-based trustworthiness assessment scheme. In our scheme;a centralized trust assessment module outputs an absolute trust score of each sensed valueand the trust score of each sensor. The trust scores of sensed values are calculated basedon the differences of sensed values provided by a sensor and its neighbors and the …,International Conference on Network and System Security,2015,3

Statistically-enhanced fine-grained diagnosis of packet losses,Daniele Midi; Antonio Tedeschi; Francesco Benedetto; Elisa Bertino,Packet losses are an important class of adverse events in Wireless Sensor Networks(WSNs); they can be caused by either a compromised or misbehaving node; or an attackfocused on the wireless links of the network. Understanding the underlying cause is criticalfor the deployment of effective response measures aimed at restoring the networkfunctionality. Shebaro et al.[9] proposed an initial approach for fine-grained analysis (FGA)of packet losses; and implemented and evaluated a tool based on it. Such approach profilesthe wireless links between the nodes using resident metrics; such as the received signalstrength indicator (RSSI) and the link quality indicator (LQI) for every packet; in order toachieve an accurate diagnosis of their root causes.

Privacy preserving biometrics-based and user centric authentication protocol,Hasini Gunasinghe; Elisa Bertino,Abstract We propose a privacy preserving biometrics-based authentication protocol bywhich users can authenticate to different service providers from their own devices withoutinvolving identity providers in the transactions. Authentication is performed through a zero-knowledge proof of knowledge protocol which is based on a cryptographic identity tokencreated using the unique; repeatable and revocable biometric identifier of the user and asecret provided by the user which enables two-factor authentication as well. Our approachfor generating biometric identifiers from the user's biometric image is based on the supportvector machine classification technique in conjunction with a mechanism for featureextraction from the biometric image. The paper includes experimental results on a dataset ofiris images and a security and privacy analysis of the protocol.,International Conference on Network and System Security,2014,3
Security of graph data: hashing schemes and definitions,Muhammad U Arshad; Ashish Kundu; Elisa Bertino; Krishna Madhavan; Arif Ghafoor,Abstract Use of graph-structured data models is on the rise-in graph databases; inrepresenting biological and healthcare data as well as geographical data. In order to securegraph-structured data; and develop cryptographically secure schemes for graph databases;it is essential to formally define and develop suitable collision resistant one-way hashingschemes and show them they are efficient.

Defending against insider threats and internal data leakage,Ilsun You; Gabriele Lenzini; Marek R Ogiela; Elisa Bertino,In the last decade; computer science researchers have been working hard to prevent attacksagainst the security of information systems. Different adversary models have incarnated themalicious entities against which researchers have defined security properties; identifiedsecurity vulnerabilities; and engineered security defenses. These adversaries were usuallyintruders; that is; outsiders trying to break into a system's defenses. However; securityreports clearly reveal that an increasing number of threats come presently from insiders.Insiders are legally authorized individuals who have; or used to have; access to corporateresources. Their illegal activities are not easily distinguishable from the uncommon but legalactivities executed by honest corporate users. To detect insiders' illegal activities is thereforehard; to recover after a security breach by an insider is expensive; and even though …,Security and Communication Networks,2012,3

Protecting information systems from insider threats-concepts and issues,Elisa Bertino,Summary form only given. Past research on information security has focused on protectingvaluable resources from attacks by outsiders. However; statistics show that a large amountof security and privacy breaches are due to insider attacks. Protection from insider threats ischallenging because insiders may have access to many sensitive resources and high-privileged system accounts. Suitable approaches need to combine several securitytechniques; like fine-grained access control; stronger authentication protocols; integrateddigital identity management; intrusion detection; with techniques from areas like informationintegration; machine learning; and risk assessment.

Based on conditional role; access permissions are assigned that represent whatcan be accessed for what purpose to roles under certain conditions. On the other hand;conditional purpose is applied along with allowed purpose and prohibited purpose in themodel. It allows users using some data for certain purpose with conditions (for instance;Tony agrees that his income information can be used for marketing purposes by removinghis name). The structure of a CPAC model is defined and investigated. Access purpose isverified in a dynamic behavior; based on user attributes; context attributes; and authorizationpolicies.

A similarity measure for comparing access control policies,PRATHIMA Rao; D Lin; RODOLFO Ferrini; ELISA Bertino; JORGE Lobo,Recent collaborative applications and enterprises very often need to efficiently integratetheir access control policies. An important step in policy integration is to analyze thesimilarity of policies. Existing approaches to policy similarity analysis are mainly based onlogical reasoning and Boolean function comparison. Such approaches are computationallyexpensive and do not scale well for large heterogeneous distributed environments (like Gridcomputing systems). In this paper; we propose a policy similarity measure as a filter phasefor policy similarity analysis. This measure provides a lightweight approach to pre-compile alarge amount of policies and only return the most similar policies for further evaluation. Inthis paper we formally define the measure by taking into account both the case of categoricalattributes and numeric attributes.

In this work; we introduce the Contextually Adaptive INsiderthreat architecture (CAIN); which incorporates contextual and risk-based access control withanomaly detection. While traditional Mandatory Access Control (MAC) can offer highassurance for information security; its rigid structure can hinder workers' productivity. Thegoal of CAIN is to balance these dual goals of data protection and flexible access. Thispaper outlines the design goals of CAIN; as well as the behavior of its components. We alsodescribe our initial design for building a prototype of our system and our future work.,*,2009,3
A federated digital identity management approach for business processes,Elisa Bertino; Rodolfo Ferrini; Andrea Musci; Federica Paci; Kevin J Steuer,Abstract Business processes have gained a lot of attention because of the pressing need forintegrating existing resources and services to better fulfill customer needs. A key feature ofbusiness processes is that they are built from composable services; referred to ascomponent services; that may belong to different domains. In such a context; flexible multi-domain identity management solutions are crucial for increased security and user-convenience. In particular; it is important that during the execution of a business process thecomponent services be able to verify the identity of the client to check that it has the requiredpermissions for accessing the services. To address the problem of multi-domain identitymanagement; we propose a multi-factor identity attribute verification protocol for businessprocesses that assures clients privacy and handles naming heterogeneity.,International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking; Applications and Worksharing,2008,3
Authorization Strategies for Virtualized Environments in Grid Computing Systems∗,Xinming Ou; Anna Squicciarini; Sebastien Goasguen; Elisa Bertino,Abstract The development of adequate security solutions; and in particular of authenticationand authorization techniques; for grid computing systems is a challenging task. Recenttrends of service oriented architectures (SOA); where users access grids through a sciencegateway—a web service that serves as a portal between users of a virtual organizations(VO) and the various computation resources; further complicate the authorization problem.Currently; the security component developed as part of the Globus Toolkit; the de factostandard for grid infrastructures; is not fully equiped with the capabilities to meet thosechallenges. The main drawback of the current approach is that it relies on a low level identity-based authorization scheme. A low-level access control policy maps a user's identity(distinguished name) to a local account. This approach does not scale and is hard to …,*,2006,3
of Proceedings: Advances in Database Technology-EDBT 2006: 10th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,Ralf Schenkel; Martin Theobald,Abstract/Description: Relevance Feedback is an important way to enhance retrieval qualityby integrating relevance information provided by a user. In XML retrieval; feedback enginesusually generate an expanded query from the content of elements marked as relevant ornonrelevant. This approach that is inspired by text-based IR completely ignores thesemistructured nature of XML. This paper makes the important step from content-based tostructural feedback. It presents an integrated solution for expanding keyword queries withnew content; path; and document constraints. An extensible framework evaluates suchquery conditions with existing keyword-based XML search engines while allowing to easilyintegrate new dimensions of feedback. Extensive experiments with the established INEXbenchmark show the feasibility of our approach.,*,2006,3
Integration of virtual reality and database system techniques,Elisa Bertino; Stefano Franzoni; Pietro Mazzoleni; Stefano Valtolina,Abstract In this paper we discuss issues concerning the development of interactive virtualreality (VR) environments. We argue that the integration of such type of environments withdatabase technology has the potential of providing on one side much flexibility and on theother hand of resulting in enhanced interfaces for accessing contents from digital archives.The paper also describes a project dealing with the dissemination of cultural heritagecontents. Within the project an integrated framework has been developed that enhancesconventional VR environments with database interactions.,International Workshop on Databases in Networked Information Systems,2005,3
A secure publishing protocol for virtual community contracts,Anna Cinzia Squicciarini; Federica Paci; Elisa Bertino,ABSTRACT The notion of Virtual Community (VC) is today an important paradigm to enabledynamic and large-scale collaboration activities over the Web. In many of those activities;security is an important key requirement that to date has not been widely investigated. In thispaper; we make a step towards addressing such problem. We focus on the issue of securepublishing of VC policies because policies represent a key component for any VC. Theirsecurity is thus crucial for the proper function of the VC. In the paper; after discussing themotivation for the proposed work; we develop protocols for secure publication of protocolsaddressing integrity and confidentiality of the policy publication process. Our protocols coverboth community policies and community member local policies. Our approach relies on theuse of a system specifically designed for secure and selective dissemination of XML …,Proceedings of Web Based Communities 2005 (IADIS),2005,3
A Policy Framework for Access Management in Federated Information Sharing,Rafae Bhatti; Elisa Bertino; Arif Ghafoor,Abstract Current mechanisms for distributed access management are limited in theircapabilities to provide federated information sharing while ensuring adequate levels ofresource protection.

Vision paper: Micro-views; or on how to protect privacy while enhancing data usability,Ji-Won Byun; Elisa Bertino,ABSTRACT The large availability of repositories storing various types of information aboutindividuals has raised serious privacy concerns over the last ten years. Yet databasetechnology is far from providing adequate solutions to this problem that requires a delicatebalance between individual's privacy and convenience and data usability by enterprises andorganizations-a database which is rigid and over-protective may render data of little value.Though those goals may seem odd; we claim that the development of solutions able toreconcile them will be an important challenge to be addressed in the next few years. Webelieve that the next-wave of database technology will be represented by DBMS providinghigh-assurance privacy and security. In this paper; we elaborate on such challenges. Inparticular; we claim that we need to provide different views of data at a very fine level of …,in SIGMOD Record,2005,3
Distributed and cooperative updates of xml documents,Giovanni Mella,The Internet has made possible a wide spectrum of distributed cooperative applications inseveral areas; such as collaborative e-commerce [28]; distance learning; telemedicine; e-government. A requirement common to many cooperative application environments is theneed for secure document exchange. By secure exchange we mean that documentconfidentiality and integrity are ensured when documents flow among different parties withinan organization or within different organizations. Ensuring document confidentiality meansthat document contents can only be disclosed to subjects authorized according to accesscontrol policies agreed upon by the various parties. Ensuring document integrity means thatthe document contents must be correct with respect to a given application domain and thatthe document contents may be modified only by authorized subjects. It is a common case …,*,2004,3
A logical approach to quality of service specification in video databases,Elisa Bertino; Ahmed K Elmagarmid; Mohand-Said Hacid,Abstract Quality of Service (QoS) is defined as a set of perceivable attributes expressed in auser-friendly language with parameters that may be objective or subjective. Objectiveparameters are those related to a particular service and are measurable and verifiable.Subjective parameters are those based on the opinions of the end-users. We believe thatquality of service should become an integral part of multimedia database systems and usersshould be able to query by requiring a quality of service from the system. The specificationand enforcement of QoS presents an interesting challenge in multimedia systemsdevelopment. A deal of effort has been done on QoS specification and control at the systemand the network levels; but less work has been done at the application/user level. In thispaper; we propose a language; in the style of constraint database languages; for formal …,Multimedia Tools and Applications,2004,3
Guest Editors' Introduction: Data Dissemination on the Web,Elisa Bertino; Krithi Ramamritham,Abstract In addition to the traditional approach; in which users explicitly request informationwhen needed; service providers have developed more proactive techniques in whichinformation sources automatically initiate the dissemination. Such new methods oftencombining pull-and push-based dissemination with caching and proxy infrastructures havegenerated considerable research and commercial activity; but many issues remain. Thearticles in this issue show a small cross section of some of the more promising technologicalresponses to a few of the remaining problems.,IEEE Internet Computing,2004,3

In this paper we present the architecture of Di χ eminator; aselective dissemination system for XML documents based on profiles. Profiles; representedthrough XML Schema; concisely represent the kind of documents a user subscribing theservice is interested in. Profiles are used for filtering out irrelevant documents relying on userpreferences.

Ordering and path constraints over semistructured data,Elisa Bertino; Ahmed K Elmagarmid; Mohand-Saïd Hacid,Abstract Constraints are a valuable tool for managing information. Feature constraints havebeen used for describing records in constraint programming (Aït-Kaci and Podelski; 1993;Smolka and Treinen; 1994) and record like structures in computational linguistics (Kaplanand Bresnan; 1982; Shieber; 1986). In this paper; we consider how constraint-basedtechnology can be used to query and reason about semistructured data. The constraintsystem FT≤(Müller et al.; 1997) provides information ordering constraints interpreted overfeature trees. Here; we show how a generalization of FT≤ combined with path constraintscan be used to formally represent; state constraints; and reason about semistructured data.The constraint languages we propose provide possibilities to straightforwardly capture; forexample; what it means for a tree to be a subtree or subsumed by another; or what it …,Journal of intelligent information systems,2003,3

A system canbe a database (for billing purposes) or just a video store system (to store the video data)lacking the typical features of a database or an information retrieval system to supportindexing and querying of video data. Because quality of service is an important requirementfor whole management system; a specific system is introduced in the architecture.

A Set-Oriented Method Definition Language for Object Databases,Elisa Bertino; Giovanna Guerrini; Isabella Merlo,Abstract In this paper we propose a set-oriented rule-based method de nition language forobjectoriented databases. Most existing object-oriented database systems exploit a generalpurpose imperative object-oriented programming language as method de nition language.Because methods are written in a general-purpose imperative language; it is di cult toanalyze their properties and to optimize them. Optimization is important when dealing withlarge amount of objects as in databases. We therefore believe that the use of an ad-hoc; set-oriented language can o er some advantages; at least at a speci cation level. In particular;such a language can o er an appropriate framework to reason about method properties. Inthis paper; besides de ning a set-oriented rule-based language for method de nition; weformally de ne its semantics; addressing the problems of inconsistency and non …,*,1997,3
Enhanced nested-inherited index for OODBMS,Elisa Bertino; S Salerno; Boris Shidlovsky,ABSTRACT The nested-mheriterf mdez has been recently proposed as an access structureproviding an integrated support for queries in object-oriented databases along bothaggregation and inheritance hierarchies. It is very efficient for retrieval operations. However;its high update costs make this structure suitable only for hierarchies with a small number ofclzw. es. In this paper we propose an enhanced nested-inherited m dez; able to supportupdate operations more efficiently; whereas supporting nested predicates as efficiently asthe nested-inherited index.

Enforcing Mandatory Access Control in Object Bases,Elisa Bertino; Sushil Jajodiat; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Enforcement of mandatory policies in object-oriented systems generally requiresobjects to be single level; ie; all attributes of an object must have the same security level.However; entities in real world are often multilevel and; therefore; support must be providedfor representing these entities. In this paper; we show how multilevel entities can berepresented using single level objects. The approach; which extends an earlier proposal byBertino and Jajodia [4]; is based on the notions of composite objects and delegations. Wealso discuss how our approach can be implemented by extending the message filterproposed by Jajodia and Kogan in [15].,*,1994,3

A Rule-Based Language for the Specification of Message Routing Policies in a Universal Communication System,Elisa Bertino; Dip di Scienze dell'Informazione; Munir Cochinwala; Marco Mesiti,Abstract In this paper we propose a declarative rule language; based on the ECA paradigm[7]; for specifying message filtering and routing policies in a Universal CommunicationIdentifier (UCI) system. A user subscribing to a UCI system has a unique identifier;independent from the actual communication devices the user owns. It is a task of the UCIsystem to properly route messages or phone calls to the proper user devices; according tothe type of message; the type of device; and to the user preferences. The rule languagepresented in this paper allows users to state their personal policies for message/phone callrouting and filtering. Those policies; expressed through the rule language; are incorporatedinto the user profile and used by the UCI system in order to perform message/phone calldispatching.

Big Data Security and Privacy,Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari,Abstract Recent technologies; such as IoT; social networks; cloud computing; and dataanalytics; make today possible to collect huge amounts of data. However; for data to be usedto their full power; data security and privacy are critical. Data security and privacy have beenwidely investigated over the past thirty years. However; today we face new issues insecuring and protecting data; that result in new challenging research directions. Some ofthose challenges arise from increasing privacy concerns with respect to the use of suchhuge amount of data; and from the need of reconciling privacy with the use of data. Otherchallenges arise because the deployments of new data collection and processing devices;such as those used in IoT systems; increase the attack potential.

A Secure Sum Protocol and Its Application to Privacy-preserving Multi-party Analytics,Shagufta Mehnaz; Gowtham Bellala; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Many enterprises are transitioning towards data-driven business processes. Thereare numerous situations where multiple parties would like to share data towards a commongoal if it were possible to simultaneously protect the privacy and security of the individualsand organizations described in the data. Existing solutions for multi-party analytics thatfollow the so called Data Lake paradigm have parties transfer their raw data to a trusted third-party (ie; mediator); which then performs the desired analysis on the global data; and sharesthe results with the parties. However; such a solution does not fit many applications such asHealthcare; Finance; and the Internet-of-Things; where privacy is a strong concern.Motivated by the increasing demands for data privacy; we study the problem of privacy-preserving multi-party data analytics; where the goal is to enable analytics on multi-party …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM on Symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies,2017,2
A cognitive policy framework for next-generation distributed federated systems: concepts and research directions,Elisa Bertino; Seraphin Calo; Maroun Toma; Dinesh Verma; Christopher Williams; Brian Rivera,Next-generation collaborative activities and missions will be carried out by autonomousgroups of devices with a large variety of cognitive capabilities. These devices will have tooperate in environments characterized by uncertainty; insecurity (both physical and cyber);and instability. In such environments; communications may be fragmented. Proper policy-based management of such autonomous device groups is thus critical. However currentpolicy management systems have many limitations; including lack of flexibility.

Framework for behavioral analytics in anomaly identification,Maroun Touma; Elisa Bertino; Brian Rivera; Dinesh Verma; Seraphin Calo,Behavioral Analytics (BA) relies on digital breadcrumbs to build user profiles and createclusters of entities that exhibit a large degree of similarity. The prevailing assumption is thatan entity will assimilate the group behavior of the cluster it belongs to. Our understanding ofBA and its application in different domains continues to evolve and is a direct result of thegrowing interest in Machine Learning research. When trying to detect security threats; weuse BA techniques to identify anomalies; defined in this paper as deviation from the groupbehavior. Early research papers in this field reveal a high number of false positives where asecurity alert is triggered based on deviation from the cluster learned behavior but still withinthe norm of what the system defines as an acceptable behavior.

Seamblue: Seamless bluetooth low energy connection migration for unmodified iot devices,Syed Rafiul Hussain; Shagufta Mehnaz; Shahriar Nirjon; Elisa Bertino,Abstract At present; Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is dominantly used in commerciallyavailable Internet of Things (IoT) devices–such as smart watches; fitness trackers; and smartappliances. Compared to classic Bluetooth; BLE has been simplified in many ways thatinclude its connection establishment; data exchange; and encryption processes.Unfortunately; this simplification comes at a cost. For example; only a star topology issupported in BLE environments and a peripheral (an IoT device) can communicate with onlyone gateway (eg a smartphone; or a BLE hub) at a set time. When a peripheral goes out ofrange; it loses connectivity to a gateway; and cannot connect and seamlessly communicatewith another gateway without user interventions. In other words; BLE connections are notautomatically migrated or handed-off to another gateway.

In wirelesssensor networks (WSNs); provenance is critical for many different purposes; includingassessing the trustworthiness of data acquired and forwarded by sensors; supportingsituation awareness; and detecting early signs of attacks. However; a major drawback inprovenance for WSNs is its size. It is thus critical to develop efficient techniques forprovenance encoding. A major issue of previously proposed provenance encodingtechniques is that the size of the provenance either expands too fast with increases in thenumber of packet transmission hops or is very sensitive to the WSN's topology; ie; the size ofthe provenance expands drastically with changes in the WSN's topology.

Pandde: provenance-based anomaly detection of data exfiltration,Daren Fadolalkarim; Asmaa Sallam; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Preventing data exfiltration by insiders is a challenging process since insiders areusers that have access permissions to the data. Existing mechanisms focus on trackingusers' activities while they are connected to the database; and are unable to detectanomalous actions that the users perform on the data once they gain access to it. Being ableto detect anomalous actions on the data is critical as these actions are often sign of attemptsto misuse data. In this paper; we propose an approach to detect anomalous actionsexecuted on data returned to the users from a database. The approach has beenimplemented as part of the Provenance-based ANomaly Detection of Data Exfiltration(PANDDE) tool.

Adaptive trust update frequency in manets,Muhammad Saleem Khan; Daniele Midi; Majid I Khan; Elisa Bertino,Most of the existing trust-based security schemes for MANETs compute and update thetrustworthiness of the other nodes with a fixed frequency. Although this approach works wellin some scenarios; some nodes may not be able to afford the periodical trust update due tothe limited resources in energy and computation power. To avoid energy depletion andextend the network lifetime; trust-based security schemes need approaches to update thetrust taking into account the network conditions at each node. At the same time; a trade-off interms of packet loss rate; false positives; detection rate; and energy of nodes is needed fornetwork performance. In this paper; we first investigate the impact of trust update frequencyon energy consumption and packet loss rate. We then identify network parameters; such aspacket transmission rate; packet loss rate; remaining node energy; and rate of link …,Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS); 2015 IEEE 21st International Conference on,2015,2

Such algorithms; however; operate by batch processing over a widow of datareported by the nodes; which represents a difficulty in applications involving streaming data.In this paper; we propose STRIF (Streaming IF) which extends IF algorithms to datastreaming by leveraging a novel method for updating the sensors' variances. We comparethe performance of STRIF algorithm to several batch processing IF algorithms throughextensive experiments across a wide variety of configurations over both real-world and …,Intelligent Sensors; Sensor Networks and Information Processing (ISSNIP); 2015 IEEE Tenth International Conference on,2015,2
Conflict and Multimodal Communication: Social Research and Machine Intelligence,Francesca D'Errico; Isabella Poggi; Alessandro Vinciarelli; Laura Vincze,“Peace is a gift.” This is what Pope Francis said on June 6; 2014; talking about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict during an interview with journalists. It is certainly a way to give dueweight to the state of well-being and harmony between people that belong to groups withdifferent and often incompatible interests. However; despite being a gift; peace is a costlyprocess made up of steps that hardly ever respond to the laws of gratuity. Very often peacegoes through delicate and complex passages within the management of a conflict;depending on both its phases (ie; conflict settlement; conflict resolution and reconciliation;Kelman 2006) and its characteristics (intragroup; intergroup; ethnic; Tajfel 1986;Constructive and deconstructive; Deutsch et al. 2006; High vs. Low stakes conflict;symmetrical and asymmetrical; Giebels 2012); which suggest what presumably might be …,*,2015,2
Demo overview: privacy-enhancing features of identidroid,Daniele Midi; Oyindamola Oluwatimi; Bilal Shebaro; Elisa Bertino,Abstract As privacy today is a major concern for mobile systems; network anonymizers arewidely available on smartphones systems; such as Android. However; in many casesapplications are still able to identify the user and the device by means different from the IPaddress. In this demo we show two solutions that address this problem by providingapplication-level anonymity. The first solution shadows sensitive data that can reveal theuser identity. The second solutions dynamically revokes Android application permissionsassociated with sensitive information at run-time. In addition; both solutions offer protectionfrom applications that identify their users through traces left in the application's data storageor by exchanging identifying data messages. We developed IdentiDroid; a customizedAndroid operating system; to deploy these solutions; and built IdentiDroid Profile …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2014,2
Private data warehouse queries,Xun Yi; Russell Paulet; Elisa Bertino; Guandong Xu,Abstract Publicly accessible data warehouses are an indispensable resource for dataanalysis. But they also pose a significant risk to the privacy of the clients; since a datawarehouse operator may follow the client's queries and infer what the client is interested in.Private Information Retrieval (PIR) techniques allow the client to retrieve a cell from a datawarehouse without revealing to the operator which cell is retrieved. However; PIR cannot beused to hide OLAP operations performed by the client; which may disclose the client'sinterest. This paper presents a solution for private data warehouse queries on the basis ofthe Boneh-Goh-Nissim cryptosystem which allows one to evaluate any multi-variatepolynomial of total degree 2 on ciphertexts. By our solution; the client can perform OLAPoperations on the data warehouse and retrieve one (or more) cell without revealing any …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2013,2
Secure sensor network SUM aggregation with detection of malicious nodes,Sunoh Choi; Gabriel Ghiniţă; Elisa Bertino,In-network aggregation is an essential operation which reduces communication overheadand power consumption of resource-constrained sensor network nodes. Sensor nodes aretypically organized into an aggregation tree; whereby aggregator nodes collect data frommultiple data source nodes; and perform a reduction operation such as sum; average;minimum; etc. The result is then forwarded to other aggregators higher in the hierarchytoward a base station (or sink node) that receives the final outcome of the in-networkcomputation. However; despite its performance benefits; aggregation introduces severaldifficult security challenges with respect to data confidentiality; integrity and authenticity.

Modeling the risk & utility of information sharing in social networks,Mohamed R Fouad; Khaled Elbassioni; Elisa Bertino,With the widespread of social networks; the risk of information sharing has becomeinevitable. Sharing a user's particular information in social networks is an all-or-nonedecision. Users receiving friendship invitations from others may decide to accept this requestand share their information or reject it in which case none of their information will be shared.Access control in social networks is a challenging topic. Social network users would want todetermine the optimum level of details at which they share their personal information withother users based on the risk associated with the process. In this paper; we formulate theproblem of data sharing in social networks using two different models:(i) a model basedon\emph {diffusion kernels}; and (ii) a model based on access control. We show that it ishard to apply the former in practice and explore the latter. We prove that determining the …,Privacy; Security; Risk and Trust (PASSAT); 2012 International Conference on and 2012 International Confernece on Social Computing (SocialCom),2012,2

On Hashing Graphs.,Ashish Kundu; Elisa Bertino,Abstract. Collision resistant one-way hashing schemes are the basic building blocks ofalmost all crypto-systems. Use of graph-structured data models are on the rise–in graphdatabases; representation of biological and healthcare data as well as in modeling systemsfor representing system topologies. Therefore; the problem of hashing graphs with respect tocrypto-systems needs to be studied and addressed. The traditional Merkle Hash techniquecannot be applied as it is because graphs are more complex data structures than trees. Inthis paper; we make the following contributions:(1) we define the formal security model ofhashing schemes for graphs;(2) we define the formal security model of leakagefree hashingschemes for graphs;(3) we describe a hashing scheme for hashing directed and undirectedgraphs that uses Merkle hash technique;(4) and a hashing scheme that uses structural …,IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive,2012,2
A New Approach to Weighted Multi-Secret Sharing,Xukai Zou; Fabio Maino; Elisa Bertino; Yan Sui; Kai Wang; Feng Li,Secret sharing is important in information and network security and has broad applicationsin the real world. Since an elegant secret sharing mechanism was first proposed by Shamirin 1979; many schemes have appeared in literature. These schemes deal with either singleor multiple secrets and their shares have either the same weight or different weights.Weighted shares mean that different shares have different capabilities in recovering thesecret (s)-a more (less) weighted share needs fewer (more) other shares to recover thesecret (s). In this paper; we identify a direct relation between the length (ie; the number ofbits) and the weight of shares and; based on this relation; present a new ChineseRemainder Theorem (CRT) based weighted multiple secret sharing scheme. This schemecan also be naturally applied to other cases such as sharing a single secret with same …,Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN); 2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on,2011,2

Analyzing semantic locations cloaking techniques in a probabilistic grid-based map,Maria Luisa Damiani; Claudio Silvestri; Elisa Bertino,Abstract The protection of semantic positions; for instance that an individual is inside ahospital; is a challenging privacy issue. For example; it can be shown that popular protectionmechanisms; like location cloaking; can be easily defeated when certain mobility patternsare known; eg; certain places are more or less popular than other places. To prevent thiskind of attack; novel semantic location cloaking heuristics are being investigated. Thesemethods are built on the knowledge of population distribution and sensitive locations. In thisdemonstration; we present SAWL (Semantics-aware Location cloaking); a tool supportingthe comparison of semantic location cloaking methods over real and synthetic spatialscenarios.,Proceedings of the 18th SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2010,2
A policy-based approach for assuring data integrity in DBMSs,Hyo-Sang Lim; Chenyun Dai; Elisa Bertino,Data integrity is crucial for collaborative activities where information is shared amongmultiple organizations to effectively make cooperative and mission-critical decisions.Assuring data integrity is particularly challenging in the presence of frequent datamodifications by collaborative parties; especially for large-scale collaborations. However;data integrity is difficult to grasp with a single concept or a single model since the definitioncan vary depending on the goals and requirements of the collaboration. To address thismulti-faced feature of data integrity; we propose a policy-based approach by which one canspecify data integrity policies according to the requirements of collaborations and enforcethe policies on DBMSs; an essential software component for large-scale collaborationactivities.

Cryptanalysis of the LCSS RFID authentication protocol,Tianjie Cao; Peng Shen; Elisa Bertino,To reduce the computational load on both the back-end database and the tags; Ha et al.proposed a low-cost and strong-security (LCSS) RFID authentication protocol. In this paper;we identify two effective attacks; a desynchronization attack and a spoofing attack; againstthe LCSS protocol. The former attack can break the synchronization between the RFIDreader and the tag in a single protocol run so that they can not authenticate each other inany following protocol run. The latter can impersonate a legal tag to spoof the RFID readerby extracting the ID of a specific tag during the authentication process. Moreover; we pointout the potential countermeasure by adding an integrity check to improve the security.,Electronic Commerce and Security; 2008 International Symposium on,2008,2
Privately updating suppression and generalization based k-anonymous databases,Alberto Trombetta; Wei Jiang; Elisa Bertino; Lorenzo Bossi,Alice; owner of a k-anonymous database; needs to determine whether her database; wheninserted with a tuple owned by Bob; is still k-anonymous. Suppose that Bob is not allowed toaccess to the database because of data confidentiality and that Alice is not allowed to readBob's tuple due to Bob's privacy concern. Under these assumptions; this paper proposes twoprotocols to check whether the database inserted with a tuple is still k-anonymous; withoutletting Alice and Bob know the contents of the tuple and the database respectively.,Data Engineering; 2008.

Query mesh: An efficient multi-route approach to query optimization,Rimma V Nehme; Karen Works; Elke A Rundensteiner; Elisa Bertino,Abstract—In most database systems; traditional and stream systems alike; the optimizerpicks a single query plan for all data based on the overall statistics of the data. It hashowever been repeatedly observed that real-life datasets are non-uniform. Selecting asingle execution plan may result in a query execution that is ineffective for possibly largeportions of the actual data. In this paper; we present a practical alternative to the currentstate-of-the-art query optimization techniques; termed a multiroute query mesh model (orshort QM). The main idea of QM is to compute multiple routes (query plans); each designedfor a particular subset of data with distinct statistical properties. Based on the executionroutes and the data characteristics; a classifier model is induced. The classifier is used forefficient partitioning of the new data to assign the best route for query processing. We …,*,2008,2
A structure preserving approach for securing XML documents,Mohamed Nabeel; Elisa Bertino,With the widespread adoption of XML as the message format to disseminate content overdistributed systems including Web Services and Publish-Subscribe systems; differentmethods have been proposed for securing messages. We focus on a subset of such systemswhere incremental updates are disseminated. The goal of this paper is to develop anapproach for disseminating only the updated or accessible portions of XML content whileassuring confidentiality and integrity at message level. While sending only the updatesgreatly reduces the bandwidth requirements; it introduces the challenge of assuring securityefficiently for partial messages disseminated to intermediaries and clients.

k-anonymous Attribute-Based Access Control⋆,Anna Squicciarini; Alberto Trombetta; Abilasha Bhargav-Spantzel; Elisa Bertino,Abstract. Access control in a distributed system can be achieved by requesting digitalcredentials of the entity wanting to access the system. Credentials contain attributes thatattest information concerning a given subject. Because such information can be sensitive;uncontrolled disclosure of such sensitive attributes may result in privacy breaches. Previousresearch efforts have shown that; even if one discloses only non-sensitive attributes; theseattributes can still be linked to specific individuals. In this work; we propose attribute-basedauthorizations to satisfy the kanonymity property: the set of credentials submitted by asubject during an access control operation should be equal to at least k other such setsreceived by the counterpart during earlier access controls operations. We thus propose aprotocol that ensures k-anonymity for users accessing services in a distributed setting …,International Conference on Information and Computer Security (ICICS’07),2007,2
Integrating data management and panoramic images for an effective representation of cultural heritage information,S Valtolina; E Bertino,The effective presentation of cultural heritage (CH) information requires the application ofsophisticated techniques from different areas; namely; human computer interaction (HCI)and knowledge management. CH is no longer perceived as just a set of isolated objects;stored in museums or collections; without any links to the specific historical and socialcontexts of reference. Rather; objects have to be connected to additional informationconcerning those reference contexts. Since such information evolves over time; based onthe research carried out by archaeologists; historical experts; and sociologists; theknowledge base needs to be updated to reflect new discoveries. Moreover; informationshould be presented at different levels of detail and should support an exploratory approachto information discovery by users.

The tasks in a workflow need to be performed in a certain orderand often times are subject to temporal constraints and dependencies [1; 2]. A keyrequirement for such workflow applications is to provide the right data to the right person atthe right time. This requirement motivates for dynamic adaptations of workflows for dealingwith changing environmental conditions and exceptions.,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06.

A set‐oriented method definition language for object databases and its semantics,Elisa Bertino; Giovanna Guerrini; Isabella Merlo,Abstract In this paper we propose a set-oriented rule-based method definition language forobject-oriented databases. Most existing object-oriented database systems exploit a general-purpose imperative object-oriented programming language as the method definitionlanguage. Because methods are written in a general-purpose imperative language; it isdifficult to analyze their properties and to optimize them. Optimization is important whendealing with a large amount of objects as in databases. We therefore believe that the use ofan ad hoc; set-oriented language can offer some advantages; at least at the specificationlevel. In particular; such a language can offer an appropriate framework to reason aboutmethod properties.,Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience,2003,2
A knowledge-based approach to visual information,Elisa Bertino; Ahmed K Elmagarmid; Mohand-Saïd Hacid,Abstract We propose an approach based on description logics for the representation andretrieval of visual information. We first consider objects as having shapes which aredescribed by means of semi-algebraic sets. 1 We propose a model which consists of threelayers:(1) Shape Layer; which provides the geometric shapes of image objects;(2) ObjectLayer; intended to contain objects of interest and their description; and (3) Schema Layer;which contains the structured abstractions of objects; ie; a general schema about the classesof objects represented in the Object Layer. We propose two abstract languages on the basisof description logics: one for describing knowledge of the object and schema layers; and theother; more expressive; for making queries. Queries can refer to the form dimension (ie;information of the Shape Layer) or to the semantic dimension (ie; information of the Object …,Journal of Intelligent Information Systems,2002,2
Introducing cooperation and actions in amalgamated knowledge bases,Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania; Paolo Perlasca,The theory of amalgamated knowledge bases represents a formal logical foundation forheterogeneous databases. In an amalgamated knowledge base; data sources are modeledby generalized annotated logic. Moreover; an amalgamated knowledge base is equippedwith a supervisor acting as a mediator for amalgamating knowledge from the localdatabases. Even if the framework is quite appealing; it does not model dynamic aspects.Moreover; no communication channels among local databases are supported andcooperation is provided only through the supervisor. In this paper; we extend the theory ofamalgamated knowledge bases to deal with actions and cooperation among localdatabases.,Database Systems for Advanced Applications; 2001. Proceedings.

Metadata; intelligent indexing; and repository management for multimedia digital libraries,Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania; Gian Piero Zarri,Abstract Metadata represent the vehicle by which digital documents can be efficientlyindexed and retrieved. The need for such kind of information is particularly evident inmultimedia digital libraries; which store documents dealing with different types of media(text; images; sound; video). In this context; a relevant metadata function consists insuperimposing some sort of conceptual organization over the unstructured informationspace proper to these digital repositories; in order to facilitate the intelligent retrieval of theoriginal documents. To this purpose; the usage of conceptual annotations seems quitepromising. In this paper; we propose a two-steps annotation approach by which conceptualannotations; represented in NKRL (Narrative Knowledge Representation Language)[7; 8];are associated with multimedia documents and used during retrieval operations.

Representing and Querying Imprecise Data,Alberto Trombetta; Elisa Bertino; Marenza Demarie,A database is a model of a portion of the real world. As any other model of the real world; itattempts to represent in an abstract way a portion of reality; and the precision of suchrepresentation is determined by users and applications' needs. A solution to the problem offaithfully represent data is simply to restrict the data model in order to represent veryprecisely defined data. As it is well known; the standard way of representing and queryingvery precisely defined data is very efficiently accomplished by relational databasesmanagement systems (RDBMs): an RBDMS supports the relational model provided by Codd[24]. It consists of a set of relations–by which users can represent the data and therelationship among data–and provides high level languages that allow the user to define thestructure of data; access data and manipulate data. this poses several restrictions to the …,*,2001,2
A linguistic framework for querying dimensional data,Elisa Bertino; Tsz S Cheng; Shashi K Gadia; Giovanna Guerrini,This paper deals with dimensional data. Examples of dimensions are space and time. Thus;temporal; spatial; spatiotemporal values are examples of dimensional data. We define thenotion of dimensional object; extending an object-oriented ODMG-like type system toinclude dimensional types. We then address the problem of querying dimensional objects.Linguistic constructs are introduced that allow objects with different dimensions to be mixedin the same phrases. This allows the user to formulate both associative and navigationalaccesses seamlessly without having to worry about the dimensions of the various dataelements involved.,Temporal Representation and Reasoning; 2001.

Maintaining secrecy and integrity in multilevel databases: A practical approach,Sushil Jajodia; Don Marks; Elisa Bertino,Abstract. In a multilevel database; certain integrity constraints create a secrecy problemsince they cannot be evaluated without access to data at higher classiﬁcations than theclassiﬁcation of the data to be modiﬁed. We present a practical approach for enforcing suchconstraints without sacriﬁcing the secrecy requirements. Our approach requires that the suchconstraints be rewritten as a collection of level-valid constraints. Level-valid constraints meetthe secrecy requirement since their evaluation does not require access to any data that isclassiﬁed higher than the classiﬁcation of data to be modiﬁed. Moreover; they meet theintegrity requirements since any database state that satisﬁes the level-valid constraintssatisﬁes the original constraints as well. The cost associated with this approach is thattrusted processes must be relied upon to make occasional modiﬁcations.,Proc. 18th National Information Systems Security Conference,1996,2
A data access structure for filtering distance queries in image retrieval,Alberto Belussi; Elisa Bertino; A Biavasco; S Rizzo,Summary In this paper; we describe Snapshot; a data structure for supporting distancequeries in image databases. This data structure is defined as combination of severaltechniques; namely regular grid with locational keys; corner stitching and clusteringtechnique for spatial objects; extensible hashing. The paper discusses how distancepredicates are supported. In particular; algorithms are presented for two types of distancepredicate: the FAR predicate; retrieving all objects within a given distance from a given point;and the MIN predicate; retrieving all objects at the minimum distance from a given point.,*,1996,2

An extended authorization model for object databases,Elisa Bertino; Fabio Origgi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Object-oriented database systems represent today one of the most promisingtechnology to a number of applications in business and industry. A serious problem withthese systems is that they do not provide adequate access control mechanisms forcontrolling access to information. One of the most significant proposal for the protection ofOODBMSs is represented by the Orion authorization model. In the Orion authorization modelseveral concepts have been introduced such as those of implicit/explicit and strong/weakauthorizations. However; the Orion authorization model suffers from some drawbacks andaddresses only partially some protection problems. In this paper we present an authorizationmodel for the protection of object-oriented database systems based on the types ofauthorizations introduced in the Orion authorization model.

Distributed and parallel database object management,Elisa Bertino; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract. We propose an algorithm for executing transactions in object-oriented databases.The object-oriented database model generalizes the classical model of databaseconcurrency control by permitting accesses to class and instance objects; by permittingarbitrary operations on objects as opposed to traditional read and write operations; and byallowing nested execution of transactions on objects. In this paper; we first develop auniform methodology for treating both classes and instances. We then develop a two-phaselocking protocol with a new relationship between locks caIled ordered sharing for an object-oriented database. Ordered sharing does not restrict the execution of conflicting operations.Finally; we extend the protocol to handle objects that execute methods on other objects thusresulting in the nested execution of transactions. The resulting protocol permits more …,*,1994,2

Generalized Temporal Role Based Access Control Model (GTRBAC)(Part II)–Expressiveness and Design Issues,James BD Joshi; Elisa Bertino; Usman Latif; Arif Ghafoor,Abstract The Generalized Temporal Role Based Access Control (GTRBAC) modelintroduces a large set of temporal constraint expressions that facilitates the specification of acomprehensive access control policy. However; the issue of its expressiveness has not beeninvestigated earlier. In this paper; we present an exhaustive analysis of the expressivenessof the constructs provided by GTRBAC and prove that the set of constraints is not minimal byshowing that there is a subset of GTRBAC constraints that is sufficient to express all accessconstraints that can be expressed using the full set. We formally present the minimality resultfor the GTRBAC constraint set and argue that; although the complete set of constraints inGTRBAC is not minimal; having such an extensive set is advantageous from the perspectiveof user convenience and the lower complexity of constraint representation.

Differentially Private K-Means Clustering and a Hybrid Approach to Private Optimization,Dong Su; Jianneng Cao; Ninghui Li; Elisa Bertino; Min Lyu; Hongxia Jin,Abstract k-means clustering is a widely used clustering analysis technique in machinelearning. In this article; we study the problem of differentially private k-means clustering.Several state-of-the-art methods follow the single-workload approach; which adapts anexisting machine-learning algorithm by making each step private. However; most of them donot have satisfactory empirical performance. In this work; we develop techniques to analyzethe empirical error behaviors of one of the state-of-the-art single-workload approaches;DPLloyd; which is a differentially private version of the Lloyd algorithm for k>-meansclustering. Based on the analysis; we propose an improvement of DPLloyd.

A collaborative ddos defence framework using network function virtualization,Bahman Rashidi; Carol Fung; Elisa Bertino,High-profile and often destructive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks continue to beone of the top security concerns as the DDoS attacks volumes are increasing constantly.Among them; the SYN Flood attack is the most common type. Conventional DDoS defensesolutions may not be preferable; since they demand highly capable hardware resources;which induce high cost and long deployment cycle. The emerging of network functionvirtualization (NFV) technology introduces new opportunities to decrease the amount ofproprietary hardware that is needed to launch and operate network services. In this paper;we propose a DDoS defense mechanism named CoFence; which facilitates a “domain-helps-domain” collaboration network among NFV-based domain networks.

Shortfall-based optimal placement of security resources for mobile IoT scenarios,Antonino Rullo; Edoardo Serra; Elisa Bertino; Jorge Lobo,Abstract We present a method for computing the best provisioning of security resources forInternet of Things (IoT) scenarios characterized by a high degree of mobility. The securityinfrastructure is specified by a security resource allocation plan computed as the solution ofan optimization problem that minimizes the risk of having IoT devices not monitored by anyresource. Due the mobile nature of IoT devices; a probabilistic framework for modeling suchscenarios is adopted. We adapt the concept of shortfall from economics as a risk measureand show how to compute and evaluate the quality of an allocation plan. The proposedapproach fits well with applications such as vehicular networks; mobile ad-hoc networks;smart cities; or any IoT environment characterized by mobile devices that needs amonitoring infrastructure.,European Symposium on Research in Computer Security,2017,1
Heimdall: Mitigating the Internet of Insecure Things,Javid Habibi; Daniele Midi; Anand Mudgerikar; Elisa Bertino,The Internet of Things (IoT) is built of many small smart objects continuously connected tothe Internet. This makes these devices an easy target for attacks exploiting vulnerabilities atthe network; application; and mobile level. With that it comes as no surprise that distributeddenial of service attacks leveraging these vulnerable devices have become a new standardfor effective botnets. In this paper; we propose Heimdall; a whitelist-based intrusiondetection technique tailored to IoT devices. Heimdall operates on routers acting as gatewaysfor IoT as a homogeneous defense for all devices behind the router.

App behavioral analysis using system calls,Prajit Kumar Das; Anupam Joshi; Tim Finin,Abstract—System calls provide an interface to the services made available by an operatingsystem. As a result; any functionality provided by a software application eventually reducesto a set of fixed system calls.

Ghostbuster: a fine-grained approach for anomaly detection in file system accesses,Shagufta Mehnaz; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Protecting sensitive data against malicious or compromised insiders is achallenging problem. Access control mechanisms are not always able to prevent authorizedusers from misusing or stealing sensitive data as insiders often have access permissions tothe data. Also; security vulnerabilities and phishing attacks make it possible for externalmalicious parties to compromise identity credentials of users who have access to the data.Therefore; solutions for protection from insider threat require combining access controlmechanisms and other security techniques; such as encryption; with techniques fordetecting anomalies in data accesses. In this paper; we propose a novel approach to createfine-grained profiles of the users' normal file access behaviors.

Building robust temporal user profiles for anomaly detection in file system accesses,Shagufta Mehnaz; Elisa Bertino,Protecting sensitive data against malicious or compromised insiders is a big concern. Inmost cases; insiders have authorized access in file systems containing such data which theymisuse or exfiltrate for financial profit. Moreover; external parties can compromise identitycredentials of valid file system users by means of exploiting security vulnerabilities; phishingattacks etc. Therefore; in order to protect sensitive information from such attackers; securitymeasures; eg; access control and encryption are often combined with anomaly detection.Anomaly detection is based on the key observation that the access behavior of an attacker issignificantly different from the regular access pattern of a benign user. However; due to thecomplexity of users' interactions with a file system; the modeling of user profiles is achallenging problem. As a result; most of the existing anomaly detection techniques suffer …,Privacy; Security and Trust (PST); 2016 14th Annual Conference on,2016,1

Anomaly Detection Techniques for Database Protection Against Insider Threats,Asmaa Sallam; Qian Xiao; Elisa Bertino; Daren Fadolalkarim,In this paper; we propose techniques for detecting anomalies in user accesses by learningprofiles of normal access patterns of users based on both the syntactic and semanticfeatures of past users queries stored in database logs. New accesses are checked uponthese profiles and deviations are considered anomalous accesses which may be indicationsof potential insider attacks. We consider two scenarios. The first scenario is when themonitored database employs role-based access control (RBAC). In this scenario; we buildprofiles of roles rather than individual users; this makes our approach usable for databaseswhich have a large user population. In this case; we use the naive Bayesian classification todetect anomalies. We also employ multilabeling classification to account for the case whenroles have common access patterns. The second scenario is when RBAC is not used. In …,Information Reuse and Integration (IRI); 2016 IEEE 17th International Conference on,2016,1
An application restriction system for bring-your-own-device scenarios,Oyindamola Oluwatimi; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Different containerization techniques have been developed to ensure theseparation of enterprise content and personal data on an end-user's device. Although theenterprise manages the environment in which work-related activities are conducted; referredto as a work persona; third-party applications installed on the mobile devices may make theenterprise content vulnerable to misuse or exfiltration. It is thus critical that enterprises begiven the ability to restrict the capabilities of third-party applications that reside in the workpersona. In mobile systems; applications typically request to use a list of capabilities on thedevice prior to being installed on the device; and alll capabilities must be granted in order forthe applications to be installed.

A Data-Driven Evaluation for Insider Threats,Yuqing Sun; Haoran Xu; Elisa Bertino; Chao Sun,Abstract Insiders are often legal users who are authorized to access system and data. If theymisuse their privileges; it would bring great threat to system security. In practice; we couldnot have any knowledge about fraud pattern in advance; and most malicious behaviors areoften in accordance with security rules; thus; it is difficult to predefine regulations forpreventing all kinds of frauds. In this paper; we propose a data-driven evaluation model todetect malicious insiders; which audits user behaviors from both parallel and incrementalaspects. Users are grouped together according to their positions and responsibilities; basedon which the normal pattern is learned. For each user; a routine behavior pattern is alsolearned for historical assessment. Then; users are evaluated against both group patternsand routine patterns by probabilistic methods.

Private cell retrieval from data warehouses,Xun Yi; Russell Paulet; Elisa Bertino; Guandong Xu,Publicly accessible data warehouses are an indispensable resource for data analysis.However; they also pose a significant risk to the privacy of the clients; since a datawarehouse operator may follow the client's queries and infer what the client is interested in.Private information retrieval (PIR) techniques allow the client to retrieve a cell from a datawarehouse without revealing to the operator which cell is retrieved and; therefore; protectsthe privacy of the client's queries. However; PIR cannot be used to hide online analyticalprocessing (OLAP) operations performed by the client; which may disclose the client'sinterest. This paper presents a solution for private cell retrieval from a data warehouse onthe basis of the Paillier cryptosystem. By our solution; the client can privately perform OLAPoperations on the data warehouse and retrieve one (or more) cell without revealing any …,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2016,1
Inside attack filtering for robust sensor localization,Jongho Won; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Several solutions have recently been proposed to securely estimate sensorpositions even when there is malicious location information which distorts the estimate.Some of those solutions are based on the Minimum Mean Square Estimation (MMSE)methods which efficiently estimate sensor positions. Although such solutions can filter outmost of malicious information; if an attacker knows the position of a target sensor; theattacker can significantly alter the position information. In this paper; we introduce such anew attack; called Inside-Attack; and a technique that is able to detect and filter out maliciouslocation information. Based on this technique; we propose an algorithm to effectivelyestimate sensor positions. We illustrate the impact of inside attacks on the existingalgorithms and report simulation results concerning our algorithm.,Proceedings of the 11th ACM on Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2016,1
Robust Aggregation of Inconsistent Information: Concepts and Research Directions,Aleksandar Ignjatovic; Mohsen Rezvani; Mohammad Allahbakhsh; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Improving the reliability of information obtained from multiple sources in anautomated way is today a critical need as decision-making processes and other applicationsheavily depend on such information. The sources can be sensors used in a wireless sensornetwork; multiple resources on the Internet or a large number of users of a web service or asocial network. Examples of such a problem include finding a reliable rating of a product or amovie; the accurate current price of a stock or a reliable assessment of the prevailing marketanalysts' sentiment about a stock. The problem arises from the fact that multiple sourcesoften provide inconsistent information; due to differences of opinion; human or hardwareerrors; being out of date and; most importantly; the sources might even maliciously supplyfalse information with an express intent to deceive.

Lightweight and Secure Two-Party Range Queries over Outsourced Encrypted Databases,Bharath K Samanthula; Wei Jiang; Elisa Bertino,Abstract: With the many benefits of cloud computing; an entity may want to outsource its dataand their related analytics tasks to a cloud. When data are sensitive; it is in the interest of theentity to outsource encrypted data to the cloud; however; this limits the types of operationsthat can be performed on the cloud side. Especially; evaluating queries over the encrypteddata stored on the cloud without the entity performing any computation and without everdecrypting the data become a very challenging problem. In this paper; we propose solutionsto conduct range queries over outsourced encrypted data. The existing methods leakvaluable information to the cloud which can violate the security guarantee of the underlyingencryption schemes. In general; the main security primitive used to evaluate range queriesis secure comparison (SC) of encrypted integers. However; we observe that the existing …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1401.3768,2014,1

Private searching on streaming data,Xun Yi; Russell Paulet; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Private searching on streaming data is a process to dispatch to a public server aprogram; which searches streaming sources of data without revealing searching criteria andthen sends back a buffer containing the findings. From an Abelian group homomorphicencryption; the searching criteria can be constructed by only simple combinations ofkeywords; eg; disjunction of keywords. The recent breakthrough in fully homomorphicencryption has allowed one to construct arbitrary searching criteria theoretically. In thischapter; we consider a new private query suggested by Yi et al.[23]; which searches fordocuments from streaming data on the basis of keyword frequency; such that the frequencyof a keyword is required to be higher or lower than a given threshold. This form of query canhelp us in finding more relevant documents. Based on the state-of-the-art fully …,*,2014,1
Remote End-to-End Voting Scheme,Xun Yi; Russell Paulet; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Recently; remote voting systems have gained popularity and have been used forgovernment elections and referendums in the United Kingdom; Estonia; and Switzerland aswell as municipal elections in Canada and party primary elections in the United States andFrance. Current remote voting schemes assume either the voter's personal computer istrusted or the voter is not physically coerced. In this chapter; we describe a remote end-to-end voting scheme [23]; in which the voter's choice remains secret even if the voter'spersonal computer is infected by malware or the voter is physically controlled by theadversary. Based on homomorphic encryption; the overhead for tallying in such scheme islinear in the number of candidates. Thus; such scheme is practical for elections at a largescale; such as general elections.,*,2014,1

A fundamental issue that impacts the success of these applications is thesecurity and privacy concerns raised regarding the mobile users. In that; a malicious user orservice provider can track the locations of a user traveled so that other malicious act can becarried out more effectively against the user. Therefore; the challenge becomes how toauthenticate mobile users while preserving their actual identity and location privacy.

A secure architecture design based on application isolation; code minimization and randomization,Aditi Gupta; Michael S Kirkpatrick; Elisa Bertino,With fast evolving attacks; using software patches for fixing software bugs is not enough asthere are often considerable delays in their application to vulnerable systems and theattackers may find other vulnerabilities to exploit. A secure architecture design that providesrobust protection against malware must be guided by strong security design principles. Inthis work; we propose a system design based on the security principles that aim at achievingisolation; diversification and reducing attack surface. Our design leverages multi-corearchitecture to enforce physical isolation between application processes so that a maliciousor infected application is unable to affect other parts of the system. We use randomizationtechniques to increase the entropy of the system and thwart various attacks such as code-reuse attacks. Further; we significantly reduce the software attack surface by executing …,Communications and Network Security (CNS); 2013 IEEE Conference on,2013,1
An efficient certificateless cryptography scheme without pairing,Seung-Hyun Seo; Mohamed Nabeel; Xiaoyu Ding; Elisa Bertino,Abstract We propose a mediated certificateless encryption scheme without pairingoperations. Mediated certificateless public key encryption (mCL-PKE) solves the key escrowproblem in identity based encryption and certificate revocation problem in public keycryptography. However; existing mCL-PKE schemes are either inefficient because of the useof expensive pairing operations or vulnerable against partial decryption attacks. In order toaddress the performance and security issues; in this poster; we propose a novel mCL-PKEscheme. We implement our mCL-PKE scheme and a recent scheme; and evaluate thesecurity and performance.

A crucial problem for owners is how to make sure their sensitiveinformation accessed by legitimate users only using the trusted services but not authorizedto read the actual information. We address the problem with role-based access control toenforce selective access to outsourced data without involving the owner in the accesscontrol authorization. The basic idea is to combine cryptography with authorizations; dataowners assign keys to roles that will enforce access via encryption. A formal role-basedaccess model is designed to analyse the translating an authorization policy into anequivalent encryption policy. The paper also investigates the affect of role hirarchy …,Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Australasian Database Conference-Volume 137,2013,1
Fine-grained encryption-based access control for big data,Mohamed Nabeel; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Big Data technologies are increasingly used to store and/or analyze personallyidentifiable information (PII) and other sensitive data. In order to comply with variousregulations and organizational policies; such data needs to be stored encrypted and theaccess to them needs to be controlled based on the identity attributes of users. A simplesolution is to use an efficient symmetric key encryption scheme. However; it requires sharingmany keys with various entities in the system increasing the risk of key leakage. Further;when the user membership changes; these symmetric keys need to be re-issued incurring ahigh overhead. A better solution is to utilize attribute based encryption (ABE) techniques.While ABE provides fine-grained access control for encrypted data; they require expensivepairing operations and; further; attribute revocation is inefficient.

Privacy-preserving assessment of location data trustworthiness,Chenyun Dai; Fang-Yu Rao; Gabriel Ghinita; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Assessing the trustworthiness of location data corresponding to individuals isessential in several applications; such as forensic science and epidemic control. To obtainaccurate and trustworthy location data; analysts must often gather and correlate informationfrom several independent sources; eg; physical observation; witness testimony; surveillancefootage; etc. However; such information may be fraudulent; its accuracy may be low; and itsvolume may be insufficient to ensure highly trustworthy data. On the other hand; recentadvancements in mobile computing and positioning systems; eg; GPS-enabled cell phones;highway sensors; etc.; bring new and effective technological means to track the location ofan individual. Nevertheless; collection and sharing of such data must be done in ways thatdo not violate an individual's right to personal privacy.

Aggregated Privacy-Preserving Identity Verification for Composite Web Services,Nan Guo; Tianhan Gao; Bin Zhang; Ruchith Fernando; Elisa Bertino,An aggregated privacy-preserving identity verification scheme is proposed for compositeWeb services. It aggregates multiple component providers' interactions of identity verificationto a single one involving the user. Besides; it protects users from privacy disclosure throughthe adoption of zero-knowledge of proof of knowledge. This approach can dramaticallyreduce the computation time; independently on the number of identity attributes andcomponent providers.,Web Services (ICWS); 2011 IEEE International Conference on,2011,1

An assessment of accountability policies for large-scale distributed computing systems,Wonjun Lee; Anna C Squicciarini; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Grid computing systems offer resources to solve large-scale computationalproblems and are thus widely used in a large variety of domains; including computationalsciences; energy management; and defense. Accountability in these application domains isan important requirement; in that it enables controlling activities of users and resourceproviders through the collection and analysis of accountability data. However; because it isnot feasible to simply collect all the potentially useful data; we propose an accountabilitypolicy language to simplify administration tasks. In this paper; we show the efficiency of asystem that we have developed to implement the language. We first present a shortoverview of the system; and then assess the proposed accountability policies based on theexperiments.,Proceedings of the 5th Annual Workshop on Cyber Security and Information Intelligence Research: Cyber Security and Information Intelligence Challenges and Strategies,2009,1
Provenance-based confidence policy management in data streams,Hyo-Sang Lim; Yang-Sae Moon; Elisa Bertino,Abstract In this paper we address the problem of enforcing the confidence policy in datastream management systems (DSMSs in short). The confidence policy is a novel notion thatsupports confidence concept in data management and query processing; more specifically;such a confidence policy restricts access to the query results by specifying the minimumconfidence level of a certain task. To deal with the confidence policy over data streams; wefirst propose a provenance-based framework of controlling confidence policy in DSMSs.

Secure Publishing Techniques,Elisa Bertino; Lorenzo D Martino; Federica Paci; Anna C Squicciarini,Abstract Integrity is a key security requirement. It deals with assuring that information is nottampered with and is only modified by properly authorized subjects. In the Web serviceworld; integrity is crucial from at least two different perspectives. The first is related tointegrity of information transmitted across the network. Integrity in such context is assured bythe use of digital signatures; for which an XML standard has been specified (see Chapter 4).The second; more important issue is related to the integrity of UDDI registries [139]. Becausesuch registries provide structured and standard descriptions of Web services; as well assearching facilities for finding the service providers that better fit client requirements; theirintegrity is crucial.,*,2009,1
Leakage-Free Integrity Assurance for Tree Data Structures,Ashish Kundu; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Data sharing with multiple parties over a third-party distribution framework requiresthat both data integrity and confidentiality be assured. One of the most widely used dataorganization structures is the tree structure. When such structures encode sensitiveinformation (such as in the XML documents); it is crucial that integrity and confidentiality beassured not only for the content; but also for the structure. Digital signature schemes arecommonly used to authenticate the integrity of the data. The most widely used suchtechnique for tree structures is the Merkle hash technique; which however is known to be“not hiding”; thus leading to leakage of information. Most existing techniques for the integrityof hierarchical data structures are based on the Merkle hash technique and thus suffer fromthe problem of information leakages.

For the widespread adoption of thisparadigm; it is important that both the data owners and users have strong securityguarantees with respect to data management. In this paper; we present a comprehensiveframework for the secure outsourcing of XML data; by mainly focusing on confidentiality andcompleteness requirements.

Security for Content Distribution Networks—Concepts; Systems and Research Issues,Elisa Bertino; Yunhua Koglin,Abstract Previous research on content distribution networks (CDNs) mainly focuses onimproving system performance by deploying replication such that latency for data accesscould be reduced and bandwidth could be saved; especially when dealing with largeamounts of data. Centrallymanaged; trusted replicas are important characters in thesetraditional CDNs. However; there is not enough attention given to the security of data inCDNs; even though data security is a crucial need for most Internet-based applications.Moreover; with the emergence of various network appliances and heterogeneous clientenvironments; intermediaries are used for dynamic content delivery.

Authentication Techniques for UDDI Registries,Elisa Bertino; Barbara Carminati; Elena Ferrari,Abstract A Web service is a software system designed to support interoperable application-to-application interactions over the Internet. Web services are based on a set of XMLstandards; such as Web services description language (WSDL); simple object accessprotocol (SOAP) and universal description; discovery and integration (UDDI). A key role inthe Web service architecture is played by UDDI registries; ie; a structured repository ofinformation that can be queried by clients to find the Web services that better fit their needs.Even if; at the beginning; UDDI has been mainly conceived as a public registry withoutspecific facilities for security; today security issues are becoming more and more crucial; dueto the fact that data published in UDDI registries may be highly strategic and sensitive.

Privacy-Preserving Updates to Confidential and Anonymous Databases,Alberto Trombetta; Wei Jiang; Elisa Bertino; Lorenzo Bossi,Abstract Suppose that Alice; owner of a k-anonymous database; needs to determinewhether her database; when inserted with a tuple owned by Bob; is still k-anonymous.Suppose moreover that access to the database is strictly controlled; because for exampledata are used for experiments that need to be maintained confidential. Clearly; allowingAlice to directly read the contents of the tuple breaks the privacy of Bob; on the other hand;the confidentiality of the database managed by Alice is violated once Bob has access to thecontents of the database. Thus the problem is to check whether the database inserted withthe tuple is still k-anonymous; without letting Alice and Bob know the contents of the tupleand the database respectively.

The basic ideais to determine the hazard zonesby simulating the lava flows originated from a number ofsample points localized in regions at high densityof vents; called eruption zones. The keychoice is the adoption of a probabilistic model for the simulation ofthe lava flow. In the paperwe outline the characteristics of the model; called ELFM; and how it has beenvalidated. Onthe other side; for the determination of the eruption zones; which likely contain the pointsoffuture lava flows emissions; we propose an approach based on data mining techniques.,*,2006,1

A modular framework for administering spatial constraints in context-aware rbac,Rafae Bhatti; Maria Damiani; David W Bettis; Elisa Bertino; Arif Ghafoor,Many context-aware access control models with support for spatial and location-basedcapabilities (or constraints) have recently been proposed [6; 8; 9]. Models with location-based access control are becoming increasingly necessary in pervasive computingapplications; and are adequately receiving considerable popularity in the research andindustrial community alike. However; the design of context-aware access control modelswith spatial constraints is still far from satisfactory in a very important respect; vis-à-visflexibility of policy administration.

An optimal conflict resolution strategy for event-driven role based access control policies,Basit Shafiq; Elisa Bertino; Arif Ghafoor,Abstract Role based access control (RBAC) has generated great interest in the securitycommunity for its inherent richness and flexibility in modeling a wide range of access controlpolicies. Any comprehensive access control model such as RBAC requires verification toolsto support consistency analysis and identify possible policy conflicts. These conflicts; ifremain undetected and unresolved; expose the underlying system to numerousvulnerabilities and security risks. In this paper; we propose a verification framework fordetection and resolution of inconsistencies and conflicts in event-driven RBAC policies. Theframework uses an integer programming based approach for optimal resolution of policyconflicts. The proposed approach is generic and can be tuned to a variety of optimalitymeasures.,CERIAS; Purdue University; Tech. Rep,2005,1

In this paper we present the problem of trustworthy computations in Grid systems.Trustworthy computations have several articulated requirements that are inroduced in thepaper. As initial result; we introduce the notion that applications should be able to specify thecriteria to be privileged when executing computation on a grid. This specification can be bestspecified for computations organized according to workflows in that it is possible to specifydifferent criteria to be optimized for different tasks. In the paper we thus provide an initialdefinition of how a workflow specification can extended with the specification of thetrustworthiness criteria to be optimized.,DELOS Workshop: Digital Library Architectures,2004,1

To cope with this problem; the conceptof mediator has been introduced as a software component providing intermediate services;linking data resources and application programs; and making transparent the heterogeneityof the underlying systems. In designing a mediator architecture; we believe that an importantaspect is the definition of a formal framework by which one is able to model integrationaccording to a declarative style. To this purpose; the use of a logical approach seems verypromising. Another important aspect is the ability to model both static integration aspects;concerning query execution; and dynamic ones; concerning data updates and theirpropagation among the various data sources.

In this paper; weinvestigate the problem of index configuration in the framework of a commercially availableOODBMS. We first identify the features that characterize such OODBMS and we develop twocost models: the first extends the generic cost model presented by Gardarin etal.(Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Very Large Data Bases; 1996; 378–389); the second is an analytical cost model tailored to the OODBMS at hand.

The resulting model is very flexible in terms of theprotection requirements it can represent. Such flexibility requires a non trivial underlyingformal model. In particular; when inheritance and derivation rules are used simultaneously;there is need for conditions ensuring that the authorization base is free from ambiguities. Forthis purpose; we introduce a notion of safeness; and prove that it guarantees the absence ofambiguities and inconsistencies in the specification.,*,2000,1

Structural signatures: How to authenticate trees without leaking,Ashish Kundu; Elisa Bertino,Abstract—Data sharing over a third-party distribution framework such as the cloudcomputing paradigm requires that both data authenticity and confidentiality be assured. Oneof the most widely used data organization structures is the tree structure. When suchstructures encode sensitive information (such as in XML documents); it is crucial thatauthenticity and confidentiality be assured not only for the content; but also for the structure.There is a plethora of work on data authentication in the literature; however; none of themaddress the problem of leakage-free authentication of tree-structured data; especially whensuch structures encode sensitive information (such as in XML documents). The most widelyused technique for trees is the Merkle hash technique (MHT); which however is known to be“not hiding”; ie; it leads to leakage of information. Most existing data authentication …,*,*,1
Android User Privacy Preserving Through Crowdsourcing,Bahman Rashidi; Carol Fung; Anh Nguyen; Tam Vu; Elisa Bertino,In current Android architecture; users have to decide whether an app is safe to use or not.Expert users can make savvy decisions to avoid unnecessary privacy breach. However; themajority of normal users are not technically capable or do not care to consider privacyimplications to make safe decisions. To assist the technically incapable crowd; we proposeDroidNet; an Android permission control framework based on crowdsourcing. At its core;DroidNet runs new apps under probation mode without granting their permission requestsup-front. It provides recommendations on whether to accept or reject the permissionrequests based on decisions from peer expert users. To seek expert users; we propose anexpertise ranking algorithm using a transitional Bayesian inference model.

Highly efficient randomized authentication in VANETs,Jian Kang; Dan Lin; Wei Jiang; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Considering the huge number of vehicles on the roads; Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks(VANETs) are envisioned to foster a variety of new applications ranging from road safetyenhancement to mobile entertainment. These new VANET applications all face a criticalchallenge which is to ensure the identity and location privacy of vehicles' owners whoparticipate in such ad-hoc network. In this paper; we propose a highly efficient randomizedauthentication protocol that leverages homomorphic encryption to allow each individualvehicle to self-generate any number of authenticated identities to achieve full anonymity inVANETs. The proposed protocol prevents vehicles from being tracked by any single partyincluding peer vehicles; service providers; authentication servers; and other infrastructure.Meanwhile; our protocol also provides traceability in case of any dispute.

PrivBioMTAuth: Privacy Preserving Biometrics-Based and User Centric Protocol for User Authentication From Mobile Phones,Hasini Gunasinghe; Elisa Bertino,We introduce a privacy preserving biometrics-based authentication solution by which userscan authenticate to different service providers from mobile phones without involving identityproviders in the transactions. Authentication is performed via zero-knowledge proof ofknowledge; based on a cryptographic identity token that encodes the biometric identifier ofthe user and a secret provided by the user; making it three-factor authentication. Ourapproach for generating a unique; repeatable; and revocable biometric identifier from theuser's biometric image is based on a machine learning-based classification technique;which involves the features extracted from the user's biometric image. We have implementeda prototype of the proposed authentication solution and evaluated our solution with respectto its performance; security; and privacy.

Pareto Optimal Security Resource Allocation for Internet of Things,Antonino Rullo; Daniele Midi; Edoardo Serra; Elisa Bertino,Abstract In many Internet of Thing (IoT) application domains security is a critical requirement;because malicious parties can undermine the effectiveness of IoT-based systems bycompromising single components and/or communication channels. Thus; a securityinfrastructure is needed to ensure the proper functioning of such systems even under attack.However; it is also critical that security be at a reasonable resource and energy cost. In thisarticle; we focus on the problem of efficiently and effectively securing IoT networks bycarefully allocating security resources in the network area. In particular; given a set ofsecurity resources R and a set of attacks to be faced A; our method chooses the subset of Rthat best addresses the attacks in A; and the set of locations where to place them; thatensure the security coverage of all IoT devices at minimum cost and energy consumption …,ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security (TOPS),2017,*

Detection of Temporal Insider Threats to Relational Databases,Asmaa Sallam; Elisa Bertino,The mitigation of insider threats against databases is a challenging problem as insidersoften have legitimate access privileges to sensitive data. Therefore; conventional securitymechanisms; such as authentication and access control; may be insufficient for theprotection of databases against insider threats and need to be complemented withtechniques that support real-time detection of access anomalies. The existing real-timeanomaly detection techniques consider anomalies in references to the database entities andthe amounts of accessed data. However; they are unable to track the access frequencies.According to recent security reports; an increase in the access frequency by an insider is anindicator of a potential data misuse and may be the result of malicious intents for stealing orcorrupting the data.

Extending social networks with delegation,Adnan Ahmad; Brian Whitworth; Furkh Zeshan; Elisa Bertino; Robert Friedman,Abstract Despite their enormous growth; current social networks lack a systematic approachto delegate rights–when an entity authorizes another to access the resources on its behalf.This paper proposes a delegation model based on socio-technical design and theory ofcooperation and collaboration that best suits the requirements of social networks. The modelis formulated through formal methods; designed using ontologies and implemented throughFacebook APIs. The model's expressiveness is examined for overlapping policies of multipleusers; its consistency is analyzed for conflicting and redundant policies and user acceptancetesting is performed for acceptability. For social validity; the model is also compared with 27previous delegation models with respect to socio-technical validity parameters derived fromsocial principles already accepted in the human society.,Computers & Security,2017,*
Detecting deceptive engagement in social media by temporal pattern analysis of user behaviors: a survey,Qian Xiao; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Deceptive engagement in social media; such as spamming; commenting; or ratingwith automatic scripts; spreading fabricated facts; seriously affects users' trust on onlineservices.

Secure Seamless Bluetooth Low Energy Connection Migration for Unmodified IoT Devices,Syed Rafiul Hussain; Shagufta Mehnaz; Shahriar Nirjon; Elisa Bertino,At present; Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is dominantly used in commercially availableInternet of Things (IoT) devices-such as smart watches; fitness trackers; and smartappliances. Compared to classic Bluetooth; BLE has been simplified in many ways thatinclude its connection establishment; data exchange; and encryption processes.Unfortunately; this simplification comes at a cost. For example; only a star topology issupported in BLE environments and a peripheral (an IoT device) can communicate with onlyone gateway (eg a smartphone; or a BLE hub) at any given set time. When a peripheralgoes out of range and thus loses connectivity to a gateway; it cannot connect andseamlessly communicate with another gateway without user interventions.

Privacy-Preserving Multi-Party Analytics over Arbitrarily Partitioned Data,Shagufta Mehnaz; Elisa Bertino,Data-driven business processes are gaining popularity among enterprises now-a-days. Inmany situations; multiple parties would share data towards a common goal if it werepossible to simultaneously protect the privacy of the individuals and organizations describedin the data. Existing solutions for multi-party analytics require parties to transfer their rawdata to a trusted mediator; who then performs the desired analysis on the global data; andshares the results with the parties. Unfortunately; such a solution does not fit manyapplications where privacy is a strong concern such as healthcare; finance and the internet-of-things. Motivated by the increasing demands for data privacy; in this paper; we study theproblem of privacy-preserving multi-party analytics; where the goal is to enable analytics onmulti-party data without compromising the data privacy of each individual party.

Isolating Misbehaving Nodes in MANETs with an Adaptive Trust Threshold Strategy,Muhammad Saleem Khan; Daniele Midi; Majid I Khan; Nadeem Javaid; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Due to dynamic network topology; distributed architecture and absence of acentralized authority; Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) are vulnerable to various attacksfrom misbehaving nodes. To enhance the security of MANETs; various trust-based schemeshave been proposed that augment the traditional cryptography-based security schemes.However; most of these schemes use static and predefined trust thresholds for nodemisbehavior detection; without taking into consideration the network conditions locally ateach node. Using static trust thresholds for misbehavior detection may result in high falsepositives; low malicious node detection rate; and network partitioning. In this paper; wepropose a novel Adaptive Trust Threshold (ATT) strategy that adapts the trust threshold inthe routing protocol according to the network conditions such as rate of link changes …,Mobile Networks and Applications,2017,*

Fine-Grained Analysis of Packet Loss in MANETs,Muhammad Saleem Khan; Daniele Midi; Majid Iqbal Khan; Elisa Bertino,Most existing trust-based security schemes for mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) considerpacket loss an indicator of possible attacks by malicious nodes. There may be severalreasons for packet losses; such as interference; queue overflow; and node mobility.Identifying the real underlying cause of a packet loss event is important for any securitysolution. To detect truly malicious nodes; it is necessary to carry out a fine-grained analysis(FGA) to determine the underlying cause of such loss. Without such analysis; theperformance of any security solution may degrade; due to the punishment of innocent nodeswhile actual malicious nodes may remain undetected. Therefore; approaches are requiredthat can correctly identify the reason for packet losses and can react accordingly.

Introduction to Data Security and Privacy,Elisa Bertino,Issues around data security [1]; trustworthiness [2]; and privacy [3] are today under greaterfocus than ever before. Technological advances; such as sensors; smart mobile devices;Internet of things (IoTs); and novel systems; and applications; such as cloud systems; cyber–physical systems; social networks; and smart and connected health care; are makingpossible to capture; process; share; and use huge amounts of data from everywhere and atevery time; and to extract knowledge and predict trends from these data [3]. The widespreadand intensive use of data for many different tasks makes; however; data security;trustworthiness; and privacy increasingly critical requirements. For example; the availabilityof multiple datasets; which can be easily combined and analyzed; makes it very easy to infersensitive information. Such issue may make data sharing more difficult; if at all possible …,Data Science and Engineering,2016,*
Protecting Against Velocity-Based; Proximity-Based; and External Event Attacks in Location-Centric Social Networks,Gabriel Ghinita; Maria Luisa Damiani; Claudio Silvestri; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Mobile devices with positioning capabilities allow users to participate in novel andexciting location-based applications. For instance; users may track the whereabouts of theiracquaintances in location-aware social networking applications (eg; Foursquare).Furthermore; users can request information about landmarks in their proximity. Suchscenarios require users to report their coordinates to other parties; which may not be fullytrusted. Reporting precise locations may result in serious privacy violations; such asdisclosure of lifestyle details; sexual orientation; and so forth. A typical approach to preservelocation privacy is to generate a cloaking region (CR) that encloses the user position.However; if locations are continuously reported; an attacker can correlate CRs from multipletimestamps to accurately pinpoint the user position within a CR.

User Preference Based Link Inference for Social Network,Yuqing Sun; Haoran Xu; Elisa Bertino; Demin Li,In this paper; we focus on the link predication problem in social networks. Our approach isbased on the observation that there is a large amount of social behavior taking place everyday which contains substantial information about user intrinsic characteristics that influencethe dynamics of social networks. In order to obtain a deeper understanding of user behavior;we introduce the concept of latent factor to capture the motivation behind social activities.Since user relationships are often asymmetric; we also take into account bilateral userwishes with respect to friend as preferences; which is beyond traditional approaches oroverall measurements. Two combination modes are proposed; independent fusion andinterdependent fusion; to integrate these hybrid metrics with traditional measurements forlink inference. In order to quantify the sensitivity of each element in metrics we use …,Web Services (ICWS); 2016 IEEE International Conference on,2016,*

A Context-Aware System to Secure Enterprise Content,Oyindamola Oluwatimi; Daniele Midi; Elisa Bertino,Abstract In this paper; we present an architecture and implementation of a secure;automated; proximity-based access control that we refer to as Context-Aware System toSecure Enterprise Content (CASSEC). Using the pervasive WiFi and Bluetooth wirelessdevices as components in our underlying positioning infrastructure; CASSEC addresses twoproximity-based scenarios often encountered in enterprise environments: Separation of Dutyand Absence of Other Users. The first scenario is achieved by using Bluetooth MACaddresses of nearby occupants as authentication tokens. The second scenario exploits theinterference of WiFi received signal strength when an occupant crosses the line of sight(LOS). Regardless of the scenario; information about the occupancy of a particular locationis periodically extracted to support continuous authentication.

Providing different degrees of recency,V Atlur; E Bertino; S Jajodia,Abstract Although several secure multiversion concurrency protocols have been proposedby researchers; only two protocols produce histories that are one-copy serializable—oneproposed by Keefe and Tsai and the other by Jajodia and Atluri. However; neither of theseare completely satisfactory. Keefe and Tsai protocol sacrifices recency for correctness byproviding a high transaction with very old versions of low data. Jajodia and Atluri protocol;on the other hand; sacrifices performance for correctness by making high transactions thatread low data wait before they can commit. The first contribution of this paper is to providedifferent recency options to transactions; where each transaction can receive data with adesired degree of recency. These options are provided without sacrificing one-copyserializability. In fact; we propose four types of degrees of recency and present protocols …,Database Security IX: Status and prospects,2016,*

Monitoring DBMS activity for detecting data exfiltration by insiders,Elisa Bertino; Lorenzo Bossi; Syed Rafiul Hussain; Asmaa Sallam,Abstract Data represents one of the most important assets of an organization. The undesiredrelease (exfiltration) of sensitive or proprietary data outside of the organization is one of themost severe threats of insider cyber-attacks. A malicious insider who has the propercredentials to access organizational databases may; over time; send data outside theorganizations network through a variety of channels; such as email; file transfer; webuploads; or specialized HTTP requests that encapsulate the data. Existing security tools fordetecting cyber-attacks focus on protecting the boundary between the organization and theoutside world. While such tools may be effective in protecting an organization from externalattacks; they are less suitable if the data is being transmitted from inside the organization tothe outside by an insider who has the proper credentials to access; retrieve; and transmit …,Proceedings of the 16th Annual Information Security Symposium,2015,*
Privacy-enhancing features of identidroid,Daniele Midi; Oyindamola Oluwatimi; Bilal Shebaro; Elisa Bertino,Abstract As privacy today is a major concern for mobile systems; network anonymizers arewidely available on smartphones systems; such as Android. However; in many casesapplications are still able to identify the user and the device by means different from the IPaddress. Our work provides two solutions that address this problem by providing application-level anonymity. The first solution shadows sensitive data that can reveal the user identity.The second solutions dynamically revokes Android application permissions associated withsensitive information at run-time. In addition; both solutions offer protection from applicationsthat identify their users through traces left in the application's data storage or by exchangingidentifying data messages.

Using such Web services;dynamic composition of atomic data type properties coupled with the context in which thedata is accessed may breach sensitive data that may not comply with the users preference atthe time of data collection. Thus; providing uniform access policies to such data can lead toprivacy problems. Some fairly recent research has focused on providing solutions fordynamic privacy policy management.

We described a solution given by Yi et al.[22] forthe mobile user to preserve his or her location privacy in kNN queries. The solution is builton the Paillier public-key cryptosystem 11] and can provide both location privacy and dataprivacy. In particular; the solution allows the mobile user to retrieve one type of POIs; forexample; k nearest car parks; without revealing to the LBS provider what type of points isretrieved.

Fully Homomorphic Encryption,Xun Yi; Russell Paulet; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Homomorphic encryption is a very useful tool with a number of attractiveapplications. However; the applications are limited by the fact that only one operation ispossible (usually addition or multiplication in the plaintext space) to be able to manipulatethe plaintext by using only the ciphertext. What would really be useful is to be able to utilizeboth addition and multiplication simultaneously. This would permit more manipulation of theplaintext by modifying the ciphertext. In fact; this would allow one without the secret key tocompute any efficiently computable function on the plaintext when given only the ciphertext.In this chapter; we introduce fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) techniques; which allowone to evaluate both addition and multiplication of plaintext; while remaining encrypted. Theconcept of FHE was introduced by Rivest [14] under the name privacy homomorphisms …,*,2014,*

POSTER: Performance signatures of mobile phone browsers,Bilal Shebaro; Di Jin; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Several fingerprinting techniques for computer browsers have been proposed tomake it possible to link together different browser sessions and possibly tie them to a useridentity. As most of these techniques depend on static browser characteristics and user-installed plugins; the resulting fingerprints are not suitable for mobile browsers because ofthe similarity of browser characteristics on similar mobile device products in spite of thedifferences in software and hardware. Moreover; mobile devices are shipped with pre-installed plugins that cannot be modified; which limits browser uniqueness. Therefore; wepropose a dynamic mobile browser fingerprinting technique that records the browser'sbehavior and execution characteristics by running background customized browser scripts.Our dynamic technique is based on the use of Javascript; HTML5; Flash; and other scripts …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGSAC conference on Computer & communications security,2013,*

Panel discussion: Re-use of information and data in energy management,Gongzhu Hu; Gordon Lee; Stuart Rubin; Russell Tatro; Suresh Vadhva,With the current world economic crisis and the responsibility of all citizens to “go green”comes the need to provide efficient means for improving energy consumption. For example;the demand for electricity is at its peak during the summer months in general and during hotsummer days in particular. The increased use of electrical appliances; HVAC systems andelectric vehicles for residential customers; for example; plays a considerable role in thisdemand. However; usage of these appliances can be done in a more cost efficient mannerthrough scheduling; avoiding peak demand periods; and reducing consumption when thehome is vacated. So how can the research and technologies associated with information re-use and integration (IRI) be applied to alleviate the energy crisis? This panel focuses on theenergy management issue and looks at ways of applying information re-use principles to …,Information Reuse and Integration (IRI); 2013 IEEE 14th International Conference on,2013,*
Agent-based accountable grid computing systems,Wonjun Lee; Anna Squicciarini; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Accountability is an important aspect of any computer system. It assures that everyaction executed in the system can be traced back to some entity. Accountability is even morecrucial for assuring the safety and security of grid systems; given the very large number ofusers active in these sophisticated environments. However; no comprehensive approach toaccountability for grid systems presently exists. Our work addresses this inadequacy bydeveloping a comprehensive accountability system driven by policies and supported byaccountability agents. In this paper; we first discuss the requirements that have driven thedesign of our accountability system and then discuss the key elements of our accountabilityframework. We also show how accountability data can be used to detect anomaliesperformed by exploiting resources; such as computing power and/or network bandwidth …,The Journal of Supercomputing,2013,*
Efficient General Policy Decision by Using Mutable Variable Aware Cache,Liangxing Liu; Weili Han; Elisa Bertino; Tao Zhou; Xinyi Zhang,Performance is a key issue in the implementation of tools for policy-based management oflarge and complex networked systems. When a system is characterized by millions ofpolicies; the policy decision point is usually a performance bottleneck for the whole system.Although a few researchers have proposed cache-based methods to improve the efficiencyof the policy decision point; the mutable variables; eg; time; location; and temperature; areusually hard to be dealt with. The reason is that when applicable policies contain mutablevariables; the policy decision point has to re-evaluate conditions in policies for events withthe same targets. This paper thus proposes a novel Mutable Variable Aware Cachemechanism; by which the entries in the cache are aware of the mutable variables. Theconditions or sub-conditions that do not contain mutable variables in the applicable …,Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC); 2013 IEEE 37th Annual,2013,*
Towards Authenticated Objects,Daniele Midi; Ashish Kundu; Elisa Bertino,Abstract In many application domains; objects are transferred; shared; and used acrossorganizational and trust boundaries; which poses serious security concerns. Given theubiquitous use of objects; it is important to assure at program run-time that the objectsreceived and used have not been modified by any unauthorized program or entity; and arefrom the authorized programs. In this paper; we propose an authenticated model of objectsthat facilitates verification of authenticity of objects at program run-time and its possible Java-based implementations.,International Conference on Network and System Security,2013,*

FiPS: a file system provenance,Elisa Bertino,Abstract A file provenance system supports the automatic collection and management ofprovenance ie the complete processing history of a data object. File system levelprovenance provides functionality unavailable in the existing provenance systems. In thispaper; we discuss the design objectives for a flexible and efficient file provenance systemand then propose the design of such a system; called FiPS. We design FiPS as a thinstackable file system for capturing provenance in a portable manner. FiPS can captureprovenance at various degrees of granularity; can transform provenance records into secureinformation; and can direct the resulting provenance data to various persistent storagesystems.,Proceedings of the 14th Annual Information Security Symposium,2013,*
DBMask: encrypted query processing over an encrypted database,Mohamed Nabeel; Jianneng Cao; Mohamed Sarfraz; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Many organizations are moving their data to cloud based relational databases tomanage their data due to many economical benefits it offers. However; there are many otherorganizations hesitant to move their sensitive data to the cloud due to security and privacyconcerns. One such concern is the confidentiality of the data stored in a relational cloud.Most commonly utilized technique is to encrypt the data before uploading to the cloud.However; a simple encryption negates the benefits provided by a relational database andmakes it difficult to control access to the data. In this work; we propose an approach topreserve the confidentiality of the data stored in a relational database in the cloud whilesupporting relational operations over encrypted data. Further; our solution supports fine-grained access control when executing SQL queries over encrypted relational data. Our …,Proceedings of the 14th Annual Information Security Symposium,2013,*
PostgreSQL anomaly detector,Bilal Shebaro; Asmaa Sallam; Ashish Karma; Elisa Bertino,Abstract We propose to demonstrate the design; implementation; and the capabilities of ananomaly detection (AD) system integrated with a relational database management system(DBMS). Our AD system is trained by extracting relevant features from the parse-treerepresentation of the SQL commands; and then uses the DBMS roles as the classes for thebayesian classifier. In the detection phase; the maximum apriori probability role is chosen bythe classifier which; if not matching the role associated with the SQL command; raises analarm. We have implemented such system in the PostgreSQL DBMS; integrated with thestatistics collection and the query processing mechanism of the DBMS. During thedemonstration; our audience will be given the choice of training our system using eithersynthetic role-based SQL query traces based on probability sampling; or by entering their …,Proceedings of the 14th Annual Information Security Symposium,2013,*

Privacy Preserving Context Aware Publish Subscribe Systems 2013-1,Mohamed Nabeel; Stefan Appel; Elisa Bertino; Alejandro Buchmann,Abstract. Publish/subscribe (pub/sub) systems support highly scalable; many- to-many communicationsamong loosely coupled publishers and subscribers. Mod- ern pub/sub systems perform messagerouting based on the message content and allow subscribers to receive messages related totheir subscriptions and the cur- rent context. However; both content and context encode sensitiveinformation which should be protected from third-party brokers that make routing decisions. Inthis work; we address this issue by proposing an approach for constructing a privacy preservingcontext-based pub/sub system. In particular; our approach as- sures the confidentiality of themessages being published and subscriptions being issued while allowing the brokers to makerouting decisions without decrypting individual messages and subscriptions; and without learningthe context. Further; subscribers with a frequently changing context such as location are …,*,2013,*

Efficient and flexible attribute policy based key management,Mohamed Nabeel; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Attribute based systems enable fine-grained access control among a group of userseach identified by a set of attributes. Broadcast services and secure collaborativeapplications; such as location based services; cloud storage services; multimedia streamingservices and document dissemination; need such flexible attribute based systems formanaging and distributing group keys. However; current group key management schemesare not well designed to manage group keys based on the attributes of the group members.Attribute based group membership policies allow to select any sub-group of users from alarge group of users. In this poster; we propose novel key management schemes that allowusers whose attributes satisfy a certain group membership policy to derive the group key.Our schemes efficiently support rekeying operations when the group changes due to joins …,Proceedings of the 12th Annual Information Security Symposium,2011,*

3 CHAPTER Security for Distributed Systems: Foundations of Access Control,Elisa Bertino; Jason Crampton,A computer system is typically used to store information and run programs that manipulatedata. Users interact with the system by reading from and writing to files containing data; or byexecuting programs that perform computations with that data. The basic goals of computersecurity are to prevent unauthorized disclosure and unauthorized modification of data [1]. Inother words; computer security mechanisms seek to preserve the confidentiality and integrityof the data stored in a computer system. Additionally; computer systems must guarantee theavailability of information to authorized users. The focus of this chapter is on the part thataccess control has to play in preserving confidentiality and integrity. Access control isconcerned with protecting resources from unauthorized access. In particular; confidentialityis addressed by limiting the files that users can read; while integrity is addressed by …,Information Assurance: Dependability and Security in Networked Systems,2010,*
JTAM-A Joint Threshold Administration Model,Ashish Kamra; Elisa Bertino,We propose a Joint Threshold Administration Model (JTAM) for performing certain criticaland sensitive database operations such as user/role permission assignment; user/rolecreation; and so forth. The key idea is that a JTAM enabled operation is incomplete unless itis authorized by at least k-1 additional DBAs. We present the design details of JTAM basedon a cryptographic threshold signature scheme. We implement JTAM in the PostgreSQLDBMS; and demonstrate the execution of the JTAM enabled SQL GRANT command. Wealso show how to prevent malicious modifications to the JTAM enabled operations.,Policies for Distributed Systems and Networks (POLICY); 2010 IEEE International Symposium on,2010,*

However; security reports clearly reveal that anincreasing number of threats come presently from insiders which; being legally authorized tohave access to corporate resources; can exploit system vulnerabilities and data breaches toget access to systems and information. Actually; insiders can cause significant damages toenterprises; companies; and even countries; they can threaten enterprises' reputation;weaken their national and international competitiveness; and compromise their overallbusiness.

PSAC: privilege state-based access control,Ashish Kamra; Elisa Bertino,Abstract We propose an access control model specifically developed to support fine-graineddecision semantics for the results of access control decisions. To achieve such semantics;the model introduces the concept of privilege states and orientation modes in the context ofa role-based access control system. The central idea in our model is that privileges;assigned to a user or role; have a state attached to them; thereby resulting in a privilegestates based access control (PSAC) system. In this paper; we present the design details anda formal model of PSAC tailored to database management systems (DBMSs). PSAC hasbeen designed to also take into account role hierarchies that are often present in the accesscontrol models of current DBMSs. We have implemented PSAC in the PostgreSQL DBMSand in the paper; we discuss relevant implementation issues. We also report …,Proceedings of the 11th Annual Information Security Symposium,2010,*
Preserving privacy in policy-based content dissemination,Mohamed Nabeel; Ning Shang; Elisa Bertino,Abstract We propose a novel scheme for selective distribution of content; encoded asdocuments; that preserves the privacy of the users to whom the documents are deliveredand is based on an efficient and novel group key management scheme. Our documentbroadcasting approach is based on access control policies specifying which users canaccess which documents; or subdocuments. Based on such policies; a broadcast documentis segmented into multiple subdocuments; each encrypted with a different key. In line withmodern attribute-based access control; policies are specified against identity attributes ofusers. Our approach is the first to achieve the following three strong privacy and securityguarantees in such a push based system:(1) Users are granted access to a specificdocument; or subdocument; according to the policies.(2) The document publisher does …,Proceedings of the 11th Annual Information Security Symposium,2010,*

L'Elimination de la subjectivité dans la recommandation de confiance,Omar Hasan; Lionel Brunie; Jean-Marc Pierson; Elisa Bertino,Abstract In ubiquitous environments; a party who wishes to make a transaction oftenrequires that it has a certain level of trust in the other party. It is frequently the case that theparties are unknown to each other and thus share no preexisting trust. Trust-based systemsenable users to establish trust in unknown users through trust recommendation from knownusers. For example; Bob may choose to trust an unknown user Carol when he receives arecommendation from his friend Alice that Carol's trustworthiness is 0.8 on the interval [0; 1].In this paper we highlight the problem that when a trust value is recommended by one userto another it may lose its real meaning due to subjectivity. Bob may regard 0.8 as a very highvalue of trust but it is possible that Alice perceived this same value as only average. Wepresent a solution for the elimination of subjectivity from trust recommendation. We run …,Proceedings of the 5th French-Speaking Conference on Mobility and Ubiquity Computing,2009,*
Guest Editorial: Special Section on Service-Oriented Distributed Computing Systems,Elisa Bertino; William Cheng-Chung Chu,Recent developments in service-oriented computing and grid computing have led to therapid adoption of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) in distributed computing systems. Oneof the most important advantages of SOA is the capability of enabling a rapid composition ofservices provided by various providers through networks for distributed applications andintegration of the systems. In their paper; Yau et al. propose a performance-modelorientedapproach to developing adaptive service-based software systems (SBS). This approach isbased on establishing performance models for SBS through controlled experiments; andthen developing QOS monitoring and adaptation modules based on the performancemodels and validating the adaptive SBS design through simulations.

Biometrics and identity management in healthcare applications,C Blomeke; SK Modi; E Bertino; SJ Elliott,Abstract The long term objective of this research is to provide a model for the delivery ofidentity management services to a diverse range of healthcare applications.. This is achallenge; due to various regulations and requirements that are unique to the healthcaresystem. Healthcare applications require a strong form of authentication; which goes beyondthe capabilities of passwords; based on what you remember; and tokens; based on what youhave. Healthcare applications are now considering biometrics as a potential authenticationmethodology. Biometrics is the automated recognition of humans based on biological andbehavioral traits; like fingerprint recognition etc. This research proposes the development ofan identity management model and in doing so provides the healthcare system withknowledge about the efficacy of biometrics in various healthcare applications.,Proceedings of the 10th Annual Information Security Symposium,2009,*

However nosuch technique exists for graphs; even though graphs are one of the most widely used dataorganization structures. Techniques exist for directed acyclic graphs and trees; which arerestricted forms of graphs. Such techniques are integrity-preserving (binding) but notconfidentiality-preserving (hiding); which lead to leakage of sensitive information duringintegrity verification. The recently proposed structural signature scheme for trees is bothbinding and hiding; however is not suitable for graphs.

Homomorphic Encryption,Ninghui Li,A hash function is a well-defined deterministic algorithm that takes as input data of arbitrarylength and produces a short fixed-length digital representation of the data; or a digest; as itsoutput. The output of a hash function can serve the role of a digital ''fingerprint''of the inputdata; as an important design property of hash functions is that of collision resilience: twohashes produced on different inputs are very unlikely to result in the same value.Furthermore; given a hash function output; it is normally infeasible to find a (previouslyunseen) input that matches that output (this property is called preimage resistance).,*,2009,*

Several privacyparadigms have been proposed that preserve privacy by placing constraints on the value ofreleased QIDs. However; in order to enforce these paradigms; data publishers need tools toassist them in selecting a suitable anonymization method and choosing the right systemparameters. We developed TIAMAT; a tool for analysis of anonymization techniques whichallows data publishers to assess the accuracy and overhead of existing anonymizationtechniques. The tool performs interactive; head-to-head comparison of anonymizationtechniques; as well as QID change-impact analysis. Other features include collection ofattribute statistics; support for multiple information loss metrics and compatibility with …,*,2009,*

Privacy-Preserving Accountable Accuracy Management Systems (PAAMS),Roshan K Thomas; Ravi Sandhu; Elisa Bertino; Budak Arpinar; Shouhuai Xu,Abstract We argue for the design of “Privacy-preserving Accountable Accuracy ManagementSystems (PAAMS)”. The designs of such systems recognize from the onset that accuracy;accountability; and privacy management are intertwined. As such; these systems have todynamically manage the tradeoffs between these (often conflicting) objectives. For example;accuracy in such systems can be improved by providing better accountability links betweenstructured and unstructured information. Further; accuracy may be enhanced if access toprivate information is allowed in controllable and accountable ways. Our proposed approachinvolves three key elements. First; a model to link unstructured information such as thatfound in email; image and document repositories with structured information such as that intraditional databases.

Tagging Stream Data for Rich RealTime,Rimma Nehme; Elke Rundensteiner; Elisa Bertino,Abstract In recent years; data streams have become ubiquitous as technology is improvingand the prices of portable devices are falling; eg; sensor networks; location-based services.Most data streams transmit only data tuples based on which continuous queries areevaluated. In this paper; we propose to enrich data streams with a new type of metadatacalled streaming tags or short tick-tags1. The fundamental premise of tagging is that userscan label data using uncontrolled vocabulary; and these tags can be exploited in a widevariety of applications; such as data exploration; data search; and to produce “enriched” withadditional semantics; thus more informative query results. In this paper we focus primarily onthe problem of continuous query processing with streaming tags and tagged objects; andaddress the tick-tag semantic issues as well as efficiency concerns.

Access control and privacy in location-aware applications,Maria Luisa Damiani,Abstract The topic addressed in this thesis concerns the relationship between spatialknowledge and information protection in a mobile setting. The proliferation of mobile devicesin an increasingly connected world raises growing concern for information security andprivacy. For example; sensitive data recorded in corporate and networked informationsystems can be accessed from uncontrolled locations; downloaded on mobile terminals anddisclosed to unauthorized third parties. The protection of information against improper useand modification in a mobile context poses research questions which solicit the investigationof unconventional protection strategies. In such a perspective; this thesis investigates how toprovide strong control over information access based on knowledge of location andmovement of individuals. Indeed; the use of spatial information for secure access support …,*,2008,*

Database Intrusion Detection and Response,Ashish Kamra; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Why is it important to have an intrusion detection (ID) mechanism tailored for adatabase management system (DBMS)? There are three main reasons for this. First; actionsdeemed malicious for a DBMS are not necessarily malicious for the underlying operatingsystem or the network; thus ID systems designed for the latter may not be effective againstdatabase attacks. Second; organizations have stepped up data vigilance driven by variousgovernment regulations concerning data management such as SOX; GLBA; HIPAA and soforth. Third; and this is probably the most relevant reason; the problem of insider threats isbeing recognized as a major security threat; its solution requires among other techniquesthe adoption of mechanisms able to detect access anomalies by users internal to theorganization owning the data.,International Workshop on Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection,2008,*

Continuous security policy enforcement in streaming environments,Rimma V Nehme; Hyo-Sang Lim; Elisa Bertino,Abstract The management of privacy and security in the context of data stream managementsystems (DSMS) remains largely an unaddressed problem to date. Unlike in traditionalDBMSs where access control policies are persistently stored on the server and tend toremain stable; in streaming applications the contexts and with them the access controlpolicies on the real-time data may rapidly change. We propose a novel" stream-centric"approach; where security restrictions are not persistently stored on the server; but ratherstreamed together with the data. The data provider access control policies are expressed viasecurity constraints called" data security punctuations"(or short; dsps). Server-side policiesare specified by administrators in the form of" continuous policy queries" which emit querysecurity constraints called" query security punctuations"(or short; qsps).

Security services for healthcare applications,Lorenzo D Martino; Suchit Ahuja; Elisa Bertino,Abstract The federal government has mandated an Electronic Medical Record (EMR)initiative that will convert paper medical records into electronic records for all citizens by2012. But; this will pose a challenge to the maintenance of security and privacy of medicaldata. In order for compliance with regulatory laws like HIPAA and GBLA; it is important toadhere to strict security and privacy controls. Now patients are demanding more control overtheir own health records and this has initiated researchers and healthcare organizations todevelop the Personal Health Record (PHR). PHRs will provide patients with control overparts of their own medical information as well as the ability to control accessibility to it. Anexample of a PHR would be the recently launched Microsoft HealthVault application.

Thesevariations ultimately affect performance rates of the overall fingerprint recognition system.Fingerprint images captured using the same sensor technology during enrollment andrecognition phases will introduce similar distortions; thus making it easier to compensate forsuch distortions and reducing its effect on the performance of the overall fingerprintrecognition system. However; an impact on performance is expected; but unpredictable;when different fingerprint sensor technologies are used during enrollment and recognitionphases.

Policies models and tools for collaborative applications,Elisa Bertino,Policies are at the heart of any assured information sharing infrastructure for collaborativeapplications and may include those for access control; trust and accountability. Policies canbe a key component in deciding what and how much to reveal in the discovery stage for bothinformation seekers and providers. Policies can also drive the process of negotiation in theacquisition and release stage. Policies are needed to monitor and enforce usage control aswell as for auditing and accountability. Fine-grained policy integration algorithms areneeded to support dynamic coalitions and virtual organizations that need to quickly shareand integrate information. Policies must adapt; based on events and contexts; to supportcontinuous access to critical information resources.

Lava Flow Invasion Hazard map of the Southern Rift (Mount Etna; Italy),G Groppelli; G Norini; B Aldighieri; E Bertino; F Comoglio; ML Damiani; C Silvestri,Abstract We present an integrated approach and a multidisciplinary methodology to compilevolcanic hazard map for lava flow invasion. In addition we display an application of theproposed methodology to a sector of Mount Etna; the Southern Rift; one of the most activeareas of the Volcano (Behncke & Neri; 2003). The basis and the starting point are a detailedgeological and structural survey and a high-resolution stratigraphy (at 1: 10;000 scale) thatallow us to recognize and to map about 30 lava flows along the Southern Rift. Thegeological data (lava flow emission point location; relative or historical age; length andoutcropping area) are organized in a geographic database. In addition GIS softwareanalyses (Groppelli & Norini; 2005); statistical tests and probabilistic lava flow model(Damiani et al.; 2006) are applied.

A Fine-Grained Access Control Model for Semantic Databases,S Franzoni; P Mazzoleni; E Bertino; S Valtolina,A growing number of domains is adopting semantic models as a centralized gateway tomultiple data sources; or directly to store relevant information. In such contexts; grantingaccess to the semantic model and its data only to the authorized users is a crucialrequirement. In this paper; we present a fine-grained access control model specificallytailored to regulate access to semantic models. One of the most relevant features of themodel is the granularity of the resources that can be protected. In fact; access control can beenforced at the level of both the model's entities and the entities' instances. Authorizationdecisions are determined by the evaluation of access control policies. An implementation ofthe proposed model adopting the XACML standard and the SeRQL query language is alsodiscussed.,European Semantic Web Conference (ESWC),2007,*
Modeling and language support for the management of pattern-bases,Panos Vassiliadis; Spiros Skiadopoulos; Elisa Bertino; Barbara Catania; Anna Maddalena; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract Information overloading is today a serious concern that may hinder the potential ofmodern web-based information systems. A promising approach to deal with this problem isrepresented by knowledge extraction methods able to produce artifacts (also calledpatterns) that concisely represent data. Patterns are usually quite heterogeneous andvoluminous. So far; little emphasis has been posed on developing an overall integratedenvironment for uniformly representing and querying different types of patterns. In this paperwe consider the larger problem of modeling; storing; and querying patterns; in a database-like setting and use a Pattern-Base Management System (PBMS) for this purpose.Specifically;(a) we formally define the logical foundations for the global setting of patternmanagement through a model that covers data; patterns; and their intermediate mappings …,*,2007,*

In this paper; we present a novel frameworkfor enforcing access control in conversation-based Web services. Our approach takes intoaccount the conversational nature of Web services. This is in contrast with existingapproaches to access control enforcement that assume a Web service as a set ofindependent operations. Furthermore; our approach achieves a tradeoff between the needto protect Web service's access control policies and the need to disclose to clients theportion of access control policies related to the conversations they are interested in.

Such systems howeverpresent however several challenges; related to privacy; reliability; security of the biometricdata. Inter-operability is also required among the devices used for the authentication.Moreover; very often biometric authentication in itself is not sufficient as a conclusive proof ofidentity and has to be complemented with multiple other proofs of identity like passwords;SSN; or other user identifiers.

The DHX Project,S Valtolina; S Franzoni; P Mazzoleni; E Bertino,Abstract This paper presents the reconstruction of a typical Italian theatre from the first half ofthe XIX century carried out by an immersive virtual reality simulation; accessible by multipleusers at the same time. A key distinguishing feature of our system is that it is highlyinteractive. Visitors can not only explore the environment; but also interact with it accordingto different modes: through the help of a virtual guide; through a palmtop; or by means of adevice emulating a real scene machinery. In addition; visitors can change the environmentcontents by issuing database queries. As a results the contents of the presentation portionsare dynamically modified to reflect the query results.,Post-proceedings of the First Italian Research Conference on Digital Library Management Systems (IRCDL 2005),2005,*

Establishing and Protecting Digital Identity in Federation Systems,Anna C Squicciarini; Elisa Bertino,ABSTRACT We develop solutions for the security and privacy of user identity information ina federation. By federation we mean a group of organizations or service providers whichhave built trust among each other and enable sharing of user identity information amongstthemselves. We first propose a flexible approach to establish a single sign-on (SSO) ID inthe federation. Then we show how a user can leverage this SSO ID to establish certified andun-certified user identity attributes without the dependence on PKI for user authentication.This makes the process more usable and privacy preserving. Our major contribution in thispaper is a novel solution for protection against identity theft of these identity attributes. Weprovide protocols based on cryptographic techniques; namely zero knowledge proofs anddistributed hash tables. We show how we can preserve privacy of the user identity without …,*,2005,*
Controlled and cooperative updates of XML documents in byzantine and failure prone distributed systems,ELISA BERTINO; YUNHUA KOGLIN,This paper proposes an infrastructure and related algorithms for the controlled andcooperative updates of XML documents. Key components of the proposed system are a setof XML-based languages for specifying access control policies and the path that thedocument must follow during its update. Such path can be fully specified before the updateprocess begins or can be dynamically modified by properly authorized subjects while beingtransmitted. Our approach is fully distributed in that each party involved in the process canverify the correctness of the operations performed till that point on the document withoutrelying on a central authority. More importantly; the recovery procedure also does not needthe participation of a central authority. Our approach is based on the use of some specialcontrol information that is transmitted together with the document and a suite of protocols …,ACM Transactions on Information and System Security,2005,*

The key features of the proposed approach include: an extensiveset of object types; a large variety of spatial and temporal relation types for combiningobjects into presentations; and relaxation techniques to automatically correct inconsistentspecifications. Furthermore; our approach organizes presentations according to a multi-page model to increase reusability of presentation fragments and to support flexible contentdelivery to final users. The proposed approach has been implemented in the HSGS systemthat provides a tool for automatically generating presentations; coded in SMIL; according tothe constraints specification given by presentation authors.,International Journal of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering,2004,*
On Comparing the Expressing Power of Access Control Model Frameworks,E Bertino; B Catania; E Ferrari; P Perlasca,Abstract One of the key requirements of an Adaptive Security Infrastructure (ASI) is the abilityof formally reasoning about the specified security policies. In this paper; we contribute to thisissue by focusing on one of the most relevant kind of security policies; ie; access controlpolicies. Several access control frameworks have been proposed so far in the literature;based on different formalisms. However; what has not yet so far extensively explored is thecomparison of the expressive power of such frameworks. We believe that this is a key issuesince such analysis can be the basis for choosing the framework that better fits the securityneeds of a given domain. This analysis is particular relevant for complex and distributedenvironments; like the ones in which the ASI paradigm may be usefully applied. The aim ofthis paper is thus to make a step in this direction by comparing the expressive power of …,FCS'04,2004,*

X-GTRBAC: an XML-based framework for distributed access control,Rafae Bhatti; James BD Joshi; Elisa Bertino; Arif Ghafoor,Abstract This research presents X-GTRBAC: A framework for distributed access control inopen systems. The X-GTRBAC framework is based on an XML-based GeneralizedTemporal extension of the well-known Role Based Access Control model; and provides fine-grained context-aware access control. A salient feature of the framework is that it allowsexpressing context-based constraints on resource accesses in distributed systems using anXML-based grammar specification called X-Grammar. This specification is derived from thewell-defined semantics of the underlying formal model. Hence; the framework enablesefficient and secure interoperation of heterogeneous domains across an enterprise. Itsupports decentralization of policy administration tasks through the X-GTRBAC Adminmodel. A prototype implementation of X-GTRBACv1. 2 version is available.

Privacy preserving data mining,E Bertino; I Nai Fovino; L Parasiliti Provenza,Abstract Securing data against intruders attacking implicit sensitive information is an openresearch problem. In order to make a publicly available system secure; we must ensure notonly that private sensitive data have been trimmed out; but also that certain inferencechannels have been blocked as well. Moreover; the need to make a system as open aspossible-to the degree that data sensitivity is not jeopardized-asks for techniques thataccount for the disclosure control of sensitive data. In this context an European project(Codmine) was developed in order to reach the following objectives:(a) Investigation of newtechniques for privacy preserving data mining;(b) Implementation and testing of newlyproposed techniques for privacy preserving data mining;(c) Specification of an evaluationframework in order to compare all the techniques in a common platform.,Proceedings of the 5th Annual Information Security Symposium,2004,*

A Decentralized Approach for Controlled Sharing of Resources in Virtual Communities,E Ferrari; AC Squicciarini; E Bertino,Abstract A Virtual Community is a composition of heterogeneous and independentlydesigned subsystems; focusing on large-scale resource sharing. One of the key aspects ofvirtual community management; is how to enforce a controlled and selective sharing ofresources in such a dynamic and decentralized environment. The traditional way is to haveall the access requests mediated by a trusted third-party. However; this approach has thedrawback that the third party can become a bottleneck for the whole system. By contrast; inthis paper we propose a decentralized approach to virtual community management thatrelies on a controlled sharing of rights and duties among community members. In the paper;besides dealing with community policy specification we provide a framework able tomanage all the phases of the the community life.,*,2004,*
Database Security,Chenyun Dai; Gabriel Ghinita; Elisa Bertino; Ji-won Byun; Ninghui Li,Abstract Releasing detailed data (microdata) about individuals poses a privacy threat; due tothe presence of quasi-identifier (QID) attributes such as age or zip code. Several privacyparadigms have been proposed that preserve privacy by placing constraints on the value ofreleased QIDs. However; in order to enforce these paradigms; data publishers need tools toassist them in selecting a suitable anonymization method and choosing the right systemparameters. We developed TIAMAT; a tool for analysis of anonymization techniques whichallows data publishers to assess the accuracy and overhead of existing anonymizationtechniques. The tool performs interactive; head-to-head comparison of anonymizationtechniques; as well as QID change-impact analysis.

Distributed Cooperative Updates of XML Documents,Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Giovanni Mella,Abstract Securing web documents entails addressing two key issues: privacy and integrity.Whereas the problem of privacy has been widely investigated; the problem of how to ensurethat a document; when moving among different parties; is modified only according to thestated policies still lack comprehensive solutions. In this paper we present a solution to thisproblem by proposing a model for specifying authoring policies; and an infrastructuresupporting the specification and enforcement of these policies in a distributed andcooperative environment. The key aspect of our proposal is that; by using a combination ofhash functions and digital signature techniques; a subject is able to verify; upon receiving adocument; whether the update operations performed on the document till that point arecorrect with respect to the authoring policies; without interacting with the document server.,*,2003,*

Retrieval of semistructured Web data,Elisa Bertino; Mohand-Saïd Hacid; Farouk Toumani,Abstract The ability to manage data whose structure is less rigid and strict than inconventional databases is important in many new application areas; such as biologicaldatabases; digital libraries; data integration and Web databases. Such data is calledsemistructured; since it cannot be constrained by a fixed predefined schema: the informationthat is normally associated with a schema is contained within the data; which is sometimescalled self-describing. Such data has recently emerged as a particularly interesting researchtopic in which new data modelling and querying techniques are investigated. In this paper;we consider how constraint-based technology can be used to query and reason aboutsemistructured data. The constraint system FT≤[37] provides information orderingconstraints interpreted over feature trees. Here; we show how a generalization of FT≤ …,*,2003,*

Receipt Management-Transaction History based Trust Establishment,Jungha Woo; Elisa Bertino,ABSTRACT In a history-based trust-management system; users and service providers useinformation about past transactions to make trust-based decisions concerning currenttransactions. One category of such systems is represented by the reputation systems.However; despite the growing body of experience in building reputation systems; there areseveral limitations on how they are typically implemented. They often rely on scores that areevaluated by service providers and are often not reliable or well understood. We believe thatreputation has to be based on objective and reliable information. In such context; transactionhistories play an important role. In this paper; we present the VeryIDX system thatimplements an electronic receipt infrastructure and supports protocols to build and manageonline transaction history of users. The receipt protocols are shown to have several …,*,2002,*

The process includes inserting both legs of the bird into ashackle; then flipping and hanging the bird for subsequent processing. Unlike the traditionalarticulated robotic arm where the actuations are applied directly through the joint angles; thelegs of a live object can only be manipulated indirectly. In addition; natural objects aretypically characterized by varying sizes and shapes in batch processing and their naturalreflexes (or voluntarily motion) contribute to the overall dynamics. Specifically; this paperillustrates the operating principles of the transfer system and describes the method formanipulating the leg kinematics for shackling.

Panel: The next generation of acess control models (panel session): do we need them and what should they be?,Ravi Sandhu; Elisa Bertino; Jaeger Jaeger; Richard Kuhn; Carl Landwehr,Abstract Research on access control models was started in the 1960s and 1970s by the twothrusts of mandatory and discretionary access control. Mandatory access control (MAC)came from the military and national security arenas whereas discretionary access control(DAC) had its roots in academic and commercial research laboratories. These two thrustswere dominant through the 1970s and 1980s almost to exclusion of any other approach toaccess control models. In the 1990s we have seen a dramatic shift towards pragmatism. Thedominant access-control model of the 1990s is role-based access control (RBAC). It is nowunderstood that RBAC encompasses MAC and DAC as special cases and goes beyondthem in providing a policy-neutral framework. This SACMAT meeting has evolved from ahighly successful and productive series of ACM workshops on RBAC.

Protecting XML documents,Elisa Bertino,The World Wide Web (Web) has become the main information dissemination means inprivate and public organizations. As a consequence; several applications at both at Internet;and intranet levels need mechanisms supporting a selective access to data available overthe Web. In this context; developing an access control model system for data and documentsencoded according to XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is an important step. XML hasrecently emerged as the most relevant standardization effort in the area of documentrepresentation through markup languages. Its goal is to provide a language for encodingdocuments that is easier to learn and use than SGML and semantically richer than HTML.Because XML documents can contain information at different degrees of sensitivity; there isa strong need for models and mechanisms enabling the specification and enforcement of …,Computer Software and Applications Conference; 2000.

Hence; the attention is focused on deleteoperation and its implications on database security. The guidelines we propose are formallystated as security principles.

Protecting information in the Web-position paper,Elisa Bertino,Despite the growing interest; however; both public and private organizations are mainlyperforming cautious experiments and still refrain from massively using the Web and as theirmain information exchange medium. The reason of this apprehension is the insecurity of thecommunication channels and the lack of rules to regulate data accesses. The protection ofdata; while transmitted or stored at the servers; is now becoming the most critical issue toworry about. The problem is emphasized by the openness; the simplicity and the globalnature of the enabling technology.

An Execution Model for Multilevel Secure Workflows,Vijayalakshmi Atluri Wei-Kuang Huang; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Workflow management systems (WFMS) support the modeling and coordinatedexecution of processes within an organization. To coordinate the execution of the variousactivities (or tasks) in a workflow; task dependencies are specified among them. Asadvances in workflow management take place; they are also required to support security. Ina multilevel secure (MLS) workflow; tasks may belong to different security levels. Ensuringthe task dependencies from the tasks at higher security levels to those at lower security level(high-to-low dependencies) may compromise security. In this paper; we consider such MLSworkflows and show how they can In executed in a secure and correct manner. Ourapproach is based on semantic classification of the task dependencies that examines thesource of the task dependencies.

Emerging Applications,Elisa Bertino; Beng Chin Ooi; Ron Sacks-Davis; Kian-Lee Tan; Justin Zobel; Boris Shidlovsky; Barbara Catania,Abstract Because performance is a crucial issue in database systems; indexing techniqueshave always been an area of intense research and development. Advances in indexingtechniques are primarily driven from the need to support different data models; such as theobject-oriented data model; and different data types; such as image and text data. However;advances in computer architectures may also require significant extensions to traditionalindexing techniques. Such extensions are required to fully exploit the performance potentialof new architectures; such as in the case of parallel architectures; or to cope with limitedcomputing resources; such as in the case of mobile computing systems. New applicationareas also play an important role in dictating extensions to indexing techniques and inoffering wider contexts in which traditional techniques can be used.,*,1997,*
Temporal Databases,Elisa Bertino; Beng Chin Ooi; Ron Sacks-Davis; Kian-Lee Tan; Justin Zobel; Boris Shidlovsky; Barbara Catania,Abstract Apart from some primary keys and keys that rarely change; many attributes evolveand take new values over time. For example; in an employee relation; employees' titles maychange as they take on new responsibilities; as will their salaries as a result of promotion orincrement. Traditionally; when data is updated; its old copy is discarded and the most recentversion is captured. Conventional databases that have been designed to capture only themost recent data are known as snapshot databases. With the increasing awareness of thevalues of the history of data; maintenance of old versions of records becomes an importantfeature of database systems.,*,1997,*
Image Databases,Elisa Bertino; Beng Chin Ooi; Ron Sacks-Davis; Kian-Lee Tan; Justin Zobel; Boris Shidlovsky; Barbara Catania,Abstract Images have always been an essential and effective medium for presenting visualdata. With advances in today's computer technologies; it is not surprising that in manyapplications; much of the data is images. In medical applications; images such as X-rays;magnetic resonance images and computer tomography images are frequently generatedand used to support clinical decision making. In geographic information systems; maps;satellite images; demographics and even tourist information are often processed; analyzedand archived. In police department criminal databases; images like fingerprints and picturesof criminals are kept to facilitate identification of suspects. Even in offices; information mayarrive in many different forms (memos; documents; and faxes) that can be digitizedelectronically and stored as images.,*,1997,*

On the number of descendants in an object DAG,Boris Shidlovsky; Elisa Bertino,In object databases; relationships among different classes are often multivalued; that is; theyhave 1+ n or n+ m type. Thus; an object of a class can reference several objects of otherclasses and; in turn; be referenced by multiple objects of other classes. An object; and theobjects it directly or indirectly references; therefore form a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Insuch a DAG there is an edge from object o to object o'; if o references 0'. The object o'iscalled a direct descendant of o. Moreover; o includes as indirect descendants all objects thatare direct or indirect descendants of 0'. An essential component of query processingstrategies in object databases consists of navigations through the DAG. Because the datastructures for object storage and retrieval are often based on some DAG traversals [2]; thechoice of the most efficient data structure as well as the strategy for object navigation …,Information processing letters,1996,*

A Mathematical Model For Optimal Indexing In Object-Oriented Databases,Boris Shidlovsky; Elisa Bertino,Abstract A generalized approach to the problem of optimal indexing structures for navigationalong inheritance and aggregation hierarchies in object-oriented database systems isproposed. The approach is based on two main ideas. First; we use the notion of indexinggraphs for providing an abstract view of the indexing relationships among classes in thehierarchies. Second; we propose a mapping schema which reflects an indexing graph into B-tree-like data structures and develop the cost model for the basic workload operations. Thisreduces the query optimization and optimal indexing problems to standard shortest pathsand nonlinear integer programming problems. We detect the exponential complexity of theobtained optimization problem and give an efficient approximation method for the selectionof nearly optimal indexing structure. 1,*,1996,*

Index Configurations in Object-Oriented Databases.,Sunil Choenni; Elisa Bertino; Henk M Blanken; Thiel Chang,Abstract Several indexing techniques have been proposed to accelerate databaseoperations in object-oriented databases. A database operation gives rise to the processingof a path. We address the problem of optimal index con guration for a given logical schema;the workload de ned on the schema and some other database characteristics such as thecardinality of a class; page size; etc. As will be shown an optimal index con guration for theworkload can be achieved by splitting the paths into subpaths and by indexing each subpathoptimal. For the moment we take a limited number of existing indexing techniques intoaccount (simple index; inherited index; nested inherited-index; multi-index; and multi-inherited index) and the possibility of not indexing a (sub) path. However; the principles ofthe algorithm will remain the same adding more indexing techniques.,TOOLS (13),1994,*

Achieving Stricter Correctness Requirements in Multilevel Secure Database Management Systems,Vijayalakshmi Atluri; Sushil Jajodia; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Although high assurance multilevel secure database management systems(DBMSs) are slowly becoming commercially available; these systems have yet to offer aconcurrency control protocol that is free of signaling channels and produces serializable(one-copy serializable when multiple versions of data are maintained) histories. In thispaper; we consider the multiversion con currency control algorithm that has beenimplemented in the Trusted Oracle DBMS. It guarantees levelwise serializability; which is aweaker notion of correctness than one-copy serializability.,Journal of Computer Security,1993,*

LTEInspector: A Systematic Approach for Adversarial Testing of 4G LTE,Syed Rafiul Hussain; Omar Chowdhury; Shagufta Mehnaz; Elisa Bertino,Abstract—In this paper; we investigate the security and privacy of the three criticalprocedures of the 4G LTE protocol (ie; attach; detach; and paging); and in the process;uncover potential design flaws of the protocol and unsafe practices employed by thestakeholders. For exposing vulnerabilities; we propose a modelbased testing approachLTEInspector which lazily combines a symbolic model checker and a cryptographic protocolverifier in the symbolic attacker model. Using LTEInspector; we have uncovered 10 newattacks along with 9 prior attacks; categorized into three abstract classes (ie; security; userprivacy; and disruption of service); in the three procedures of 4G LTE. Notable among ourfindings is the authentication relay attack that enables an adversary to spoof the location of alegitimate user to the core network without possessing appropriate credentials.

Privacy Protection,Ji-won Byun; Elisa Bertino; Ninghui Li,Abstract As privacy becomes a major concern for both consumers and enterprises; manyresearch efforts have been devoted to the development of privacy protecting technology. Werecently proposed a privacy preserving access control model for relational databases; wherepurpose information associated with a given data element specifies the intended use of thedata element. In this paper; we extend our previous work to handle other advanced datamanagement systems; such as the ones based on XML and the ones based on the object-relational data model. Another contribution of our paper is that we address the problem ofhow to determine the purpose for which certain data are accessed by a given user. Ourproposed solution relies on the well-known RBAC model as well as the notion of conditionalrole which is based on the notions of role attribute and system attribute. 1.,*,*,*

Security for the Internet of Things,Elisa Bertino,Abstract The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm refers to the network of physical objects or"things" embedded with electronics; software; sensors; and connectivity to enable objects to exchangedata with servers; centralized systems; and/or other connected devices based on a variety ofcommunication infrastructures. IoT makes it possible to sense and control objects creating opportunitiesfor more direct integration between the physical world and computer-based systems. IoT willusher automation in a large number of application domains; ranging from manufacturing andenergy management (eg SmartGrid); to healthcare management and urban life (egSmartCity). However; because of its fine-grained; continuous and pervasive data acquisitionand control capabilities; IoT raises concerns about the security and privacy of data.

CERIAS Tech Report 2017-2 A Provenance-Aware Multi-Dimensional Reputation System For Online Rating Systems,Mohsen Rezvani; Aleksandar Ignjattovic; Elisa Bertino,Abstract. Online rating systems are widely accepted as means for quality assessment on theweb and users increasingly rely on these systems when de ciding to purchase an itemonline. This makes such rating systems frequent targets of attempted manipulation byposting unfair rating scores. Therefore; providing useful; realistic rating scores as well asdetecting unfair behavior are both of very high importance. Existing solutions are mostlymajority based; also employing temporal analysis and clustering techniques. However; theyare still vulnerable to unfair ratings. They also ignore distances between op tions; theprovenance of information and different dimensions of cast rating scores while computingaggregate rating scores and trustworthiness of users. In this paper; we propose a robustiterative algorithm which leverages infor mation in the profile of users and provenance of …,*,*,*

Thesis/Dissertation Acceptance,Mohamed Raouf Fouad; Elisa Bertino; Sunil Prabhakar; Arif Ghafoor; Guy Lebanon,An important issue any organization or individual has to face when managing datacontaining sensitive information is the risk that can be incurred when releasing such data.Even though data may be sanitized before being released; it is still possible for an adversaryto reconstruct the original data using additional information thus resulting in privacyviolations. To date; however; a systematic approach to quantify such risks is not available.Releasing health care information; for example; though useful in improving the quality ofservice that patients receive; raises the chances of identity exposure of the patients.Disclosing the minimum amount of information (or no information at all) is compellingspecially when organizations try to protect the privacy of individuals. To achieve such a goal;the organizations typically try to hide the identity of an individual to whom data pertains …,*,*,*
Thesis/Dissertation Acceptance,Michael S Kirkpatrick; Elisa Bertino; Mikhail Atallah; Ninghui Li; Dongyan Xu,My initial foray into the realm of computer and information security came as a softwareengineer for IBM Microelectronics Division (now Server & Technology Group). At the time; Iwas working on a team that implemented shape-processing algorithms for semiconductormanufacturing; these algorithms modified the chip de signs to pre-correct microscopic errorsthat were introduced during the manufacturing process. This work started with three peopleas a feature that was nice to have. After about 10 years; it became a vital prerequisite formanufacturing; with more than 75 people working on the project. My task was to design anaccess control system that restricted access to subsets of our code based on the person'sjob duties.

Guest Editorial: Insider Threat Solutions-Moving from Concept to Reality,Jason RC Nurse; Elisa Bertino,As society has embraced technology and systems to promote services; trade and ubiquitouscommunication; it has also inadvertently exposed itself to a plethora of security risks. One ofthe most significant of these risks is that of insider threat; where privileged insiders (be theyemployees or trusted thirdparties) within an enterprise; intentionally or inadvertently causeharm their organisations [1]. While the topic of insider threat has been examined andresearched for decades [2; 3]; the problem still persists; and some would even argue that it isbecoming worse [4]. Could this be the result of a disconnect between approaches andsolutions being researched and those that are (or can be) actually implemented? In thisspecial issue titled;“Insider Threat Solutions: Moving from Concept to Reality”; we focus onnovel systems to tackle insider threat which also provide a clear path for how they can be …,*,*,*

However; the issue of its expressiveness has not beeninvestigated earlier. In this paper; we present an exhaustive analysis of the expressivenessof the constructs provided by GTRBAC and prove that the set of constraints is not minimal byshowing that there is a subset of GTRBAC constraints that is sufficient to express all accessconstraints that can be expressed using the full set. We formally present the minimality resultfor the GTRBAC constraint set and argue that; although the complete set of constraints inGTRBAC is not minimal; having such an extensive set is advantageous from the perspectiveof user convenience and the lower complexity of constraint representation.

By analyzing and integrating data collected on the Internet and Web one can identifyconnections and relationships among individuals that may in turn help with homelandprotection. By collecting and mining data concerning user travels and disease outbreaks onecan predict disease spreading across geographical areas. And those are just a fewexamples; there are certainly many other domains where data technologies can play a …,*,*,*

Veriﬁcation of Receipts from M-Commerce Transactions on NFC Cellular Phones,Jungha Woo; Abhilasha Bhagav-Spantzell; Anna Cinzia Squicciarinii; Elisa Bertino,Abstract—A main challenge in mobile commerce is to make it possible for users to managetheir transaction histories from both online e-commerce transactions and in-persontransactions. Such histories are typically useful to build credit or to establish trust based onpast transactions. In this paper We propose an approach to manage electronic receipts oncellular devices by assuring their secure and privacy-preserving usage. We provide acomprehensive notion of transactions history including both on-line transaction and in-person transactions. We apply cryptographic protocols; such as secret sharing and zeroknowledge proofs; in a potentially vulnerable and constrained setting. Speciﬁcally; ourapproach supports ﬂexible strategies based on Shamir's secret sharing to cater to differentuser requirements and architectural constraints. In addition; aggregate zero knowledge …,*,*,*
Access Control,Elisa Bertino,• It is typically a software system implementing the access control function• It is usually part ofother systems• The access control mechanism uses some access control policies to decidewhether to grant or deny a subject access to a requested resource• We will refer to anaccess control system as system comprising an access control mechanism and allinformation required to take access control decisions (for example; access permissions),*,*,*

DBMask: Fine-Grained Access Control on Encrypted Relational Databases,Mohamed Nabeel; Muhammad I Sarfraz; Jianneng Cao; Elisa Bertino,Abstract—For efficient data management and economic bene fits; organizations areincreasingly moving towards the paradigm of “database as a service” where their data aremanaged by a database management system (DBMS) hosted in a public cloud. However;data are the most valuable asset in an organization; and inappropriate data disclosure putsthe organization's business at risk. Therefore; data are usually encrypted in order topreserve their confidentiality. Past research has extensively investigated query processingon encrypted data. However; a naive encryption scheme negates the benefits provided bythe use of a DBMS. In particular; past research efforts do not have adequately addressedflexible access control on encrypted data at different granularity levels which is critical whendata are shared among different users and applications.

A secure architecture design based on code minimization and application isolation,Aditi Gupta; Michael S Kirkpatrick; Elisa Bertino,ABSTRACT With fast evolving attacks; using software patches for fixing software bugs is notenough as there are often considerable delays in their application to vulnerable systemsand the at tackers may find other vulnerabilities to exploit. A secure architecture design thatprovides robust protection against malware must be guided by strong security design principles. In this work; we propose a system design based on the security principles that aim atachieving isolation and reducing attack surface. Our design leverages multi-core architecture to enforce physical isolation between application processes so that a malicious orinfected application is un able to affect other parts of the system. Further; we signifi cantlyreduce the software attack surface by executing each application on its own customizedoperating system image that is minimized to only contain code required by the given …,*,*,*

A Computer-Aided System for Dynamic Pottery Classification Using XML,Maria Bonghi Jovino; Giovanna Bagnasco Gianni; Lucio G Perego; Elisa Bertino; Pietro Mazzoleni; Stefano Valtolina,Abstract. The present paper focuses on the aspects concerning the improvement of theclassification and the recording techniques of archaeological artifacts. We propose asolution in which XML is used to build a computer-based system useful to group findings intoa classification which can dynamically change over the time. The paper finally discusses theresults achieved applying this methodology to the results of the excavations of the Universityof Milan at the archaeological site of Tarquinia (Italy).,*,*,*

It has been targeted bymalicious software (malware) that operates in kernel mode to implement advanced stealthyfeatures; such as backdoors or hidden services; that can elude userlevel anti-malwareprograms. Malware tampers with program execution and achieves the attacker's maliciousgoals with a variety of techniques. Many traditional malicious programs use code injectionattacks (eg; buffer overflows and format string bugs); which inject unau thorized code into thememory and executes malware functions. Various kinds of malware; such as computerworms; viruses; exploits; and rootkits; have been using this technique to execute maliciouslogic [1–3].

Thesis/Dissertation Acceptance,Prathima Rao; Elisa Bertino; Ninghui Li; Sunil Prabhakar; Luo Si,The widespread deployment of distributed applications and architectures such as Web Services; Virtual Private Networks and Service-Oriented Architectures has led to the proliferation of security policies that are specified and maintained independent of the applicationlogic. Policy-based approaches enhance flexibility and reduce the application developmenttime. Changes to the security requirements of an application simply entail modifying thepolicies without requiring changes to the application logic. Particularly important class ofsuch security policies is represented by access control policies which determine whether requests to protected resources are permitted or denied. Various types of access control models and mechanisms have emerged; such as PolicyMaker [2]; the ISO 10181-3 model [3] andthe eXtensible Access Control Mark-up Language (XACML)[4].

Thesis/Dissertation Acceptance,Ian Molloy; Ninghui Li; Elisa Bertino; Eugene Spafford; Christopher Clifton,Much of information security is; at its core; about classifying actions into two classes; eg;allow and deny; good and bad; or safe and dangerous; and ensuring this division is notviolated. The division balances the confidentiality; integrity; and availability of the resourcesbased on the needs of resource owners or organizations and is specified by a policy. One ofthe primary mechanisms used to ensure a safe division between the two classes isauthorization and access control. Access control systems make the distinction betweenallowed and denied at many levels and are central to the security of any organization. In themost basic access control models; permissions are directly assigned to users. When a userenters an organization they must be assigned a set of permissions re quired to perform theirduties. If a user changes jobs within the organization; their set of permissions is likely to …,*,*,*

Efﬁcient Hierarchical Key Generation and Key Diffusion for Sensor Networks,Elisa Bertino; Arif Ghafoor,Abstract—Sensor networks are designed with the assumption that nodes are willing tocollaborate. However; the open collaboration of nodes introduces privacy and securityissues. Therefore; ensuring privacy in wireless sensor networks is a challenging task. Basedon a multilevel security paradigm; in this paper We present a hierarchical key generationand distribution protocol for wireless sensor networks. We show by simulation results thatour key generation scheme outperforms the existing hierarchical key generation schemesthus it is suitable for sensor networks with limited computation and energy capabilities.Furthermore; we present an energy efﬁcient key diffusion protocol. We also discuss thepossible security threats involved with the proposed protocol and provide suitable solutionsto such threats.,*,*,*

Though there has been recent research in areas of XML-based documentsecurity; these challenges have not been addressed within the XML framework. In thispaper; we present X-RBAC; an XML-based RBAC policy speciﬁcation framework forenforcing access control in dynamic XML-based Web services. An X-RBAC system hasbeen implemented as a Java application; and is based on a speciﬁcation language thataddresses speciﬁc security requirements of these Web services. We discuss the salient …,*,*,*

It isthus crucial that the use of Web services; stand-alone or composed; provide strong securityguarantees. Web services security encompasses several requirements that can bedescribed along the well known security dimensions; that is: integrity; whereby a messagemust remain unaltered during transmission; confidentiality; whereby the contents of amessage cannot be viewed while in transit; except by authorized services; availability;whereby a message is promptly delivered to the intended recipient; thus ensuring thatlegitimate users receive the services they are entitled to.

In P-Hera; resource owners can specify ﬁne-grained restrictions on who can access their resources and which user can access whichpart of data. We diﬂerentiate our work with traditional works ofﬁne-grained access control onWeb services; as our system in addition to handling access constrains o_f the serviceprovider (which is the case in Web services); it also handles security constrains regardingactions performed on data: replication and modification. We believe this is of immensesigniﬁcance for wide-range of applications such as data Grids; lnformation Grids and WebContent Delivery Networks. In addition to presenting the overall system architecture; we …,*,*,*

Thesis/Dissertation Acceptance,Mohamed Yoosuf Mohamed Nabeel; Elisa Bertino; Ninghui Li; Samuel S Wagstaff; Dongyan Xu,In the cloud computing era; disseminating and sharing data through a third-party serviceprovider has never been more economical and easier than now. However; such serviceproviders cannot be trusted to assure the confidentiality of the data. In fact; data privacy andsecurity issues have been major concerns for many orga nizations utilizing such services.Data (eg electronic health records (EHRs)) often encode sensitive information and shouldbe protected in order to comply with various organizational policies; legal regulations;subscription conditions; and so forth. En cryption is a commonly adopted approach to protectthe confidentiality of the data. Encryption alone however is not sufficient as organizationsoften have to enforce finegrained access control on the data. Such control is often based onthe attributes of users; referred to as identity attributes; such as the roles of users in the …,*,*,*

Expressiveness and Design Issues,James BD Joshi; Elisa Bertino; Usman Latif; Arif Ghafoor,Abstract The Generalized Temporal Role Based Access Control (GTRBAC) modelintroduces a large set of temporal constraint expressions that facilitates the specification of acomprehensive access control policy. However; the issue of its expressiveness has not beeninvestigated earlier. In this paper; we present an exhaustive analysis of the expressivenessof the constructs provided by GTRBAC and prove that the set of constraints is not minimal byshowing that there is a subset of GTRBAC constraints that is suﬂicient to express all accessconstraints that can be expressed using the full set. We formally present the minimality resultfor the GTRBAC constraint set and argue that; although the complete set of constraints inGTRBAC is not minimal; having such an extensive set is advantageous from the perspectiveof user convenience and the lower complexity of constraint representation. Based on our …,*,*,*

Message from PASSAT 2009 Workshop Chair,Elisa Bertino,The symposia consist of invited papers in the field of privacy; security; risk; and trust. Thegoal of SecureCom 2009 and PSA 2009 is to provide an additional forum within PASSAT2009 for interaction among researchers and further discussion on the topics of interest to themain conference. The workshop provides a focused treatment of specific topics in thePASSAT field. We believe these workshops/symposia are an excellent complement to theoverall scope of the main conference and give additional value and interest to PASSAT2009. We hope that all of the selected papers will have a significant impact on futureresearch in the respective research areas. The workshops were selected by considering thequality of the proposal; its application to the scope of PASSAT 2009; and the CV of theorganizers.

Practical Identity Theft Prevention using Aggregated Proof of Knowledge,Abhilasha Bhargav-Spantzel Anna C Squicciarini; Rui Xue; Elisa Bertino,Abstract The problem of identity theft; that is; the act of impersonating others' identities bypresenting stolen identifiers or proofs of identities; has been receiving increasing attentionbecause of its high financial and social costs. In this paper we address such problem bydeveloping a solution for federated organizations. Our approach is based on the concept ofprivacy preserving multi-factor authentication achieved by the implementation of a newcryptographic primitive which uses aggregate signatures on commitments that are then usedfor aggregate zero-knowledge proof of knowledge (ZKPK) protocols. The resultantsignatures are very short and the zero-knowledge proofs are succinct and efficient. Weprove the security of our scheme under the co-GDH assumption for groups with bilinearmaps. Our cryptographic scheme is superior in terms of the performance; flexibility and …,*,*,*

A Privacy-Preserving Approach to Policy-Based Content Dissemination (Full Paper),Ning Shang; Mohamed Nabeel; Federica Paci; Elisa Bertino,Abstract We propose a novel scheme for selective distribution of content; encoded asdocuments; that preserves the privacy of the users to whom the documents are deliveredand is based on an efficient and novel group key management scheme. Our documentbroadcasting approach is based on access control policies specifying which users canaccess which documents; or subdocuments. Based on such policies; a broadcast documentis segmented into multiple subdocuments; each encrypted with a different key. In line withmodern attribute-based access control; policies are specified against identity attributes ofusers. However our broadcasting approach is privacy-preserving in that users are grantedaccess to a specific document; or subdocument; according to the policies without the need ofproviding in clear information about their identity attributes to the document publisher …,*,*,*

CERIAS Tech Report 2004-04 X-GTRBAC ADMIN: A DECENTRALIZED ADMINISTRATION MODEL FOR ENTERPRISE WIDE ACCESS CONTROL,Rafae Bhatti; James BD Joshi; Elisa Bertino; Arif Ghafoor,Abstract Access control in enterprises is a key research area in the realm of ComputerSecurity because of the unique needs of the target enterprise. As the enterprise typically haslarge user and resource pools; administering the access control based on any frameworkcould in itself be a daunting task. This work presents X-GTRBAC Admin; an administrationmodel that aims at enabling policy administration within a large enterprise. In particular; itsimplifies the process of user-to-role and permission-to-role assignments; and thus allowsdecentralization of the policy administration tasks. Secondly; it also allows for specifying thedomain of authority of the system administrators; and hence provides mechanism todistribute the administrative authority over multiple domains within the enterprise. The paperalso illustrates the applicability of the administrative concepts presented in our framework …,*,*,*
CERIAS Tech Report 2004-08 A TRUST-BASED CONTEXT-AWARE ACCESS CONTROL MODEL FOR WEB-SERVICES,Rafae Bhatti; Elisa Bertino; Arif Ghafoor,A key challenge in Web services security is the design of effective access control schemesthat can adequately meet the unique security challenges posed by the Web servicesparadigm. Despite the recent advances in Web based access control approaches applicableto Web services; there remain issues that impede the development of effective accesscontrol models for Web services environment. Amongst them are the lack of context-awaremodels for access control; and reliance on identity or capability-based access controlschemes. In this paper; we motivate the design of an access control scheme that addressesthese issues; and propose an extended; trust-enhanced version of our XML-based RoleBased Access Control (XRBAC) framework that incorporates context-based access control.We outline the configuration mechanism needed to apply our model to the Web services …,*,*,*

An Update Protocol for XML Documents in Distributed and Cooperative Systems,Yunhua Koglin t Giovanni Mella; Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari,Abstract Securing data is becoming a crucial need for most internet-based applications.Whereas the problem of data confidentiality has been widely investigated; the problem ofhow to ensure that data; when moving among different parties; are modified only accordingto the stated policies has been so far not deeply investigated. In this paper; we propose anapproach supporting parallel and distributed secure updates to XML documents. Theapproach; based on the use of a security region-object parallel flow (S-RPF) graph protocol;is particularly suited for all environments requiring cooperative updates to XML documents. Itallows different users to simultaneously update different portions of the same document;according to the specified access control policies. Additionally; it supports a decentralizedmanagement of update operations in that a subject can exercise its privileges and verify …,*,*,*

Timely Dissemination of Confidential Events in Content-Based Publish/Subscribe Systems,Yunhua Koglin; Elisa Bertino; Xukai Zou,Abstract Content-based publish/subscribe (pub/sub) systems provide more flexibility andexpressiveness than subject-based pub/sub systems. They are attractive solutions fordistributed event dissemination. In this paper; we address the issue of on-time delivery ofconfidential events to authorized subscribers; which is the paramount requirement forapplications such as the stock trade. Besides ensured confidentiality; the proposedhierarchical event forwarding scheme among brokers greatly reduces the cost of matchingoperations performed by a series of brokers; moreover; it enhances event delivery bytolerating broker failures. We also provide an encryption scheme for delivering event frombrokers to authorized subscribers. This encryption scheme explores the localitycharacteristics of subscribers. These characteristics are generated by our hierarchical …,*,*,*
Specification and Verification of a Context-Based Access Control Framework for Cyber Physical Systems,Arjmand Samuel; Hammad Haseeb; Arif Ghafoor; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are complex systems that operate in a dynamicenvironment where security characteristics of contexts are unique; and uniform access tosecure resources anywhere anytime to mobile entities poses daunting challenges. Tocapture context parameters such as location and time in an access control policy for CPS;we propose a Generalized Spatio-Temporal RBAC (GST-RBAC) model. In this model spatialand temporal constraints are defined for role enabling; user-role assignment; role-permission assignment; role activation; separation of duty and role hierarchy. The inclusionof multiple types of constraints exposes the need of composing a policy which is verifiablefor consistency. The second contribution in this paper is GST-RBAC policy specification andverification framework using light weight formal modeling language; Alloy. The analysis …,*,*,*

Enabling Fine-grained Access Control requires Security-aware Resource Broker,Pietro Mazzoleni; Bruno Crispo Swaminathan Sivasubramanian; Elisa Bertino,Abstract—The heterogeneous nature and independent admin-istration of geographicallydispersed resources in Grid; demand the need for access control using fine-grained policies.In this paper; we investigate the problem of fine-grained access control in the context ofresource allocation in Grid; as we believe it is the first and key step in developing accesscontrol methods specifically tailored for Grid systems. In particular; we argue that for efficientsupport of access control policies; the problem of resource brokering must be integrated withthe problem of access control. We propose the design of one such system that integratessecurity component into the resource broker. The proposed resource broker allocates onlythose resources that the user is authorized to access. Enabling fine-grained policy-basedaccess control would help the adoption of Grid to a higher extent into new avenues such …,*,*,*

Structural Signatures: How to Authenticate Graphs Without Leaking,Ashish Kundu; Elisa Bertino,ABSTRACT Secure data sharing in multi-party environments such as cloud computingrequires that both authenticity and confidentiality of the data be assured. Digital signatureschemes are commonly employed for authentication of data. However; no such techniqueexists for directed graphs; even though such graphs are one of the most widely used dataorganization structures. Existing schemes for DAGs are authenticity-preserving but notconfidentiality-preserving; and lead to leakage of sensitive information during authentication.In this paper; we propose two schemes on how to authenticate DAGs and directed cyclicgraphs without leaking; which are the first such schemes in the literature. It is based on thestructure of the graph as defined by depth-first graph traversals and aggregate signatures.Graphs are structurally different from trees in that they have four types of edges: tree …,*,*,*

Integrating Federated Digital Identity Management and Trust Negotiation–issues and solutions,Abhilasha Bhargav-Spantzel Anna C Squicciarini; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Most organizations today require the verification of personal information pertainingto users in order to provide service to users. Privacy of such information is of growingconcern and because organizations often ask for similar information; this process can alsobe redundant and inefficient. Recent proposals dealing with federated identity managementhave the potential to alleviate such problems. The trust negotiation paradigm has severalsimilarities with federated identity management as they both aim at better handling users'sensitive information. It is thus important to clearly assess their differences and theirsimilarities in order to better understand the potential advantages deriving from theirintegration. In this paper we develop such a comparison according to a number of relevantcriteria; and we review the most well known initiatives and projects. Based on such an …,*,*,*

Authorization Strategies for Virtualized Environments in Grid Computing Systems,Xinming Ou Anna Squicciarini Sebastien Goasguen; Elisa Bertino,Abstract The development of adequate security solutions; and in particular of authenticationand authorization techniques; for grid computing systems is a challenging task. Challengesarise from the heterogeneity of users; the presence of multiple security administrationentities and the heterogeneity of security techniques used at the various grid hosts; thescalability requirements; and the need for high-level policies concerning resource sharing.Recent trends; like accessing grid through science gateways and the use of virtualorganizations (VO) for managing user communities; further complicate the problem ofsecurity for grid computing systems. Currently; the GSI component developed as part of theGlobus Toolkit; the de facto standard for grid infrastructures; is not fully equiped with thecapabilities to meet those challenges. The main drawback of the current approach is that …,*,*,*
CERIAS Tech Report 2004-32 TOWARDS IMPROVED FEDERATED IDENTITY AND PRIVILEGE MANAGEMENT IN OPEN SYSTEMS,Rafae Bhatti; Elisa Bertino; Arif Ghafoor,Federated identity and privilege management are the cornerstones of access managementon the Web. The increasing trend of business integration across enterprises and Web-basedcollaboration has led to tremendous growth of the identity and privilege managementresearch and products in the recent past. However; despite the existence of availablemechanisms; there are drawbacks in almost all well-known schemes that make theminadequate for use in large scale open system. Additionally; the migration of thesemechanisms to the Web environment is happening at dissimilar pace; resulting in a widegap in integrating privilege management with existing federated identity mechanisms toprovide a comprehensive access management solution. In this paper; we discuss theseissues in detail; namely the shortcomings of federated identity mechanisms; and their …,*,*,*

Support Multi-Dimensional Trustworthiness for Grid Workflow,Elisa Bertino; Bruno Crispo; Pietro Mazzoleni,Grid systems were initially developed for supporting scientific computations; in areas suchas biotechnology and physics; and therefore their purpose was mainly to supportcomputationally intensive tasks. Today; companies; users and researchers are looking atways to use the grid approach for commercial uses and for applications in many differentareas; ranging from the entertainment to the financial industry. The development oftechniques and tools for coordinating the execution of complex tasks over grids; such asworkflow management systems; as well as the development of specialized web services andof storage services; is simplifying the deployment of grid-based applications. However; alimiting factor to the wide exploitation of the computational grid paradigm is represented bythe untrusted environment in which computations are sometimes to be performed. Not …,*,*,*

Unlike wired hosts; mobilehosts can be temporarily unreachable as a consequence of their movements across di erentcells; their energy limitations or unavailable wireless channels. Mobility forces mobile hoststo alternate connected and disconnected work. When connected; they perform personalcommunications and access shared data and services; when disconnected; they canprocess locally cached data objects. Analogously to wired networks; data replication is thekey element to ensure high data availability and to increase performance.

Efficient and Selective Publishing of Hierarchically Structured Data,Mohamed Nabeel; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Hierarchical data models (eg XML; Oslo) are an ideal data exchange format tofacilitate ever increasing data sharing needs among enterprises; organizations as well asgeneral users. However; building efficient and scalable Event Driven Systems (EDS) forselectively disseminating such data remains largely an unsolved problem to date. Ingeneral; an EDS has three distinct parties-Content Publishers (P); Content Brokers (B);Subscribers (U)-working in a highly decoupled Publish-Subscribe (PS) model. With a largeSubscriber base having different interests and many documents (D); the deficiency inexisting such systems lies in the techniques used to distribute (match/filter and forward)content from P to U through B. Thus; we propose an efficient and scalable approach toselectively distribute different subtrees of possibly large documents; which have access …,*,*,*

Data in the Cloud: Authentication of Trees; Graphs; and Forests Without Leaking,Ashish Kundu; Mikhail Atallah; Elisa Bertino,ABSTRACT In this paper; we address the problem of how to authenticate sub-trees (sub-graphs) without leakage of information. Previous schemes for tree (graph)-organized data;such as XML documents; authenticate information recorded in tree (graph) nodes; but leakstructural information that the data receiver is not entitled to access. This is oftenunacceptable; as the value of a tree (graph)-organized data is not only in the contents of thetree (graph) nodes but also in the tree (graph) structure (such as in healthcare and militarydata). A possible approach would be to store a pre-signed hash for each subset of the tree(graph). Such an approach is however not suitable even for moderate-size trees (graphs)because of the exponential number of such subsets. This paper proposes authenticationschemes for trees and graphs (with or without cycles). The schemes are provably secure …,*,*,*

Security and Privacy in Data Stream Management Systems,Rimma V Nehme; Elke A Rundensteiner; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Privacy and security in the context of the streaming systems largely have beenoverlooked. We now tackle this important problem in this paper. Our work focuses oncontextaware security and user-centric privacy preservation in data stream managementsystems (DSMS) by exploiting security constraints (called security punctuations) that aredynamically embedded into data streams. The novelty of our proposed approach is thataccess control policies are not persistently stored in the DSMS but rather streamed togetherwith the data. We present novel query operators; termed Security Shield (SS) and Security-Compliant Join (SCJoin) that are designed to make queries comply with the security policiesof the streaming data while still guaranteeing near real-time response. As a proof offeasibility; we have implemented the security punctuation framework within a real DSMS …,*,*,*
