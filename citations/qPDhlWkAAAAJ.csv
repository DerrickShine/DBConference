Approximate aggregation techniques for sensor databases,Jeffrey Considine; Feifei Li; George Kollios; John Byers,In the emerging area of sensor-based systems; a significant challenge is to developscalable; fault-tolerant methods to extract useful information from the data the sensorscollect. An approach to this data management problem is the use of sensor databasesystems; exemplified by TinyDB and Cougar; which allow users to perform aggregationqueries such as MIN; COUNT and AVG on a sensor network. Due to power and rangeconstraints; centralized approaches are generally impractical; so most systems use in-network aggregation to reduce network traffic. However; these aggregation strategiesbecome bandwidth-intensive when combined with the fault-tolerant; multipath routingmethods often used in these environments. For example; duplicate-sensitive aggregatessuch as SUM cannot be computed exactly using substantially less bandwidth than explicit …,Data Engineering; 2004.

Semantics of ranking queries for probabilistic data and expected ranks,Graham Cormode; Feifei Li; Ke Yi,When dealing with massive quantities of data; top-k queries are a powerful technique forreturning only the k most relevant tuples for inspection; based on a scoring function. Theproblem of efficiently answering such ranking queries has been studied and analyzedextensively within traditional database settings. The importance of the top-k is perhaps evengreater in probabilistic databases; where a relation can encode exponentially many possibleworlds. There have been several recent attempts to propose definitions and algorithms forranking queries over probabilistic data. However; these all lack many of the intuitiveproperties of a top-k over deterministic data. Specifically; we define a number of fundamentalproperties; including exact-k; containment; unique-rank; value-invariance; and stability;which are all satisfied by ranking queries on certain data. We argue that all these …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,734
On trip planning queries in spatial databases,Feifei Li; Dihan Cheng; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; George Kollios; Shang-Hua Teng,Abstract In this paper we discuss a new type of query in Spatial Databases; called the TripPlanning Query (TPQ). Given a set of points of interest P in space; where each point belongsto a specific category; a starting point S and a destination E; TPQ retrieves the best trip thatstarts at S; passes through at least one point from each category; and ends at E. Forexample; a driver traveling from Boston to Providence might want to stop to a gas station; abank and a post office on his way; and the goal is to provide him with the best possible route(in terms of distance; traffic; road conditions; etc.). The difficulty of this query lies in theexistence of multiple choices per category. In this paper; we study fast approximationalgorithms for TPQ in a metric space. We provide a number of approximation algorithms withapproximation ratios that depend on either the number of categories; the maximum …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2005,540
Dynamic authenticated index structures for outsourced databases,Feifei Li; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; George Kollios; Leonid Reyzin,Abstract In outsourced database (ODB) systems the database owner publishes its datathrough a number of remote servers; with the goal of enabling clients at the edge of thenetwork to access and query the data more efficiently. As servers might be untrusted or canbe compromised; query authentication becomes an essential component of ODB systems.Existing solutions for this problem concentrate mostly on static scenarios and are based onidealistic properties for certain cryptographic primitives. In this work; first we define a varietyof essential and practical cost metrics associated with ODB systems. Then; we analyticallyevaluate a number of different approaches; in search for a solution that best leverages allmetrics. Most importantly; we look at solutions that can handle dynamic scenarios; whereowners periodically update the data residing at the servers. Finally; we discuss query …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,382
Efficient processing of top-k queries in uncertain databases with x-relations,Ke Yi; Feifei Li; George Kollios; Divesh Srivastava,This work introduces novel polynomial algorithms for processing top-k queries in uncertaindatabases under the generally adopted model of x-relations. An x-relation consists of anumber of x-tuples; and each x-tuple randomly instantiates into one tuple from one or morealternatives. Our results significantly improve the best known algorithms for top-k queryprocessing in uncertain databases; in terms of both runtime and memory usage. In the single-alternative case; the new algorithms are 2 to 3 orders of magnitude faster than the previousalgorithms. In the multialternative case; we introduce the first-known polynomial algorithms;while the current best algorithms have exponential complexity in both time and space. Ouralgorithms run in near linear or low polynomial time and cover both types of top-k queries inuncertain databases. We provide both the theoretical analysis and an extensive …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2008,228

Efficient parallel kNN joins for large data in MapReduce,Chi Zhang; Feifei Li; Jeffrey Jestes,Abstract In data mining applications and spatial and multimedia databases; a useful tool isthe kNN join; which is to produce the k nearest neighbors (NN); from a dataset S; of everypoint in a dataset R. Since it involves both the join and the NN search; performing kNN joinsefficiently is a challenging task. Meanwhile; applications continue to witness a quick(exponential in some cases) increase in the amount of data to be processed. A popularmodel nowadays for large-scale data processing is the shared-nothing cluster on a numberof commodity machines using MapReduce [6]. Hence; how to execute kNN joins efficientlyon large data that are stored in a MapReduce cluster is an intriguing problem that meetsmany practical needs. This work proposes novel (exact and approximate) algorithms inMapReduce to perform efficient parallel kNN joins on large data.

Spatio-temporal aggregation using sketches,Yufei Tao; George Kollios; Jeffrey Considine; Feifei Li; Dimitris Papadias,Several spatio-temporal applications require the retrieval of summarized information aboutmoving objects that lie in a query region during a query interval (eg; the number of mobileusers covered by a cell; traffic volume in a district; etc.). Existing solutions have the distinctcounting problem: if an object remains in the query region for several timestamps during thequery interval; it will be counted multiple times in the result. We solve this problem byintegrating spatio-temporal indexes with sketches; traditionally used for approximate queryprocessing. The proposed techniques can also be applied to reduce the space requirementsof conventional spatio-temporal data and to mine spatio-temporal association rules.,Data Engineering; 2004.

Secure nearest neighbor revisited,Bin Yao; Feifei Li; Xiaokui Xiao,In this paper; we investigate the secure nearest neighbor (SNN) problem; in which a clientissues an encrypted query point E (q) to a cloud service provider and asks for an encrypteddata point in E (D)(the encrypted database) that is closest to the query point; withoutallowing the server to learn the plaintexts of the data or the query (and its result). We showthat efficient attacks exist for existing SNN methods [21];[15]; even though they were claimedto be secure in standard security models (such as indistinguishability under chosen plaintextor ciphertext attacks). We also establish a relationship between the SNN problem and theorder-preserving encryption (OPE) problem from the cryptography field [6];[5]; and we showthat SNN is at least as hard as OPE. Since it is impossible to construct secure OPE schemesin standard security models [6];[5]; our results imply that one cannot expect to find the …,ICDE 2013,2013,120
NDC: Analyzing the impact of 3D-stacked memory+ logic devices on MapReduce workloads,Seth H Pugsley; Jeffrey Jestes; Huihui Zhang; Rajeev Balasubramonian; Vijayalakshmi Srinivasan; Alper Buyuktosunoglu; Al Davis; Feifei Li,While Processing-in-Memory has been investigated for decades; it has not been embracedcommercially. A number of emerging technologies have renewed interest in this topic. Inparticular; the emergence of 3D stacking and the imminent release of Micron's HybridMemory Cube device have made it more practical to move computation near memory.However; the literature is missing a detailed analysis of a killer application that can leveragea Near Data Computing (NDC) architecture. This paper focuses on in-memory MapReduceworkloads that are commercially important and are especially suitable for NDC because oftheir embarrassing parallelism and largely localized memory accesses.

Time series compressibility and privacy,Spiros Papadimitriou; Feifei Li; George Kollios; Philip S Yu,Abstract In this paper we study the trade-offs between time series compressibility and partialinformation hiding and their fundamental implications on how we should introduceuncertainty about individual values by perturbing them. More specifically; if the perturbationdoes not have the same compressibility properties as the original data; then it can bedetected and filtered out; reducing uncertainty. Thus; by making the perturbation" similar" tothe original data; we can both preserve the structure of the data better; while simultaneouslymaking breaches harder. However; as data become more compressible; a fraction of theuncertainty can be removed if true values are leaked; revealing how they were perturbed.We formalize these notions; study the above trade-offs on real data and develop practicalschemes which strike a good balance and can also be extended for on-the-fly data hiding …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,111
Hiding in the crowd: Privacy preservation on evolving streams through correlation tracking,Feifei Li; Jimeng Sun; Spiros Papadimitriou; George A Mihaila; Ioana Stanoi,We address the problem of preserving privacy in streams; which has received surprisinglylimited attention. For static data; a well-studied and widely used approach is based onrandom perturbation of the data values. However; streams pose additional challenges. First;analysis of the data has to be performed incrementally; using limited processing time andbuffer space; making batch approaches unsuitable. Second; the characteristics of streamsevolve over time. Consequently; approaches based on global analysis of the data are notadequate. We show that it is possible to efficiently and effectively track the correlation andautocorrelation structure of multivariate streams and leverage it to add noise whichmaximally preserves privacy; in the sense that it is very hard to remove. Our techniquesachieve much better results than previous static; global approaches; while requiring …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007. IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,99
Approximate string search in spatial databases,Bin Yao; Feifei Li; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Kun Hou,This work presents a novel index structure; MHR-tree; for efficiently answering approximatestring match queries in large spatial databases. The MHR-tree is based on the R-treeaugmented with the min-wise signature and the linear hashing technique. The min-wisesignature for an index node u keeps a concise representation of the union of q-grams fromstrings under the sub-tree of u. We analyze the pruning functionality of such signaturesbased on set resemblance between the query string and the q-grams from the sub-trees ofindex nodes. MHR-tree supports a wide range of query predicates efficiently; includingrange and nearest neighbor queries. We also discuss how to estimate range queryselectivity accurately. We present a novel adaptive algorithm for finding balanced partitionsusing both the spatial and string information stored in the tree.

Randomized synopses for query assurance on data streams,Ke Yi; Feifei Li; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; George Kollios; Divesh Srivastava,The overwhelming flow of information in many data stream applications forces manycompanies to outsource to a third-party the deployment of a Data Stream ManagementSystem (DSMS) for performing desired computations. Remote computations intrinsicallyraise issues of trust; making query execution assurance on data streams a problem withpractical implications. Consider a client observing the same data stream as a remote server(eg; network traffic); that registers a continuous query on the server's DSMS; and receivesanswers upon request. The client needs to verify the integrity of the results using significantlyfewer resources than evaluating the query locally. Towards that goal; we propose aprobabilistic algorithm for selection and aggregate/group-by queries; that uses constantspace irrespective of the result-set size; has low update cost; and arbitrarily small …,Data Engineering; 2008.

K nearest neighbor queries and knn-joins in large relational databases (almost) for free,Bin Yao; Feifei Li; Piyush Kumar,Finding the k nearest neighbors (kNN) of a query point; or a set of query points (kNN-Join)are fundamental problems in many application domains. Many previous efforts to solvethese problems focused on spatial databases or stand-alone systems; where changes to thedatabase engine may be required; which may limit their application on large data sets thatare stored in a relational database management system. Furthermore; these methods maynot automatically optimize kNN queries or kNN-Joins when additional query conditions arespecified. In this work; we study both the kNN query and the kNN-Join in a relationaldatabase; possibly augmented with additional query conditions. We search for relationalalgorithms that require no changes to the database engine. The straightforward solutionuses the user-defined-function (UDF) that a query optimizer cannot optimize.

Authenticated index structures for aggregation queries,Feifei Li; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; George Kollios; Leonid Reyzin,Abstract Query authentication is an essential component in Outsourced DataBase (ODB)systems. This article introduces efficient index structures for authenticating aggregationqueries over large datasets. First; we design an index that features good performancecharacteristics for static environments. Then; we propose more involved structures for thedynamic case. Our structures feature excellent performance for authenticating queries withmultiple aggregate attributes and multiple selection predicates. Furthermore; our techniquescover a large number of aggregate types; including distributive aggregates (such as SUM;COUNT; MIN; and MAX); algebraic aggregates (such as the AVG); and holistic aggregates(such as MEDIAN and QUANTILE). We have also addressed the issue of authenticatingaggregation queries efficiently when the database is encrypted to protect data …,ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC),2010,74
Proof-infused streams: Enabling authentication of sliding window queries on streams,Feifei Li; Ke Yi; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; George Kollios,Abstract As computer systems are essential components of many critical commercialservices; the need for secure online transactions is now becoming evident. The demand forsuch applications; as the market grows; exceeds the capacity of individual businesses toprovide fast and reliable services; making outsourcing technologies a key player inalleviating issues of scale. Consider a stock broker that needs to provide a real-time stocktrading monitoring service to clients. Since the cost of multicasting this information to a largeaudience might become prohibitive; the broker could outsource the stock feed to third-partyproviders; who are in turn responsible for forwarding the appropriate sub-feed to clients.Evidently; in critical applications the integrity of the third-party should not be taken forgranted.

Ranking distributed probabilistic data,Feifei Li; Ke Yi; Jeffrey Jestes,Abstract Ranking queries are essential tools to process large amounts of probabilistic datathat encode exponentially many possible deterministic instances. In many applicationswhere uncertainty and fuzzy information arise; data are collected from multiple sources indistributed; networked locations; eg; distributed sensor fields with imprecise measurements;multiple scientific institutes with inconsistency in their scientific data. Due to the networkdelay and the economic cost associated with communicating large amounts of data over anetwork; a fundamental problem in these scenarios is to retrieve the global top-k tuples fromall distributed sites with minimum communication cost. Using the well founded notion of theexpected rank of each tuple across all possible worlds as the basis of ranking; this workdesigns both communication-and computation-efficient algorithms for retrieving the top-k …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,71
Scalable Multi-Query Optimization for SPARQL,Wangchao Le; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Songyun Duan; Feifei Li,This paper revisits the classical problem of multi-query optimization in the context ofRDF/SPARQL. We show that the techniques developed for relational and semi-structureddata/query languages are hard; if not impossible; to be extended to account for RDF datamodel and graph query patterns expressed in SPARQL. In light of the NP-hardness of themulti-query optimization for SPARQL; we propose heuristic algorithms that partition the inputbatch of queries into groups such that each group of queries can be optimized together. Anessential component of the optimization incorporates an efficient algorithm to discover thecommon sub-structures of multiple SPARQL queries and an effective cost model to comparecandidate execution plans. Since our optimization techniques do not make any assumptionabout the underlying SPARQL query engine; they have the advantage of being portable …,*,2012,67
Optimal location queries in road network databases,Xiaokui Xiao; Bin Yao; Feifei Li,Optimal location (OL) queries are a type of spatial queries particularly useful for the strategicplanning of resources. Given a set of existing facilities and a set of clients; an OL query asksfor a location to build a new facility that optimizes a certain cost metric (defined based on thedistances between the clients and the facilities). Several techniques have been proposed toaddress OL queries; assuming that all clients and facilities reside in an L p space. Inpractice; however; movements between spatial locations are usually confined by theunderlying road network; and hence; the actual distance between two locations can differsignificantly from their L p distance. Motivated by the deficiency of the existing techniques;this paper presents the first study on OL queries in road networks. We propose a unifiedframework that addresses three variants of OL queries that find important applications in …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,65
Reverse furthest neighbors in spatial databases,Bin Yao; Feifei Li; Piyush Kumar,Given a set of points $ P $ and a query point $ q $; the {\em reverse furthest neighbor}(\trfn)query fetches the set of points $ p\in P $ such that $ q $ is their furthest neighbor among allpoints in $ P\cup\{q\} $. This is the monochromatic\trfn (\mrfn) query. Another interestingversion of\trfn query is the {\em bichromatic reverse furthest neighbor}(\brfn) query.

Probabilistic string similarity joins,Jeffrey Jestes; Feifei Li; Zhepeng Yan; Ke Yi,Abstract Edit distance based string similarity join is a fundamental operator in stringdatabases. Increasingly; many applications in data cleaning; data integration; and scientificcomputing have to deal with fuzzy information in string attributes. Despite the intensiveefforts devoted in processing (deterministic) string joins and managing probabilistic datarespectively; modeling and processing probabilistic strings is still a largely unexploredterritory. This work studies the string join problem in probabilistic string databases; using theexpected edit distance (EED) as the similarity measure. We first discuss two probabilisticstring models to capture the fuzziness in string values in real-world applications. The string-level model is complete; but may be expensive to represent and process. The character-level model has a much more succinct representation when uncertainty in strings only …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,48
Rewriting queries on SPARQL views,Wangchao Le; Songyun Duan; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Feifei Li; Min Wang,Abstract The problem of answering SPARQL queries over virtual SPARQL views iscommonly encountered in a number of settings; including while enforcing security policies toaccess RDF data; or when integrating RDF data from disparate sources. We approach thisproblem by rewriting SPARQL queries over the views to equivalent queries over theunderlying RDF data; thus avoiding the costs entailed by view materialization andmaintenance. We show that SPARQL query rewriting combines the most challengingaspects of rewriting for the relational and XML cases: like the relational case; SPARQL queryrewriting requires synthesizing multiple views; like the XML case; the size of the rewrittenquery is exponential to the size of the query and the views. In this paper; we present the firstnative query rewriting algorithm for SPARQL. For an input SPARQL query over a set of …,Proceedings of the 20th international conference on World wide web,2011,45
Wiccap data model: Mapping physical websites to logical views,Zehua Liu; Feifei Li; Wee Ng,Abstract Information sources over the WWW contain a large amount of data organizedaccording to different interests and values. Thus; it is important that facilities are there toenable users to extract information of interests in a simple and effective manner. To do this;information from the Web sources need to be extracted automatically according to users'interests. However; the extraction of information requires in-depth knowledge of relevanttechnologies and the extraction process is slow; tedious and difficult for ordinary users. Wepropose the Wiccap Data Model; an XML data model that maps Web information sourcesinto commonly perceived logical models. Based on this data model; ordinary users are ableto extract information easily and efficiently. To accelerate the creation of data models; wealso define a formal process for creating such data model and have implemented a …,Conceptual Modeling—ER 2002,2003,45

Scalable keyword search on large RDF data,Wangchao Le; Feifei Li; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Songyun Duan,Keyword search is a useful tool for exploring large RDF data sets. Existing techniques eitherrely on constructing a distance matrix for pruning the search space or building summariesfrom the RDF graphs for query processing. In this work; we show that existing techniqueshave serious limitations in dealing with realistic; large RDF data with tens of millions oftriples. Furthermore; the existing summarization techniques may lead to incorrect/incompleteresults. To address these issues; we propose an effective summarization algorithm tosummarize the RDF data. Given a keyword query; the summaries lend significant pruningpowers to exploratory keyword search and result in much better efficiency compared toprevious works. Unlike existing techniques; our search algorithms always return correctresults. Besides; the summaries we built can be updated incrementally and efficiently …,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2014,42
Building wavelet histograms on large data in MapReduce,Jeffrey Jestes; Ke Yi; Feifei Li,Abstract MapReduce is becoming the de facto framework for storing and processingmassive data; due to its excellent scalability; reliability; and elasticity. In many MapReduceapplications; obtaining a compact accurate summary of data is essential. Among variousdata summarization tools; histograms have proven to be particularly important and useful forsummarizing data; and the wavelet histogram is one of the most widely used histograms. Inthis paper; we investigate the problem of building wavelet histograms efficiently on largedatasets in MapReduce. We measure the efficiency of the algorithms by both end-to-endrunning time and communication cost. We demonstrate straightforward adaptations ofexisting exact and approximate methods for building wavelet histograms to MapReduceclusters are highly inefficient. To that end; we design new algorithms for computing exact …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,41
Group enclosing queries,Feifei Li; Bin Yao; Piyush Kumar,Given a set of points P and a query set Q; a group enclosing query (Geq) fetches the pointp*∈ P such that the maximum distance of p* to all points in Q is minimized. This problem isequivalent to the Min-Max case (minimizing the maximum distance) of aggregate nearestneighbor queries for spatial databases. This work first designs a new exact solution byexploring new geometric insights; such as the minimum enclosing ball; the convex hull; andthe furthest voronoi diagram of the query group. To further reduce the query cost; especiallywhen the dimensionality increases; we turn to approximation algorithms. Our mainapproximation algorithm has a worst case√ 2-approximation ratio if one can find the exactnearest neighbor of a point. In practice; its approximation ratio never exceeds 1.05 for alarge number of data sets up to six dimensions. We also discuss how to extend it to higher …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,40
Flexible aggregate similarity search,Yang Li; Feifei Li; Ke Yi; Bin Yao; Min Wang,Abstract Aggregate similarity search; aka aggregate nearest neighbor (Ann) query; findsmany useful applications in spatial and multimedia databases. Given a group Q of M queryobjects; it retrieves the most (or top-k) similar object to Q from a database P; where thesimilarity is an aggregation (eg; sum; max) of the distances between the retrieved object pand all the objects in Q. In this paper; we propose an added flexibility to the query definition;where the similarity is an aggregation over the distances between p and any subset of ÆMobjects in Q for some support 0< Æ d 1. We call this new definition flexible aggregatesimilarity (Fann) search; which generalizes the Ann problem. Next; we present algorithms foranswering Fann queries exactly and approximately.

Improving transaction-time DBMS performance and functionality,David B Lomet; Feifei Li,Immortal DB is a transaction time database system that is built into a commercial databasesystem rather than being layered on top. This enables it to have performance that is veryclose to the performance of an unversioned current time database system. Achieving suchcompetitive performance is essential for wide acceptance of this temporal functionality. Inthis paper we describe further performance improvements in two critical dimensions. FirstImmortal DB range search performance is improved for current time data via improvedcurrent version storage utilization; making this performance essentially the same asunversioned performance. Second; Immortal DB update performance is increased by furtherreducing the cost for the timestamping of versions.

Comparing implementations of near-data computing with in-memory mapreduce workloads,Seth H Pugsley; Jeffrey Jestes; Rajeev Balasubramonian; Vijayalakshmi Srinivasan; Alper Buyuktosunoglu; Al Davis; Feifei Li,The emergence of 3D stacking and the imminent release of Micron's Hybrid Memory Cube(HMC) device have made it more practical to move computation near memory. This workpresents a detailed analysis of in-memory MapReduce in the context of near-data computing(NDC). MapReduce is a good fit for NDC because it is embarrassingly parallel and hashighly localized memory accesses. This article considers two NDC architectures: one thatexploits HMC devices and one that does not. It thus provides insight on the benefits ofdifferent NDC approaches and quantifies the potential for improvement for an importantemerging big-data workload.,IEEE Micro,2014,35
Characterizing and exploiting reference locality in data stream applications,Feifei Li; Ching Chang; George Kollios; Azer Bestavros,In this paper; we investigate a new approach to process queries in data stream applications.We show that reference locality characteristics of data streams could be exploited in thedesign of superior and flexible data stream query processing techniques. We identify twodifferent causes of reference locality: popularity over long time scales and temporalcorrelations over shorter time scales. An elegant mathematical model is shown to preciselyquantify the degree of those sources of locality. Furthermore; we analyze the impact oflocality-awareness on achievable performance gains over traditional algorithms onapplications such asMAX-subset approximate sliding window join and approximate countestimation. In a comprehensive experimental study; we compare several existing algorithmsagainst our locality-aware algorithms over a number of real datasets. The results validate …,Data Engineering; 2006.

Multi-approximate-keyword routing in GIS data,Bin Yao; Mingwang Tang; Feifei Li,Abstract For GIS data situated on a road network; shortest path search is a basic operation.In practice; however; users are often interested at routing when certain constraints on thetextual information have been also incorporated. This work complements the standardshortest path search with multiple keywords and an approximate string similarity function;where the goal is to find the shortest path that passes through at least one matching objectper keyword; we dub this problem the multi-approximate-keyword routing (MAKR) query. Wepresent both exact and approximate solutions. When the number κ of query keywords issmall (eg; κ≤ 6); the exact solution works efficiently. However; when κ increases; it becomesincreasingly expensive (especially on large GIS data).

Spatial approximate string search,Feifei Li; Bin Yao; Mingwang Tang; Marios Hadjieleftheriou,This work deals with the approximate string search in large spatial databases. Specifically;we investigate range queries augmented with a string similarity search predicate in botheuclidean space and road networks. We dub this query the spatial approximate string (SAS)query. In euclidean space; we propose an approximate solution; the MHR-tree; whichembeds min-wise signatures into an R-tree. The min-wise signature for an index node ukeeps a concise representation of the union of q-grams from strings under the subtree of u.We analyze the pruning functionality of such signatures based on the set resemblancebetween the query string and the q-grams from the subtrees of index nodes. We also discusshow to estimate the selectivity of a SAS query in euclidean space; for which we present anovel adaptive algorithm to find balanced partitions using both the spatial and string …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2013,27
Quality and efficiency for kernel density estimates in large data,Yan Zheng; Jeffrey Jestes; Jeff M Phillips; Feifei Li,Abstract Kernel density estimates are important for a broad variety of applications. Theirconstruction has been well-studied; but existing techniques are expensive on massivedatasets and/or only provide heuristic approximations without theoretical guarantees. Wepropose randomized and deterministic algorithms with quality guarantees which are ordersof magnitude more efficient than previous algorithms. Our algorithms do not requireknowledge of the kernel or its bandwidth parameter and are easily parallelizable. Wedemonstrate how to implement our ideas in a centralized setting and in MapReduce;although our algorithms are applicable to any large-scale data processing framework.Extensive experiments on large real datasets demonstrate the quality; efficiency; andscalability of our techniques.,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,26
Top-k queries on temporal data,Feifei Li; Ke Yi; Wangchao Le,Abstract The database community has devoted extensive amount of efforts to indexing andquerying temporal data in the past decades. However; insufficient amount of attention hasbeen paid to temporal ranking queries. More precisely; given any time instance t; the queryasks for the top-k objects at time t with respect to some score attribute. Some genericindexing structures based on R-trees do support ranking queries on temporal data; but asthey are not tailored for such queries; the performance is far from satisfactory. We presentthe Seb-tree; a simple indexing scheme that supports temporal ranking queries much moreefficiently. The Seb-tree answers a top-k query for any time instance t in the optimal numberof I/Os in expectation; namely; $ ${O\left ({\rm log} _B\;\frac {N}{B}+\frac {k}{B}\right)} $ $ I/Os;where N is the size of the data set and B is the disk block size.

Wander Join: Online Aggregation via Random Walks,Feifei Li; Bin Wu; Ke Yi; Zhuoyue Zhao,Abstract Joins are expensive; and online aggregation over joins was proposed to mitigatethe cost; which offers users a nice and flexible tradeoff between query efficiency andaccuracy in a continuous; online fashion. However; the state-of-the-art approach; in bothinternal and external memory; is based on ripple join; which is still very expensive and evenneeds unrealistic assumptions (eg; tuples in a table are stored in random order). This paperproposes a new approach; the wander join algorithm; to the online aggregation problem byperforming random walks over the underlying join graph. We also design an optimizer thatchooses the optimal plan for conducting the random walks without having to collect anystatistics a priori. Compared with ripple join; wander join is particularly efficient for equalityjoins involving multiple tables; but also supports θ-joins.

Efficient Threshold Monitoring for Distributed Probabilistic Data,Mingwang Tang; Feifei Li; Jeff M Phillips; Jeffrey Jestes,In distributed data management; a primary concern is monitoring the distributed data andgenerating an alarm when a user specified constraint is violated. A particular useful instanceis the threshold based constraint; which is commonly known as the distributed thresholdmonitoring problem [4];[16];[19];[29]. This work extends this useful and fundamental study todistributed probabilistic data that emerge in a lot of applications; where uncertainty naturallyexists when massive amounts of data are produced at multiple sources in distributed;networked locations. Examples include distributed observing stations; large sensor fields;geographically separate scientific institutes/units and many more. When dealing withprobabilistic data; there are two thresholds involved; the score and the probabilitythresholds. One must monitor both simultaneously; as such; techniques developed for …,*,2012,21
Towards Fair Sharing of Block Storage in a Multi-tenant Cloud.,Xing Lin; Yun Mao; Feifei Li; Robert Ricci,Abstract A common problem with disk-based cloud storage services is that performance canvary greatly and become highly unpredictable in a multi-tenant environment. A fundamentalreason is the interference between workloads co-located on the same physical disk. Weobserve that different IO patterns interfere with each other significantly; which makes theperformance of different types of workloads unpredictable when they are executedconcurrently. Unpredictability implies that users may not get a fair share of the systemresources from the cloud services they are using. At the same time; replication is commonlyused in cloud storage for high reliability. Connecting these two facts; we propose a cloudstorage system designed to minimize workload interference without increasing storage costsor sacrificing the overall system throughput. Our design leverages log-structured disk …,HotCloud,2012,19

Building a national neighborhood dataset from geotagged Twitter data for indicators of happiness; diet; and physical activity,Quynh C Nguyen; Dapeng Li; Hsien-Wen Meng; Suraj Kath; Elaine Nsoesie; Feifei Li; Ming Wen,Background Studies suggest that where people live; play; and work can influence healthand well-being. However; the dearth of neighborhood data; especially data that is timely andconsistent across geographies; hinders understanding of the effects of neighborhoods onhealth. Social media data represents a possible new data resource for neighborhoodresearch. Objective The aim of this study was to build; from geotagged Twitter data; anational neighborhood database with area-level indicators of well-being and healthbehaviors. Methods We utilized Twitter's streaming application programming interface tocontinuously collect a random 1% subset of publicly available geolocated tweets for 1 year(April 2015 to March 2016).

Ranking large temporal data,Jeffrey Jestes; Jeff M Phillips; Feifei Li; Mingwang Tang,Abstract Ranking temporal data has not been studied until recently; even though ranking isan important operator (being promoted as a first-class citizen) in database systems.However; only the instant top-k queries on temporal data were studied in; where objects withthe k highest scores at a query time instance t are to be retrieved. The instant top-k definitionclearly comes with limitations (sensitive to outliers; difficult to choose a meaningful querytime t). A more flexible and general ranking operation is to rank objects based on theaggregation of their scores in a query interval; which we dub the aggregate top-k query ontemporal data. For example; return the top-10 weather stations having the highest averagetemperature from 10/01/2010 to 10/07/2010; find the top-20 stocks having the largest totaltransaction volumes from 02/05/2011 to 02/07/2011.

Optimal splitters for temporal and multi-version databases,Wangchao Le; Feifei Li; Yufei Tao; Robert Christensen,Abstract Temporal and multi-version databases are ideal candidates for a distributed store;which offers large storage space; and parallel and distributed processing power from acluster of (commodity) machines. A key challenge is to achieve a good load balancingalgorithm for storage and processing of these data; which is done by partitioning thedatabase. We introduce the concept of optimal splitters for temporal and multi-versiondatabases; which induce a partition of the input data set; and guarantee that the size of themaximum bucket be minimized among all possible configurations; given a budget for thedesired number of buckets. We design efficient methods for memory-and disk resident datarespectively; and show that they significantly outperform competing baseline methods boththeoretically and empirically on large real data sets.,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,12

Fast and Concurrent RDF Queries with RDMA-based Distributed Graph Exploration,Jiaxin Shi; Youyang Yao; Rong Chen; Haibo Chen; Feifei Li,Abstract Many public knowledge bases are represented and stored as RDF graphs; whereusers can issue structured queries on such graphs using SPARQL. With massive queriesover large and constantly growing RDF data; it is imperative that an RDF graph store shouldprovide low latency and high throughput for concurrent query processing. However; priorsystems still experience high perquery latency over large datasets and most prior designshave poor resource utilization such that each query is processed in sequence. We presentWukong 1; a distributed graph-based RDF store that leverages RDMA-based graphexploration to provide highly concurrent and low-latency queries over large data sets.Wukong is novel in three ways.

Spatial online sampling and aggregation,Lu Wang; Robert Christensen; Feifei Li; Ke Yi,Abstract The massive adoption of smart phones and other mobile devices has generatedhumongous amount of spatial and spatio-temporal data. The importance of spatial analyticsand aggregation is ever-increasing. An important challenge is to support interactiveexploration over such data.

The world in a nutshell: Concise range queries,Ke Yi; Xiang Lian; Feifei Li; Lei Chen,With the advance of wireless communication technology; it is quite common for people toview maps or get related services from the handheld devices; such as mobile phones andPDAs. Range queries; as one of the most commonly used tools; are often posed by theusers to retrieve needful information from a spatial database. However; due to the limits ofcommunication bandwidth and hardware power of handheld devices; displaying all theresults of a range query on a handheld device is neither communication-efficient norinformative to the users. This is simply because that there are often too many resultsreturned from a range query. In view of this problem; we present a novel idea that a conciserepresentation of a specified size for the range query results; while incurring minimalinformation loss; shall be computed and returned to the user.

Oblivious ram: a dissection and experimental evaluation,Zhao Chang; Dong Xie; Feifei Li,Abstract Many companies choose the cloud as their data and IT infrastructure platform. Theremote access of the data brings the issue of trust. Despite the use of strong encryptionschemes; adversaries can still learn valuable information regarding encrypted data byobserving the data access patterns. To that end; one can hide the access patterns; whichmay leak sensitive information; using Oblivious RAMs (ORAMs). Numerous works haveproposed different ORAM constructions; but they have never been thoroughly comparedagainst and tested on large databases. There are also no open source implementation ofthese schemes. These limitations make it difficult for researchers and practitioners to chooseand adopt a suitable ORAM for their applications.

Dynamic monitoring of optimal locations in road network databases,Bin Yao; Xiaokui Xiao; Feifei Li; Yifan Wu,Abstract Optimal location (OL) queries are a type of spatial queries that are particularlyuseful for the strategic planning of resources. Given a set of existing facilities and a set ofclients; an OL query asks for a location to build a new facility that optimizes a certain costmetric (defined based on the distances between the clients and the facilities). Severaltechniques have been proposed to address OL queries; assuming that all clients andfacilities reside in an L_p L p space. In practice; however; movements between spatiallocations are usually confined by the underlying road network; and hence; the actualdistance between two locations can differ significantly from their L_p L p distance. Motivatedby the deficiency of the existing techniques; this paper presents a comprehensive study onOL queries in road networks.

Query access assurance in outsourced databases,Wangchao Le; Feifei Li,Query execution assurance is an important concept in defeating lazy servers in the databaseas a service model. We show that extending query execution assurance to outsourceddatabases with multiple data owners is highly inefficient. To cope with lazy servers in thedistributed setting; we propose query access assurance (Qaa) that focuses on IO-boundqueries. The goal in Qaa is to enable clients to verify that the server has honestly accessedall records that are necessary to compute the correct query answer; thus eliminating theincentives for the server to be lazy if the query cost is dominated by the IO cost in accessingthese records. We formalize this concept for distributed databases; and present two efficientschemes that achieve Qaa with high success probabilities. The first scheme is simple toimplement and deploy; but may incur excessive server to client communication cost and …,IEEE Transactions on services computing,2012,6

Privacy Preserving Subgraph Matching on Large Graphs in Cloud,Zhao Chang; Lei Zou; Feifei Li,Abstract The wide presence of large graph data and the increasing popularity of storing datain the cloud drive the needs for graph query processing on a remote cloud. But afundamental challenge is to process user queries without compromising sensitiveinformation. This work focuses on privacy preserving subgraph matching in a cloud server.The goal is to minimize the overhead on both cloud and client sides for subgraph matching;without compromising users' sensitive information. To that end; we transform an originalgraph $ G $ into a privacy preserving graph G k; which meets the requirement of an existingprivacy model known as k-automorphism. By making use of the symmetry in a k-automorphicgraph; a subgraph matching query can be efficiently answered using a graph G o; a smallsubset of G k. This approach saves both space and query cost in the cloud server. We …,ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data 2016; San Francisco; USA,2016,1
Generating and implementing local search engines over large databases,*,Embodiments described herein are directed to providing local search engines over largedatabases. In one scenario; a computing system receives as inputs data records stored in adatabase. The computing parses the data records into file pairs that each include a keywordfile and record ID file and merges file pairs into a keyword file and record ID file; where thekeyword file includes keywords in sorted order; and where the record ID file includes a list ofrecord IDs for keywords in the keyword file. The computing system further creates an offsetfile which stores offset values for starting addresses of record ID lists in the record ID file; andgenerates an index of keywords by assigning unique identifiers to keywords in the keywordfile. The computing system also provides a query interface that allows the database's datarecords to be searched using the generated index of keywords.,*,2016,1
Scalable histograms on large probabilistic data,Mingwang Tang; Feifei Li,Abstract Histogram construction is a fundamental problem in data management; and a goodhistogram supports numerous mining operations. Recent work has extended histograms toprobabilistic data. However; constructing histograms for probabilistic data can be extremelyexpensive; and existing studies suffer from limited scalability. This work designs novelapproximation methods to construct scalable histograms on probabilistic data. We show thatour methods provide constant approximations compared to the optimal histograms producedby the state-of-the-art in the worst case.

ColumbuScout: towards building local search engines over large databases,Cody Hansen; Feifei Li,Abstract In many database applications; search is still executed via form based queryinterfaces; which are then translated into SQL statements to find matching records. Rankingis usually not implemented unless users have explicitly indicated how to rank the matchingrecords; eg; in the ascending order of year. Often; this approach is neither intuitive nor userfriendly (especially with many search fields in a query form). It also requires applicationdevelopers to design schema-specific query forms and develop specific programs thatunderstand these forms. In this work; we propose to demonstrate the ColumbuScout systemthat aims at quickly building and deploying a local search engine over one or more largedatabases. The ColumbuScout system adopts a search-engine-style approach for searchesover local databases. It introduces its own indexing structures and storage designs; to …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,1

GreedyDual-Join: Locality-aware buffer management for approximate join processing over data streams,Ching Chang; Feifei Li; Azer Bestavros,We investigate adaptive buffer management techniques for approximate evaluation ofsliding window joins over multiple data streams. In many applications; data streamprocessing systems have limited memory or have to deal with very high speed data streams.In both cases; computing the exact results of joins between these streams may not befeasible; mainly because the buffers used to compute the joins contain much smallernumber of tuples than the tuples contained in the sliding windows. Therefore; a stream buffermanagement policy is needed in that case. We show that the buffer replacement policy is animportant determinant of the quality of the produced results. To that end; we proposeGreedyDual-Join (GDJ) an adaptive and locality-aware buffering technique for managingthese buffers. GDJ exploits the temporal correlations (at both long and short time scales) …,*,2004,1
Scalable Keyword Search on Big RDF Data,Wangchao Le; Feifei Li; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Songyun Duan,Abstract—Keyword search is a useful tool for exploring large RDF datasets. Existingtechniques either rely on constructing a distance matrix for pruning the search space orbuilding summarization from the RDF graphs for query processing. In this work; we showthat existing techniques have serious limitations in dealing with realistic; large RDF graphswith tens of millions of triples. Furthermore; the existing summarization techniques may alsoreturn incorrect results. To address these issues; we propose a new; succinct and effectivesummarization from the underlying RDF data. Given a keyword query; the summarizationlends significant pruning powers to exploratory keyword search and leads to much betterefficiency compared to previous work. Unlike existing summarization techniques; oursummarization always returns exact results and can be updated incrementally and …,*,*,1

Random Sampling over Joins Revisited,Zhuoyue Zhao; Robert Christensen; Feifei Li; Xiao Hu; Ke Yi,ABSTRACT Joins are expensive; especially on large data and/or multiple relations. Onepromising approach in mitigating their high costs is to just return a simple random sample ofthe full join results; which is sufficient for many tasks. Indeed; in as early as 1999; Chaudhuriet al. posed the problem of sampling over joins as a fundamental challenge in largedatabase systems. They also pointed out a fundamental barrier for this problem; that thesampling operator cannot be pushed through a join; ie; sample (R▷◁ S) sample (R)▷◁sample (S). To overcome this barrier; they used precomputed statistics to guide the samplingprocess; but only showed how this works for two-relation joins. This paper revisits thisclassic problem for both acyclic and cyclic multi-way joins. We build upon the idea ofChaudhuri et al.; but extend it in several nontrivial directions. First; we propose a general …,*,2018,*
Persistent Bloom Filter: Membership Testing for the Entire History,Yanqing Peng; Jinwei Guo; Feifei Li; Weining Qian; Aoying Zhou,ABSTRACT Membership testing is the problem of testing whether an element is in a set ofelements. Performing the test exactly is expensive space-wise; requiring the storage of allelements in a set. In many applications; an approximate testing that can be done quicklyusing small space is o en desired. Bloom lter (BF) was designed and has witnessed greatsuccess across numerous application domains. But there is no compact structure thatsupports set membership testing for temporal queries; eg; has person A visited a web serverbetween 9: 30am and 9: 40am? And has the same person visited the web server againbetween 9: 45am and 9: 50am? It is possible to support such “temporal membership testing”using a BF; but we will show that this is fairly expensive. To that end; this paper designspersistent bloom lter (PBF); a novel data structure for temporal membership testing with …,*,2018,*

Twitter-derived neighborhood characteristics associated with obesity and diabetes,Quynh C Nguyen; Kimberly D Brunisholz; Weijun Yu; Matt McCullough; Heidi A Hanson; Michelle L Litchman; Feifei Li; Yuan Wan; James A VanDerslice; Ming Wen; Ken R Smith,Abstract Neighborhood characteristics are increasingly connected with health outcomes.Social processes affect health through the maintenance of social norms; stimulation of newinterests; and dispersal of knowledge. We created zip code level indicators of happiness;food; and physical activity culture from geolocated Twitter data to examine the relationshipbetween these neighborhood characteristics and obesity and diabetes diagnoses (Type 1and Type 2). We collected 422;094 tweets sent from Utah between April 2015 and March2016. We leveraged administrative and clinical records on 1.86 million individuals aged 20years and older in Utah in 2015. Individuals living in zip codes with the greatest percentageof happy and physically-active tweets had lower obesity prevalence—accounting forindividual age; sex; nonwhite race; Hispanic ethnicity; education; and marital status; as …,Scientific reports,2017,*

DeepLog: Anomaly Detection and Diagnosis from System Logs through Deep Learning,Min Du; Feifei Li; Guineng Zheng; Vivek Srikumar,Abstract Anomaly detection is a critical step towards building a secure and trustworthysystem. The primary purpose of a system log is to record system states and significantevents at various critical points to help debug system failures and perform root causeanalysis. Such log data is universally available in nearly all computer systems. Log data isan important and valuable resource for understanding system status and performanceissues; therefore; the various system logs are naturally excellent source of information foronline monitoring and anomaly detection. We propose DeepLog; a deep neural networkmodel utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM); to model a system log as a naturallanguage sequence. This allows DeepLog to automatically learn log patterns from normalexecution; and detect anomalies when log patterns deviate from the model trained from …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2017,*

Distributed trajectory similarity search,Dong Xie; Feifei Li; Jeff M Phillips,Abstract Mobile and sensing devices have already become ubiquitous. They have madetracking moving objects an easy task. As a result; mobile applications like Uber and manyIoT projects have generated massive amounts of trajectory data that can no longer beprocessed by a single machine efficiently. Among the typical query operations overtrajectories; similarity search is a common yet expensive operator in querying trajectory data.It is useful for applications in different domains such as traffic and transportationoptimizations; weather forecast and modeling; and sports analytics. It is also a fundamentaloperator for many important mining operations such as clustering and classification oftrajectories. In this paper; we propose a distributed query framework to process trajectorysimilarity search over a large set of trajectories.

Wander Join and XDB: Online Aggregation via Random Walks,Feifei Li; Bin Wu; Ke Yi; Zhuoyue Zhao,Abstract Joins are expensive; and online aggregation is an effective approach to explore thetradeoff between query efficiency and accuracy in a continuous; online fashion. However;the stateof-the-art approach; in both internal and external memory; is based on ripple join;which is still very expensive and needs strong assumptions (eg; the tuples in a table arestored in random order). This paper proposes a new approach; the wander join algorithm; tothe online aggregation problem by performing random walks over the underlying join graph.We also design an optimizer that chooses the optimal plan for conducting the random walkswithout having to collect any statistics a priori. Selection predicates and group-by clausescan be handled as well. We have developed an online engine called XDB by integratingwander join in the latest version of PostgreSQL.

Graduate School of Arts and Sciences,FEIFEI LI,ABSTRACT In this dissertation; I study critical phenomena and phase transitions in systemswith longrange interactions; in particular; the ferromagnetic Ising model with quenched sitedilution and the asset exchange model with growth. In the site-diluted Ising model; I focus onthe effects of quenched disorder on both critical phenomena and nucleation. For criticalphenomena; I generalize the Harris criterion for the mean-field critical point and thespinodal; and find that they are not affected by dilution; whereas pseudospinodals aresmeared out. For nucleation; I find that dilution reduces the lifetime of the metastable state. Ialso investigate the structure of nucleating droplets in both nearest-neighbor and long-rangeIsing models. In both cases; nucleating droplets are more likely to occur in spatially moredilute regions. I also modify the asset exchange model to include different types of …,*,2013,*
Privacy Preservation on Time Series,Spiros Papadimitriou; Feifei Li; George Kollios; S Yu Philip,Time series data are sequence of values based on observations at periodic time instantsand appear in a wide range of domains and applications; such as financial; retail;environmental and process monitoring; defense and health care. Additionally; massivevolumes of data from various sources are continuously collected. However; when a dataowner wants to publish this data he may not be willing to exactly reveal the true values dueto various reasons; most notably privacy considerations. A widely employed and acceptedapproach for partial information hiding is based on random perturbation [4]; whichintroduces uncertainty about individual values. Consider the following examples:,Privacy-Aware Knowledge Discovery: Novel Applications and New Techniques,2010,*
Semantics of Ranking Queries for Probabilistic Data,Jeffrey Jestes; Graham Cormode; Feifei Li; Ke Yi,Abstract—Recently; there have been several attempts to propose definitions and algorithmsfor ranking queries on probabilistic data. However; these lack many intuitive properties of atop-k over deterministic data. We define numerous fundamental properties; including exact-k; containment; unique-rank; value-invariance; and stability; which are satisfied by rankingqueries on certain data. We argue these properties should also be carefully studied indefining ranking queries in probabilistic data; and fulfilled by definition for ranking uncertaindata for most applications. We propose an intuitive new ranking definition based on theobservation that the ranks of a tuple across all possible worlds represent a well-foundedrank distribution. We studied the ranking definitions based on the expectation; the medianand other statistics of this rank distribution for a tuple and derived the expected rank …,IEEE Transactions on Communications,1991,*
Secure DIMM: Moving ORAM Primitives Closer to Memory,Ali Shafiee; Rajeev Balasubramonian; Feifei Li; Mohit Tiwari,Abstract—As more critical applications move to the cloud; there is a pressing need toprovide privacy guarantees for data and computation. While cloud infrastructures arevulnerable to a variety of attacks; in this work; we focus on an attack model where anuntrusted cloud operator has physical access to the server and can monitor the signalsemerging from the processor socket. Even if data packets are encrypted; the sequence ofaddresses touched by the program serves as an information side channel. To eliminate thisside channel; Oblivious RAM constructs have been investigated for decades; but continue topose large overheads. In this work; we make the case that ORAM overheads can besignificantly reduced by moving some ORAM functionality into the memory system.
