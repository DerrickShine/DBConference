Early nested word automata for XPath query answering on XML streams,Denis Debarbieux; Olivier Gauwin; Joachim Niehren; Tom Sebastian; Mohamed Zergaoui,Abstract Algorithms for answering XPath queries on Xml streams have been studiedintensively in the last decade. Nevertheless; there still exists no solution with high efficiencyand large coverage. In this paper; we introduce early nested word automata in order toapproximate earliest query answering algorithms for nested word automata. Our early queryanswering algorithm is based on stack-and-state sharing for running early nested wordautomata on all answer candidates with on-the-fly determinization. We prove tight uppercomplexity bounds on time and space consumption. We have implemented our algorithm inthe QuiXPath system and show that it outperforms all previous tools in coverage on theXPathMark benchmark; while obtaining very high time and space efficiency and scaling tohuge Xml streams. Furthermore; it turns out that our early query answering algorithm is …,Theoretical Computer Science,2015,22

Path tree: document synopsis for XPath query selectivity estimation,Muath Alrammal; Gaétan Hains; Mohamed Zergaoui,XML is one of the most important standards for manipulating data on the Internet. However;querying large volumes of XML data represents a bottleneck for several computationallyintensive applications. A solution is to pre-process the document in streaming mode withresources approximately proportional to document depth and query selectivity. Limitedprocessing space can then accommodate much larger documents. But the actual savingsvary so much as to make them unpredictable. To overcome this limitation of stream-processing we propose a new application of the path tree synopsis data structure. Such asynopsis provides a succinct description of the original document with low computationaloverhead and high accuracy for processing tasks like selectivity estimation and queryanswer approximation. In this paper; we formally define the path tree synopsis; informally …,Complex; Intelligent and Software Intensive Systems (CISIS); 2011 International Conference on,2011,11
A portable and extensible performance model for stream-processing of XPath queries,Muath Alrammal; Gaétan Hains; Mohamed Zergaoui,XML has become a standard for document storage and interchange and its convenientsyntax improves the interoperability of many applications. The computational complexity andpractical cost of XPath queries can vary dramatically so its unconstrained use leads tounpredictable space and time costs. Stream-processing of XPath queries mitigates thisproblem by restricting the query language fragment and allows simpler implementations bystack automata with no limit on the XML document size. We have designed an accurateperformance model for such algorithms. It collects static information about the XMLdocument to statically predict the memory consumption of a query to within a few percent.The model is portable; adapts to any document structure and scales to 1GiB documents andbeyond. In addition to predictable performance; user interaction with the system can lead …,Rapport interne TR-LACL-2010-4; LACL; Laboratoire d’algorithmique; complexité et logique; Université Paris-Est Créteil Val de Marne (UPEC),2010,6
Intelligent Ordered XPath for Processing Data Streams.,Muath Alrammal; Gaétan Hains; Mohamed Zergaoui,Abstract Data Streaming is a necessary and useful technique to process very large XMLdocuments but poses serious algorithmic problems; various approaches and algorithmswere implemented to fulfill this purpose.

Performance measurements towards the optimization of stream processing for XML Data,Muath Alrammal; Gaétan Hains; Mohamed Zergaoui,In this report we present the first experimental results to support our proposal [1] as anattempt to optimize stream processing for XML data. A core prototype called O-Search wasimplemented to have a concrete understanding for the complexity of stream-queryingalgorithms i; with respect to different structures of XML documents (wide; depth; varioussize). Space and time measurements are applied to state the possible performance gainsfrom the use of meta data to orient searching in stream XML data.,*,2009,5
Realistic Performance Gain Measurements for XML Data Streaming with Meta Data,Muath Alrammal; Gaétan Hains; Mohamed Zergaoui,This report is part of our ongoing project on the optimization of stream processing for XPathqueries on XML documents. The fact that XML documents can be large relative to query-processing memory is one of the reasons to favour streaming over in-core processing. Buteven in streaming mode query processing uses storage and hence time proportional to thedepth of sub-documents. With the goal of querying large documents on mobile devices; orvery large ones on normal machines; we have designed a scheme whereby exhaustivesearching can be traded against streaming performance. Our scheme uses query meta-datawhich restricts the search to a subset of the document. In an earlier report we havemeasured the maximal theoretical gains possible with perfect" chance" on choosing themeta-data for synthetic documents; and have found them attractive. In this report we verify …,*,2009,3
