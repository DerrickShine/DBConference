Young’s modulus of graphene: a molecular dynamics study,Jin-Wu Jiang; Jian-Sheng Wang; Baowen Li,Abstract The Young's modulus of graphene is investigated through the intrinsic thermalvibration in graphene which is “observed” by molecular dynamics and the results agree verywell with the recent experiment [Lee et al.; Science 321; 385 (2008)]. This method is furtherapplied to show that the Young's modulus of graphene (1) increases with increasing sizeand saturates after a threshold value of the size;(2) increases from 0.95 to 1.1 TPa astemperature increases in the region [100; 500] K;(3) is insensitive to the isotopic disorder inthe low disorder region (< 5%) and decreases gradually after further increasing the disorderpercentage.,Physical Review B,2009,273
Small-scale effects on buckling of multiwalled carbon nanotubes under axial compression,YQ Zhang; GR Liu; JS Wang,Abstract Based on the theory of nonlocal continuum mechanics; a multiple shell model isdeveloped for the axial buckling of multiwalled carbon nanotubes under axial compression.The effects of small length scale are incorporated in this model. In particular; an explicitexpression is derived for the axial buckling strain for a double-walled carbon nanotube. Onthe basis of this expression; the influence of the small length scale on the axial bucklingstrain is discussed. As a result; the effect of small length scale on the axial buckling strain isrelated to the buckling mode and the length-to-radial ratio.,Physical review B,2004,244

Finite-size effects at critical points with anisotropic correlations: Phenomenological scaling theory and Monte Carlo simulations,Kurt Binder; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract Various thermal equilibrium and nonequilibrium phase transitions exist where thecorrelation lengths in different lattice directions diverge with different exponents v‖; v⊥:uniaxial Lifshitz points; the Kawasaki spin exchange model driven by an electric field; etc. Anextension of finite-size scaling concepts to such anisotropic situations is proposed; includinga discussion of (generalized) rectangular geometries; with linear dimension L‖ in thespecial direction and linear dimensions L⊥ in all other directions. The related shape effectsfor L‖≠ L⊥ but isotropic critical points are also discussed. Particular attention is paid to thecase where the generalized hyperscaling relation v‖+(d− 1) v⊥= γ+ 2 β does not hold.

Carbon nanotube thermal transport: ballistic to diffusive,Jian Wang; Jian-Sheng Wang,We propose the expression ℓ 0∕(ℓ 0+ L) for the energy transmission covering both ballisticand diffusive regimes; where ℓ 0 is mean free path and L is system length. With this formula;calculations of thermal conduction in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) show:(1) Thermalconductance at room temperature is proportional to the diameter for single-walled CNTs(SWCNTs) and to the square of diameter for multiwalled CNTs.(2) Interfaces play animportant role in thermal conduction in CNTs due to their symmetry of vibrational modes.(3)For CNTs in ballistic-diffusive regime; thermal conductivity κ goes as L α. The exponent α isfound to decrease with increasing temperature and is insensitive to the diameter of SWCNTsfor the Umklapp process; α≈ 0.8 for short SWCNTs at room temperature. These results areconsistent with recent experimental findings.,Applied physics letters,2006,176
Nonequilibrium Green’s function approach to mesoscopic thermal transport,Jian-Sheng Wang; Jian Wang; Nan Zeng,Abstract We present a formulation of a nonequilibrium Green's function method for thermalcurrent in nanojunction atomic systems with nonlinear interactions. This first-principlesapproach is applied to the calculation of the thermal conductance in a one-dimensionalchain and carbon nanotube junctions. It is shown that nonlinearity already becomesimportant at low temperatures. Nonlinear interactions greatly suppress phonon transmissionat room temperature. The peak of thermal conductance is found to be around 400 K; in goodagreement with experiments. High-order phonon scattering processes are important fordiffusive heat transport.,Physical Review B,2006,167

The method gives an efficient reweighting technique. This dynamics isshown to have relaxation times proportional to the specific heat. From this we argue for alogarithmic factor in the correlation time of the standard 2D Ising local dynamics.,Physical review letters,1999,157
Thermal conduction of carbon nanotubes using molecular dynamics,Zhenhua Yao; Jian-Sheng Wang; Baowen Li; Gui-Rong Liu,Abstract The heat flux autocorrelation functions of carbon nanotubes (CNT's) with differentradii and lengths are calculated using equilibrium molecular dynamics with periodicboundary conditions. The thermal conductance of CNT's is also calculated using the Green-Kubo formula from linear response theory. By pointing out an ambiguity in the cross-sectiondefinition of single-wall CNT's; we refer to the thermal conductance instead of conductivity incalculations and discussions. We find that the thermal conductance of CNT's diverges withthe length of CNT's. After an analysis of vibrational density of states; it is shown that there aremore and stronger low-frequency vibrational modes in longer CNT's; and these modeseffectively contribute to the divergence of thermal conductance.,Physical Review B,2005,155
Thermal expansion in single-walled carbon nanotubes and graphene: Nonequilibrium Green’s function approach,Jin-Wu Jiang; Jian-Sheng Wang; Baowen Li,Abstract The nonequilibrium Green's function method is applied to investigate the coefficientof thermal expansion (CTE) in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) and graphene. It isfound that atoms expand about 1% from equilibrium positions even at T= 0 K; resulting fromthe interplay between quantum zero-point motion and nonlinear interaction. The CTE inSWCNT of different sizes is studied and analyzed in terms of the competition betweenvarious vibration modes. As a result of this competition; the axial CTE is positive in the wholetemperature range; while the radial CTE is negative at low temperatures. In graphene; theCTE is very sensitive to the substrate. Without substrate; CTE has large negative region atlow temperatures and very small value at high-temperature limit; and the value of CTE at300 K is− 6× 10− 6 K− 1 which is very close to a recent experimental result;− 7× 10− 6 K …,Physical Review B,2009,144
Intriguing heat conduction of a chain with transverse motions,Jian-Sheng Wang; Baowen Li,Abstract We study heat conduction in a one-dimensional chain of particles with longitudinalas well as transverse motions. The particles are connected by two-dimensional harmonicsprings together with bending angle interactions. Using equilibrium and nonequilibriummolecular dynamics; three types of thermal conducting behaviors are found: a logarithmicdivergence with system sizes for large transverse coupling; 1/3 power law at intermediatecoupling; and 2/5 power law at low temperatures and weak coupling. The results areconsistent with a simple mode-coupling analysis of the same model. We suggest that the 1/3power-law divergence should be a generic feature for models with transverse motions.,Physical review letters,2004,137
Thermal conductance of graphene and dimerite,Jin-Wu Jiang; Jian-Sheng Wang; Baowen Li,Abstract We investigate the phonon thermal conductance of graphene regarding thegraphene sheet as the large-width limit of graphene strips in the ballistic limit. We find thatthe thermal conductance depends weakly on the direction angle θ of the thermal fluxperiodically with period π/3. It is further shown that the nature of this directional dependenceis the directional dependence of group velocities of the phonon modes in the graphene;originating from the D 6 h symmetry in the honeycomb structure. By breaking the D 6 hsymmetry in graphene; we see more obvious anisotropic effect in the thermal conductanceas demonstrated by dimerite.,Physical Review B,2009,130

Edge effects on quantum thermal transport in graphene nanoribbons: Tight-binding calculations,Jinghua Lan; Jian-Sheng Wang; Chee Kwan Gan; Sai Kong Chin,Abstract We investigate the quantum thermal transport properties of graphene nanoribbons(GNRs) with natural edges by combining the Naval Research Laboratory tight-bindingapproach and the phonon nonequilibrium Green's function method. Thermal transport ofGNRs shows substantial dependence on the width due to edge reconstructions. For GNRswith n≥ 12; where n is the number of atoms along the direction perpendicular to the ribbonaxis; the effect of natural edges is negligible and quantized thermal transport is observed.For GNRs with 2< n< 12; natural edges destroy quantized thermal transport and reducethermal conductance significantly. For the narrowest GNR with n= 2; perfect quantizedthermal transport is restored and a zero-transmission phonon band gap appears at ω=785∼ 808 cm− 1. By sandwiching the narrowest GNR between two wide GNRs; the band …,Physical Review B,2009,123

Disorder enhances thermoelectric figure of merit in armchair graphane nanoribbons,Xiaoxi Ni; Gengchiau Liang; Jian-Sheng Wang; Baowen Li,We study the thermoelectric property of graphane strips by using density functional theorycalculations combined with the nonequilibrium Green's function method. It is found thatfigure of merit (ZT) can be remarkably enhanced five times by randomly introducinghydrogen vacancies to the graphene nanoribon derivatives—armchair graphanenanoribbons. For 5 nm wide ribbons under certain conditions; ZT can be as high as 5.8 anddepends on temperature linearly. The high ZT; low cost; and rapid advances in the synthesisof nanoscale graphene derivatives make carbon-based materials a viable choice forthermoelectric applications.,Applied Physics Letters,2009,122
Isotopic effects on the thermal conductivity of graphene nanoribbons: Localization mechanism,Jin-Wu Jiang; Jinghua Lan; Jian-Sheng Wang; Baowen Li,Thermal conductivity of graphene nanoribbons (GNR) with length 106 Å and width 4.92 Åafter isotopic doping is investigated by molecular dynamics with quantum correction. Twointeresting phenomena are found;(1) isotopic doping reduces thermal conductivity effectivelyin low doping region; and the reduction slows down in high doping region;(2) thermalconductivity increases with increasing temperature in both pure and doped GNR; but theincreasing behavior is much more slow in the doped GNR than that in pure ones. Furtherstudies reveal that the physics of these two phenomena is related to the localized phononmodes; whose number increases quickly (slowly) with increasing isotopic doping in low(high) isotopic doping region.,Journal of Applied Physics,2010,119
Random sequential adsorption: Series and virial expansions,Ronald Dickman; Jian‐Sheng Wang; Iwan Jensen,We introduce an operator formalism for random sequential adsorption on lattices and incontinuous space. This provides a convenient framework for deriving series expansions forthe deposition rate d θ/dt in powers of t. Several specific examples—the square lattice withnearest‐neighbor exclusion; and with exclusion extended to next‐nearest neighbors; anddisks and oriented squares on the plane—are considered in detail. Precise estimates for θ(t) and the jamming coverage are obtained via Padé approximant analysis. These are foundto be in excellent agreement with simulation results. A diagrammatic expansion for d θ/dt isderived; and its relation to the equilibrium Mayer series is elucidated.,The Journal of chemical physics,1991,119
Improved neighbor list algorithm in molecular simulations using cell decomposition and data sorting method,Zhenhua Yao; Jian-Sheng Wang; Gui-Rong Liu; Min Cheng,Abstract An improved neighbor list algorithm is proposed to reduce unnecessary interatomicdistance calculations in molecular simulations. It combines the advantages of Verlet tableand cell linked list algorithms by using cell decomposition approach to accelerate theneighbor list construction speed; and data sorting method to lower the CPU data cache missrate; as well as partial updating method to minimize the unnecessary reconstruction of theneighbor list. Both serial and parallel performance of molecular dynamics simulation areevaluated using the proposed algorithm and compared with those using conventional Verlettable and cell linked list algorithms. Results show that the new algorithm outperforms theconventional algorithms by a factor of 2∼ 3 in cases of both small and large number ofatoms.,Computer physics communications,2004,118

The chiral edge states form a connected loop as a 4 π-or 8 π-periodMöbius strip in the spin-wave vector space; showing the nontrivial topology of magnonicbands. Using the nonequilibrium Green's function method; we explicitly demonstrate that theone-way chiral edge transport is indeed topologically protected from defects or disorders.Moreover; we show that the topological edge state mainly localizes around edges and leaksinto the bulk with oscillatory decay. Although the chiral edge magnons and energy currentprefer to travel along one edge from the hot region to the cold one; the anomalous …,Physical Review B,2013,115

In the randomness dominated critical region; the size dependences of thespecific heat; C; the susceptibility; χ; and the magnetization; m; at critically are in very goodagreement with the analytic predictions; C≈ ln ln L; χ≈ L if 7 4; and m≈ L− 1 8.

Quantum thermal transport from classical molecular dynamics,Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract Using a generalized Langevin equation of motion; quantum thermal transport isobtained from classical molecular dynamics. This is possible because the heat baths arerepresented by random noises obeying quantum Bose-Einstein statistics. The numericalmethod gives asymptotically exact results in both the low-temperature ballistic transportregime and the high-temperature strongly nonlinear classical regime. The method is aquasiclassical approximation to the quantum transport problem. A one-dimensional quarticon-site model is used to demonstrate the crossover from ballistic to diffusive thermaltransport.,Physical review letters,2007,106
Continuum limit in random sequential adsorption,V Privman; J-S Wang; P Nielaba,Abstract We develop analytical estimates of the late-stage (long-time) asymptotic behavior ofthe coverage in the D-dimensional lattice models of irreversible deposition of hypercube-shaped particles. Our results elucidate the crossover from the exponential time dependencefor the lattice case to the power-law behavior with a multiplicative logarithmic factor; in thecontinuum deposition. Numerical Monte Carlo results are reported for the two-dimensional(2D) deposition; both lattice and continuum. Combined with the exact 1D results; they areused to test the general theoretical expectations for the late-stage deposition kinetics. Newaccurate estimates of the jamming coverages in 2D rule out some earlier ''exact''conjectures.Generally; a combination of lattice and continuum simulations; with asymptotic crossoveranalysis; allows for a deeper understanding of the deposition kinetics and derivation of …,Physical Review B,1991,106
First-principles study of heat transport properties of graphene nanoribbons,Zhen Wah Tan; Jian-Sheng Wang; Chee Kwan Gan,We use density-functional theory and the nonequilibrium Green's function method as well asphonon dispersion calculations to study the thermal conductance of graphene nanoribbonswith armchair and zigzag edges; with and without hydrogen passivation. We find that low-frequency phonon bands of the zigzag ribbons are more dispersive than those of thearmchair ribbons and that this difference accounts for the anisotropy in the thermalconductance of graphene nanoribbons. Comparing our results with data on large-areagraphene; edge effects are shown to contribute to thermal conductance; enhance theanisotropy in thermal conductance of graphene nanoribbons; and increase thermalconductance per unit width. The edges with and without hydrogen passivation modify theatomic structure and ultimately influence the phonon thermal transport differently for the …,Nano letters,2010,100
Low-temperature properties of the±J Ising spin glass in two dimensions,Jian-Sheng Wang; Robert H Swendsen,Abstract The replica Monte Carlo simulation method and finite-size transfer-matrix methodare used to study low-temperature properties of the±J Ising spin glass in two dimensions.We find the spin-glass susceptibility exponent γ= 5.11±0.05 with a zero-temperaturetransition. The ground-state entropy s 0= 0.071±0.007 by Monte Carlo simulation agreeswell with previous transfer-matrix calculation; and the specific heat at low temperature hasan asymptotic form ck B≈ 1.3 J 2 (k BT) 2 e− 2 J (k BT); which indicates an energy 2 J as low-lying excitations. We show that the replica Monte Carlo method is much faster than standardannealing for finding ground states.,Physical Review B,1988,100
Interfacial thermal conductance between silicon and a vertical carbon nanotube,Ming Hu; Pawel Keblinski; Jian-Sheng Wang; Nachiket Raravikar,Molecular simulations are used to evaluate thermal resistance between crystalline siliconand a vertically oriented carbon nanotube (CNT). Without chemical bonds between CNT andSi the thermal resistance is high and its values are consistent with that measured inexperiment on vertical CNT arrays. With chemical bonds the thermal resistance is reducedby two orders of magnitude demonstrating significant potential of CNT arrays for thermalmanagement applications. The underlying mechanism for the very large effect of chemicalbonding is revealed by simulations of individual phonon scattering across the interface andunderstood within an analytical solution of a simple spring-mass chain model.,Journal of Applied Physics,2008,97
Nonequilibrium Green’s function method for thermal transport in junctions,Jian-Sheng Wang; Nan Zeng; Jian Wang; Chee Kwan Gan,Abstract We present a detailed treatment of the nonequilibrium Green's function method forthermal transport due to atomic vibrations in nanostructures. Some of the key equations;such as self-energy and conductance with nonlinear effect; are derived. A self-consistentmean-field theory is proposed. Computational procedures are discussed. The method isapplied to a number of systems including one-dimensional chains; a benzene ring junction;and carbon nanotubes. Mean-field calculations of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam model arecompared with classical molecular dynamics simulations using a generalized Langevin heatbath. We find that nonlinearity suppresses thermal transport even at moderately hightemperatures.,Physical Review E,2007,95
Power law decay of correlations in stationary nonequilibrium lattice gases with conservative dynamics,MQ Zhang; J-S Wang; JL Lebowitz; JL Vallés,Abstract We report computer simulations and high-temperature approximations of the paircorrelation in a stationary nonequilibrium system; a lattice gas subject to a strong uniformdriving field E. The dynamics of the system is given by hoppings of particles to adjacentempty sites with rates biased for jumps in the direction of E. We study the anisotropic short-distance behavior as well as the long-distance decay properties of the two-point correlationsalong the principal axes. The simulations as well as the (approximate) expansion in βstrongly suggest that the correlations in this system have a power law decay; r− D fordimensions D= 2 and 3; even at high temperatures.,Journal of statistical physics,1988,89

Square lattices with periodic and helical boundaryconditions have been studied with linear sizes L= 8; 16; 32; 64; 128. Numerical results onthe scaling of the maximum of the specific heat and on the magnetization critical exponentshow the perfect Ising model critical behaviour; for the amount of randomness studied in thepresent work. The shift of the critical temperature T c at the corners of the phase diagram T c(ci); with ci being the concentration of the impurity lattice bonds; is found to agree with theanalytic theory.,Nuclear Physics B,1990,87
Phonon interference at self-assembled monolayer interfaces: Molecular dynamics simulations,Lin Hu; Lifa Zhang; Ming Hu; Jian-Sheng Wang; Baowen Li; Pawel Keblinski,Abstract Using molecular dynamics simulations; we expose phonon interference effects inthermal transports across a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of alkanethiol moleculescovalently bonded to (111) gold substrate and physically bonded to silicon. In particular; weshow that the thermal conductance of SAM-Au interface depends on the bonding strength atthe SAM-Si interface and that the phonon transmission coefficients show strong andoscillatory dependence on frequency; with oscillatory features diminishing with increasingSAM thickness. To explore the generality of this behavior we analyze a simple model ofpoint junction on a one-dimensional chain using the scattering boundary method.,Physical Review B,2010,79
A nonequilibrium Green’s function study of thermoelectric properties in single-walled carbon nanotubes,Jin-Wu Jiang; Jian-Sheng Wang; Baowen Li,The phonon and electron transport in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) areinvestigated using the nonequilibrium Green's function approach. In zigzag SWCNT (n; 0)with mod (n; 3)≠ 0; the thermal conductance is mainly attributed to the phonon transport;while the electron only has few percentage contribution. The maximum value of the figure ofmerit (ZT) is about 0.2 in this type of SWCNT. The ZT is considerably larger in narrowerSWCNT because of enhanced Seebeck coefficient. ZT is smaller in the armchair SWCNT;where Seebeck coefficient is small due to zero band gap. It is found that the cluster isotopicdoping can reduce the phonon thermal conductance obviously and enhance the value of ZT.The uniaxial elongation and compress strain depresses phonons in whole frequency region;leading to the reduction in the phonon thermal conductance in whole temperature range …,Journal of Applied Physics,2011,78

The critical temperature isexactly known from self-duality. The size-dependent specific heat shows a crossover fromthe perfect Ising to the randomness-dominated critical behaviour of doubly logarithmic form.In the latter region; our estimates for the critical exponents of the size-dependentmagnetization and susceptibility are in very good agreement with analytic results suggestingβ/ν= 1/8 and γ/ν= 7/4.,EPL (Europhysics Letters),1990,77

The particles are connected by 2D harmonic springs together withbending angle interactions. The problem is analyzed by mode-coupling theory andcompared with molecular dynamics. We find very good; quantitative agreement for thedamping of modes between a full mode-coupling theory and molecular dynamics result; anda simplified mode-coupling theory gives qualitative description of the damping. The theoriespredict generically that thermal conductance diverges as N 1∕ 3 as the size N increases forsystems terminated with heat baths at the ends. The N 2∕ 5 dependence is also observedin molecular dynamics; which we attribute to crossover effect.,Physical Review E,2004,75

Thermal transport in graphene junctions and quantum dots,Yong Xu; Xiaobin Chen; Jian-Sheng Wang; Bing-Lin Gu; Wenhui Duan,Abstract Thermal-transport properties of various graphene junctions and quantum dots withnanoscale width are systematically investigated by nonequilibrium Green's-function method.Thermal conductance is insensitive to the detailed structure of the contact region butsubstantially limited by the narrowest part of the systems. Thermal-contact resistance innanodevices carved entirely from graphene is quite low (∼ 10− 10 m 2 K/W at 300 K); atleast one order lower than that between graphene and other materials. Interestingly; thermal-contact resistance of double-interface junctions is just slightly higher than that of single-interface junctions; distinct from the case of electronic transport. Moreover; graphenejunctions with smaller connection angles show lower thermal conductance but higherelectronic conductance. The different; even opposite dependences of thermal-and …,Physical Review B,2010,72
Nonequilibrium Green’s function method for phonon-phonon interactions and ballistic-diffusive thermal transport,Yong Xu; Jian-Sheng Wang; Wenhui Duan; Bing-Lin Gu; Baowen Li,Abstract Phonon-phonon interactions are systematically studied by nonequilibrium Green'sfunction (NEGF) formalism in momentum space at finite temperatures. Within thequasiparticle approximation; phonon frequency shift and lifetime are obtained from theretarded self-energy. The lowest-order NEGF provides the same phonon lifetime as Fermi'sgolden rule. Thermal conductance is predicted by the Landauer formula with aphenomenological transmission function. The main advantage of our method is that it coversboth ballistic and diffusive limits; and thermal conductance of different system sizes can beeasily obtained once the mode-dependent phonon mean-free path is calculated by NEGF.As an illustration; the method is applied to two one-dimensional atom chain models [theFermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU)-β model and the ϕ 4 model] with an additional harmonic on-site …,Physical Review B,2008,72
Coupled electron and phonon transport in one-dimensional atomic junctions,JT Lü; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract Employing the nonequilibrium Green's function method; we develop a fully quantummechanical model to study the coupled electron-phonon transport in one-dimensionalatomic junctions connecting to one-dimensional leads. This model enables us to study theelectronic and phononic transport on an equal footing. We derive the electrical and energycurrents of the coupled electron-phonon system and present a self-consistent picture ofenergy exchange between them. As an application; we study the heat dissipation in current-carrying atomic junctions with metallic and semiconductor leads. We find that the inclusion ofphonon transport is important in determining the heat dissipation and temperature change ofthe atomic junctions.,Physical Review B,2007,70
Topological Nature of the Phonon Hall Effect,Lifa Zhang; Jie Ren; Jian-Sheng Wang; Baowen Li,Abstract We provide a topological understanding of the phonon Hall effect in dielectrics withRaman spin-phonon coupling. A general expression for phonon Hall conductivity isobtained in terms of the Berry curvature of band structures. We find a nonmonotonicbehavior of phonon Hall conductivity as a function of the magnetic field. Moreover; weobserve a phase transition in the phonon Hall effect; which corresponds to the suddenchange of band topology; characterized by the altering of integer Chern numbers. This canbe explained by touching and splitting of phonon bands.,Physical review letters,2010,69
Clusters in the three-dimensional Ising model with a magnetic field,Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract We study the clusters generated in the Swendsen-Wang algorithm in a magneticfield. It is shown that the number of clusters is related to that of Coniglio and Klein by simplefactors. With this definition of clusters; infinite size appears whenever the system has anonzero magnetization. Scaling behavior of the number of clusters near the critical point isconfirmed. The number of clusters away from the critical point for large cluster size s isconsistent with ln n≌| h| s− Γ s 2 3 on the low temperature side of the Coniglio-Klein clusterpercolation transition line; and is consistent with ln n≌−(| h|+ c) s on the high temperatureside. We also argue that this transition line is given by h=±h ̃ (T)×(TT c) 1 near T c.,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,1989,68
First principle study of the thermal conductance in graphene nanoribbon with vacancy and substitutional silicon defects,Jin-Wu Jiang; Bing-Shen Wang; Jian-Sheng Wang,The thermal conductance in graphene nanoribbon with a vacancy or silicon point defect isinvestigated by nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism combined with first-principles calculations of density-functional theory with local density approximation. Thethermal conductance is very sensitive to the position of the vacancy defect; while insensitiveto the position of silicon defect. A vacancy defect situated at the center of the nanoribbongenerates a saddlelike surface; which greatly reduces the thermal conductance by strongscattering to all phonon modes; while an edge vacancy defect only results in a furtherreconstruction of the edge and slightly reduces the thermal conductance.,Applied Physics Letters,2011,67
Interfacial thermal transport in atomic junctions,Lifa Zhang; Pawel Keblinski; Jian-Sheng Wang; Baowen Li,Abstract We study ballistic interfacial thermal transport across atomic junctions. Exactexpressions for phonon transmission coefficients are derived for thermal transport in one-junction and two-junction chains; and verified by numerical calculation based on anonequilibrium Green's function method. For a single-junction case; we find that the phonontransmission coefficient typically decreases monotonically with increasing freqency.However; in the range between the point of equal frequency spectrum and that of equalacoustic impedance; it first increases then decreases; which explains why the Kapitzaresistance calculated from the acoustic mismatch model is far larger than the experimentalvalues at low temperatures. The junction thermal conductance reaches a maximum whenthe interfacial coupling equals the harmonic average of the spring constants of the two …,Physical Review B,2011,67
Minimum thermal conductance in graphene and boron nitride superlattice,Jin-Wu Jiang; Jian-Sheng Wang; Bing-Shen Wang,The minimum thermal conductance versus supercell size (ds) is revealed in graphene andboron nitride superlattice with ds far below the phonon mean free path. The minimum valueis reached at a constant ratio of ds/L≈ 5%; where L is the thickness of the superlattice; thus;the minimum point of ds depends on L. The phenomenon is attributed to the localizationproperty and the number of confined modes in the superlattice. With the increase of ds; thelocalization of the confined mode is enhanced while the number of confined modesdecreases; which directly results in the minimum thermal conductance.,Applied Physics Letters,2011,66
New Monte Carlo methods for improved efficiency of computer simulations in statistical mechanics,Robert H Swendsen; Jian-Sheng Wang; Alan M Ferrenberg,Abstract In this paper; we have reviewed two complementary new approaches to improvethe accuracy and efficiency of Monte Carlo computer simulations in the study of phasetransitions. Substantial gains have already been achieved; and since these methodsrepresent approaches to the problem of simulation that are still being developed; theypromise further improvements in the future. In both cases; a key feature is the lifting of therestriction of thinking about computer simulations as simply “computer experiments;” andrecognising that there are certain aspects of simulations that can be exploited to greatlyincrease their value.,*,1992,65
Anisotropic finite-size scaling analysis of a two-dimensional driven diffusive system,Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract The standard two-dimensional uniformly driven diffusive model is simulatedextensively for much larger systems with a multi-spin coding technique. The nonequilibriumphase transition is analyzed with anisotropic finite-size scaling both at the critical point andoff the critical point. The field-theoretic values of critical exponents fit the data well at andabove T c. Below T c the scaling is rather difficult and the results are not conclusive.,Journal of statistical physics,1996,61
Phase transitions and universality in nonequilibrium steady states of stochastic Ising models,Jian-Sheng Wang; Joel L Lebowitz,Abstract We present results of direct computer simulations and of Monte Carlorenormalization group (MCRG) studies of the nonequilibrium steady states of a spin systemwith competing dynamics and of the voter model. The MCRG method; previously used onlyfor equilibrium systems; appears to give useful information also for these nonequilibriumsystems. The critical exponents are found to be of Ising type for the competing dynamicsmodel at its second-order phase transitions; and of mean-field type for the voter model(consistent with known results for the latter).,Journal of Statistical Physics,1988,60
Dissipative particle dynamics simulations of electroosmotic flow in nano-fluidic devices,Duc Duong-Hong; Jian-Sheng Wang; GR Liu; Yu Zong Chen; Jongyoon Han; Nicolas G Hadjiconstantinou,Abstract When modeling the hydrodynamics of nanofluidic systems; it is often essential toinclude molecular-level information such as molecular fluctuations. To this effect; we presenta mesoscopic approach which combines a fluctuating hydrodynamics formulation with anefficient implementation of Electroosmotic flow (EOF) in the small Debye length limit. Theresulting approach; whose major ingredient is Dissipative Particle Dynamics; is sufficientlycoarse-grained to allow efficient simulation of the hydrodynamics of micro/nanofluidicdevices of sizes that are too large to be simulated by ab initio methods such as MolecularDynamics. Within our formulation; EOF is efficiently generated using the recently provensimilitude between velocity and electric field under appropriate conditions. More specifically;EOF is generated using an effective boundary condition; akin to a moving wall; thus …,Microfluidics and Nanofluidics,2008,58
Elastic and nonlinear stiffness of graphene: A simple approach,Jin-Wu Jiang; Jian-Sheng Wang; Baowen Li,Abstract The recent experiment CG Lee et al.[Science 321; 385 (2008)] on the Young'smodulus and third-order elastic stiffness of graphene are well explained in a very simpleapproach; where the graphene is described by a simplified system and the force constant forthe nonlinear interaction is estimated from the Tersoff-Brenner potential.,Physical Review B,2010,52
Theoretical study on thermoelectric properties of kinked graphene nanoribbons,Wen Huang; Jian-Sheng Wang; Gengchiau Liang,Abstract A ballistic transport model based on electron and phonon band structures has beenimplemented to evaluate the thermoelectric properties of kinked AA/ZZ-graphenenanoribbons (GNRs) connected by two armchair GNRs or zigzag GNR segments with anangle of 120; as well as hybridized structures connected by different edge segments andangles. Compared to straight GNRs with the same width; the thermoelectric properties ofkinked AA-GNRs and ZZ-GNRs are enhanced due to increases in the figure of merit (ZT)and power factor and the reduction in lattice thermal conductance. For kinked AA-GNRs; ZTmax (the first peak of ZT) is almost twice that of straight AGNRs; while for ZZ-GNRs; ZT maxis greatly improved from that of straight ZGNRs; which is around zero. Furthermore; becauseof the comparable ZT max values of both kinked AA-GNRs and ZZ-GNRs; it is indicated …,Physical Review B,2011,50
Dimensional crossover of thermal conductance in nanowires,Jian Wang; Jian-Sheng Wang,Dimensional dependence of thermal conductance at low temperatures in nanowires isstudied using the nonequilibrium Green's function method. The authors' calculation shows asmooth dimensional crossover of thermal conductance in nanowire from one-dimensional tothree-dimensional behavior with the increase of diameters. The results are consistent withthe experimental findings that the temperature dependence of thermal conductance at lowtemperature for diameters from tens to hundreds of nanometers will be close to the Debyelaw. The calculation also suggests that universal thermal conductance is only observable innanowires with small diameters. They also find that the interfacial thermal conductanceacross Si and Ge nanowires is much lower than the corresponding value in bulk materials.,Applied physics letters,2007,49
Monte Carlo algorithms based on the number of potential moves,Jian-Sheng Wang; Lik Wee Lee,Abstract We discuss Monte Carlo dynamics based on< N (σ; ΔE)> E; the (microcanonical)average number of potential moves which increase the energy by ΔE in a single spin flip.The microcanonical average can be sampled using Monte Carlo dynamics of a single spinflip with a transition rate min (1;< N (σ′; E− E′)> E′/< N (σ; E′− E)> E) from energy E toE′. A cumulative average (over Monte Carlo steps) can be used as a first approximation tothe exact microcanonical average in the flip rate. The associated histogram is a constantindependent of the energy. The canonical distribution of energy can be obtained from thetransition matrix Monte Carlo dynamics. This second dynamics has fast relaxation time–atthe critical temperature the relaxation time is proportional to specific heat. The dynamics areuseful in connection with reweighting methods for computing thermodynamic quantities.,Computer physics communications,2000,49
Kinetics and jamming coverage in a random sequential adsorption of polymer chains,Jian-Sheng Wang; Ras B Pandey,Abstract Using a highly efficient Monte Carlo algorithm; we are able to study the growth ofcoverage in a random sequential adsorption of self-avoiding walk chains for up to∼ 10 12time steps on a square lattice. For the first time; the true jamming coverage θ J is found todecay with the chain length N with a power law θ J∝ N− 0.1. The growth of the coverage toits jamming limit can be described by a power law θ (t)≈ θ J− cty with an effective exponenty which depends on the chain length; ie; y≃ 0.50 for N= 4 to y≃ 0.07 for N= 30 with y→ 0 inthe asymptotic limit N→∞.,Physical review letters,1996,48
Collective effects in random sequential adsorption of diffusing hard squares,Jian-Sheng Wang; Peter Nielaba; Vladimir Privman,We study by Monte Carlo computer simulations random sequential adsorption (RSA) withdiffusional relaxation; of lattice hard squares in two dimensions. While for RSA withoutdiffusion the coverage approaches its maximum jamming value (large-time fractionalcoverage) exponentially; added diffusion allows the deposition process to proceed to the fullcoverage. The approach to the full coverage is consistent with the~ t− 1/2 power lawreminiscent of the equilibrium cluster coarsening in models with nonconserved order-parameter dynamics.,Modern Physics Letters B,1993,48
A review on the flexural mode of graphene: lattice dynamics; thermal conduction; thermal expansion; elasticity and nanomechanical resonance,Jin-Wu Jiang; Bing-Shen Wang; Jian-Sheng Wang; Harold S Park,Abstract Single-layer graphene is so flexible that its flexural mode (also called the ZA mode;bending mode; or out-of-plane transverse acoustic mode) is important for its thermal andmechanical properties. Accordingly; this review focuses on exploring the relationshipbetween the flexural mode and thermal and mechanical properties of graphene. We firstsurvey the lattice dynamic properties of the flexural mode; where the rigid translational androtational invariances play a crucial role. After that; we outline contributions from the flexuralmode in four different physical properties or phenomena of graphene—its thermalconductivity; thermal expansion; Young's modulus and nanomechanical resonance. Weexplain how graphene's superior thermal conductivity is mainly due to its three acousticphonon modes at room temperature; including the flexural mode. Its coefficient of thermal …,Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter,2015,47
Mechanisms causing thermal rectification: The influence of phonon frequency; asymmetry; and nonlinear interactions,Nan Zeng; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract We have determined the mechanisms leading to thermal rectification by applyingthe nonequilibrium Green's function method to study thermal transport through a one-dimensional asymmetric lattice. Thermal rectification occurs in the presence of nonlinearinteractions and a nonuniform phonon frequency distribution. We show that thermalrectification results from the contribution of high-frequency phonons; a thermal rectifier canthus be realized by filtering out high-frequency phonons in a single direction. Using theseresults; we present methods of increasing the level of rectification; and also discuss possiblelimitations on thermal rectifier performance.,Physical Review B,2008,47
Is the broad histogram random walk dynamics correct?,J-S Wang,Abstract: We show explicitly that the broad histogram single-spin-flip random walk dynamicsdoes not give correct microcanonical average even in one dimension. The dynamicsviolates the detailed balance condition by an amount proportional to the inverse system size.As a result; in distribution different configurations with the same energy can have differentprobabilities. We propose a modified dynamics which ensures detailed balance and thehistogram obtained from this dynamics is exactly flat. The broad histogram equation relatingthe average number of potential moves to density of states is generally valid.,The European Physical Journal B-Condensed Matter and Complex Systems,1999,46
Ballistic thermal rectification in nanoscale three-terminal junctions,Lifa Zhang; Jian-Sheng Wang; Baowen Li,Abstract We study ballistic thermal transport in three-terminal atomic nanojunctions by thenonequilibrium Green's function method. We find that there is ballistic thermal rectification inasymmetric three-terminal structures because of the incoherent phonon scattering from thecontrol terminal. With spin-phonon interaction; we also find the ballistic thermal rectificationeven in symmetric three-terminal paramagnetic structures.,Physical Review B,2010,45
Wetting transitions in polymer blends: A Monte Carlo lattice simulation,Jian‐Sheng Wang; Kurt Binder,Wetting transitions of binary polymer mixtures in contact with a wall were studied usinglattice models by the method of Monte Carlo simulation. First‐order wetting transitions werefound below the critical temperature but at a moderately high volume fraction of the polymertype favored by the wall. The transitions appear to be second order at low temperatures orfor short chain lengths.,The Journal of chemical physics,1991,43

Locally frozen defects in random sequential adsorption with diffusional relaxation,Jian-Sheng Wang; Peter Nielaba; Vladimir Privman,Abstract Random sequential adsorption with diffusional relaxation; of two by two squareobjects on the two-dimensional square lattice; is studied by Monte Carlo computersimulation. Asymptotically for large lattice sizes; diffusional relaxation allows the depositionprocess to reach full coverage. The coverage approaches the full occupation value; 1; as apower-law with convergence exponent near 1 2. For a periodic lattice of finite (even) size L;the final state is a frozen random rectangular grid of domain walls connecting single-sitedefects. The domain sizes saturate at∼ L 0.8. Prior to saturation; ie; asymptotically for infinitelattice; the domain growth is power-law with growth exponent near; or possibly somewhatsmaller than; 1 2.,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,1993,41
Geometry effects on thermoelectric properties of silicon nanowires based on electronic band structures,Gengchiau Liang; Wen Huang; Chee Shin Koong; Jian-Sheng Wang; Jinghua Lan,The thermoelectric properties of silicon nanowires with different shapes; sizes; andorientations are theoretically investigated using sp 3 d 5 s∗ tight-binding model coupled withballistic transport approach. We found that the thermoelectric properties significantly dependon nanowire geometry. Compared to [111] and [100] nanowires; n-doped and p-doped [110]nanowires show the worst performance in terms of power factor per cross-section area andfigure of merit (ZT). As nanowire size decreases; thermoelectric properties of nanowires canbe enhanced. As a result; triangular nanowires with side length of 1 nm have the best resultsof ZT and it can be enhanced to 1.5 and 0.85 for an n-type nanowire along [111] orientationand a p-type nanowire along [100] orientation; respectively. For extremely narrownanowires; thermoelectric properties are only dependent on the number of the …,Journal of Applied Physics,2010,40
Edge states induce boundary temperature jump in molecular dynamics simulation of heat conduction,Jin-Wu Jiang; Jie Chen; Jian-Sheng Wang; Baowen Li,Abstract We point out that the origin of the commonly occurred boundary temperature jumpin the application of Nośe-Hoover heat bath in molecular dynamics is related to the edgemodes; which are exponentially localized at the edge of the system. If heat baths are appliedto these edge regions; the injected thermal energy will be localized thus leading to aboundary temperature jump. The jump can be eliminated by shifting the location of heatbaths away from edge regions. Following this suggestion; a very good temperature profile isobtained without increasing any simulation time and the accuracy of thermal conductivitycalculated can be largely improved.,Physical Review B,2009,39
Mode-dependent energy transmission across nanotube junctions calculated with a lattice dynamics approach,Jian Wang; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract A generalized scattering boundary equation method (SBM) is proposed for thecalculation of the vibrational amplitude transmission across solid junctions. An energytransmission expression with relation to atomic masses; lattice constants; and groupvelocities is elucidated. The phonon transmission is computed by the SBM for an (11; 0)–(8;0) nanotube junction. The strongly mode-dependent energy transmission observed can beascribed to the mismatch in symmetry of the vibrational motions; indicating its possiblyimportant role in thermal transport in nanotubes.,Physical Review B,2006,39
Critical dynamics of the swendsen-wang algorithm in the three-dimensional ising model,Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract The correlation times of the three-dimensional Ising model at the critical point for theSwendsen-Wang dynamics are obtained up to a system size 89 3. Strong corrections toscaling are present in the size dependences of the correlation times of the energy and thesize of the largest cluster; making the estimation of the true asymptotic dynamic criticalexponent difficult. When the largest cluster is not flipped; the dynamic critical exponent; zm;defined by the magnetization correlations of the largest cluster; is estimated to be0.339±0.004.,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,1990,39
Monte Carlo renormalization-group study of Ising spin glasses,Jian-Sheng Wang; Robert H Swendsen,Abstract We present a new Monte Carlo renormalization-group approach to spin glasses.Application of this approach to the±J Ising spin glass shows clear differences between two-;three-; and four-dimensional models.

Kinetics of multilayer adsorption: Monte Carlo studies of models without screening,P Nielaba; V Privman; J-S Wang,Abstract New 1D and 2D lattice models are introduced to study irreversible multilayeradsorption processes observed in recent experiments in colloid systems. Kinetics ofdeposition without screening (with no overhangs) is investigated by Monte Carlosimulations. The approach to the jamming coverage in each layer is asymptoticallyexponential. The jamming coverages approach the infinite-layer limiting value according toa power law; reminiscent of critical phenomena; with no length scale; and with exponentuniversality within the accuracy of the numerical data.,Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General,1990,34
Reversal of thermal rectification in quantum systems,Lifa Zhang; Yonghong Yan; Chang-Qin Wu; Jian-Sheng Wang; Baowen Li,Abstract We study thermal transport in anisotropic Heisenberg spin chains using thequantum master equation. It is found that thermal rectification changes sign when theexternal homogeneous magnetic field is varied. This reversal also occurs when themagnetic field becomes inhomogeneous. Moreover; we can tune the reversal of rectificationby temperatures of the heat baths; the anisotropy; and size of the spin chains.,Physical Review B,2009,33
Why edge effects are important on the intrinsic loss mechanisms of graphene nanoresonators,Jin-Wu Jiang; Jian-Sheng Wang,Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to investigate edge effects on the qualityfactor of graphene nanoresonators with different edge configurations and of various sizes. Ifthe periodic boundary condition is applied; very high quality factors (3× 105) are obtained forall kinds of graphene nanoresonators. However; if the free boundary condition is applied;quality factors will be greatly reduced by two effects resulting from free edges: the imaginaryedge vibration effect and the artificial effect. Imaginary edge vibrations will flip between apair of doubly degenerate warping states during the mechanical oscillation ofnanoresonators. The flipping process breaks the coherence of the mechanical oscillation ofthe nanoresonator; which is the dominant mechanism for extremely low quality factors.There is an artificial effect if the mechanical oscillation of the graphene nanoresonator is …,Journal of Applied Physics,2012,32

Computer simulation of driven diffusive systems with exchanges,Jian-Sheng Wang; Kurt Binder; Joel L Lebowitz,Abstract The field-driven Kawasaki model with a fraction p admixture of Glauber dynamics isstudied by computer simulation: p= 0 corresponds to the order-parameter-onserving drivendiffusive system; while p= 1 is the equilibrium Ising model. For p= 0.1 our best estimates ofcritical exponents based on a system of size 4096× 128 are β≈ 0.22; η RS≈ 0.45; andv‖≈ v⊥≈ 1. These exponents differ from both the values predicted by a field-theoreticmethod for p= 0 and those of the equilibrium Ising model. Anisotropic finite-size scalinganalyses are carried out; both for subsystems of the large system and for fully periodicsystems. The results of the latter; however; are inconsistent; probably due to the complexityof the size effects. This leaves open the possibility that we are in a crossover regime from p=0 to p≠ 0 and that our critical exponents are “effective ones.” For p= 0 our results are …,Journal of statistical physics,1989,31
Full-counting statistics of heat transport in harmonic junctions: Transient; steady states; and fluctuation theorems,Bijay Kumar Agarwalla; Baowen Li; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract We study the statistics of heat transferred in a given time interval t M; through a finiteharmonic chain; called the center; which is connected to two heat baths; the left (L) and theright (R); that are maintained at two temperatures. The center atoms are driven by externaltime-dependent forces. We calculate the cumulant generating function (CGF) for the heattransferred out of the left lead; QL; based on the two-time quantum measurement conceptand using the nonequilibrium Green's function method. The CGF can be conciselyexpressed in terms of Green's functions of the center and an argument-shifted self-energy ofthe lead. The expression of the CGF is valid in both transient and steady-state regimes.

Transition matrix Monte Carlo,Robert H Swendsen; Brian Diggs; Jian-Sheng Wang; Shing-Te Li; Christopher Genovese; Joseph B Kadane,Although histogram methods have been extremely effective for analyzing data from MonteCarlo simulations; they do have certain limitations; including the range over which they arevalid and the difficulties of combining data from independent simulations. In this paper; wedescribe a complementary approach to extracting information from Monte Carlo simulationsthat uses the matrix of transition probabilities. Combining the Transition Matrix with an N-foldway simulation technique produces an extremely flexible and efficient approach to rathergeneral Monte Carlo simulations.,International Journal of Modern Physics C,1999,29
Transient behavior of heat transport in a thermal switch,Eduardo C Cuansing; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract We study the time-dependent transport of heat in a nanoscale thermal switch. Theswitch consists of left and right leads that are initially uncoupled. During switch on thecoupling between the leads is abruptly turned on. We use the nonequilibrium Green'sfunction formalism and numerically solve the constructed Dyson equation to determine thenonperturbative heat current. At the transient regime we find that the current initially flowssimultaneously into both of the leads and then afterwards oscillates between flowing intoand out of the leads. At later times the oscillations decay away and the current settles intoflowing from the hotter to the colder lead. We find the transient behavior to be influenced bythe extra energy added during switch on. Such a transient behavior also exists even whenthere is no temperature difference between the leads. The current at the long-time limit …,Physical Review B,2010,28
Topology-induced thermal rectification in carbon nanodevice,JW Jiang; JS Wang; B Li,Abstract The thermal rectification (TR) effect in a topological system; Möbius graphene strip;is studied by nonequilibrium molecular-dynamics simulation with Nóse-Hoover heat baths.Due to the nonlinear interaction in graphene and the topological asymmetry of the Möbiusstrip; the TR phenomenon emerges and the value of TR can be as large as 120%. Thistopology-induced TR is not very sensitive to the temperature and size of the system; whilethe position of heat bath is important; since it can induce additional asymmetry.,EPL (Europhysics Letters),2010,28
Molecular dynamics with quantum heat baths: Application to nanoribbons and nanotubes,Jian-Sheng Wang; Xiaoxi Ni; Jin-Wu Jiang,Abstract A generalized Langevin equation with quantum heat baths [quantum moleculardynamics (QMD)] for thermal transport is derived with the help of nonequilibrium Green'sfunction (NEGF) formulation. The exact relationship of the quasiclassical approximation toNEGF is demonstrated using Feynman diagrams of the nonlinear self-energies. To leadingorder; the retarded self-energies agree but QMD and NEGF differ in lesser/greater self-energies. An implementation for general systems using Cholesky decomposition of thecorrelated noises is discussed. Some means of stabilizing the dynamics is given. Thermalconductance results for graphene strips and carbon nanotubes are presented. The“quantum correction” method is critically examined.,Physical Review B,2009,28
Realistic simulations of combined DNA electrophoretic flow and EOF in nano‐fluidic devices,Duc Duong‐Hong; Jongyoon Han; Jian‐Sheng Wang; Nicolas G Hadjiconstantinou; Yu Zong Chen; Gui‐Rong Liu,Abstract We present a three-dimensional dissipative particle dynamics model of DNAelectrophoretic flow that captures both DNA stochastic motion and hydrodynamics withoutrequiring expensive molecular dynamics calculations. This model enables us to efficientlyand simultaneously simulate DNA electrophoretic flow and local EOF (generated bycounterions near the DNA backbone); in mesoscale (∼ μm) fluidic devices. Our model isused to study the electrophoretic separation of long DNA chains under entropic trappingconditions [Han and Craighead; Science 2000; 288; 1026–1029]. Our simulation results arein good agreement with experimental data for realistic geometries (tapered walls) and revealthat wall tapering in entropic traps has a profound impact in the DNA trapping behavior; aneffect which was largely ignored in previous modeling.,Electrophoresis,2008,28
Replica Monte Carlo simulation (revisited),Jian-Sheng Wang; Robert H Swendsen,Abstract In 1986; Swendsen and Wang proposed a replica Monte Carlo algorithm for Isingspin glasses [Phys. Rev. Lett. 57 (1986); 2607]. Two important ingredients are present;(1)the use of a collection of systems (replicas) at different temperatures; but with the samerandom couplings;(2) defining and flipping clusters. Exchange of information between thesystems is facilitated by fixing the τ spin (τ= σ 1 σ 2) and flipping the two neighboringsystems simultaneously. In this talk; we discuss this algorithm and its relationship to replicaexchange (also known as parallel tempering) and Houdayer's cluster algorithm for spinglasses. We review some of the early results obtained using this algorithm. We also presentnew results for the correlation times of replica Monte Carlo dynamics in two and threedimensions and compare them with replica exchange.,Progress of Theoretical Physics Supplement,2005,28
Reconstruction of Si (001) and adsorption of Si adatoms and ad-dimers on the surface: Many-body potential calculations,Jun Cai; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract A recently developed potential function for covalent materials [Phys. Status Solidi B212; 9 (1999)] is used to simulate the reconstruction of the Si (001) surface; the surfaceadsorption; and diffusion of Si on the surface. For the simulation of reconstruction of Si (001)surface; our numerical results show that an empirical potential can correctly predict buckling-dimerized asymmetrical (001)−(2× 1); p−(2× 2); and c−(4× 2) configurations and the relativestability between them in energetics. For the calculations of surface adsorption; we considerthe formation energies and diffusion activation energies of several possible binding sites.The predicted stable and metastable configurations and diffusion paths of Si adatom and Siad-dimers on the Si (001)−(2× 1) surface are in agreement with those from first-principlescalculations and experiments.,Physical Review B,2001,27

Giant magnetocaloric effect in magnetoelectric Eu1-xBaxTiO3,Km Rubi; Pawan Kumar; DV Maheswar Repaka; Ruofan Chen; Jian-Sheng Wang; R Mahendiran,We report the magnetic entropy change (Δ Sm) in magnetoelectric Eu1-x Ba x TiO3 for 0.1≤x≤ 0.9. We find− Δ Sm= 11 (40) J/kg· K in x= 0.1 for a field change of 1 (5) T; respectively;which is the largest value among all Eu-based oxides. Δ Sm arises from the field-inducedsuppression of the spin entropy of Eu2+: 4f7 localized moments. While∣− Δ Sm∣decreases with increasing x;∣− Δ Sm∣= 6.58 J/kg· K observed in the high spin dilutedcomposition x= 0.9 is larger than that in many manganites.

Negative temperatures and the definition of entropy,Robert H Swendsen; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract The concept of negative temperature has recently received renewed interest in thecontext of debates about the correct definition of the thermodynamic entropy in statisticalmechanics. Several researchers have identified the thermodynamic entropy exclusively withthe “volume entropy” suggested by Gibbs; and have further concluded that by this definition;negative temperatures violate the principles of thermodynamics. We disagree with theseconclusions. We demonstrate that volume entropy is inconsistent with the postulates ofthermodynamics for systems with non-monotonic energy densities; while a definition ofentropy based on the probability distributions of macroscopic variables does satisfy thepostulates of thermodynamics. Our results confirm that negative temperature is a validextension of thermodynamics.,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,2016,25

Single crystalline EuTi O 3 shows antiferromagnetic ordering due to E u 2+magnetic moments below TN= 5.6 K. This compound shows a giant magnetocaloric effectaround its Néel temperature. The isothermal magnetic entropy change is 49 J kg− 1 K− 1;the adiabatic temperature change is 21 K; and the refrigeration capacity is 500 J kg− 1 for afield change of 7 T at T N. The single crystal and polycrystalline samples show similar valuesof the magnetic entropy and adiabatic temperature changes. The large magnetocaloric effectis due to suppression of the spin entropy associated with the localized 4 f moment of E u 2+ions. The giant magnetocaloric effect; together with negligible hysteresis; suggest that …,Physical Review B,2016,25
Reduced density matrix for nonequilibrium steady states: A modified Redfield solution approach,Juzar Thingna; Jian-Sheng Wang; Peter Hänggi,Abstract We describe a method to obtain the reduced density matrix (RDM) correct up tosecond order in system-bath coupling in nonequilibrium steady-state situations. The RDM isobtained via a scheme based on analytic continuation; using the time-local Redfield-likequantum master equation; which was earlier used by the same authors [J. Chem. Phys. 136;194110 (2012)] to obtain the correct thermal equilibrium description. This nonequilibriummodified Redfield solution is then corroborated with the exact RDM obtained via thenonequilibrium Green's function technique for the quantum harmonic oscillator. Lastly; thescheme is compared to different quantum master equations (QMEs); namely the time-localRedfield-like and the Lindblad-like QMEs; in order to illustrate the differences between eachof these approaches.,Physical Review E,2013,25
Joule heating and thermoelectric properties in short single-walled carbon nanotubes: electron-phonon interaction effect,Jin-Wu Jiang; Jian-Sheng Wang,The electron-phonon interaction (EPI) effect in single-walled carbon nanotube isinvestigated by the nonequilibrium Green's function approach within the Bornapproximation. Special attention is paid to the EPI induced Joule heating phenomenon andthe thermoelectric properties in both metallic armchair (10; 10) tube and semiconductorzigzag (10; 0) tube. For Joule heat in the metallic (10; 10) tube; the theoretical results for thebreakdown bias voltage is quite comparable with the experimental value. It is found that theJoule heat can be greatly enhanced by increasing the chemical potential; while the role ofthe temperature is not so important for Joule heat. In the zigzag (10; 0) tube; the Joule heat issmaller than the armchair tube; resulting from nonzero bandgap in the electron bandstructure. For the electronic conductance Ge and electron thermal conductance σ el; the …,Journal of Applied Physics,2011,25
Theoretical study of thermal conductivity in single-walled boron nitride nanotubes,Jin-Wu Jiang; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract We perform a theoretical investigation on the thermal conductivity of single-walledboron nitride nanotubes (SWBNT) using the kinetic theory. By fitting to the phonon spectrumof the boron nitride sheet; we develop an efficient and stable Tersoff-derived interatomicpotential which is suitable for the study of heat transport in sp 2 structures. We work out theselection rules for the three-phonon process with the help of the helical quantum numbers(κ; n) attributed to the symmetry group (line group) of the SWBNT. Our calculation shows thatthe thermal conductivity κ ph diverges with length as κ ph∝ L β with exponentially decayingβ (T)∝ e− T/T c; which results from the competition between boundary scattering and three-phonon scattering for flexure modes. We find that the two flexure modes of the SWBNT makedominant contribution to the thermal conductivity; because their zero frequency locates at …,Physical Review B,2011,25
The phonon Hall effect: theory and application,Lifa Zhang; Jie Ren; Jian-Sheng Wang; Baowen Li,Abstract We present a systematic theory of the phonon Hall effect in a ballistic crystal latticesystem; and apply it on the kagome lattice which is ubiquitous in various real materials. Byproposing a proper second quantization for the non-Hermitian in the polarization-vectorspace; we obtain a new heat current density operator with two separate contributions: thenormal velocity responsible for the longitudinal phonon transport; and the anomalousvelocity manifesting itself as the Hall effect of transverse phonon transport. As exemplified inkagome lattices; our theory predicts that the direction of Hall conductivity at low magneticfield can be reversed by tuning the temperatures; which we hope can be verified byexperiments in the future. Three phonon-Hall-conductivity singularities induced by phonon-band-topology change are discovered as well; which correspond to the degeneracies at …,Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter,2011,25
Continuum transport model of Ogston sieving in patterned nanofilter arrays for separation of rod‐like biomolecules,Zi Rui Li; Gui Rong Liu; Yu Zong Chen; Jian‐Sheng Wang; Hansen Bow; Yuan Cheng; Jongyoon Han,Abstract This article proposes a simple computational transport model of rod-like shortdsDNA molecules through a microfabricated nanofilter array. Using a nanochannelconsisting of alternate deep wells and shallow slits; it is demonstrated that the complexpartitioning of rod-like DNA molecules of different sizes over the nanofilter array can be welldescribed by continuum transport theory with the orientational entropy and anisotropictransport parameters properly quantified. In this model; orientational entropy of the rod-likeDNA is calculated from the equilibrium distribution of rigid cylindrical rod near the solid wall.The flux caused by entropic differences is derived from the interaction between the DNArods and the solid channel wall during rotational diffusion. In addition to its role as anentropic barrier; the confinement of the DNA in the shallow channels also induces large …,Electrophoresis,2008,25
A fast algorithm for random sequential adsorption of discs,Jian-Sheng Wang,An efficient simulation algorithm for random sequential adsorption of discs is implemented.By dividing the surface into small squares; depositions are attempted only on squares thatare actually possible. A crucial part is a method to identify the available squares. A precisevalue of the jamming coverage is obtained: θ (∞)≈ 0.547069. The asymptotic law θ (t)≈ θ(∞)− ct− 1/2 is verified to a high accuracy. The pair correlation function at the jamming stateis analyzed.,International Journal of Modern Physics C,1994,25
Ballistic magnetothermal transport in a Heisenberg spin chain at low temperatures,Lifa Zhang; Jian-Sheng Wang; Baowen Li,Abstract We study ballistic thermal transport in Heisenberg spin chain with nearest-neighborferromagnetic interactions at low temperatures. Explicit expressions for transmissioncoefficients are derived for thermal transport in a periodic spin chain of arbitrary junctionlength by a spin-wave model. Our analytical results agree very well with the ones fromnonequilibrium Green's function method. Our study shows that the transmission coefficientoscillates with the frequency of thermal wave. Moreover; the thermal transmission showsstrong dependence on the intrachain coupling; the length of the spin chain; and the externalmagnetic field. The results demonstrate the possibility of manipulating spin-wavepropagation and magnetothermal conductance in the spin-chain junction by adjusting theintrachain coupling and/or the external magnetic field.,Physical Review B,2008,24
Phonon Hall effect in four-terminal nano-junctions,Lifa Zhang; Jian-Sheng Wang; Baowen Li,Abstract Using an exact nonequilibrium Green's function formulation; the phonon Hall effect(PHE) for paramagnetic dielectrics is studied in a nanoscale four-terminal device setting.The temperature difference in the transverse direction of the heat current is calculated fortwo-dimensional models with the magnetic field perpendicular to the plane. We find thatthere is a PHE in nanoscale paramagnetic dielectrics; the magnitude of which is comparableto millimeter scale experiments. If the dynamic matrix of the system satisfies mirror reflectionsymmetry; the PHE disappears. The Hall temperature difference changes sign if themagnetic field is sufficiently large or if the size increases.,New Journal of Physics,2009,23
Characteristics of phonon transmission across epitaxial interfaces: a lattice dynamic study,Jian Wang; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract Phonon transmission across epitaxial interfaces is studied within the lattice dynamicapproach. The transmission shows weak dependence on frequency for a lattice wave with afixed angle of incidence. The dependence on azimuth angle is found to be related to thesymmetry of the boundary interface. The transmission varies smoothly with the change of theincident angle. A critical angle of incidence exists when the phonon is incident from the sidewith large group velocities to the side with low ones. No significant mode conversion isobserved among different acoustic wave branches at the interface; except when the incidentangle is near the critical value. Our theoretical result of the Kapitza conductance GK acrossthe Si–Ge (100) interface at temperature T= 200 K is 4.6× 10 8 WK− 1 m− 2. A scaling lawG_ {\mathrm {K}}\propto T^{2.87} at low temperature is also reported. Based on the …,Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter,2007,23
Steady-state thermal transport in anharmonic systems: Application to molecular junctions,Juzar Thingna; JL García-Palacios; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract We develop a general theory for thermal transport in anharmonic systems under theweak system-bath coupling approximation similar to the quantum master equationformalism. A current operator is derived; which is valid not only in the steady state; but in thetransient regime as well. Here; we focus on the effects of anharmonicity on the steady-statethermal conductance of a mono and diatomic molecular junctions. We also study moleculesbeing confined in a double-well potential. We find that when the molecules have a nonlinearon-site potential; the low-temperature thermal conductance is dramatically affected by thestrength of nonlinearity; whereas for the diatomic molecule connected by an anharmonicspring the strength of anharmonicity plays almost no role in the low-temperature regime. Incase of the molecules confined in a double-well potential; we find that the height of the …,Physical Review B,2012,22
Disordered quantum dots: A diffusion quantum Monte Carlo study,AD Güçlü; Jian-Sheng Wang; Hong Guo,Abstract We report diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) calculations of disorderedquantum dots in the presence of an external magnetic field. The addition spectra; spinconfiguration; Hund's rule; and many-body densities are investigated up to 13 electrons. Thedata from DQMC is in excellent agreement with exact diagonalization for disorder-freequantum dots; and in marked difference with those obtained from unrestricted Hartree-Fockmethod. The energetic competition to electron-electron interaction due to disorder is found tochange the transition energy between spin states; but the closed shell Hund's rule ismaintained for the disorder strength considered here. The DQMC many-body density isfound to be rather smooth.,Physical Review B,2003,22
Sweeny and Gliozzi dynamics for simulations of Potts models in the Fortuin-Kasteleyn representation,Jian-Sheng Wang; Oner Kozan; Robert H Swendsen,Abstract We compare the correlation times of the Sweeny and Gliozzi dynamics for two-dimensional Ising and three-state Potts models; and the three-dimensional Ising model forthe simulations in the percolation representation. The results are also compared withSwendsen-Wang and Wolff cluster dynamics. It is found that Sweeny and Gliozzi dynamicshave essentially the same dynamical critical behavior. Contrary to Gliozzi's claim [Phys. Rev.E 66; 016115 (2002)]; the Gliozzi dynamics has critical slowing down comparable to that ofother cluster methods. For the two-dimensional Ising model; both Sweeny and Gliozzidynamics give good fits to logarithmic size dependences for the correlation times; for two-dimensional three-state Potts model; their dynamical critical exponent z is 0.49±0. 0 1; thethree-dimensional Ising model has z= 0.37±0.02.,Physical Review E,2002,22
Fractal dimension of 3D Ising droplets,Jiang-Sheng Wang; Dietrich Stauffer,The idea of describing the liquid-gas critical point as the percolation threshold of suitably definedclus- ters is quite old [-1; 2]. These clusters are expected to be fractals [3] at the critical point;and long ago the cluster radius in three dimensions was predicted [4; 5] to vary as s To confirmthis prediction one needs a good cluster definition [-6] as well as an algo- rithm giving fast a thermalequilibrium at the critical point [7]. With this definition and algorithm; ie by flipping clusters of parallelneighboring spins connected with probability 1-exp(-2J/kT); we looked at the rms cluster radiusof gyration; Rs; as a function of the number s of spins in that cluster. Earlier work in two dimension[8] confirmed scaling ideas there; though no direct relation between radius and mass s wastested. We thus looked only at the simple cubic Ising model with nearest neighbor interactionsJ. Re- sults were binned in mass intervals … ;t Dedicated to Professor W.

Gibbs volume entropy is incorrect,Robert H Swendsen; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract We show that the expression for the equilibrium thermodynamic entropy containsan integral over a surface in phase space; and in so doing; we confirm that negativetemperature is a valid thermodynamic concept. This demonstration disproves the claims ofseveral recent papers that the Gibbs entropy; which contains an integral over a volume inphase space; is the correct definition and that thermodynamics cannot be extended toinclude negative temperatures. We further show that the Gibbs entropy fails to satisfy thepostulates of thermodynamics and that its predictions for systems with nonmonotonic energydensities of states are incorrect.,Physical Review E,2015,21
Tuning thermal transport in nanotubes with topological defects,Jian Wang; Liang Li; Jian-Sheng Wang,Using the atomistic nonequilibrium Green's function; we find that thermal conductance ofcarbon nanotubes with presence of topological lattice imperfects is remarkably reduced; dueto the strong Rayleigh scattering of high-frequency phonons. Phonon transmission acrossmultiple defects behaves as a cascade scattering based with the random phaseapproximation. We elucidate that phonon scattering by structural defects is related to thespatial fluctuations of local vibrational density of states (LVDOS). An effective method oftuning thermal transport in low-dimensional systems through the modulation of LVDOS hasbeen proposed. Our findings provide insights into experimentally controlling thermaltransport in nanoscale devices.,Applied Physics Letters,2011,21
Tunable heat pump by modulating the coupling to the leads,Eduardo C Cuansing; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract We follow the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism to study time-dependentthermal transport in a linear chain system consisting of two semi-infinite leads connectedtogether by a coupling that is harmonically modulated in time. The modulation is driven byan external agent that can absorb and emit energy. We determine the energy current flowingout of the leads exactly by solving numerically the Dyson equation for the contour-orderedGreen's function. The amplitude of the modulated coupling is of the same order as theinterparticle coupling within each lead. When the leads have the same temperature; ournumerical results show that modulating the coupling between the leads may direct energy toeither flow into the leads simultaneously or flow out of the leads simultaneously; dependingon the values of the driving frequency and temperature.

Boron diffusion induced symmetry reduction and scattering in CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB magnetic tunnel junctions,Zhaoqiang Bai; Lei Shen; Qingyun Wu; Minggang Zeng; Jian-Sheng Wang; Guchang Han; Yuan Ping Feng,Abstract By first-principles analysis; we investigate the effect of thermal annealing onstructural stability of CoFeB/MgO (thin)/CoFeB magnetic tunnel junctions. The calculatedphonon dispersion indicates that Mg 3 B 2 O 6 (kotoite) is a stable spacer after annealingdue to B diffusion into MgO. The calculated tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ofCoFe/kotoite/CoFe is 210%; which is in good agreement with the available experimentalvalue and 2 orders of magnitude lower than the predicted values of CoFe/MgO/CoFejunctions. The physics of this more realistic TMR value is the change in symmetry from C 4 vof MgO to C 2 v of kotoite. Such symmetry reduction induces scattering and weakens thetunneling transmission of the Δ 1-like Bloch states. Our calculations also reveal that thetunneling transmission is sensitive to the electrode/spacer interfacial chemical bonding …,Physical Review B,2013,20
Generalized Gibbs state with modified Redfield solution: Exact agreement up to second order,Juzar Thingna; Jian-Sheng Wang; Peter Hänggi,A novel scheme for the steady state solution of the standard Redfield quantum masterequation is developed which yields agreement with the exact result for the correspondingreduced density matrix up to second order in the system-bath coupling strength. We achievethis objective by use of an analytic continuation of the off-diagonal matrix elements of theRedfield solution towards its diagonal limit. Notably; our scheme does not require theprovision of yet higher order relaxation tensors. Testing this modified method for a heat bathconsisting of a collection of harmonic oscillators we assess that the system relaxes towardsits correct coupling-dependent; generalized quantum Gibbs state in second order. Wenumerically compare our formulation for a damped quantum harmonic system with thenonequilibrium Green's function formalism: we find good agreement at low temperatures …,The Journal of chemical physics,2012,20
Rotationally symmetric ordered phase in the three-state antiferromagnetic Potts model,Ralf K Heilmann; Jian-Sheng Wang; Robert H Swendsen,Abstract We investigate the three-state antiferromagnetic Potts model on a simple cubiclattice with a cluster flipping Monte Carlo simulation algorithm in the temperature regionbelow the transition into disorder at T c 1. We find both the well-established broken-sublattice-symmetry (BSS) phase at low temperature and a rotationally symmetric phase athigher temperature; but below T c 1. The properties of the second phase and the transitiontemperature to the BSS phase are in disagreement with recent cluster-variation and MonteCarlo simulation results; but in agreement with simulations by Kolesik and Suzuki.© 1996The American Physical Society.,Physical Review B,1996,20
Thermal transport across metal–insulator interface via electron–phonon interaction,Lifa Zhang; Jing-Tao Lü; Jian-Sheng Wang; Baowen Li,Abstract The thermal transport across a metal–insulator interface can be characterized byelectron–phonon interaction through which an electron lead is coupled to a phonon lead ifphonon–phonon coupling at the interface is very weak. We investigate the thermalconductance and rectification between the electron part and the phonon part using thenonequilibrium Green's function method. It is found that the thermal conductance has anonmonotonic behavior as a function of average temperature or the coupling strengthbetween the phonon leads in the metal part and the insulator part. The metal–insulatorinterface shows a clear thermal rectification effect; which can be reversed by a change inaverage temperature or the electron–phonon coupling.,Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter,2013,19
Transient behavior of full counting statistics in thermal transport,Jian-Sheng Wang; Bijay Kumar Agarwalla; Huanan Li,Abstract The generating function of energy counting statistics is derived for phononicjunction systems. It is expressed in terms of the contour-ordered self-energy of the lead withshifted arguments; Σ A (τ; τ′)= Σ L [τ+ ℏ x (τ); τ′+ ℏ x (τ′)]− Σ L (τ; τ′); where Σ L (τ; τ′)is the usual contour-ordered self-energy of the left lead. The cumulants of the energytransferred in a given time from the lead to the center are obtained by taking derivatives. Atransient result of the first four cumulants of a graphene junction is presented. It is found thatmeasurements cause the energy to flow into the lead.,Physical Review B,2011,19
Worm algorithm for two-dimensional spin glasses,Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract A worm algorithm is proposed for the two-dimensional spin glasses. The method isbased on a low-temperature expansion of the partition function. The low-temperatureconfigurations of the spin glass on square lattice can be viewed as strings connecting pairsof frustrated plaquettes. The worm algorithm directly manipulates these strings. It is shownthat the worm algorithm is efficient; particularly if free boundary conditions are used. Weobtain accurate low-temperature specific heat data consistent with a form c∼ T− 2 exp [− 2J∕(k BT)]; where T is temperature and J is coupling constant; for the two-dimensional±J spinglass.,Physical Review E,2005,19
Series expansion and computer simulation studies of random sequential adsorption,Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract We discuss two important techniques; series expansion and Monte Carlosimulation; for a random sequential adsorption study. Random sequential adsorption is anidealization for surface deposition where the time scale of particle relaxation is much longerthan the time scale of deposition. Particles are represented as extended objects which areadsorbed onto a continuum surface or lattice sites. Once landed on the surface; the particlesstick to the surface.

Effects of electron-phonon interaction on thermal and electrical transport through molecular nano-conductors,Jing-Tao Lü; Hangbo Zhou; Jin-Wu Jiang; Jian-Sheng Wang,The topic of this review is the effects of electron-phonon interaction (EPI) on the transportproperties of molecular nano-conductors. A nano-conductor connects to two electron leadsand two phonon leads; possibly at different temperatures or chemical potentials. The EPIappears only in the nano-conductor. We focus on its effects on charge and energy transport.We introduce three approaches. For weak EPI; we use the nonequilibrium Green's functionmethod to treat it perturbatively. We derive the expressions for the charge and heat currents.For weak system-lead couplings; we use the quantum master equation approach. In bothcases; we use a simple single level model to study the effects of EPI on the system'sthermoelectric transport properties. It is also interesting to look at the effect of currents on thedynamics of the phonon system. For this; we derive a semi-classical generalized …,AIP Advances,2015,18
Traffic of single-headed motor proteins KIF1A: effects of lane changing,Debashish Chowdhury; Ashok Garai; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract KIF1A kinesins are single-headed motor proteins which move on cylindricalnanotubes called microtubules (MTs). A normal MT consists of 13 protofilaments on whichthe equispaced motor binding sites form a periodic array. The collective movement of thekinesins on a MT is; therefore; analogous to vehicular traffic on multilane highways whereeach protofilament is the analog of a single lane. Does lane changing increase or decreasethe motor flux per lane? We address this fundamental question here by appropriatelyextending a recent model [P. Greulich et al.; Phys. Rev. E 75; 041905 (2007)]. By carryingout analytical calculations and computer simulations of this extended model; we predict thatthe flux per lane can increase or decrease with the increasing rate of lane changing;depending on the concentrations of motors and the rate of hydrolysis of ATP; the “fuel” …,Physical Review E,2008,18
Random sequential adsorption; series expansion and Monte Carlo simulation,Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract Random sequential adsorption is an irreversible surface deposition of extendedobjects. In systems with continuous degrees of freedom coverage follows a power law; θ(t)≈ θ J− ct− α; where the exponent α depends on the geometric shape (symmetry) of theobjects. Lattice models give typically exponential saturation to jamming coverage. Wediscuss how such function θ (t) can be computed by series expansions and analyzed withPadé approximations. We consider the applications of efficient Monte Carlo computersimulation method (event-driven method) to random sequential adsorptions with highprecision and at very long-time scale.,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,1998,18
Boosting thermoelectric efficiency using time-dependent control,Hangbo Zhou; Juzar Thingna; Peter Hänggi; Jian-Sheng Wang; Baowen Li,Abstract Thermoelectric efficiency is defined as the ratio of power delivered to the load of adevice to the rate of heat flow from the source. Till date; it has been studied in presence ofthermodynamic constraints set by the Onsager reciprocal relation and the second law ofthermodynamics that severely bottleneck the thermoelectric efficiency. In this study; wepropose a pathway to bypass these constraints using a time-dependent control and presenta theoretical framework to study dynamic thermoelectric transport in the far from equilibriumregime. The presence of a control yields the sought after substantial efficiency enhancementand importantly a significant amount of power supplied by the control is utilised to convertthe wasted-heat energy into useful-electric energy. Our findings are robust against nonlinearinteractions and suggest that external time-dependent forcing; which can be incorporated …,Scientific reports,2015,17
Anomalous thermal transport in disordered harmonic chains and carbon nanotubes,Xiaoxi Ni; Meng Lee Leek; Jian-Sheng Wang; Yuan Ping Feng; Baowen Li,Abstract We report the coherent potential approximation method of treating quantum thermaltransport properties of nanoscale systems with mass disorder. Instead of massive effortsrequired in brute-force calculations; configuration averaging of disordered systems can beefficiently handled in a self-consistent manner by setting up the phonon version ofnonequilibrium vertex correction theory. The accuracy of the method is verified by comparingwith the exact results and Monte Carlo experiments in one-dimensional atomic chains.Results obtained for disordered harmonic chains and carbon nanotubes provide evidence ofanomalous thermal transport in such systems. We also observe crossover in the transportwhere phonon scattering by disorder becomes important. Our results show that disorderplays a role in thermal conductance reduction.,Physical Review B,2011,17
Phonon Hall thermal conductivity from the Green-Kubo formula,Jian-Sheng Wang; Lifa Zhang,Abstract We derive an exact formula for the thermal-conductivity tensor of a ballistic phononHall model. It is found that; although the diagonal elements of the conductivity tensor divergeto infinite; the off-diagonal elements are finite; antisymmetric; and odd in magnetic field. Theoff-diagonal elements are nonzero only if the dynamic matrix of the phonon system breaksmirror-reflection symmetry. The results are obtained without perturbative treatment of thespin-phonon interactions.,Physical Review B,2009,17
Transport of biomolecules in asymmetric nanofilter arrays,Zi Rui Li; GR Liu; Jongyoon Han; Yu Zong Chen; Jian-Sheng Wang; Nicolas G Hadjiconstantinou,Abstract We propose a theoretical model for describing the electric-field-driven migration ofrod-like biomolecules in nanofilters comprising a periodic array of shallow passagesconnecting deep wells. The electrophoretic migration of the biomolecules is modeled astransport of point-sized Brownian particles; with the orientational degree of freedomcaptured by an entropy term. Using appropriate projections; the formulation dimensionality isreduced to one physical dimension; requiring minimal computation and making it ideal fordevice design and optimization. Our formulation is used to assess the effect of slanted wellwalls on the energy landscape and resulting molecule mobility. Using this approach; weshow that asymmetry in the well shape; such as a well with one slanted and one verticalwall; may be used for separation using low-frequency alternating-current fields because …,Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,2009,17

For the ground-state energy and entropy of an infinite system size; we estimate e 0=−1.4007±0.0085 and s 0= 0.0709±0.006; respectively. Both of them agree well with previouscalculations. The time to find the ground states as well as the tunneling times of thealgorithm are also reported and compared with other methods.,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,2000,17

Improved Dyson series expansion for steady-state quantum transport beyond the weak coupling limit: Divergences and resolution,Juzar Thingna; Hangbo Zhou; Jian-Sheng Wang,We present a general theory to calculate the steady-state heat and electronic currents fornonlinear systems using a perturbative expansion in the system-bath coupling. We explicitlydemonstrate that using the truncated Dyson-series leads to divergences in the steady-statelimit; thus making it impossible to be used for actual applications. In order to resolve thedivergences; we propose a unique choice of initial condition for the reduced density matrix;which removes the divergences at each order. Our approach not only allows us to use thetruncated Dyson-series; with a reasonable choice of initial condition; but also gives theexpected result that the steady-state solutions should be independent of initial preparations.Using our improved Dyson series we evaluate the heat and electronic currents up to fourth-order in system-bath coupling; a considerable improvement over the standard quantum …,The Journal of Chemical Physics,2014,16
Role of the on-site pinning potential in establishing quasi-steady-state conditions of heat transport in finite quantum systems,Eduardo C Cuansing; Huanan Li; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract We study the transport of energy in a finite linear harmonic chain by solving theHeisenberg equation of motion; as well as by using nonequilibrium Green's functions toverify our results. The initial state of the system consists of two separate and finite linearchains that are in their respective equilibriums at different temperatures. The chains are thenabruptly attached to form a composite chain. The time evolution of the current from just afterswitch-on to the transient regime and then to later times is determined numerically. Weexpect the current to approach a steady-state value at later times. Surprisingly; this ispossible only if a nonzero quadratic on-site pinning potential is applied to each particle inthe chain. If there is no on-site potential a recurrent phenomenon appears when the timescale is longer than the traveling time of sound to make a round trip from the midpoint to a …,Physical Review E,2012,16
Quantum transport in honeycomb lattice ribbons with armchair and zigzag edges coupled to semi-infinite linear chain leads,Eduardo Cuansing; J-S Wang,Abstract We study quantum transport in honeycomb lattice ribbons with either armchair orzigzag edges. The ribbons are coupled to semi-infinite linear chains serving as the input andoutput leads and we use a tight-binding Hamiltonian with nearest-neighbor hops. The inputand output leads are coupled to the ribbons through bar contacts. In narrow ribbons we findtransmission gaps for both types of edges. The appearance of this gap is due to theenhanced quantum interference coming from the multiple channels in bar contacts. Thecenter of the gap is at the middle of the band in ribbons with armchair edges. This particle-hole symmetry is because bar contacts do not mix the two sublattices of the underlyingbipartite honeycomb lattice when the ribbon has armchair edges. In ribbons with zigzagedges the gap center is displaced to the right of the band center. This breakdown of …,The European Physical Journal B,2009,16
Single-mode phonon transmission in symmetry-broken carbon nanotubes: Role of phonon symmetries,Jian Wang; Jian-Sheng Wang,We investigate the single-mode phonon transmission in symmetry-broken carbon nanotubeswith the Stone-Wales defect using a mode-matching method. To gain an insight into thefeatures of the transmission; the symmetry properties of phonons are analyzed within theline group symmetry theory for single-walled carbon nanotubes. Our results show that thetransmission for acoustic phonons with low group velocity is heavily suppressed; and thelong-wave optical phonons near the Γ point are strongly scattered by defects. We clarify thatthis reduction in transmission for phonons with small group velocity is a universal behaviorresulting from the broken translational invariance. Furthermore; fine structures of dips in thetransmission are observed for some phonon modes; depending on the unmatched symmetryoperations between the specific phonon mode and the defect. Our findings reveal that …,Journal of Applied Physics,2009,16
Series-expansion studies of random sequential adsorption with diffusional relaxation,Chee Kwan Gan; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract We obtain long series (28 terms or more) for the coverage (occupation fraction) θ; inpowers of time t for two models of random sequential adsorption with diffusional relaxationusing an efficient algorithm developed by the present authors [J. Phys. A 29; L177 (1996)].Three different kinds of analyses of the series are performed for a wide range of γ; the rate ofdiffusion of the adsorbed particles; to investigate the power-law approach of θ at large times.We find that the primitive series expansions in time t for θ capture rich short-and intermediate-time kinetics of the systems very well. However; we see that the series are still not longenough to extract the kinetics at large times for general γ. We have performed extensivecomputer simulations employing an efficient event-driven algorithm to confirm the t− 1/2saturation approach of θ at large times for both models; as well as to investigate the short …,Physical Review E,1997,16
Cumulant generating function formula of heat transfer in ballistic systems with lead-lead coupling,Huanan Li; Bijay Kumar Agarwalla; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract Based on a two-time observation protocol; we consider heat transfer in a given timeinterval t M in a lead-junction-lead system taking coupling between the leads into account. Inview of the two-time observation; consistency conditions are carefully verified in our specificfamily of quantum histories. Furthermore; its implication is briefly explored. Then using thenonequilibrium Green's function method; we obtain an exact formula for the cumulantgenerating function for heat transfer between the two leads; valid in both transient andsteady-state regimes. Also; a compact formula for the cumulant generating function in thelong-time limit is derived; for which the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation symmetry is explicitlyverified.

We find that the CIFs;due to the electron-phonon coherence; can control the spatial heat dissipation in theconductor. This yields a significant asymmetric concentration of excess heating (hot spot)even for a symmetric conductor. When coupled to the electrode phonons; CIFs drive differentphonon heat flux into the two electrodes. First-principles calculations on realistic biasednanojunctions illustrate the importance of the effect.,Physical review letters,2015,14
Manipulation of heat current by the interface between graphene and white graphene,Jin-Wu Jiang; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract We investigate the heat current flowing across the interface between graphene andhexagonal boron nitride (the so-called white graphene) using both molecular dynamicssimulation and nonequilibrium Green's function approaches. These two distinct methodsdiscover the same phenomena that the heat current is reduced linearly with increasingnumber of carbon atom at the interface; and the zigzag interface causes stronger reductionof heat current than the armchair interface. These phenomena are interpreted by both thelattice dynamics analysis and the transmission function explanation; which both reveal thatthe localized phonon modes at interfaces are responsible for the heat management. Theroom temperature interface thermal resistance is about 7× 10− 10 m 2 K/W in zigzaginterface and 3.5× 10− 10 m 2 K/W in armchair interface; which directly results in stronger …,EPL (Europhysics Letters),2011,14
A Monte Carlo study of wetting transitions in polymer blends confined to a capillary,Gerald G Pereira; Jian‐Sheng Wang,We investigate the problem of wetting transitions in polymer blends confined to a slitlikeadsorbing capillary of thickness H by Monte Carlo methods. Two paths for capillary wettingare considered; either along a path of increasing temperature; T; or increasing surfacechemical potential; μ1. We find that H can be thought of as an additional thermodynamicparameter which controls the nature of the transitions. We find that there exists a capillarycritical separation; H c. For separations less than H c the blend falls in the one phase regionof the phase diagram. Above H c there exists a separation H bulk; where the polymer blendbegins to show bulk behavior. H bulk is shown to separate regions of first order transitions(H< H bulk) from critical wetting transitions (H≥ H bulk). Along a path of constant T andincreasing μ1 we find for 2ξ< H 1< H 2< H bulk that the first‐order transitions between the …,The Journal of chemical physics,1996,14
Chain linear dimensions in the surface‐enriched layer of polymer mixtures,Jian‐Sheng Wang; Kurt Binder,Abstract We calculate the mean-square end-to-end distances and mean-square gyrationradii using the bond fluctuation model for a binary polymer blend in the presence of a wall byMonte Carlo simulation. In the bulk; the size of the minority; low-concentration polymerspecies is compressed compared to the majority one. In the vicinity of the wall; where theminority polymer concentration is enriched due to attraction from the wall; the dimensions ofthe two types of polymers are approximately equal and are essentially the same as in anathermal polymer melt. Thus; the geometric constraint is more important to the structure ofthe polymers than the polymer-polymer and polymer-wall interactions.,Macromolecular Theory and Simulations,1992,14
Thermoelectric transport through a quantum nanoelectromechanical system and its backaction,Hangbo Zhou; Juzar Thingna; Jian-Sheng Wang; Baowen Li,Abstract We present a comprehensive study of thermoelectric transport properties of aquantum nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS) described by a single-electron transistor(SET) coupled to a quantum nanomechanical resonator (NR). The effects of a quantum NRon the electronic current are investigated with special emphasis on how the SET-NRcoupling strength plays a role in such a NEMS. We find that the SET-NR coupling is not onlyable to suppress or enhance the thermoelectric current but can also switch its direction. Theeffect of the NR on the thermoelectric coefficients of the SET is studied and we find that evena small SET-NR coupling could dramatically suppress the figure of merit Z T. Lastly; weinvestigate the backaction of electronic current on the NR and possible routes of heating orcooling the NR are discussed. We find that by appropriately tuning the gate voltage the …,Physical Review B,2015,13
Topological effect on thermal conductivity in graphene,Jin-Wu Jiang; Jian-Sheng Wang; Baowen Li,The topological effect on thermal conductivity is investigated through the comparison amonggraphene nanoribbons; carbon nanorings; and the Möbius-like graphene strips (MGS) bymolecular dynamics simulation. It is found that the thermal conductivity of MGS is less thanone half of that of graphene nanoribbons. The underlying mechanism whereby MGS acquiresuch low thermal conductivity may be attributable to the enhanced phonon-phononscattering and localization property; which are induced by the nontrivial topology of Möbiusstrip. Moreover; by counting in the dimensions of MGS; a lower length/width ratio reduces itsthermal conductivity; as the phonon-phonon scattering and localization within might befurther elevated.,Journal of Applied Physics,2010,13
Quantum phonon transport of molecular junctions amide-linked with carbon nanotubes: A first-principles study,JT Lü; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract Quantum phonon transport through benzene and alkane chains amide-linked withsingle-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is studied within the level of density-functionaltheory. The force-constant matrices are obtained from standard quantum chemistry software.The phonon transmission and thermal conductance are from the nonequilibrium Green'sfunction and the mode-matching method. We find that the ballistic thermal conductance isnot sensitive to small compression or stretching of the molecular junction. The terminatinggroups of the SWCNTs at the cutting edges only influence the thermal conductancequantitatively. The conductance of the benzene and alkane chains shows large difference.Analysis of the transmission spectrum shows that (i) the low-temperature thermalconductance is mainly contributed by the SWCNT transverse-acoustic modes;(ii) the …,Physical Review B,2008,13
A Comparison of Extremal Optimization with Flat-Histogram and Equal-Hit Dynamics for Finding Spin–Glass Ground States,Jian-Sheng Wang; Yutaka Okabe,We compare the performance of extremal optimization (EO); flat-histogram and equal-hitalgorithms for finding spin–glass ground states. The first-passage-times to a ground stateare computed. At optimal parameter of ｼ 1: 15; EO outperforms other methods for smallsystem sizes; but equal-hit algorithm is competitive to EO; particularly for large systems. Flat-histogram and equal-hit algorithms offer additional advantage that they can be used forequilibrium thermodynamic calculations. We also propose a method to turn EO into a usefulalgorithm for equilibrium calculations.,Journal of the Physical Society of Japan,2003,13
Asymptotic layer coverage in deposition models without screening,Vladimir Privman; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract The asymptotic large-behavior of the saturation coverage in multilayer depositionwithout screening is studied by analytical considerations and numerical Monte Carlosimulations. It is argued that the convergence law to the limiting coverage is related to theproblem of the random-walk survival probability on a lattice with a partial trap at the origin. Amodel is introduced that has a logarithmic; rather than power-law; asymptotic coveragebehavior; confirmed by numerical results.,Physical Review A,1992,13
Nonlinearity enhanced interfacial thermal conductance and rectification,Lifa Zhang; Juzar Thingna; Dahai He; Jian-Sheng Wang; Baowen Li,Abstract We study the nonlinear interfacial thermal transport across atomic junctions by thequantum self-consistent mean-field (QSCMF) theory based on the nonequilibrium Green'sfunction approach; the QSCMF theory we propose is very precise and matches well with theexact results from quantum master equation. The nonlinearity at the interface is studied byeffective temperature-dependent interfacial coupling calculated from the QSCMF theory. Wefind that nonlinearity can provide an extra channel for phonon transport in addition to thephonon scattering which usually blocks heat transfer. For weak linearly coupled interface;the nonlinearity can enhance the interfacial thermal transport; with increasing nonlinearity ortemperature; the thermal conductance shows nonmonotonical behavior. The interfacialnonlinearity also induces thermal rectification; which depends on the mismatch of the two …,EPL (Europhysics Letters),2013,11

Theground-state energy can also be determined. We also explore the accuracy and limitationsof this method.,Physical Review E,2001,11

Generalized Caroli formula for the transmission coefficient with lead-lead coupling,Huanan Li; Bijay Kumar Agarwalla; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract We present a generalized transmission coefficient formula for the lead-junction-leadsystem; in which interaction between the leads has been taken into account. Based on thisformula; the Caroli formula could be easily recovered and a transmission coefficient formulafor interface problem in the ballistic system can be obtained. The condition of validity for theformula is carefully explored. We mainly focus on heat transport. However; thecorresponding electrical transport could be similarly dealt with. Also; an illustrative exampleis given to clarify the precise meaning of the quantities used in the formula; such as theconcept of the reduced interacting matrix in different situations. In addition; an explicittransmission coefficient formula for a general one-dimensional interface setup is obtainedbased on the derived interface formula.,Physical Review E,2012,10
Dimensional crossover of thermal conductance in graphene nanoribbons: a first-principles approach,Jian Wang; Xiao-Ming Wang; Yun-Fei Chen; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract First-principles density-functional calculations are performed to investigate thethermal transport properties in graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). The dimensional crossoverof thermal conductance from one to two dimensions (2D) is clearly demonstrated withincreasing ribbon width. The thermal conductance of GNRs of a few nanometers widthalready exhibits an approximate low-temperature dependence of T 1.5; like that of 2Dgraphene sheets which is attributed to the quadratic nature of the dispersion relation for theout-of-plane acoustic phonon modes. Using a zone-folding method; we heuristically derivethe dimensional crossover of thermal conductance with the increase of ribbon width.Combining our calculations with the experimental phonon mean-free path; some typicalvalues of thermal conductivity at room temperature are estimated for GNRs and for 2D …,Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter,2012,10
Molecular dynamics simulation for heat transport in thin diamond nanowires,Jin-Wu Jiang; Bing-Shen Wang; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract The phonon thermal conductivity in diamond nanowires (DNWs) is studied bymolecular dynamics simulation. It is found that the thermal conductivity in narrower DNW islower and does not show obvious temperature dependence; a very small value (about 2.0W/m/K) of thermal conductivity is observed in ultra-narrow DNW; which may be of potentialapplications in thermoelectric devices. These two phenomena are probably due to thedominant surface effect and phonon confinement effect in narrow DNW. Our simulationreveals a high anisotropy in the heat transport of DNW. Specifically; the thermal conductivityin DNW along [110] growth direction is about five times larger than that of [100] and [111]growth directions. The anisotropy is believed to root in the anisotropic group velocity foracoustic phonon modes in DNW along three different growth directions.,Physical Review B,2011,10
Nonequilibrium relaxation of the two-dimensional Ising model: Series-expansion and Monte Carlo studies,Jian-Sheng Wang; Chee Kwan Gan,Abstract We study the critical relaxation of the two-dimensional Ising model from a fullyordered configuration by series expansion in time t and by Monte Carlo simulation. Both themagnetization (m) and energy series are obtained up to 12th order. An accurate estimatefrom series analysis for the dynamical critical exponent z is difficult but compatible with 2.2.We also use Monte Carlo simulation to determine an effective exponent; z eff (t)=− 1 8 d lnt/d ln m; directly from a ratio of three-spin correlation to m. Extrapolation to t→∞ leads to anestimate z= 2.169±0.003.,Physical Review E,1998,10
Electron and phonon drag in thermoelectric transport through coherent molecular conductors,Jing-Tao Lü; Jian-Sheng Wang; Per Hedegård; Mads Brandbyge,Abstract We study thermoelectric transport through a coherent molecular conductorconnected to two electron and two phonon baths using the nonequilibrium Green's functionmethod. We focus on the mutual drag between electron and phonon transport as a result of'momentum'transfer; which happens only when there are at least two phonon degrees offreedom. After deriving expressions for the linear drag coefficients; obeying the Onsagerrelation; we further investigate their effect on nonequilibrium transport. We show that thedrag effect is closely related to two other phenomena:(1) adiabatic charge pumping througha coherent conductor;(2) the current-induced nonconservative and effective magnetic forceson phonons.,Physical Review B,2016,9
Dissipative particle dynamics simulation of field-dependent DNA mobility in nanoslits,Kun Yan; Yu-Zong Chen; Jongyoon Han; Gui-Rong Liu; Jian-Sheng Wang; Nicolas G Hadjiconstantinou,Abstract The dynamics of DNA molecules in highly confined nanoslits under varying electricfields are studied using dissipative particle dynamics method; and our results show thatmanipulation of the electrical field can strongly influence DNA mobility. The mobility of DNAμ scales with electric field E as μ= μ^ H-k_ 1 e^-E/E_ c. And the data points for different DNAlengths finally approach each other in strong fields; which suggest that the sensitivity tochain length is almost lost. To explain the unusual field-dependent phenomena; we analyzethe time evolution of DNA configurations under different fields. For strong driving potentialswhen the system is dominated by the electric driving force; the DNA chains are more likely tohold coiled configurations. For weak driving potential when the random diffusion forcesdominate; we see frequent dynamic transitions between stretched and coiled …,Microfluidics and nanofluidics,2012,9
Anisotropic finite-size scaling analysis of a three-dimensional driven-diffusive system,Kwan-Tai Leung; Jian-Sheng Wang,We study the standard three-dimensional driven diffusive system on a simple cubic latticewhere particle jumping along a given lattice direction are biased by an infinitely strong field;while those along other directions follow the usual Kawasaki dynamics. Our goal is todetermine which of the several existing theories for critical behavior is valid. We analyzefinite-size scaling properties using a range of system shapes and sizes far exceedingprevious studies. Four different analytic predictions are tested against the numerical data.Binder and Wang's prediction does not fit the data well. Among the two slightly differentversions of Leung; the one including the effects of a dangerous irrelevant variable appearsto be better. Recently proposed isotropic finite-size scaling is inconsistent with our data fromcubic systems; where systematic deviations are found; especially in scaling at the critical …,International Journal of Modern Physics C,1999,9

Monte Carlo and high-temperature-expansion calculations of a spin-glass effective Hamiltonian,Jian-Sheng Wang; Robert H Swendsen,Abstract We study the quenched random-coupling spin-glass problem from the point of viewof a nonrandom effective Hamiltonian; by Monte Carlo and high-temperature-expansionmethods. It is found that the high-temperature series of the±J spin-glass effectiveHamiltonian do not converge below the ferromagnetic transition temperature. The MonteCarlo approach does give reliable results at low temperatures. Our results are comparedwith Haake; Lewenstein; and Wilkens' picture of spin-glass phase transitions.,Physical Review B,1988,9
Topological symmetry-induced width dependence of thermal conductance of edge-reconstructed graphene nanoribbons,Jinghua Lan; Yongqing Cai; Gang Zhang; Jian-Sheng Wang; Yong-Wei Zhang,Abstract Using the nonequilibrium Green's function method; we investigate the effects ofedge reconstructions on the thermal conductance of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). For thefirst time; we show that the thermal conductance of edge reconstructed zigzag GNRsoscillates with the number of dimers along the width direction; N. When N is an odd or evennumber; the thermal conductance of edge reconstructed zigzag GNRs is about 25 or 85%that of the perfect zigzag GNRs; respectively. For edge reconstructed armchair GNRs; thethermal conductance only decreases slightly and it changes linearly with N. The significantdifference in the width dependence of GNR thermal conductance may be attributed to thetopological symmetry and edge reconstruction of GNRs. Our results shed light on a newapproach to control the thermal conductance of GNRs by reconstructing their edges and …,Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics,2014,8
Exchange fluctuation theorem for heat transport between multiterminal harmonic systems,Bijay Kumar Agarwalla; Huanan Li; Baowen Li; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract We study full counting statistics for transferred heat and entropy production betweenmultiterminal systems in absence of a finite junction. The systems are modeled ascollections of coupled harmonic oscillators; which are kept at different equilibriumtemperatures and are connected via arbitrary time-dependent couplings. Followingconsistent quantum framework and two-time measurement concept we obtain analyticalexpressions for the generalized cumulant generating function. We discuss transient andsteady-state fluctuation theorems for the transferred quantities. We also address the effect ofcoupling strength on the exchange fluctuation theorem.,Physical Review E,2014,8
Cumulants of heat transfer across nonlinear quantum systems,Huanan Li; Bijay Kumar Agarwalla; Baowen Li; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract We consider thermal conduction across a general nonlinear phononic junction.Based on two-time observation protocol and the nonequilibrium Green's function method;heat transfer in steady-state regimes is studied; and practical formulas for the calculation ofthe cumulant generating function are obtained. As an application; the general formalism isused to study anharmonic effects on fluctuation of steady-state heat transfer across a single-site junction with a quartic nonlinear on-site pinning potential. An explicit nonlinearmodification to the cumulant generating function exact up to the first order is given; in whichthe Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation symmetry is found still valid. Numerically a self-consistentprocedure is introduced; which works well for strong nonlinearity.,The European Physical Journal B,2013,8
Self-repairing in single-walled carbon nanotubes by heat treatment,Jin-Wu Jiang; Jian-Sheng Wang,Structure transformation by heat treatment in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) isinvestigated using molecular dynamics simulation. The critical temperature for the collapseof pure SWCNT is as high as 4655 K due to strong covalent carbon–carbon bonding. Above2000 K; the cross section of SWCNT changes from circle to ellipse. The self-repairingcapability is then investigated and two efficient processes are observed for the SWCNT torepair themselves.(1) In the first mechanism; vacancy defects aggregate to form a biggerhole; and a bottleneck junction is constructed nearby.(2) In the second mechanism; a localcurvature is generated around the isolate vacancy to smooth the SWCNT. Benefit from thepowerful self-repairing capability; defective SWCNT can seek a stable configuration at hightemperatures; thus the critical temperature for collapse is insensitive to the vacancy defect …,Journal of Applied Physics,2010,8

Conditions for the existence of phonon localized edge-modes,Jin-Wu Jiang; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract The phonon localized edge-modes are systematically studied; and two conditionsare proposed for the existence of the localized edge-modes:(I) coupling between differentdirections (x; y; or z) in the interaction and (II) different boundary conditions in threedirections. The generality of these two conditions is illustrated by different lattice structures:one-dimensional (1D) chain; two-dimensional (2D) square lattice; 2D graphene; three-dimensional (3D) simple cubic lattice; 3D diamond structure; etc.; and with differentpotentials: valence force field model; Brenner potential; etc.,Physical Review B,2010,8

We compare our theoretical results with the corresponding numerical data we haveobtained from the computer simulations to demonstrate the level of accuracy of ourtheoretical predictions. We also compare our results with those for some other prototypemodels; notably particle-hopping models of vehicular traffic; to demonstrate the qualitativefeatures we have observed in the Katz-Lebowitz-Spohn model; emphasizing; in particular;the consequences of repulsive interparticle interactions.,Physical Review E,2002,8
Effect of van der Waals surface interactions on wetting transitions in polymer blends,Gerald G Pereira; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract We examine the effect of van der Waals type interactions between the surface andmonomers on wetting transitions in polymer blends. Using a Monte Carlo method we findthat as long as the effective range of the van der Waals interaction is much smaller than thesize of the polymers the transition may be described by a short range model. However; whenthe range of the interaction becomes comparable to the polymer size it can affect both thepolymer density profile and the order of the wetting transition.© 1996 The American PhysicalSociety.,Physical Review E,1996,8

Enrichment of the chain ends in polymer melts at interfaces,Jiang-Sheng Wang; Kurt Binder,Abstract By Monte Carlo simulation of two lattice models of polymer melts; the enrichment ofthe chain ends in the vicinity of a wall is obsserved. For the bond fluctuation model withattractive interactions between the ends and wall; $\varepsilon/k_ {\rm B} T=-1$ and 0; theenhancement of the density of ends increases with chain lengths; while when the interactionis repulsive; $\varepsilon/k_ {\rm B} T=+ 1$; the ends get depleted.

Thermal contraction in silicon nanowires at low temperatures,Jin-Wu Jiang; Jian-Sheng Wang; Baowen Li,The thermal expansion effect of silicon nanowires (SiNW) in [100];[110] and [111] directionswith different sizes is theoretically investigated. At low temperatures; all SiNW studied exhibita thermal contraction effect due to the lowest energy of the bending vibration mode whichhas a negative effect on the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). The CTE in [110]direction is distinctly larger than the other two growth directions because of the anisotropy ofthe bending mode in SiNW. Our study reveals that CTE decreases with an increase of thestructure ratio γ= length/diameter; and is negative in the whole temperature range with γ=1.3.,Nanoscale,2010,7
Energies and structures of stacking faults of Ag from the tight-binding method calculation,Jun Cai; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract The generalized stacking fault (GSF) structure and corresponding energy of Ag arestudied by a tight-binding potential combined with a simulated annealing method. Thepotential is chosen to fit band structures and total energies from a set of first-principlecalculations (Mehl MJ and Papaconstantopoulos DA 1996 Phys. Rev. B 54 4519). It is foundthat the relaxed stacking fault energy (SFE) and anti-SFE are equal to 38 mJ m− 2 and 126mJ m− 2; respectively; and are in agreement with first-principle calculations and experiment.At the same time our numerical calculations also show that the calculated generalizedstacking energy as a function of displacement provides support for previous theoreticalstudies.

It is shown that there exist various individualmesoscopic behaviors such as the periodic conductance oscillations; Coulomb-staircase;Kondo phase; and the universal conductance fluctuations; as well as the insulating-metallicphenomenon and the multi-Kondo peak assisted Coulomb oscillations. It is predicted thatthere are many new crossing phenomena; as a result of the competition among the multipleelectron–electron scattering; the dissipations; and fluctuations in the out of equilibriumstates. Interestingly; the average coupling directly reflects the tunnel current. It is argued …,Physical Review B,2002,7
Spin rectification in thermally driven XXZ spin chain via the spin-Seebeck effect,Juzar Thingna; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract We study the phenomenon of spin-current rectification in a one-dimensional XXZspin chain in the presence of a thermal drive. In our model a pure spin current is generatedby a temperature difference between two harmonic heat baths which in turn creates a spinvoltage via the spin-Seebeck effect. Along with a local spin-current operator definition andthe nonequilibrium modified Redfield solution we study the spin-rectification ratio as afunction of system size and external magnetic field. Intriguing effects are observed at lowtemperatures such as oscillations with system size and high range of tunability with externalmagnetic field making magnetic insulators; which are well described by the XXZ model;ideal candidates to build spin devices based on rectification.,EPL (Europhysics Letters),2013,6

An analytical result of thesteady-state heat flux for an overdamped anharmonic junction with arbitrary temperaturebias is obtained. It is found that the thermal conductance can be expressed in terms of atemperature-dependent effective force constant. The role of anharmonicity is identified. Wealso give the general formula for the second cumulant of heat in steady state; as well as theaverage geometric heat flux when two system parameters are modulated adiabatically.

Heat generation and transport due to time-dependent forces,Bijay Kumar Agarwalla; Jian-Sheng Wang; Baowen Li,Abstract We study heat generation and transport properties for solids in the presence ofarbitrary time-dependent forces. Using a nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) approachwe present an exact analytical expression of heat current for the linear system. We foundthat the current can be expressed in terms of the displacement of the atoms in the center andthe self-energy of the heat bath. We carry out the calculation for a periodic driving force andstudy the dependence of steady state current on frequency and system size for one-and two-dimensional systems. We obtain an explicit solution of current for a one-dimensional linearchain connected with a Rubin bath. We found that the heat current is related to the density ofstates of the system and is independent of the bath temperature in ballistic transport. Thebaths can absorb energy only when the external frequency lies within the phonon band …,Physical Review E,2011,6
Phonon Hall effect in ionic crystals in the presence of static magnetic field,Bijay K Agarwalla; Lifa Zhang; Jian-Sheng Wang; Baowen Li,Abstract We study phonon Hall effect (PHE) for ionic crystals in the presence of staticmagnetic field. Using Green-Kubo formula; we present an exact calculation of thermalconductivity tensor by considering both positive and negative frequency phonons. Numericalresults are shown for some lattices such as hexagonal lattices; triangular lattices; andsquare lattices. We find that the PHE occurs on the nonmagnetic ionic crystal NaCl; althoughthe magnitude is very small which is due to the tiny charge-to-mass ratio of the ions. The off-diagonal thermal conductivity is finite for nonzero magnetic field and changes sign for highvalue of magnetic field at high temperature. We also found that the off-diagonal thermalconductivity diverges as±1/T at low temperature.,The European Physical Journal B,2011,6

Friction between Si tip and (001)-2× 1 surface: A molecular dynamics simulation,Jun Cai; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract In order to investigate the friction between a Si tip and its (001)-2× 1 surface bymolecular-dynamics (MD) simulation; two schemes are adopted. In the first scheme the tipadvances over the substrate each MD step while in the second scheme the tip advancesevery 1000 MD steps. It is found that if the tip and the substrate approach each other closelyenough; for both schemes wear occurs via a slip-stick mechanism; but their details aredifferent from each other. We present a detailed explanation for this phenomenon andconclude that the second scheme is more appropriate for the description of experimentalsituations.

We introduce a parameter ε s which describes themonomer–monomer interactions in the layer adjacent to the wall. This parameter is shown tobehave similarly to the parameter g; used in mean field theory to describe the change inmonomer–monomer interactions due to the wall. We identify a wetting tricritical point whichmay be defined either with respect to ε s or the bulk density. For bulk densities less than thetricritical bulk density we obtain first‐order transitions while for bulk densities greater thanthe tricritical bulk density we obtain critical wetting transitions; in accordance with mean‐fieldtheory. We also show how the molecular weight of the polymer can be varied to obtain …,The Journal of chemical physics,1996,6
Irreversible multilayer adsorption,P Nielaba; V Privman; J‐S Wang,Abstract Random sequential adsorption (RSA) models have been studied [1] due to theirrelevance to deposition processes on surfaces. The depositing particles are represented byhard-core extended objects; they are not allowed to overlap. Numerical Monte Carlo studiesand analytical considerations are reported for 1D and 2D models of multilayer adsorptionprocesses. Deposition without screening is investigated; in certain models the density mayactually increase away from the substrate. Analytical studies of the late stage coveragebehavior show the crossover from exponential time dependence for the lattice case of thepower law behavior in the continuum deposition. 2D lattice and continuum simulations ruleout some “exact” conjectures for the jamming coverage. For the deposition of dimers on a 1Dlattice with diffusional relaxation we find that the limiting coverage (100%) is approached …,Berichte der Bunsengesellschaft für physikalische Chemie,1994,6
Geometrical effects on spin injection: 3D spin drift diffusion model,Juzar Thingna; Jian-Sheng Wang,We discuss a three-dimensional (3D) spin drift diffusion (SDD) model to inject spin from aferromagnet (FM) to a normal metal (N) or semiconductor (SC). Using this model weinvestigate the problem of spin injection into isotropic materials like GaAs and study theeffect of FM contact area and SC thickness on spin injection. We find that in order to achievedetectable spin injection a small contact area or thick SC samples are essential for directcontact spin injection devices. We investigate the use of thin metal films (Cu) proposed byKumar et al.[Appl. Phys. Lett. 91; 142110 (2007)] and show that they are an excellentsubstitute for tunneling barriers (TB) in the regime of small contact area. Since mosttunneling barriers are prone to pinhole defects; we study the effect of pinholes in AlOtunneling barriers and show that the reduction in the spin-injection ratio (γ) is solely due …,Journal of Applied Physics,2011,5
Analytical description of Ogston-regime biomolecule separation using nanofilters and nanopores,Zi Rui Li; Gui Rong Liu; Jongyoon Han; Yuan Cheng; Yu Zong Chen; Jian-Sheng Wang; Nicolas G Hadjiconstantinou,Abstract We present a theoretical model describing Ogston (pore size comparable to orlarger than the characteristic molecular dimension) sieving of rigid isotropic and anisotropicbiomolecules in nanofluidic molecular filter arrays comprising of alternating deep andshallow regions. Starting from a quasi-one-dimensional drift-diffusion description; whichcaptures the interplay between the driving electric force; entropic barrier and moleculardiffusion; we derive explicit analytical results for the effective mobility and trapping time. Ourresults elucidate the effects of field strength; device geometry and entropic barrier height;providing a robust tool for the design and optimization of nanofilter/nanopore systems.Specifically; we show that Ogston sieving becomes negligible when the length of shallowregion becomes sufficiently small; mainly due to efficient diffusional transport through the …,Physical Review E,2009,5
Super paramagnetic clustering of DNA sequences,Sugiarto Radjiman; Han Lianyi; Wang Jian-Sheng; Chen Yu Zong,Abstract An unsupervised clustering of 4541 DNA sequences containing active promoterregions from vertebrate and arthropod classes (including their viral genes) was performed.All necessary information was solely gathered a priori from the DNA sequences bymeasuring frequencies of tri-nucleotides and tetra-nucleotides. We employed SuperParamagnetic Clustering; a novel clustering algorithm based on physical properties of aninhomogeneous granular ferromagnet. This method utilizes Swendsen-Wang cluster MonteCarlo simulations to distinguish clusters by measuring pairs of correlation functions fromdifferent resolutions. We identified two strongly separated clusters of human viral genescorresponding to the Epstein-Barr virus and the Herpes Simplex virus type 1.

Transition Matrix Monte Carlo and Flat‐Histogram Algorithm,Jian‐Sheng Wang,In any valid Monte Carlo sampling that realizes microcanonical property we can collectstatistics for a transition matrix in energy. This matrix is used to determine the density ofstates; from which most of the thermodynamical averages can be calculated; including freeenergy and entropy. We discuss single‐spin‐flip algorithms; such as flat‐histogram andequal‐hit algorithms; that can be used for simulations. The flat‐histogram algorithm realizesmulticanonical ensemble. We demonstrate the use of the method with applications to Isingmodel and show its efficiency of search for spin‐glass ground states.,AIP Conference Proceedings,2003,5

A Monte Carlo simulation of B-site order–disorder transformation in Pb (Sc1/2Ta1/2) O3 triggered by mechanical activation,XS Gao; J Lim; JM Xue; JS Wang; JM Liu; J Wang,Abstract Order–disorder transformation triggered by mechanical activation in a perovskitestructure was observed in Pb (Sc 1/2 Ta 1/2) O 3; it is simulated using a Monte Carloalgorithm; based on the competition between mechanical activation leading to disorderingand the thermal diffusion recovering the ordering. The time evolution of the long-range order(LRO) from an initial ordered state shows a steady decrease at the initial stage and thenbecomes more or less stabilized over a prolonged period; while from the disordered initialstate; LRO increases first and then stabilizes at a similar end value. Thermal diffusion is thedominant process at relatively high temperatures; leading to the disorder-to-ordertransformation. The effect of mechanical activation becomes significant and results in order-to-disorder transformation at relatively low temperatures. Both the mechanical activation …,Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter,2002,5
Efficient Monte Carlo simulation methods in statistical physics,Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract The basic problem in equilibrium statistical mechanics is to compute phase spaceaverage; in which Monte Carlo method plays a very important role.

Reconstruction of Si (001): A comparison study of many body potential calculations,Jun Cai; Jian‐Sheng Wang,Abstract The Tersoff potential and a recently developed potential function for covalentmaterials (phys. stat. sol.(b) 212; 9 (1999)) are used to simulate the reconstruction of Si (001)surface. We obtain a dimered (2× 1) reconstruction with an asymmetric rearrangement ofatoms in deeper layers in Z-direction using Tersoff's potential and an asymmetric buckleddimered (2× 1) reconstruction using the recently developed potential. The latter is inagreement with results from the first principles calculations or experiments.,physica status solidi (b),2001,5
Conductance oscillations in interacting mesoscopic systems with multiple energy levels: Quantum interference,Lin Yi; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract By means of the equation of motion Green function method; the Meir-Wingreen-Leetheory of strongly interacting quantum dots with two energy levels is generalized to multipleenergy levels in the self-consistent field approximation. It is found that both the conductanceand magnetization display periodic oscillations in tunneling through an interactingmesoscopic system in an applied magnetic field. In particular; it is shown that oscillations inthe conductance directly reflect quantum interference. Our results display qualitativeagreement with experimental observations.,Physical Review B,2001,5
Microstructural studies of organic light-emitting devices by Monte Carlo simulation of two-dimensional triangles,Siew-Yen Cheng; Jian-Sheng Wang; Gu Xu,Abstract The fast degradation of organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) remains as the mainobstacle to the commercialization of OLEDs. Among the failure mechanisms proposed;crystallization of the amorphous Alq 3 film that leads to the quenching ofelectroluminescence plays a crucial role and is little understood. Because in situ studies ofthe Alq 3 layer; with the probing of thin organic film by; for example; x-ray diffraction; are verydifficult; if not impossible; Monte Carlo simulation is therefore conducted. The molecularmotion of Alq 3 is simulated by two-dimensional triangles which interacted with a square-well potential in an isothermal-isobaric ensemble. Simulated results show the structuralrelaxation of Alq 3 from amorphous to crystalline upon thermal annealing. To impede thisordering process; quenched impurities of various shapes were added to the system. It is …,Physical Review B,2000,5
Unequal intralayer coupling in a bilayer driven lattice gas,Choon-Peng Chng; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract The system under study is a twin-layered lattice gas at half filling; being driven tononequilibrium steady states by a large; finite “electric” field. By making intralayer couplingsunequal; we were able to extend the phase diagram obtained by Hill; Zia; and Schmittmannand found some interesting effects. Many transient phases to the strip phase were found tobe long lived. We also attempted to test whether the driven lattice gas with negativeinterlayer coupling is still in the Ising universality class. Simulation results suggest a value of1.75 for the exponent γ but a value closer to 2.0 for the ratio γ/ν. We suspect a differentsusceptibility has to be used due to the presence of two phases near criticality.,Physical Review E,2000,5
Work distribution under continuous quantum histories,Huanan Li; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract: We present a general scheme to obtain work distribution in closed systems undercontinuous quantum histories of corresponding" power" operator. The scheme is tested byanalytically calculating the quantum work distribution for a prototype model of a center-shifted one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator. Furthermore; its relationship to thepath integral formalism with the Wick rotation is immediately noticed. We find that; based onthe continuous measurement; generally Jarzynski equality in quantum regime is not valid;though it is recovered in high-temperature limit. Also we briefly explore the extension toopen systems; in which the work done and heat transfer can be calculated in the same set ofquantum histories. Our results for this model can be directly verified by single-molecule forcespectroscopy.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1304.6286,2013,4
Bright and dark modes induced by graphene bubbles,Jin-Wu Jiang; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract Through a lattice dynamics analysis; it is revealed that the bubble plays a role ofenergy shield in the graphene; which helps to split the normal modes into two categories ofdistinct topological nature; namely the bright and dark modes. The topological invariants;Euler characteristic; of the bright and dark modes are 1 and 0; respectively. For brightmodes; the energy is confined inside the bubble; so this type of modes is sensitive to theshape of the bubble; while the opposite phenomenon is observed for the dark modes. Thedifferent behavior of these two types of normal modes is examined and verified in theprocess of phonon thermal transport. The bright and dark modes are expected to bedistinguished in experiment with existing scanning force microscope techniques; and theyshould play significant roles in many other physical processes.,EPL (Europhysics Letters),2012,4
Graphene-based torsional resonator from molecular-dynamics simulation,Jin-Wu Jiang; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract Molecular-dynamics simulations are performed to study graphene-based torsionalmechanical resonators. The quality factor is calculated by QF= ωτ/2π; where the frequency ωand lifetime τ are obtained from the correlation function of the normal mode coordinate. Oursimulations reveal the radius dependence of the quality factor as QF= 2628/(22R− 1+0.004R 2); which yields a maximum value at some proper radius R. This maximum point isdue to the strong boundary effect in the torsional resonator; as disclosed by the temperaturedistribution in the resonator. Resulting from the same boundary effect; the quality factorshows a power law temperature dependence with power factors below 1.0. The theoreticalresults supply some valuable information for the manipulation of the quality factor in futureexperimental devices based on the torsional mechanical resonator.,EPL (Europhysics Letters),2011,4
Dispersive transport of biomolecules in periodic energy landscapes with application to nanofilter sieving arrays,Zi Rui Li; Gui Rong Liu; Nicolas G Hadjiconstantinou; Jongyoon Han; Jian‐Sheng Wang; Yu Zong Chen,Abstract We present a theoretical model for describing the electric field-driven migration anddispersion of short anisotropic molecules in nanofluidic filter arrays. The model usesmacrotransport theory to derive exact integral-form expressions for the effective mobility anddiffusivity of Brownian particles moving in an effective one-dimensional energy landscape.The latter is obtained by modeling the anisotropic molecules as point-sized Brownianparticles with their orientational degrees of freedom accounted for by an entropy penaltyterm; and using a systematic projection procedure for reducing the system dimensionality tothe device axial dimension. Our analytical results provide guidance for the design andoptimization of nanofluidic separation systems without the need for complex numericalsimulations.

Erratum: Transient behavior of heat transport in a thermal switch [Phys. Rev. B 81; 052302 (2010)],Eduardo C Cuansing; Jian-Sheng Wang,We discovered an error in our code that affected the dynamical behavior of the energycurrent. In determining the current we numerically calculate several integrals using thetrapezoidal rule. The integrals in Eq.(7); however; were numerically calculated incorrectlybecause of an error (a misplaced division by 2) in the code. This resulted in the current toerroneously decay faster than the correct behavior. The figures for the numerical results inour manuscript should therefore be replaced by Figs. 1–3 shown in this erratum. Comparingthe previously published figures and the corrected figures; we find that for long times thecurrent in both cases do approach the steady-state values calculated independently from theLandauer formula. Furthermore; the initial negative spike in the transient current do alsooccur in both cases. The difference lies in how fast the current decays to the long-time …,Physical Review B,2011,4
Coupled electron–phonon transport from molecular dynamics with quantum baths,JT Lü; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract Based on generalized quantum Langevin equations for the tight-bindingwavefunction amplitudes and lattice displacements; electron and phonon quantum transportare obtained exactly using molecular dynamics (MD) in the ballistic regime. The electron–phonon interactions can be handled with a quasi-classical approximation. Both charge andenergy transport and their interplay can be studied. We compare the MD results with those ofa fully quantum mechanical nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) approach for theelectron currents. We find a ballistic to diffusive transition of the electron conduction in one-dimensional chains as the chain length increases.,Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter,2009,4

Thepotential is chosen to fit band structures and total energies from a set of first-principlecalculations [Phys. Rev. B 54; 4519 (1996)]. It is found that the relaxed stacking fault energy(SFE) and unstable SFE are equal to 46 and 102 mJ/m 2; respectively; and are in goodagreement with first principles calculations and experiment. In addition; the structureproperties of the relaxed GSF of metal Au are also presented.,The European Physical Journal B-Condensed Matter and Complex Systems,2002,4

Small Polaron Transport and Colossal Magnetoresistance in EuTiO $ _3$,Ruofan Chen; Ji-Chang Ren; Km Rubi; R Mahendiran; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract: At low temperatures; EuTiO $ _3 $ system has very large resistivities and exhibitscolossal magnetoresistance. Based on a first principle calculation and the dynamical mean-field theory for small polaron we have calculated the transport properties of EuTiO $ _3 $. Itis found that due to electron-phonon interaction the conduction band may form a tinysubband which is close to the Fermi level. The tiny subband is responsible for the largeresistivity. Besides; EuTiO $ _3 $ is a weak antiferromagnetic material and its magnetizationwould slightly shift the subband via exchange interaction between conduction electrons andmagnetic atoms. Since the subband is close to the Fermi level; a slight shift of its positiongives colossal magnetoresistance. Such mechanism provides a new explanation for thecolossal magnetoresistance phenomena.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.02238,2017,3
Thermoelectric effect in Aharonov–Bohm structures,Xin Lu; Jian-Sheng Wang; William G Morrel; Xiaoxi Ni; Chang-Qin Wu; Baowen Li,Abstract The thermoelectric effects of a single Aharonov–Bohm (SAB) ring and coupleddouble Aharonov–Bohm (DAB) rings have been investigated on a theoretical basis; takinginto account the contributions of both electrons and phonons to the transport process byusing the nonequilibrium Green's function technique. The thermoelectric figure of merit of thecoupled DAB rings cannot be predicted directly by combining the values of two SAB ringsystems due to the contribution of electron–phonon interaction to coupling between the twosites connecting the rings. We find that thermoelectric efficiency can be optimized bymodulating the phases of the magnetic flux threading the two rings.,Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter,2014,3

Our results are in goodagreement with the recent experimental ones. We find that the thermal conductancedepends on the direction angle θ of the thermal flux periodically with period π/3. It is furthershown that the nature of this directional dependence is the directional dependence of groupvelocities of the phonon modes in the graphene; originating from the D6h symmetry in thehoneycomb structure.,arXiv preprint arXiv:0902.1836,2009,3
Dynamic critical exponents for Swendsen–Wang and Wolff algorithms obtained by a nonequilibrium relaxation method,Jianqing Du; Bo Zheng; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract Using a nonequilibrium relaxation method; we calculate the dynamic criticalexponent z of the two-dimensional Ising model for the Swendsen–Wang and Wolffalgorithms. We examine dynamic relaxation processes following a quench from adisordered or an ordered initial state to the critical temperature T c; and measure theexponential relaxation time of the system energy. For the Swendsen–Wang algorithm withan ordered or a disordered initial state; and for the Wolff algorithm with an ordered initialstate; the exponential relaxation time fits well to a logarithmic size dependence up to a latticesize L= 8192. For the Wolff algorithm with a disordered initial state; we obtain an effectivedynamic exponent z exp= 1.19 (2) up to L= 2048.

One of the first such successful algorithm wasdeveloped by Swendsen and Wang eight years ago. In contrast to the local algorithms;cluster algorithms update dynamical variables in a global fashion. Therefore; large changesare made in a single step. The method is very efficient; especially near the critical point of asecond-order phase transition. Studies of various statistical mechanics models and somegeneralizations of the algorithm will be briefly reviewed. We mention applications in otherfields; especially in imaging processing.,*,1995,3
Finite coupling effects in double quantum dots near equilibrium,Xiansong Xu; Juzar Thingna; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract A weak coupling quantum master equation provides reliable steady-state resultsonly in the van Hove limit; ie; when the system-lead coupling approaches zero.

The approach providesaccurate results for harmonic oscillator and spin-bosonic systems. We apply this approach tostudy steady-state fermionic systems and the calculation on an exactly solvable doublequantum dot system shows that the method is rigorously valid up to second order in system-lead coupling only near equilibrium; ie; linear response regime. We further compare to theRedfield and the secular Redfield (Lindblad-type) master equations that are inaccurate in …,Physical Review B,2017,2
Quantum thermal transport through anharmonic systems: A self-consistent approach,Dahai He; Juzar Thingna; Jian-Sheng Wang; Baowen Li,Abstract We propose a feasible and effective approach to study quantum thermal transportthrough anharmonic systems. The main idea is to obtain an effective harmonic Hamiltonianfor the anharmonic system by applying the self-consistent phonon theory. By using theeffective harmonic Hamiltonian; we study thermal transport within the framework of thenonequilibrium Green's function method using the celebrated Caroli formula. Wecorroborate our quantum self-consistent approach by using the quantum master equationthat can deal with anharmonicity exactly; but is limited to the weak system-bath couplingregime. Finally; in order to demonstrate its strength; we apply the quantum self-consistentapproach to study thermal rectification in a weakly coupled two-segment anharmonicsystem.,Physical Review B,2016,2

Tight-bindingmodels for the electrons are coupled to the electromagnetic field continuum. Our approachdiffers from the established ones based on fluctuational electrodynamics; in that it describestruly nonequilibrium steady states; and is nonlocal in system's dielectric properties. For a twoquantum-dot model a new length scale emerges at which the heat current shows a peak.This length scale is related to the physics of parallel plate capacitors. The three-dimensionalmodel results are consistent with the theory of Polder and van Hove except at very shortdistances.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1607.02840,2016,2

Computational study of the two-terminal transport of Floquet quantum Hall insulators,Han Hoe Yap; Longwen Zhou; Jian-Sheng Wang; Jiangbin Gong,Abstract Periodic driving fields can induce topological phase transitions; resulting in Floquettopological phases with intriguing properties such as very large Chern numbers andunusual edge states. Whether such Floquet topological phases could generate robust edgestate conductance much larger than their static counterparts is an interesting question. In thispaper; working under the Keldysh formalism; we study two-lead transport via the edge statesof irradiated quantum Hall insulators using the method of recursive Floquet-Green'sfunctions. Focusing on a harmonically-driven Hofstadter model; we show that quantized Hallconductance as large as 8 e 2/h can be realized but only after applying the so-called Floquetsum rule.

Caroli formalism in near-field heat transfer between parallel graphene sheets,Jia-Huei Jiang; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract In this work we conduct a close-up investigation into the nature of near-field heattransfer (NFHT) of two graphene sheets in parallel-plate geometry. We develop a fullymicroscopic and quantum approach using the nonequilibrium Green's function method. ACaroli formula for heat flux is proposed and numerically verified. We show that our near-field-to-black-body heat flux ratios generally exhibit 1/d α dependence; with an effective exponentα≈ 2.2; at long distances exceeding 100 nm and up to one micron; in the opposite d→ 0limit; the values converge to a range within an order of magnitude. We justify this feature bynoting it is owing to the breakdown of local conductivity theory; which predicts a 1/ddependence. Furthermore; from the numerical result; we find that in addition to thermalwavelength λ tha shorter distance scale∼ 10− 100 nm; comparable to the graphene …,Physical Review B,2017,1

Tight-binding models for the electrons are coupled tothe electric-field continuum through a scalar potential. For a two–quantum-dot model a newlength scale emerges below which the heat current exhibits great enhancement. This lengthscale is related to the physics of parallel plate capacitors.

A scalar photon theory for near-field radiative heat transfer,Jiebin Peng; Han Hoe Yap; Gang Zhang; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract: We study a one-dimensional model of radiative heat transfer for which the effect ofthe electromag-netic field is only from the scalar potential and thereby ignoring the vectorpotential contribution. This is a valid assumption when the distances between objects are ofthe order of nanometers. Using Lorenz gauge; the scalar field is quantized with thecanonical quantization scheme; giving rise to scalar photons. In the limit as the speed of lightapproaches infinity; the theory reduces to a pure Coulomb interaction governed by thePoisson equation. The model describes very well parallel plate capacitor physics; where anew length scale related to its capacitance emerges. Shorter than this length scale we seegreater radiative heat transfer. This differs markedly from the usual Rytov fluctuationalelectrodynamics theory in which the enhancement is due to evanescent modes shorter …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.07113,2017,1
Radiative heat transfer as a Landauer-Büttiker problem,Han Hoe Yap; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract We study the radiative heat transfer between two semi-infinite half-spaces; boundedby conductive surfaces in contact with vacuum. This setup is interpreted as a four-terminalmesoscopic transport problem. The slabs and interfaces are viewed as bosonic reservoirs;coupled perfectly to a scattering center consisting of the two planes and vacuum. UsingRytov's fluctuational electrodynamics and assuming Kirchhoff's circuital law; we calculate theheat flow in each bath. This allows for explicit evaluation of a conductance matrix; fromwhich one readily verifies Büttiker symmetry. Thus; radiative heat transfer in layered mediawith conductive interfaces becomes a Landauer-Büttiker transport problem.,Physical Review E,2017,1

We focus on the effectfrom different layer number $ N $. Our main prediction is that: the increase of $ N $ caneither enhance or weaken CTE; depending on the strength of the substrate interaction$\gamma $. If $\gamma<\epsilon $; where $\epsilon $ is the inter-layer interaction; the CTEwill increase with increasing $ N $. Otherwise; if $\gamma>\epsilon $; CTE will decreasewith increasing $ N $.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1108.5820,2011,1
A universal exponential factor in the dimensional crossover from graphene to graphite,Jin-Wu Jiang; Jian-Sheng Wang,A universal exponential factor; γ c= π/2; is disclosed for the dimensional crossover of few-layer graphene (FLG) from two-dimensional graphene to three-dimensional graphite. γ c isfound by analyzing available experimental data on different properties of FLG with varyingthickness. A theoretical study on the phonon spectrum of the vertical acoustic mode in FLG iscarried out to further check this exponential factor γ c. Interestingly; the same exponentialfactor appears in the dimensional crossover of the phonon mode. It turns out that theexponential factor γ c is related to the homogeneous Helmholtz-like molal equation in themass transfer with a first order chemical reaction. The finding should provide valuableinformation for experimentalists and theorists in the future investigation on thicknessdependent properties of FLG.,Journal of Applied Physics,2010,1

Intriguing Heat Conduction of a Polymer Chain,Jian-Sheng Wang; Baowen Li,Abstract: We study heat conduction in a one-dimensional chain of particles with longitudinalas well as transverse motions. The particles are connected by two-dimensional harmonicsprings together with bending angle interactions. Using equilibrium and nonequilibriummolecular dynamics; three types of thermal conducting behaviors are found: a logarithmicdivergence with system sizes for large transverse coupling; 1/3 power-law at intermediatecoupling; and 2/5 power-law at low temperatures and weak coupling. The results areconsistent with a simple mode-coupling analysis of the same model. The 1/3 power-lawdivergence should be a generic feature for models with transverse motions.,arXiv preprint cond-mat/0308445,2003,1

MOLECULAR DYNAMICS STUDY OF THE FRICTION PROPERTIES FOR A Ge TIP–SURFACE SYSTEM,Jun Cai; Jian-Sheng Wang,The friction between a Ge tip and its (001)-(2× 1) reconstructed surface is investigated bymolecular dynamics (MD) simulation. It is found that when the tip and the substrate approacheach other closely enough; a wear occurs under slip-stick way. At the same time; it is alsofound that a permanent damage occurs when the tip advances perpendicularly to the dimerrows of the surface; while such damage is not observed when the tip moves parallelly to thedimer rows. This is different from the friction phenomena on a macroscopic scale. At themicroscopic level; the resulting atomic configuration and the properties of friction force vs.sliding distance depend strongly on a sliding direction.,Surface Review and Letters,2001,1
Coulomb force mediated heat transfer in the near field-geometric effect,Jian-Sheng Wang; Zu-Quan Zhang; Jing-Tao Lü,Abstract: It has been shown recently that the Coulomb part of electromagnetic interactions ismore important than transverse propagation waves for the near-field enhancement of heattransfer between metal objects at a distance of order nanometers. Here we present a theoryfocusing solely on the Coulomb potential between electrons hopping among tight-bindingsites. When the relevant systems are reduced to very small geometry; for example; a singlesite; the enhancement is much higher compared to a collection of them packed within adistance of a few angstroms. We credit this to the screening effect. This result may be usefulin designing metal-based meta-materials to enhance heat transfer much higher.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1803.01479,2018,*
Strong electron–phonon interaction and colossal magnetoresistance in EuTiO 3,Ruofan Chen; Ji-Chang Ren; Km Rubi; Ramanathan Mahendiran; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract At low temperatures; EuTiO 3 system has very large resistivities and exhibitscolossal magnetoresistance. Based on a first principle calculation and the dynamical mean-field theory for small polaron we have calculated the transport properties of EuTiO 3. It isfound that due to electron–phonon interaction the conduction band may form a tiny polaronicsubband which is close to the Fermi level. The tiny subband is responsible for the largeresistivity. Besides; EuTiO 3 is a weak antiferromagnetic material and its magnetizationwould slightly shift the subband via exchange interaction between conduction electrons andmagnetic atoms. Since the subband is close to the Fermi level; a slight shift of its positiongives colossal magnetoresistance.,The European Physical Journal B,2018,*
Energy transfer between two vacuum-gapped metal plates: Coulomb fluctuation and electron tunneling,Zu-Quan Zhang; Jing-Tao Lü; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract: Recent experimental measurements for near-field radiative heat transfer betweentwo bodies have been able to approach the gap distance within $2\;\textrm {nm} $; where thecontributions of Coulomb fluctuation and electron's tunneling are comparable. Using thenonequilibrium Green's function method in the $ G_ {0} W_ {0} $ approximation; based on atight-binding model; we obtain for the energy current a Caroli formula from the Meir-Wingreen formula in the local equilibrium approximation. Also; the Caroli formula isconsistent with the evanescent part of the heat transfer from the theory of fluctuationalelectrodynamics. We go beyond the local equilibrium approximation to study the energytransfer in the crossover region from electron tunneling to Coulomb fluctuation based on anumerical calculation.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.07946,2018,*
Phonon-driven electron scattering and magnetothermoelectric effect in two-dimensional tin selenide,Kaike Yang; Ji-Chang Ren; Hongfei Qiu; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract The bulk tin selenide (SnSe) is the best thermoelectric material currently with thehighest figure-of-merit due to strong phonon–phonon interactions. We investigate the effectof electron–phonon coupling (EPC) on the transport properties of a two-dimensional (2D)SnSe sheet. We demonstrate that EPC plays a key role in the scattering rate when theconstant relaxation time approximation is deficient. The EPC strength is especially large incontrast to that of pristine graphene. The scattering rate depends sensitively on the systemtemperatures and the carrier densities when the Fermi energy approaches the band edge.We also investigate the magnetothermoelectric effect of the 2D SnSe. It is found that at lowtemperatures there is enormous magnetoelectrical resistivity and magnetothermal resistivityabove 200%; suggesting possible potential applications in device design.

Transient and steady state behavior of full counting statistics in thermal transport,Bijay Agarwalla; Baowen Li; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract We study the statistics of heat transferred in a given time interval t M; through a finiteharmonic system; which is connected with two heat baths; maintained at two differenttemperatures. We calculate the cumulant generating function (CGF) for heat transfer usingnon-equilibrium Green's function method. The CGF can be concisely expressed in terms ofGreen's functions of the system and the self-energy of the lead with shifted arguments; Â (;')=sigma L (tau+ x (tau); tau'+ x (tau'))-sigma L (;'); where sigma L (;') is the contour-ordered self-energy of the left lead. The expression of CGF is valid in both transient and steady stateregimes. We present a transient result of the first four cumulants of a graphene junction.

Phonon modes at finite temperature in graphene and single-walled carbon nanotubes,Jin-Wu Jiang; Jian-Sheng Wang,Abstract: The phonon modes at finite temperature in graphene and single-walled carbonnanotubes (SWCNT) are investigated by the mode projection technique combined withmolecular dynamics simulation. It is found that the quadratic phonon spectrum of the flexuralmode in graphene is renormalized into linear at finite temperature by the phonon-phononscattering. Possible influence of this renormalization on the electron-phonon interaction andphonon thermal transport is analyzed. For the SWCNT; however the quadratic property ofthe phonon spectrum for the flexural mode can survive at finite temperature under protectionof the two-fold degeneracy of the flexural mode in SWCNT due to its quasi-one-dimensionalstructure. The frequency and life time of optical phonon modes are also studied at differenttemperatures. In particular; the life time of the in-plane optical phonons in graphene and …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1108.5814,2011,*

Some of these motors move on filamentous proteinswhereas other move on DNA or RNA strands. Often; many such motors movesimultaneously on the same track and their collective movement is similar to vehicular trafficon highways. We have developed theoretical models of different types of molecular motortraffic by appropriately extending the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP).Thus; our models of molecular motor traffic belong to the broad class of driven-diffusivelattice gas models which have close relations with cellular automata.

Unlike most studies at mesoscopic level; this theory focuses on the macroscopicgroup behavior of DNA transportation.

Binary tree summation Monte Carlo method for Potts models,J-S Wang; Oner Kozan; Robert H Swendsen,Abstract Efforts to develop better and more efficient algorithms for Monte Carlo simulationshave a long history; in which the Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) transformation [1] for Potts modelshas played a pivotal role. The most common use of this transformation has been to createalgorithms in which clusters of spins in the Potts model are flipped simultaneously [2; 3]. Inthis paper; we present a new algorithm using the FK representation in the spirit of recentwork by Newman and Ziff [4] on the percolation problem. The method produces independentsamples and sums up a large number of configurations for each sweep.

Cluster Monte Carlo Algorithms in Statistical Mechanics,Jian-Sheng Wang,210 LS. Wang the cluster and a “surface” term. Note that an effective surface area is used insteadof s2/3 which is proportional to the true surface area. Fisher's droplet theory is purelyphenomenological. It is not clear what does it mean by droplets or clusters in a microscopicmodel. Let us consider the Ising model with nearest neighbor ferromagnetic interaction. TheIsing spins are on a lattice taking only two states: pointing up or down. The most obvious deﬁnitionof a cluster is the so-called Ising cluster consists of bunch of “—” spins (or “+” spins). This deﬁnitionwas ﬁrst used by Miiler- Krumbhaar3 (1974) to check Fisher's droplet picture. At low T; there areonly small “—” clusters. As temperature rises; clusters become bigger. Eventually; an inﬁnitelylarge cluster is found. Unfortunately; this happens not at Tc for dimension d > 2; as it should beif Fisher's droplets can be identiﬁed as the “—” clusters.

Using the newalgorithms; a Monte Carlo renormalization-group (MCRG) study of the short-range Ising spin-glass is carried out.
