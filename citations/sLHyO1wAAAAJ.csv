Experimental quantum key distribution with decoy states,Yi Zhao; Bing Qi; Xiongfeng Ma; Hoi-Kwong Lo; Li Qian,Abstract To increase dramatically the distance and the secure key generation rate ofquantum key distribution (QKD); the idea of quantum decoys—signals of different intensities—has recently been proposed. Here; we present the first experimental implementation ofdecoy state QKD. By making simple modifications to a commercial quantum key distributionsystem; we show that a secure key generation rate of 165 bit/s; which is 1/4 of the theoreticallimit; can be obtained over 15 km of a telecommunication fiber. We also show that with thesame experimental parameters; not even a single bit of secure key can be extracted with anon-decoy-state protocol. Compared to building single photon sources; decoy state QKD isa much simpler method for increasing the distance and key generation rate ofunconditionally secure QKD.,Physical review letters,2006,319

Active phase randomization of each individual pulse is implemented toprotect against attacks on imperfect sources. By optimizing the parameters in the decoy stateprotocol; we show that it is feasible to implement polarization encoding MDI-QKD withcommercial off-the-shelf devices. A rigorous finite key analysis is applied to estimate thesecure key rate.

Experimental study on the Gaussian-modulated coherent-state quantum key distribution over standard telecommunication fibers,Bing Qi; Lei-Lei Huang; Li Qian; Hoi-Kwong Lo,Abstract In this paper; we present a fully fiber-based one-way quantum-key-distribution(QKD) system implementing the Gaussian-modulated coherent-state (GMCS) protocol. Thesystem employs a double Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) configuration in which theweak quantum signal and the strong local oscillator (LO) go through the same fiber betweenAlice and Bob; and are separated into two paths inside Bob's terminal. To suppress the LOleakage into the signal path; which is an important contribution to the excess noise; weimplemented a scheme combining polarization and frequency multiplexing; achieving anextinction ratio of 70 dB. To further minimize the system excess noise due to phase drift ofthe double MZI; we propose that; instead of employing phase feedback control; one simplylet Alice remap her data by performing a rotation operation.

Feasibility of quantum key distribution through a dense wavelength division multiplexing network,Bing Qi; Wen Zhu; Li Qian; Hoi-Kwong Lo,Abstract In this paper; we study the feasibility of conducting quantum key distribution (QKD)together with classical communication through the same optical fiber by employing dense-wavelength-division-multiplexing (DWDM) technology at telecom wavelength. The impact ofclassical channels on the quantum channel has been investigated for both QKD based onsingle-photon detection and QKD based on homodyne detection. Our studies show that thelatter can tolerate a much higher level of contamination from classical channels than theformer. This is because the local oscillator used in the homodyne detector acts as a'modeselector'; which can suppress noise photons effectively. We have performed simulationsbased on both the decoy BB84 QKD protocol and the Gaussian-modulated coherent state(GMCS) QKD protocol. While the former cannot tolerate even one classical channel (with …,New Journal of Physics,2010,74

Direct generation of polarization-entangled photon pairs in a poled fiber,Eric Y Zhu; Zhiyuan Tang; Li Qian; Lukas G Helt; Marco Liscidini; JE Sipe; Costantino Corbari; Albert Canagasabey; Morten Ibsen; Peter G Kazansky,Abstract We experimentally demonstrate the direct generation of polarization-entangledphoton pairs in an optical fiber at room temperature by exploiting type-II phase-matchedspontaneous parametric down-conversion. A second-order nonlinearity is artificially inducedin the 17-cm-long weakly birefringent step-index fiber through the process of thermal poling;and quasi-phase-matching allows for the generation of entangled photons in the 1.5-microntelecom band when the fiber is pumped at 775 nm. A greater-than 80∶ 1 coincidence-to-accidental ratio is achieved; limited mainly by multiphoton pair generation. Without the needto subtract accidentals or to compensate for walk-off; the raw two-photon interferencevisibility is found to be better than 95%; and violation of Bell's inequality is observed by morethan 18 standard deviations. This makes for a truly alignment-free; plug-and-play source …,Physical review letters,2012,67

A balanced homodyne detector for high-rate Gaussian-modulated coherent-state quantum key distribution,Yue-Meng Chi; Bing Qi; Wen Zhu; Li Qian; Hoi-Kwong Lo; Sun-Hyun Youn; AI Lvovsky; Liang Tian,Abstract We discuss the excess noise contributions of a practical balanced homodynedetector (BHD) in Gaussian-modulated coherent-state (GMCS) quantum key distribution(QKD). We point out that the key generated from the original realistic model of GMCS QKDmay not be secure. In our refined realistic model; we take into account excess noise due tothe finite bandwidth of the homodyne detector and the fluctuation of the local oscillator (LO).A high-speed BHD suitable for GMCS QKD in the telecommunication wavelength region isbuilt and experimentally tested. The 3 dB bandwidth of the BHD is found to be 104 MHz andits electronic noise level is 13 dB below the shot noise at an LO level of 8.5× 10 8 photonsper pulse.

Subpicosecond carrier lifetime in beryllium-doped InGaAsP grown by He-plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy,Li Qian; SD Benjamin; PWE Smith; BJ Robinson; DA Thompson,The carrier dynamics and absorption edges of InGaAsP samples grown by He-plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy and doped with various concentrations of beryllium areinvestigated via pump-probe experiments and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) absorptionspectroscopy. Carrier lifetimes from 10 to< 1 ps are obtained for samples of increasingdoping concentrations. The reduced in carrier lifetimes are attributed to Be compensation ofthe deep donor levels introduced by the He plasma. The carrier lifetime increases withphotogenerated carrier density due to trap saturation. The FTIR results reveal sharpabsorption edges in this material for doping concentrations up to 1× 10 18 cm− 3.

However; in practice; a fast detector is usually noisy. Here; we propose a dual-detector method to improve the performance of a practical QKD system with realisticdetectors: the legitimate receiver randomly uses either a fast (but noisy) detector or a quiet(but slow) detector to measure the incoming quantum signals. The measurement resultsfrom the quiet detector can be used to bound the eavesdropper's information; while themeasurement results from the fast detector are used to generate a secure key. We apply thisidea to various QKD protocols. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements ofthe secure key rate in the lower loss regime in both Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) …,Physical Review A,2007,36

Experimental quantum key distribution with source flaws,Feihu Xu; Kejin Wei; Shihan Sajeed; Sarah Kaiser; Shihai Sun; Zhiyuan Tang; Li Qian; Vadim Makarov; Hoi-Kwong Lo,Abstract Decoy-state quantum key distribution (QKD) is a standard technique in currentquantum cryptographic implementations. Unfortunately; existing experiments have twoimportant drawbacks: the state preparation is assumed to be perfect without errors and theemployed security proofs do not fully consider the finite-key effects for general attacks.These two drawbacks mean that existing experiments are not guaranteed to be proven to besecure in practice. Here; we perform an experiment that shows secure QKD with imperfectstate preparations over long distances and achieves rigorous finite-key security bounds fordecoy-state QKD against coherent attacks in the universally composable framework.

Because the beach has subaerialand submarine components; processes range from the effects of wind to waves; currents;and tides acting on sediment supply and redistribution to form beach types. Importantprocesses include swash run-up and rundown; overtopping; infiltration into the beachface;step generation; bar formation; cusp development; and so on. Processes and materialsinteract in a dynamic manner in continual adjustment to changing environmental conditionsassociated with wind regimes; wave climates; tides; and extreme events such as storm surgeand tsunamis.,Encyclopedia of Marine Geosciences,2016,12
Large-capacity multiplexing of near-identical weak fiber Bragg gratings using frequency-shifted interferometry,Yiwen Ou; Ciming Zhou; Li Qian; Dian Fan; Chunfu Cheng; Huiyong Guo,We demonstrate interrogation of a large-capacity sensor array with nearly identical weakfiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) based on frequency-shifted interferometry (FSI). In contrast totime-division multiplexing; FSI uses continuous-wave light and therefore requires no pulsemodulation or high-speed detection/acquisition. FSI utilizes a frequency shifter in theSagnac interferometer to encode sensor location information into the relative phasebetween the clock-wise and counter-clockwise propagating lightwaves. Sixty-five weakFBGs with reflectivities in the range of− 31~-34 dB and with near identical peak reflectionwavelengths around 1555 nm at room temperature were interrogated simultaneously.Temperature sensing was conducted and the average measurement accuracy of the peakwavelengths was±3.9 pm; corresponding to a temperature resolution of±0.4° C.

Continuous-wave cavity ring-down evanescent-field sensing with a broadband source based on frequency-shifted interferometry,Fei Ye; Ciming Zhou; Bing Qi; Li Qian,Abstract We demonstrate that all-fiber cavity ring-down (CRD) evanescent-field sensing canbe performed using frequency-shifted interferometry (FSI). In contrast to conventional CRDschemes; without the need for any optical pulse or fast electronics; this FSI–CRD techniqueallows one to monitor the intensity decay of a continuous lightwave traveling inside a fiberloop ring-down cavity (RDC); from which the cavity loss information can be deduced. Byincorporating a fiber taper as the sensing element inside a RDC; we carried out FSI–CRDexperiments with an amplified spontaneous emission source; an acousto-optic modulator;and a slow detector; successfully applying the technique to the measurement of chemicalsolution concentration based on absorption; solution refractive index change; or acombination of both.

Modeling high-concentration L-band EDFA at high optical powers based on inversion function,Vladimir Chernyak; Li Qian,High-concentration erbium-doped fibers used in L-band erbium-doped fiber amplifier(EDFA) are known to experience additional losses due to effects of energy transfer betweenEr/sup 3+/ions and possibly quenchers (eg; homogeneous and clustering-induced up-conversion; quenching; etc.). These interactions between Er/sup 3+/ions make modeling ofinversion dynamics in L-band EDFA more complicated. We present a modeling approach forhigh-concentration doped fiber based on lumping of all complex phenomena of energytransfer in EDFA into a function of two variables hereafter referred to as the inversionfunction. The inversion function is evaluated for high optical powers (which constitutes atypical situation for fiber amplifiers) using a cluster expansion and assuming thatupconversion is the leading loss mechanism. The modeling results show a close …,IEEE Journal of selected topics in quantum electronics,2002,12

Discrete and continuous variables for measurement-device-independent quantum cryptography,Feihu Xu; Marcos Curty; Bing Qi; Li Qian; Hoi-Kwong Lo,In a recent Article in Nature Photonics; Pirandola et al. 1 claim that the achievable secret keyrates of discrete-variable (DV) measurement-device-independent (MDI) quantum keydistribution (QKD)(refs 2; 3) are “typically very low; unsuitable for the demands of ametropolitan network” and introduce a continuous-variable (CV) MDI QKD protocol capableof providing key rates which; they claim; are “three orders of magnitude higher” than those ofDV MDI QKD.

Quantum key distribution based on a Sagnac loop interferometer and polarization-insensitive phase modulators,Bing Qi; Lei-Lei Huang; Hoi-Kwong Lo; Li Qian,We present a design for a quantum key distribution (QKD) system in a Sagnac loopconfiguration; employing a novel phase modulation scheme based on frequency shift; anddemonstrate stable BB84 QKD operation with high interference visibility and low quantum biterror rate (QBER). The phase modulation is achieved by sending two light pulses with afixed time delay (or a fixed optical path delay) through a frequency shift element and bymodulating the amount of frequency shift. The relative phase between two light pulses uponleaving the frequency-shift element is determined by both the time delay (or the optical pathdelay) and the frequency shift; and can therefore be controlled by varying the amount offrequency shift. To demonstrate its operation; we used an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) asthe frequency-shift element; and vary the driving frequency of the AOM to encode phase …,Information Theory; 2006 IEEE International Symposium on,2006,11

Robust model for segmenting images with/without intensity inhomogeneities,Changyang Li; Xiuying Wang; Stefan Eberl; Michael Fulham; David Dagan Feng,Intensity inhomogeneities and different types/levels of image noise are the two majorobstacles to accurate image segmentation by region-based level set models. To provide amore general solution to these challenges; we propose a novel segmentation model thatconsiders global and local image statistics to eliminate the influence of image noise and tocompensate for intensity inhomogeneities. In our model; the global energy derived from aGaussian model estimates the intensity distribution of the target object and background; thelocal energy derived from the mutual influences of neighboring pixels can eliminate theimpact of image noise and intensity inhomogeneities.

Cryogenic fluid level sensors multiplexed by frequency-shifted interferometry,Fei Ye; Tong Chen; Di Xu; Kevin P Chen; Bing Qi; Li Qian,We present a liquid level sensing system for cryogenic fluids based on an array of aluminum-coated fiber Bragg gratings written in high-attenuation fibers (HAFs) interrogated byfrequency-shifted interferometry (FSI). The sensors are heated up optically through theabsorption of light at the core of the HAF sections. The distinct thermal response of sensorsin the liquid from that in the gas provides an unambiguous means to detect the liquid level.FSI allows the sensors to have overlapped spectral response; and; therefore; has thepotential of accommodating a larger number of sensors in the array. The measurement ofliquid nitrogen level using this system was experimentally demonstrated. The successfulcombination of aluminum-coated HAF Bragg grating sensors and the FSI techniquepromises a viable solution for liquid level sensor networks at cryogenic temperatures.,Applied optics,2010,9

This is not only applicable for investigating the dependence between any twovariables of a multivariable system; but also for measuring the influence of each variable …,Science China Earth Sciences,2013,5
Direct somatic cell reprogramming: treatment of cardiac diseases,Chuner Guo; Kishan Patel; Li Qian,Cardiac diseases are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the world.Cardiomyocyte death is a common consequence of many types of heart diseases and isusually irreversible. Scar tissues formed by cardiac fibroblasts serve compensatory roles forthe injured heart but eventually weaken cardiac function and result in life-threatening heartfailures. Unfortunately; adult human hearts have limited regenerative capacities. In the pastdecades; many interventional approaches have been taken in an attempt to restorefunctional cardiomyocytes in an injured heart. Promising advances have been made indirectly reprogramming mouse fibroblasts into cardiomyocyte-like cells both in vitro and invivo. Recently; several different methods have been reported; including the use oftranscription factors and microRNAs. In addition; two in vivo studies showed heart …,Current gene therapy,2013,5
Research on Visual Attention Classification Based on EEG Entropy Parameters,Wen Li; Dong Ming; Rui Xu; Hao Ding; Hongzhi Qi; Baikun Wan,Abstract In this study; two electroencephalogram (EEG) feedback experiments werecompleted to measure the different levels of visual attention. In order to assess differentvisual attention levels; EEG data were processed with nonlinear dynamics parametersbased on sequence complexity which involves approximate entropy; sample entropy andmulti-scale entropy. According to the statistical analysis of 14 subjects' EEG signal by usingentropy as parameters; significant differences in attention intensity have been found in mostof the electrodes in frontal regions and some of the electrodes in temporal regions. Thevalues of entropy indicate a declining tendency with the decreasing level of attention andamong all the parameters; sample entropy achieves the highest sensitivity in theclassification performance of visual attention.

Entangled coherent states: generation,Dai-Guo He; Yu-Li Dong; Jian-Xing Fang; Li Qian; Jie Hu,A scheme of generating the Bell-type and cluster-type entangled coherent states (ECSs) viaa single two-level atom and cavity modes initially prepared in coherent states is proposed.Discussions on the two ECSs are presented. When the atom interacts separately with twoRamsey zones and two cavity modes; the generation of Bell-type ECSs in separate cavitiesis realized after an atomic measurement. By adding the Ramsey zones and cavity modes;the cluster-type ECSs can be generated. The interaction time between the atom and cavitymodes are allπ/2λ; where A is the effective atom-cavity coupling constant. At last theexperimental feasibility of such proposal is discussed.,Chinese Journal of Quantum Electronics,2011,5

Temperature in high temperature SHPB experiments,Zhifang Deng; Ruoze Xie; Yixia Yan; Sizhong Li; Xicheng Huang,Abstract As an experimental technique; it's desired that the temperature in specimen isuniform in high temperature split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) experiments. However;the temperature in specimen decreases and the temperature of bars increases whenspecimen starts to contact with bars; which induces the nonuniform temperature distributionin specimen; and may result in inaccuracy of experimental results. In this paper; thetemperature distributions of specimen and bars in high temperature SHPB experiments wereinvestigated while the specimen was heated alone. Firstly; the temperature history ofspecimen was measured at different initial temperatures by experiments; then simulationwas carried out. Simulation results were consistent with experimental results by adjustingthe thermal contact coefficient between specimen and bars.

Large wdm fbg sensor network based on frequency-shifted interferometry,Yiwen Ou; Ciming Zhou; Li Qian; Dian Fan; Chunfu Cheng; Huiyong Guo; Zeng Xiong,Abstract—We combine wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) and frequency shiftedinterferometry (FSI) to interrogate a large-scale ultra-weak Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) array.Based on Sagnac interference; FSI can location resolve sensors without using pulses or fastdetection; therefore considerably lowers the system cost. By combining FSI with WDM;higher spatial resolution can be achieved. We demonstrated simultaneous interrogation of363 FBG sensors; grouped into 121 identical units of 3 FBGs of different central wavelengthsand spaced two meters apart. Based on the performance of the 363 grating system; we showthe potential for interrogating 3207 sensors with good signal-to-noise ratio.

In this work; we demonstrate that theNTE operation-temperature window of LaFe13–x Si x can be significantly broadened byadjusting Fe–Fe magnetic exchange coupling as x ranges from 2.8 to 3.1. In particular; theNTE operation-temperature window of LaFe10. 1Si2. 9 is extended to 220 K.

Measurement of Intracellular pH Changes Based on DNA-Templated Capsid Protein Nanotubes,Limin Ning; Xiaoxi Li; Dawei Yang; Peng Miao; Zonghuang Ye; Genxi Li,Intracellular pH (pHi) is a fundamental modulator of cell function. Minute changes in pHi maycause great effects in many cellular activities such as metabolism and signal transduction.Herein we report an electrochemical pHi sensor based on viral-coat proteins–DNAnanotubes modified gold electrode. The sensor is pH-sensitive as a result of the pH-dependent electrochemical property of methylene blue (MB) and cell permeable owing tothe polyarginine domain of the cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) coat protein. Moreover;because the pH sensor can be translocated into cells without any further operations; themeasurement of pHi changes can be greatly simplified. The pH sensor has a broad pHspectrum in the pH range from 4.0 to 9.0 and responds rapidly to the pH changes of cells; soit may hold great potential to be a valuable tool to study pH-dependent biological and …,Analytical chemistry,2014,4

Real-time χ (2) evolution in twin-hole fiber during thermal poling and repoling,Jiawen Zhang; Li Qian,We report the real-time evolution of the second-order nonlinearity χ^(2) induced in a twin-hole fiber during its first thermal poling and the subsequent repoling after thermal erasure.The considerable difference in the χ^(2) evolution in the two poling processes indicates thatthe first poling has a strong history effect on the repoling. We use a two-charge dynamicsmodel involving a fast charge carrier Na^+ and a slow charge carrier H^+ to model the χ^(2)evolution in both poling processes. We quantitatively show that the difference in χ^(2)evolution is due to the different initial charge distributions before each poling. The extra H^+ions injected into the fiber during the first poling change the initial charge distribution in thesecond poling; which leads to a different χ^(2) dynamic.,JOSA B,2009,4

Room Temperature Photoluminescence from Erbium in Silica by Evaporation and Thermal Oxidation,Hossein Alizadeh; Wahid Shams-Kolahi; Li Qian; Nazir P Kherani; Stefan Zukotynski,Abstract Room temperature photoluminescence (PL) at 1.54 µm from erbium-doped siliconrich silicon oxide (ErSRSO) films; fabricated on fused quartz by thermal evaporation followedby thermal-annealing in air; is reported. PL measurements show maximum intensity insamples annealed at 1000 C for 4 h. X-ray diffraction (XRD) structural analyses show thatannealing caused the formation of active Er 3+(Er 2 O 3) centers. XRD and PL results showthat increasing Er 2 O 3 concentration does not necessarily lead to an increase inphotoluminescence. Compositional analysis using time-of-flight secondary ion massspectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) depth-profiling shows a strong correlation between the presenceof contiguous Si rich regions and Er 2 O 3 centers on the one hand and the observed PL onthe other.

χ (2) evolution in fiber during prolonged thermal poling,Jiawen Zhang; Li Qian,1. Introduction Silica glass lacks second-order nonlinearity (SON) χ(2); due to its macroscopicsymmetry. However; this symmetry can be broken by thermal poling; and a permanent SON insilica glass can be established; as reported by Myers et al. in 1991[1]. Since then; many attemptshave been made to obtain a large SON in silica fibers for their potential new applications; suchas optical switch[2]; wavelength conversion[3;6]; and photon pair generation[4]. In theliterature; fibers were typically poled for minutes to tens of minutes to achieve a large SON[5;6]. The induced SON within this time is mainly due to the migration of the fast charge carrierNa+[7]. In this paper; we find that the SON in a twin-hole fiber under thermal poling reaches maximumafter ~6 hours. We observe a two-stage rise in the SON evolution and attribute the fast rise tothe migration of Na+ and the … 2.

Role of adenosine in weak electro-acupuncture-induced depression of nociceptive response of spinal dorsal horn neurons in rats,C Liu; F Zhao; W Li; L Zhu,Abstract In this study; extracellular recordings were made from wide dynamic range (WDR)neurons in lumbar segments of the spinal cord in rats transsected at the first lumbarsegment. The nociceptive discharges of WDR neurons were depressed by weak electro-acupuncture applied to" Yanglingquan"-" Xuanzhong" points. The depression was blockedby iv administration of adenosine receptor antagonists; theophylline and caffeine. Theobservations indicate that depression of the nociceptive response of the WDR neuronsinduced by weak EA may be mediated by adenosine within the spinal cord.,Zhen ci yan jiu= Acupuncture research,1994,4

Despite recent success in directly reprogramming fibroblasts into various celltypes; the precise changes that occur as fibroblasts progressively convert to the target cellfates remain unclear. The inherent heterogeneity and asynchronous nature of thereprogramming process renders it difficult to study this process using bulk genomictechniques. Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing to overcome this limitation andanalysed global transcriptome changes at early stages during the reprogramming of mousefibroblasts into induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) 1; 2; 3; 4.

Polarization-entangled photon pair sources based on spontaneous four wave mixing assisted by polarization mode dispersion,Pisek Kultavewuti; Eric Y Zhu; Xingxing Xing; Li Qian; Vincenzo Pusino; Marc Sorel; J Stewart Aitchison,Abstract Photonic-based qubits and integrated photonic circuits have enableddemonstrations of quantum information processing (QIP) that promises to transform the wayin which we compute and communicate. To that end; sources of polarization-entangledphoton pair states are an important enabling technology. However; such states are difficult toprepare in an integrated photonic circuit. Scalable semiconductor sources typically rely onnonlinear optical effects where polarization mode dispersion (PMD) degradesentanglement. Here; we directly generate polarization-entangled states in an AlGaAswaveguide; aided by the PMD and without any compensation steps. We perform quantumstate tomography and report a raw concurrence as high as 0.91±0.01 observed in a 1;100-nm-wide waveguide.

Shear thickening fluids in protective applications: a review,Selim Gürgen; Melih Cemal Kuşhan; Weihua Li,Abstract A thorough and critical review on Shear Thickening Fluids (STFs) is presentedbased on a literature survey. The rheological properties of STFs are discussed consideringmany factors affecting shear thickening behavior and the use of STFs in protective systemsis reviewed. The main focus of this review is multi-phase STFs; relatively new to the literature(in the last five years). Multi-phase STFs include a second phase in suspensions and theinfluences of this additional phase on rheological behavior and protective applications arediscussed extensively. Based on this extended review; STF do benefit protectiveapplications; but the major contribution is not driven by the shear thickening behavior.Rather; STFs are responsible for the increase in friction along fabrics and enhancedfiber/yarn coupling in fabric based protective systems. As a result; of these effects; the …,*,2017,3

Progress in molecular genetics and its potential implications in organizational behavior research,Zhaoli Song; Wendong Li; Nan Wang,Virtually all human behavioral traits are heritable; which means that traits are geneticallytransmitted from parents to offspring. Although it sounds bold; decades of empirical researchin the social sciences have accumulated abundant evidence largely supporting this claim(Turkheimer 2000; Turkheimer and Gottesman 1991). Organizational behaviors are noexception. We have reached a general consensus; mainly through studies involving twins;that work-related behaviors and experiences are partially influenced by genetic factors. Forinstance; the heritability of job satisfaction is estimated to be about 30%(Arvey et al. 1989;Arvey; et al. 1994). Genetic factors are also estimated to explain; on average; 36% of thevariance in vocational interests (eg; Bouchard 2004) and about 30% of the variance in workvalues (Keller et al. 1992). These figures mean that a certain portion of variance of the …,The Biological Foundations of Organizational Behavior; The University of Chicago Press; Chicago; IL,2015,3

In this method transfer matrix is implemented inthe time domain; either by switching between time and frequency domains using Fouriertransform and its inverse operation; or by replacing the frequency variable (ω) with itstemporal operator (-i (d/dt)). This approach allows us to implement the transfer matrixmethod (which can easily incorporate dispersion; is analytical in nature; and requires lesscomputation time) in the time domain; where we can incorporate nonlinearity of variouskinds; instantaneous (such as Kerr nonlinearity); or slow resonant nonlinearity (such ascarrier-induced nonlinearity).

Construction and expression of anti-Hantavirus N protein single chain Fv antibody fragment in Escherichia coli,Jiandong Li; Tao Wang; Chuan Li; Yan Ji; Mifang Liang,Abstract The nucleocapsid (N) protein of Hantaviruses plays an important role in theformation of RNP complex of each genomic segment of vRNA and the assembly of the RNPsinto virion. Previous studies showed that the RNA binding domain (RBD) of N proteinspecifically interacts with vRNA located at amino acids 175 to 217; nonspecific RBD waslocalized at the carboxyl-terminal amino acids of the N protein. To elucidate the function of Nprotein in vivo; we develoepd single chain Fv antibodies (scFv) with different binding sites atN protein. By using phage display technology; we isolated the heavy and light chain genesof both group specific (L13D3) and Hantann virus (HTNV) type specific (H34) antibodies toHTN virus N protein from mouse hybridoma cell lines and human peripheral lymphocytesrespectively; and expressed them in form of Fab in Escherichia coli.

Doppler Effect-Based Optical Fiber Vibration Sensor Using Frequency-Shifted Interferometry Demodulation,Ciming Zhou; Tao Tian; Li Qian; Dian Fan; Weilong Liang; Yiwen Ou,A novel optic-fiber vibration sensing system based on frequency-shifted interferometry (FSI)is proposed and demonstrated in this paper. The sensor is based on the phenomenon thatthe light frequency transmitted through a segment of bent fiber can be Doppler shifted byvibration. The Doppler frequency shift is measured using FSI demodulation. Compared totraditional fiber Bragg grating vibration sensor; the proposed sensor is easy to fabricate; oflow cost and without directional dependency. The application of FSI demodulation allows forcustom tailoring of measurement sensitivity; and has superior signal stability due to its same-path interference nature. The measured Doppler frequency shift using the FSI system agreeswell with the calculated one; derived from strain measurements.

Performance of a double-layer guided mode resonance filter with non-subwavelength grating period at oblique incidence,Linyong Qian; Dawei Zhang; Yuanshen Huang; Chunxian Tao; Ruijin Hong; Songlin Zhuang,Abstract A double-layer guided-mode resonance (GMR) filter with a non-subwavelengthgrating period is proposed for light reflection at oblique incidence. A zinc oxide coated photo-resist grating GMR filter was fabricated; which exhibits good filter properties. For atransverse magnetic-polarized wave; the grating period is larger than the resonancewavelength; which will reduce the difficulties associated with pattern production. The gratingstructure with a 750 nm period was fabricated utilizing a low cost two-beam interferencesystem; with resonance obtained at 659.76 nm. In addition; the fabrication toleranceconcerning the fill factor and the grating thickness were discussed. The device wasdesigned utilizing numerical methods based on a rigorous coupled-wave analysis. Ourdesign may promote the practical application of GMR filters.,Optics & Laser Technology,2015,2
Edelta: A Word-Enlarging Based Fast Delta Compression Approach.,Wen Xia; Chunguang Li; Hong Jiang; Dan Feng; Yu Hua; Leihua Qin; Yucheng Zhang,Abstract Delta compression; a promising data reduction approach capable of finding thesmall differences (ie; delta) among very similar files and chunks; is widely used foroptimizing replicate synchronization; backup/archival storage; cache compression; etc.However; delta compression is costly because of its time-consuming wordmatchingoperations for delta calculation. Our indepth examination suggests that there exists strongwordcontent locality for delta compression; which means that contiguous duplicate wordsappear in approximately the same order in their similar versions. This observation motivatesus to propose Edelta; a fast delta compression approach based on a word-enlargingprocess that exploits word-content locality. Specifically; Edelta will first tentatively find amatched (duplicate) word; and then greedily stretch the matched word boundary to find a …,HotStorage,2015,2
Simulation of instantaneous light transmission in wheat/maize intercropping canopy in Hetao region; China,ZK Wang; PT Wu; XN Zhao; XL Chen; ZZ Li; RH Chai,Abstract The leaf distribution in intercropping canopy is usually laterally and verticallyheterogeneous; which makes continuous measurement of light interception very difficult. Inorder to quantify the light interception by wheat/maize intercropping during different growthstages; a geometrical model was developed in this study to simulate photosyntheticallyactive radiation (PAR) transmission in this system. Measured PAR values in fieldexperiments were used to validate the geometrical model. Results showed that thegeometrical model efficiently simulated the PAR transmitted on soil surface underintercropping canopy. The determination coefficients of linear regression between estimatedand measured values were 0.947 and 0.950 for 6: 2 intercropping (I62) and 12: 4intercropping (I124); respectively.

Self-calibrating fiber spectrometer for the measurement of broadband downconverted photon pairs,EY Zhu; C Corbari; PG Kazansky; L Qian,Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a simple method to measure the biphoton jointspectrum by mapping the spectral information onto the temporal domain using a dispersivemedium. Various top-hat spectral filters are used to limit the spectral (and hence; temporal)extent of the broadband downconversion photons measured. The sharp edges of thespectral filters are utilized as spectral markers for dispersion characterization of thedispersive medium. This method allows dispersion characterization and joint spectralmeasurement to be completed simultaneously. The joint spectrum (which extends beyond100 nm; centered about 1.5 micron) of the type-II downconverted photon pairs generatedfrom a poled optical fiber is obtained with this method.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1505.01226,2015,2

Immune complex negatively regulates Toll‐like receptor 9‐mediated immune responses in B cells through the inhibitory Fc‐gamma receptor IIb,Li Qian; Wenyan Chen; Hongchao Qin; Chenglei Rui; Xiaoqin Jia; Yi Fu; Weijuan Gong; Fang Tian; Mingchun Ji,ABSTRACT Because inappropriate activation of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) may inducepathological damage; negative regulation of the TLR9-triggered immune response hasattracted considerable attention. Nonpathogenic immune complex (IC) has beendemonstrated to have beneficial therapeutic effects in some kinds of autoimmune diseases.However; the role of IC in the regulation of TLR9-triggered immune responses and theunderlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study; it was demonstrated that IC stimulationof B cells not only suppresses CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN)-induced pro-inflammatory IL-6 and IgM κ production; but also attenuates CD40 and CD80 expression.Furthermore; our results suggest that the receptor for the Fc portion of IgG (FcγR) IIb isinvolved in the suppressive effect of IC on TLR9-mediated CD40; CD80 and IL-6 …,Microbiology and immunology,2015,2

Low-coherence virtual reference interferometry for dispersion analysis,Michael A Galle; Li Qian,We present low-coherence virtual reference interferometry (LC-VRI) for short length (<; 1 m)fiber dispersion characterization using a broadband LED source and a low-resolutionspectrometer or spectrum analyzer. The LC-VRI is a simple and convenient alternative tobalanced spectral interferometry (BSI); capable of measuring both first-and second-orderdispersion directly from the interference pattern. The main advantage of using LC-VRIinstead of BSI is that full characterization can be performed from a single spectral scan;without the need for precision control of the reference path. The technique is demonstratedfor the characterization of SMF28 fiber and the results are compared with the manufacturer'sspecifications and to measurements obtained using BSI. The standard deviation of the first-and second-order dispersion is found to be on the order of 10-3 ps and 10-4 ps/nm …,IEEE Photonics Technology Letters,2014,2
High-purity; Broadband; Entangled Photon Pairs Generated in Poled Silica Fibers,Eric Y Zhu; Li Qian; Costantino Corbari; Alexey Gladyshev; Peter G Kazansky,Quantum entanglement is a fundamental resource in quantum optics and the field of quantuminformation in general. The most widely used entangled photon pair sources to date are basedon bulk nonlinear crystals or waveguides formed in periodically poled crystals; but these sourceseither require bulky free-space optics; or precision fiber-to- waveguide coupling. To make quantumtechnologies more practical and accessible; low-cost and easily-fabricated sources must bedeveloped. In this talk; we focus on a fiber-based polarization-entangled photon source. It iscompatible with telecom fiber networks; and therefore highly desirable for applications such asquantum key distribution and fiber-optic quantum networks. Our fiber-based polarization-entangledphoton pair source is based on the periodically-poled silica fiber (PPSF).

In order to produce both low-density and large-area holographic gratings; a tilted and axis-shift (TAS) Lloyd's mirrorsystem was designed for recording such holographic gratings. The recording area willincrease largely especially for gratings of low density; by setting the angle between theLloyd's mirror and the substrate larger than 90°; and meanwhile; by enlarging theintersection angle of incident light and mirror surface. Insuring the projected area onto thesubstrate by reflex equal to the incident area directly onto the substrate; the optical axis wasshifted to realize the maximization of utilization of interference area.

It isshown that the DC-induced process is capable of producing a significantly larger conversionefficiency than the four wave mixing process. Despite the fact that it suffers greater effects ofdispersion; the enhanced growth rate of the DC-induced process provides a conversionefficiency roughly 300× larger than that of four wave mixing. Over a sample length of 20 cmthe DC-induced process is able to generate idler power more than 270 times greater thanthat produced by the equivalent four wave mixing process.,Optics letters,2012,2

Crosstalk and ghost gratings in a large-scale weak fiber bragg grating array,Huiyong Guo; Li Qian; Ciming Zhou; Zhou Zheng; Yinquan Yuan; Ruquan Xu; Desheng Jiang,Large-scale distributed fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor networks have a wide range ofapplications. However; serious crosstalk could occur in a near-identical serial FBG sensornetwork because of multiple reflections. Since crosstalk cannot be observed directly andseparately from signal; experimental investigation of crosstalk is challenging. In this work;we point out the similarity and symmetry between crosstalk and ghost gratings; and by wayof measuring the spectrum of ghost gratings; we experimentally study the characteristics ofcrosstalk in a serial array of 3010 near-identical FBGs using a commercial FBG sensorinterrogation system. We show that ghost gratings drop much more rapidly in power as onegoes downstream; and they are more homogeneous in spectral distribution than realgratings.

Second harmonic generation via femtosecond laser fabrication of poled; quasi-phase-matched waveguides in fused silica,Jason C Ng; Peter R Herman; Li Qian,Abstract Second harmonic generation (SHG) is demonstrated in femtosecond laser writtenwaveguides in fused silica through a combination of thermal poling and laser-based quasi-phase-matching (QPM) techniques. Quasi-phase-matching was controlled by the periodicerasure of induced nonlinearity through femtosecond laser erasure. A maximum SHGconversion efficiency of 6.6±0.5× 10− 5%/W is reported for the fundamental wavelength of1552.8 nm with a phase-matching bandwidth of 4.4 nm for a 10.0 mm long waveguide. For ashorter sample; an effective second-order nonlinearity of χ (2)= 0.012±0.001 pm/V wasmeasured.

The previous reservation on the key rate and suitability of DV-MDI-QKD formetropolitan networks expressed by Pirandola et al.[Nature Photon. 9; 397 (2015)] wasbased on an unfair comparison with low-efficiency detectors and high quantum bit error rate;and is; in our opinion; unjustified.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.04819,2015,1

Achievement of beam steering in terahertz band based on frequency-scanning grating-reflector antenna,Shichao Li; Chao Li; Xiaojuan Zhang; Guangyou Fang,A frequency-scanning grating-reflector antenna operating in the 0.2 THz band is proposed.The antenna system consists of a planar grating reflector; a thin lens and a feed horn placedat the focal point of the lens. The beam-scanning property based on the frequency sweepingwas analysed and optimised based on Floquet's theorem. A bilayer structure is introduced toimprove the diffraction efficiency and to suppress the specular beam. The frequency-controlled beam steering concept was verified by the quasi-optical measurements in the 0.2THz band. The measured scanning range is 13.55° over the frequency band 180–220 GHz.The specular beams are remarkably inhibited with the diffractive efficiency as high as over89%. The presented antenna has the advantage of the convenience to be extended to ahigher frequency with a high directivity.,Electronics Letters,2014,1

Modeling Polarization in a Bidirectional Fiber System,William La; Li Qian,Polarization control in fiber-optics systems in a unidirectional configuration is well understoodand can be modeled with one set of orthogonal principal states of polarization (PSP) [1].However; no model exists that describes polarization evolution in a bidirectional section of afiber system; which are commonly encountered; such as in the case when fiber Bragg gratings(FBGs) are used. Such a model would be required when polarization control is implementedin a bidirectional section of the system. Additionally; such a model would be useful for understandingpolarization evolution in a bidirectional fiber system when it is subject to external stimuli suchas stress and temperature variations that impact the fiber's birefringence. Here; we present apolarization model for a bidirectional fiber system containing an element with variablebirefringence; referred to as a polarization control element (PCE); and demonstrate that it …,Signal Processing in Photonic Communications,2011,1

Paradoxical Relationship of Chromosomal Instability with Breast Cancer Outcome: Identification of a Good Prognostic ER Negative/HER2 Negative Breast Cancer C...,C Swanton; N Juul; Q Li; A Eklund; A Richardson; Z Szallasi,Chromosomal Instability (CIN) is widely held to be associated with poor prognosis in solidtumours; including breast cancer; that may be related to enhanced clonal evolutionarycapacity and the rapid acquisition of multi-drug resistance. Paradoxically; CIN is alsoassociated with tumour suppression in animal models that may result from excessivegenomic instability leading to autonomous cell lethality; a phenomenon analogous to"mutational meltdown" in model systems. We addressed whether such a phenomenon couldbe identified in breast cancer through a meta-analysis of CIN frequency in 1850 breastcancer patients.

Passive Estimate of an Untrusted Source for Quantum Key Distribution,Yi Zhao; Bing Qi; Li Qian; Hoi-Kwong Lo,Abstract" Plug & play" quantum key distribution (QKD) system has significant advantage inreal-life applications over other QKD structures. Its unconditional security has been provedrecently. One key assumption made in the security proof is that Alice actively sets path toeach individual pulse. This is challenging for high-speed QKD. Here we propose a simplerscheme with a complete proof of its unconditional security. The essential idea is to use abeam splitter to passively split each input pulse. We show that we can estimate theproperties of the source using cross-estimate technique. Thus active routing of eachindividual pulse is not necessary. We have derived analytical expressions for the passiveestimation scheme. Moreover; using simulations; we have considered four real-lifeimperfections: Additional loss introduced by the" plug & play" structure; inefficiency of the …,*,2009,1

Dual‐band 1: 3 series power divider based on composite right/left‐handed transmission lines,Xiao Liu; Chao Li; Fang Li,Abstract A dual-band 1: 3 series power divider that provides equal power splits to all threeoutput ports is presented. To achieve dual-band working; the divider employs; instead ofconventional transmission lines of one wavelength; the composite right/left-handedtransmission lines (CRLH TLs) yielding electrical length of 0 and− 2π at 1.14 and 2.47 GHz;respectively. Dual-frequency transformers in two sections are added at the output ports toprovide dual-band impedance matching. Two pairs of isolation resistors are used to isolatethe three output ports from each other; and their values are determined by solving theequivalent network model of the divider. The isolation between any of the two output ports ismeasured to be larger than 20 dB at both frequencies; which is of great use in powercombination; and the dual-band divider maintains a relatively compact size.© 2008 Wiley …,Microwave and Optical Technology Letters,2008,1

Gaussian-modulated coherent state quantum key distribution experiment over 20km telecommunication fiber,Bing Qi; Lei-Lei Huang; Yue-Meng Chi; Li Qian; Hoi-Kwong Lo,In most implementations of quantum-key-distribution (QKD) protocols the secure keysoriginate from single-photon signals. However; due to the unavoidable channel losses andthe low efficiencies of single photon detectors; the key generation rate of a single-photonQKD system is low. Recently; there has been a growing interest in the Gaussianmodulatedcoherent state (GMCS) QKD protocol because it can be implemented with conventionallaser sources and high efficiency homodyne-detectors. Here; we present our experimentalresults with a fully fiber-based one-way GMCS QKD system. Our system employed a doubleMach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) configuration in which the weak quantum signal and thestrong local-oscillator (LO) go through the same fiber between Alice and Bob.

Measuring chromatic dispersion using single-arm interferometers: from millimeters to kilometers,Li Qian; Bing Qi; Waleed S Mohammed; Michael A Galle; Fei Ye,We present three new interferometric techniques for dispersion characterization coveringfrom millimeter waveguides to kilometers of fibers. The first is a Frequency-ShiftedInterferometer (FSI) that measures fibers from meters to tens of kilometers. The second is athree-wave Single-Arm Interferometer (SAI); where the envelope of a three-waveinterference pattern yields the second-order dispersion directly. It is suitable for fibers fromcentimeters to> 1m. The third is a Common-Path Interferometer (CPI) that measuresdispersion of millimeter-long fibers/waveguides. These techniques offer high precision intheir respective ranges; and are all" single-arm" interferometers: the two interfering beamsgo through the same arm of the interferometer. They are simple; low-cost; and more resilientto phase and polarization instabilities than conventional interferometric techniques for …,Optics and Photonics for Information Processing II,2008,1
Low-Insertion-Loss; In-Fiber; Dynamic Arbitrary Waveform Generation,Yu Yeung Kenny Ho; Li Qian,Optical Arbitrary Waveform Generation (O-AWG) is a promising technology for generatinghigh-bandwidth ana- log microwaves used in advanced radar systems and ultra-wideband communicationssystems [1]. O-AWG utilizes waveform generation and shaping in the optical domain to overcomethe speed limitation of electronics. Techniques for dynamic pulse shaping in the optical domaincan be generally divided into two categories: direct temporal shaping [2] and temporal shapingthrough spectral manipulation [3; 4]. The reported techniques; however; require coupling lightout of fiber for spectral manipulation and then coupling back into the fiber — the inherent lossis therefore high. In this paper; we demonstrate for the first time; a dynamic O-AWG system wherethe waveform shaping function can be carried out in a continuous; splice-free fiber. Our systemperforms spectral line-by-line shaping by employing uniform Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs) …,Coherent Optical Technologies and Applications,2008,1
Fabrication and Characterization of MR Elastomers with High MR Effects,K Popp; PB Kosasih; XZ Zhang; WH Li,Abstract Magnetorheological (MR) elastomers have characteristics that their modulus can becontrolled by an external magnetic field. Therefore; MR elastomers have potentialapplications in variable stiffness based devices; such as adaptive tuned vibration dynamicabsorbers. For such devices; the tuning range depends much on MR effect. So it is importantto fabricate MR elastomers with high MR effects. However; existing MR elastomers haverelatively small MR effect; which is generally less than 100%. This paper aims to fabricatenew MR elastomers with larger MR effect. To this end; four categories of MR elastomers withdifferent components are fabricated and their performances were characterized by using atest rig and also verified by simulation analysis.

Dynamics of room temperature DC-induced second-order nonlinearity in poled fiber under an external field,Jiawen Zhang; Li Qian,1. Introduction As silica glass is a centro-symmetric material; it lacks any even-ordernonlinearity. However; recent developments in poling techniques shows that second-order nonlinearity(SON) can be induced in silica by recording an internal electric field in the material[1]. This phenomenonopens doors for various new applications for silica fibers such as optical switch/modulator[2];frequency conversion[3]; and photon pair generation[4]. In order to understand the mechanismof the poling process and to achieve the optimum poling results; the time evolution of the internalSON in the fiber under poling has been characterized and studied by many researchgroups[5;6]. However; the dynamics of the internal SON in a poled fiber under the influence ofan external DC field has never been reported before; which is of significant importance for thestability study of the recorded internal field; and for further understanding of charge …,Optical Fiber communication/National Fiber Optic Engineers Conference; 2008.

Full dispersion characterization using single-arm interferometry on a mm-length fiber,W Mohammed; Michael Galle; Joachim Meier; Chris Sapiano; Li Qian; Peter W Smith,1. Introduction Full dispersion characterization on short fibers is desirable and sometimes necessarywhen designing fiber-based devices. A case in point is the thermally polled twin-hole fibers(THF) [1; 2]; which can be used for parametric frequency conversion [2] and for entangled photongeneration [4]. Typical fiber lengths used in these applications are short; on the order ofcentimeters. Accurate determination of the effective index and dispersion parameters is criticalto the design of these fiber devices in terms of determining the quasi-phase matching periodicityas well as the nonlinear interaction length. However; measurements obtained on long fibersmight be erroneous as the fibers exhibit large non-uniformity along the length due to their structureand the fabrication process. Hence; it is essential to perform dispersion measurements; locallyand nondestructively; on short fibers; before periodic polling. Though accurate effective …,Quantum Electronics and Laser Science Conference; 2007. QELS'07,2007,1
A New Approach for the Analysis of Planar Distributed Two-Dimentional (2-D) Left-Haned (Lh) Structures,Chao Li; Kaiyu Liu; Fang Li,Abstract A new approach is proposed to analyze planar distributed 2-D LH structures. The 4-port S parameters of the unit cell combined with the Bloch-Floquet theory are used todetermine the dispersion relations and Bloch impedance. The LH and RH frequency bandsare identified by the signs of the real parts of the wave number and the Bloch impedance.Several advantages of the new approach over the previous unit cell analysis methods arepresented. As an example; a capacitance-enhanced LH structure is designed and analyzedwith the new approach. FDTD simulation is also performed to study the periodic LH structurewith infinite arrays. The results of the simulation at the LH frequency band show thebackward wave properties in consistent with those obtained by the proposed approach.,International Journal of Infrared and Millimeter Waves,2007,1

Perylene Diimide as the Black-Layer Material of the OLEDs,Jiun-Haw Lee; Kai-Hsiang Chuang; Yu-Hsuan Ho; Chi-Feng Lin; Chun-Chieh Chao; Man-Kit Leung; Cheng-Yu Li; Hsuen-Li Chen,Abstract In this paper; we use a perylene diimide derivative serving as a destructive and anabsorption layer of the “black cathode” of an organic light-emitting device (OLED). A thin andsemitransparent metal between the electron transport layer and the perylene diimide is usedfor better electron injection and also serves as the destructive interference. The thickness ofsuch layer is critical since thinner metal results in lower reflectance; but higher diving voltagedue to worse electron injection. To enhance the electron injection capability; the thickness ofthe thin metal increases which in turns to increase the reflectance. Here; we used a double-metal configuration to decrease the reflectance and maintain the electron injection capabilityat the same time.,MRS Online Proceedings Library Archive,2006,1
Sagnac quantum key distribution using novel polarization-insensitive phase modulators based on frequency shift,Lei-Lei Huang; Bing Qi; Roger Mong; Li Qian; Hoi-Kwong Lo,I. INTRODUCTION Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) allows two parties (Alice and Bob) to generateand share unconditionally secure keys [1] [2] [3] [4]. BB84 [1] is the most commonly used protocolin QKD; and in fiber-based systems it is usually implemented through phase encoding; whichmeans Alice and Bob employ phase modulations and interferences to encode and decodekeys. In such systems; phase and polarization instabilities are the most significant problems encounteredin practical imple- mentations; especially for long transmissions. One effective and simple solutionis making the two interfering pulses travel through the same loop in a Sagnac configuration[5] [6] [7] [8]. Unfortunately; all reported Sagnac QKD systems are based on polarization-sensitivephase modulators; making the system susceptible to polarization and also inconvenient toadjust. For example; four polarization controllers were employed in [7]; and the …,LEOS Summer Topical Meetings; 2006 Digest of the,2006,1

The dependence of damage threshold on laserpulse width is measured by the linear relationship between the area of damage spot and thelogarithm of laser energy. The pulse duration ranges from 55 fs to 750 fs. We develop themultiple-equation model (Phys. Rev. Lett. Vol. 92; pp. 187401; 2004); in which two-photonabsorption in the conduction band is considered.

An advanced method based on FDTD to extract the indices of composite meta-material,Chao Li; Cixiang Liu; Qiang Sui; Fang Li,An advanced method was introduced to determine the negative indices of the compositemeta-material. The macroscopic configuration of meta-material simulated in FDTD was aslab of finite thickness. A genuine plane wave normally incident on the slab was simulatedby FDTD and the phase of the total field was extracted with an optimized phase extractiontechnique. The phase of the total field was verified to vary monotonously along the center ofthe slab. According to this property; the wavelength; the phase velocity and refraction indexof the electromagnetic wave in the meta-material were readily determined. As comparison toour method; the conventional method to determine refraction index with Snell's law was alsoperformed.

Versatile optical pulse shaping using a linearly chirped fibre Bragg grating and an amplitude mask,SA Neata; A Wong; L Qian; X Gu; PWE Smith,Optical pulse shaping finds many important applications in the area of ultrafast photonics.For example; in ultrafast all-optical switching; temporal shaping of the control pulses can beused to create a wide flat-top switching window with sharp rise and fall times. Such switchingwindows are more jitter-tolerant than simple Gaussian windows; and can therefore achievea lower bit-error rate. Previously reported pulse shaping methods using linearly chirpedFibre Bragg Gratings (FBGs) take advantage of the direct correspondence between thespatial distribution of the grating periods and the temporal distribution of the spectralcontents of the grating impulse response (space-to-frequency-to-time mapping). However;they have two major drawbacks: first; they are only valid for high-dispersion gratings; andtherefore are unsuitable for producing short pulses; second; due to the inherent impulse …,Photonic Applications in Devices and Communication Systems,2005,1
Erbium-doped phosphosilicate fiber amplifiers: a comparison of configurations for the optimization of noise figure and conversion efficiency,Li Qian; Ryan Bolen,Extending the amplification bandwidth of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) is one ofthe most cost-effective means of expanding the fiber transmission capacity. In conventionalaluminosilicate EDFAs; gain drops sharply beyond 1605nm. Several new or modifiederbium host materials have been used to extend the amplification band to beyond theconventional L-band; such as tellurite; bismuth-oxide; antimony silicate; P-dopedaluminosilicate; and phosphosilicate EDFAs. Although tellurite and bismuth-oxide basedEDFAs have wider bandwidths compared to that of demonstrated phosphosilicate (P-Si)EDFAs; P-Si EDFAs have been shown to provide better noise performance when the gainbandwidth is extended to 1620 nm. In addition; unlike tellurite or bismuth-oxide fibers; P-SiEDF does not exhibit increased nonlinearity or weakened reliability; compared to …,Photonic Applications in Devices and Communication Systems,2005,1

EDFA gain and noise figure measurements at filter edges using a broadband source,Sanjay Gupta; Li Qian,A variety of optical techniques; namely; the time-domain extinction (TDE) method [1;2]; and thespectral interpolation method [3]; are commonly employed for characterizing the gain and noisefigure (NF) of erbium doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA). These techniques usually employ a largearray of narrowly spaced DFB lasers for an accurate measurement across the full amplifierbandwidth. The cost of such a large number of DFB lasers is high and is further increased withthe expansion of EDFA bandwidth. Although; there are reports of NF measurement of EDFA usinga single strong saturating signal or reduced set of sources; the measurement accuracy is limitedby the presence of spectral hole-burning (SHB) which distorts the gain spectrum [4;5].Alternatively; there is a possibility of using a broadband amplified spontaneous emission(ASE) source for characterizing the EDFA.

Quantum encryption,Bing Qi; Li Qian; Hoi‐Kwong Lo,The evolution of cryptography has been propelled by the endless war between code-makersand code-breakers; among whom are some of the brightest minds in human history. Theholy grail of cryptography is to develop an absolutely secure coding scheme that is secureagainst eavesdroppers (Eves) with unlimited computational power. Surprisingly; this goalwas achieved; at least in principle; when Gilbert Vernam invented the one-time pad (OTP)encryption in 1917 [1]; which was later proved by Shannon to be absolutely secure [2]. Theencoding key used in OTP has to be completely random and secure–known only to thesender and the receiver (known as Alice and Bob; respectively). Therefore; Alice and Bobneed to preestablish the secure key they will use before encoding/decoding their messages.Although OTP is unbreakable in principle; there is a problem in applying this scheme in …,Optical and Digital Image Processing: Fundamentals and Applications,*,1
Initiating Events in Direct Cardiomyocyte Reprogramming,Kimberly Sauls; Todd M Greco; Li Wang; Meng Zou; Michelle Villasmil; Li Qian; Ileana M Cristea; Frank L Conlon,Summary Direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into cardiomyocyte-like cells (iCM) holds greatpotential for heart regeneration and disease modeling and may lead to future therapeuticapplications. Currently; application of this technology is limited by our lack of understandingof the molecular mechanisms that drive direct iCM reprogramming. Using a quantitativemass spectrometry-based proteomic approach; we identified the temporal global changes inprotein abundance that occur during initial phases of iCM reprogramming. Collectively; ourresults show systematic and temporally distinct alterations in levels of specific functionalclasses of proteins during the initiating steps of reprogramming including extracellular matrixproteins; translation factors; and chromatin-binding proteins. We have constructed proteinrelational networks associated with the initial transition of a fibroblast into an iCM. These …,Cell reports,2018,*

Demodulation method combining virtual reference interferometry and minimum mean square error for fiber-optic Fabry–Perot sensors,Xinwang Gui; Michael Anthony Galle; Li Qian; Weilong Liang; Ciming Zhou; Yiwen Ou; Dian Fan,Abstract We propose a cavity length demodulation method that combines virtual referenceinterferometry (VRI) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) algorithm for fiber-optic Fabry–Perot (FP) sensors. In contrast to the conventional demodulating method that uses fastFourier transform (FFT) for cavity length estimation; our method employs the VRI techniqueto obtain a raw cavity length; which is further refined by the MMSE algorithm. As anexperimental demonstration; a fiber-optic FP sensor based on a sapphire wafer is fabricatedfor temperature sensing. The VRI-MMSE method is employed to interrogate cavity lengths ofthe sensor under different temperatures ranging from 28 C to 1000 C. It eliminates the “modejumping” problem in the FFT-MMSE method and obtains a precision of 4.8 nm;corresponding to a temperature resolution of 2.0 C over a range of 1000 C.

Compensation-free broadband entangled photon pair sources,Changjia Chen; Eric Y Zhu; Arash Riazi; Alexey V Gladyshev; Costantino Corbari; Morten Ibsen; Peter G Kazansky; Li Qian,Quantum sources that provide broadband biphotons entangled in both polarization and time-energy degrees of freedom are a rich quantum resource that finds many applications inquantum communication; sensing; and metrology. Creating such a source while maintaininghigh entanglement quality over a broad spectral range is a challenge; which conventionallyrequires various compensation steps to erase temporal; spectral; or spatialdistinguishabilities. Here; we point out that in fact compensation is not always necessary.The key to generate broadband polarization-entangled biphotons via type-II spontaneousparametric downcoversion (SPDC) without compensation is to use nonlinear materials withsufficiently low group birefringence that the biphoton bandwidth becomes dispersion-limited.Most nonlinear crystals or waveguides cannot meet this condition; but it is easily met in …,Optics Express,2017,*

In the caseof thermal poling; the χ(2) response in femtosecond laser formed waveguide structure has beeninferred to block ion- migration effects [5]. In this paper; thermal poling was applied before andafter waveguide formation to enhance the poling field [6].

Pathological mechanisms of chronic insomnia: Evidence from neuro-electrophysiology and neuroimaging research,R Huang; W Li; L She; Z Li; W Jiang,Abstract As a widely recognized public health problem as well as prevalent and challengingto modern society; chronic insomnia is involved in wide brain areas (such as prefrontalcortex; anterior cingulate cortex; amygdala; hippocampus; and thalamus) and emotion-cognition neuro-circuit. It is closely related to the conditioned hyperarousal and theincreased information process and/or the impaired inhibitory ability to withdraw fromawaking state. Thus; some specific abnormal mode may exist in the emotion-cognitioncircuit; which is associated with abnormal cognition load; such as repeatedretrieval/intrusion of aversive memories during night.

Impact of Heterogeneous Beliefs and Shortsale Constraints on Security Issuance Decision,Feng XU; An-gang HU; Nan GUO,By relaxing the explicit assumption that short selling is forbidden; a model is presented inthis paper to analyzes how heterogeneous beliefs stemming from investors' overconfidenceand short sale constraints jointly affect a firm's security issuance decision. The main findingsare:(1) an increase in heterogeneity in investors' beliefs results in an increased likelihood ofequity issuance over debt when public signal about the project's payoff is favorable;whereas it results in a reduced likelihood when public signal is modestly adverse.(2) thetightness of short sale constraints has a positive effect on the likelihood of equity issuanceonly when public signal is highly favorable. These results indicate that the relations betweenheterogeneous beliefs as well as short sale constraints and security issuance decision areinfluenced by public signal.,Chinese Journal of Management Science,2013,*

Dual labeling of figural elements in primary visual cortex,Minggui Chen; Charles Gilbert; Wu Li,[摘要]: According to the" labeled line" theory in sensory processing; different neurons in theprimary visual cortex (V1) register different local stimulus features; on the other hand; V1neuronal responses can be affected by global stimulus context. Contextual influences in V1have been interpreted to play diverse roles in mediating various center-surroundinteractions; but it is unclear whether the V1 signals conveying figural information defined bydifferent stimulus contexts share similar properties. By examining the response properties ofV1 neurons in monkeys detecting different forms of targets within complex backgrounds; wefound that V1 plays a double role in stimulus labeling: registering the local stimulusattributes and marking the local elements within the global context as belonging either to thefigure or to the background.

Analysis of the effects and causes of numerical error in four-wave mixing simulations,Christopher A Sapiano; J Stewart Aitchison; Li Qian,We present an investigation of accumulated numerical error in the simulation of four-wavemixing; which is frequently used to model a variety of nonlinear optical devices. TheDormand-Prince method (commonly used by commercial solving software such as MATLAB)has been found to be susceptible to numerical error; which manifests itself in a 3.8%increase in the total power over 200 m of nonlinear interaction length. This numerical errorcan lead to qualitatively mistaken physical interpretations of simulation results; which aresimilar to those found in previously published materials. We use a home-built Adams-Bashforth solver to simulate four-wave mixing; which produces results that do not lead tounphysical results; even for simulation over a large nonlinear interaction length.

MicroRNA-24 Prevents Apoptosis and Preserves Cardiac Function after Myocardial Infarction Through Cell-Autonomous Effects in Cardiomyocytes,Li Qian; Linda W Van Laake; Yu Huang; Deepak Srivastava,Background Apoptosis due to myocardial infarction (MI) leads to an irreversible loss ofcardiomyocytes. MicroRNAs may influence this process by post-transcriptionally regulatingthe expression of proteins involved in apoptotic pathways. We have previously shown thatexogenous application of miR-24 after coronary artery ligation in mice preserves cardiacfunction by repressing the pro-apoptotic protein Bim. Here; we investigate whether miR-24delivered by local injection exerts its effects primarily within cardiomyocytes or non-cellautonomously through neighboring cells. Methods We genetically targeted miR-24 undercontrol of the cardiac-specific Myh6 promoter; and selected a line of transgenic mice (αMHC-miR-24 mice) with six fold greater expression of miR-24 than control littermates.

The DC-induced process was QPM due to the fact that all experimentalrealizations of DC-induced SONs have occurred in fiber with an on-off QPM structure.

Enhanced Optical Parametric Gain by Cascading Periodically Poled Fiber Segments,Lijun Zhang; Li Qian,2. Results Based on the approach detailed in [4]; we build a numeric model for second-ordernonlinear interaction between three nondegenerate fundamental fiber modes; pump; signal;and idler; propagating along a cascade of QPM PPSF segments with an on-off second-ordernonlinearity; representative of PPSFs fabricated by periodic erasure [3]. Because controllingthe segment separation to an accuracy of less than the optical wavelength is impractical; therelative phase between the three waves entering the segments (other than the first one) is randomover [-π;π]. This leads to a probabilistic output. For comparison; we calculate the probability densityfunction (pdf) of the parametric gain for 10 cascaded PPSF segments (G10) with: (a) no idlerfiltering; (b) 100% idler filtering; and (c) 90% idler filtering in between the segments.

Despite this improvement; asignificant proportion of patients do not respond and the prognosis for patients with ER-/PR-/ERBB2-disease failing to achieve a pCR remains particularly poor. Identification of suchpatients in a reliable manner is the first step towards determining who might benefit fromalternative treatment regimens within clinical trials. We previously reported an RNAinterference screen in 3 cancer cell lines; including an ER-/PR-/ERBB2-breast cancer cellline; identifying genes involved in mitosis or ceramide metabolism that influenced sensitivityto paclitaxel. Our goal was to evaluate these genes as a predictor of pCR to paclitaxelcombination chemotherapy in ER-/PR-/ERBB2-breast cancer. Methods: We derived a …,Journal of Clinical Oncology,2010,*
Enhanced nonlinear generation in DC-induced three wave mixing versus four wave mixing,Christopher A Sapiano; J Stewart Aitchison; Li Qian,2. Results and Discussion Both FWM and DC-induced TWM processes were modeled in a fiberwith a mode-field diameter of 10.2μm and the dispersion properties of fused silica as providedin [5]. In order to understand the effects of this growth term enhancement on DC-inducedTWM; a mid-infrared generation process was modeled in which an idler beam with roughly 2μmwavelength would be generated. For the sake of simplicity in this preliminary investigation;phase- matching was assumed to be perfect for both processes. The DC-induced TWM processwas modeled with a 0.125V/µm frozen-in DC field which is equivalent to an effective SON of0.045pm/V; well within the range of typical values for periodically poled fiber. This process involveda pump at 875nm with 1kW peak power and a signal at 1550nm with 100mW peak power.

Difference between Doppler Frequency and Azimuth Frequency and Its Influence on the Azimuth Resolution of Spaceborne SAR,Shu LI; Xiao-lin ZHAO; Feng LI,This paper compared the Doppler frequency and azimuth frequency in detail during theresearching of a representative bistatic SAR imaging theory and found that using Dopplerfrequency instead of azimuth frequency in the general SAR processing with traditionalimaging algorithms has little influence on the azimuth resolution of the fine imaging; the erroris less than 4%. But if the differences between the two frequencies are neglected in thecondition of larger squint angle; bigger transmit signal chirp rate; and longer wave length;the azimuth resolution error may reach as much as 10% even 27%. So; whether Dopplerfrequency can be used instead of azimuth frequency depends on the SAR systems withdifferent specific parameters and the different requirements in specific imaging precision.,Journal of Air Force Engineering University (Natural Science Edition),2009,*

In this paper we present the work of the beam shaping in 1.0 μm wavelength regionto make it compatible to Yb-doped high power fiber laser. The device uses a long-periodgrating to couple a portion of core-mode; LP 01 into a low-order m th-radial cladding modeLP 0m. Interference of the two modes could reduce field at the centre and enhance the fieldin the first or second ring of the cladding mode to transform the Gaussian-shaped laserbeam to an intensity uniform beam.

Dual detectors scheme in practical quantum key distribution systems,B Qi; Y Zhao; X Ma; H-K Lo; L Qian,A practical quantum key distribution (QKD) system has imperfections; which will contribute toquantum bit error rate (QBER) even in the absence of Eve. One important error source is thenoise of the receiver's detector; for example; the dark count probability of a single photondetector (SPD) or the" excess noise" of a homodyne detector. The maximum secure distanceof a QKD system is limited by the detector's noise; while the secure key rate is proportional tothe operating rate of the detector. An ideal detector should be fast and noiseless.Unfortunately; there is a fundamental trade-off between speed and noise. To overcome thelimitation imposed by the speed-noise trade-off; we propose a" dual detectors" method toimprove the performance of a practical QKD system based on realistic detectors. In thisscheme; Bob has two detectors: one is fast but noisy; while the other one is quiet but slow …,International Quantum Electronics Conference,2007,*

Quantum key distribution with``dual detectors,Xiongfeng Ma; Bing Qi; Yi Zhao; Hoi-Kwong Lo; Li Qian,Abstract To improve the performance of a quantum key distribution (QKD) system; highspeed; low dark count single photon detectors (or low noise homodyne detectors) arerequired. However; in practice; a fast detector usually is noisy. Here; we propose a``dualdetectors" method to improve the performance of a practical QKD system with realisticdetectors: the legitimate receiver randomly uses either a fast (but noisy) detector or a quiet(but slow) detector to measure the incoming quantum signals. The measurement resultsfrom the quiet detector can be used to bound eavesdropper's information; while themeasurement results from the fast detector are used to generate secure key. We apply thisidea into various QKD protocols.

Fiber Grating Sensor Array Interrogation Using a Frequency-Shifted Interferometer and Fourier Analysis,Yu Liu; Li Qian; Bing Qi; Xijia Gu,1. Introduction Fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) sensors have been widely used for monitoringstrain; vibration; temperature; pressure; etc. [1]. Traditional grating interrogation techniques includewavelength- and time-division multiplexing (WDM and TDM); or a combination of both [2]. Thoughthese are well-established techniques; their limitations are also well recognized: The WDM techniquelimits the number of sensors in an array; as each sensor is allocated a distinct wavelengthrange; the TDM technique requires narrow pulses and high-speed time measurements. Themaximum number of sensors is limited by SNR due to the large bandwidth of the narrowpulse; resulting in weak reflection from narrow-band gratings. Recently; many new grating interrogationtechniques have been proposed [3-7]. Among these; the frequency-modulated continuous wave(FMCW) method [6] and the synthesis of optical coherence function (SOCF) method [7] …,Coherent Optical Technologies and Applications,2006,*
Quantum cloning with a broadband optical amplifier,Bing Qi; Li Qian; Hoi-Kwong Lo,1. Introduction A well-known principle in quantum mechanics is the quantum no-cloning theorem[1]: Perfect cloning of an unknown quantum state is strictly forbidden. This no-cloning theoremhas a fundamental impact in the area of quantum information. Non-perfect cloning; on the otherhand; is allowed by quantum mechanics. The ultimate performance of a quantum cloning machine(QCM) has been extensively studied theoretically [2-4]. One special case is the so-called universalQCM (UQCM); whose performance is independent of the input quantum state. An N→M UQCMproduces M output quanta from N identical input quanta; which are in a pure state. Its fidelity;defined as the overlap between the output state and the initial input state; has been proved tohave the following upper limit [3-4] … )]2 ( /[) ( + + + = → N M N M MN F Opt M N …Therefore; for 1→2 cloning; the maximum fidelity is 5/6; while the fidelity of a random …,Optical Amplifiers and Their Applications,2006,*
Interrogation of multiplexed fiber grating sensors using frequency-shifted interferometer,Yu Liu; Li Qian; Bing Qi; Hoi-Kwong Lo; Xijia Gu,1. Introduction Fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) have been pursued as sensor elements for measurementsincluding strain; vibration; temperature; pressure; and composite material cure and response[1; 2]. Conventional methods address grating sensors in an array by wavelength- or time-divisionmultiplexing; or a combination of both [3-5]. Time-division multiplexing requires short pulse andfast time gating; making the system more costly. On the other hand; wavelength multiplexinglimits the sensing dynamic range and the number of sensor elements due to limited availablebandwidth. For example; for a 40 nm spectral region with 4 nm channel spacing; only 10 sensorelements could be implemented to avoid the spectral overlap; which greatly restricts gratingsin distributed sensing applications. For a grating based distributed sensing; achieving both alarge dynamic sensing range and a large number of sensor elements is still challenging …,Quantum Electronics and Laser Science Conference,2006,*

Experimental quantum key distribution with decoy states,Hoi-Kwong Lo; Yi Zhao; Bing Qi; Xiongfeng Ma; Li Qian,To increase dramatically the distance and the secure key generation rate of quantum keydistribution (QKD); the idea of quantum decoys—signals of different intensities—has recentlybeen proposed.

Ultrafast all-optical switching based on indium gallium arsenic phosphide grown by helium plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy,Li Qian,Abstract We present the first experimental study of the optical properties of HELP InGaAsP(InGaAsP grown by He-plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy) relevant to all-opticalswitching; and the first demonstration of picosecond switching using this material. Weobserved an optical response time of 15 ps; a nonlinear index change as large as 0.077; asharp absorption band edge; and a small absorption tail in HELP InGaAsP. The uniquecoexistence of ultrafast response; large interband nonlinearity; and small band-tailabsorption; never before reported; makes HELP InGaAsP particularly suitable for ultrafast all-optical switching. Additionally; faster response (subpicosecond) was achieved by doping thematerial with beryllium; and moderate doping (up to~ 10 18 cm-3) did not significantly alterthe absorption edge.

Mode-locking of a femtosecond Cr: forsterite laser with negative nonlinear phase shifts generated by/spl chi//sup (2):/spl chi//sup (2)/cascading,X Liu; LJ Qian; FW Wise,Summary form only given. Recently; there has been a resurgence of interest in the effectivethird-order nonlinearity that arises from the cascading of/spl xi//sup (2)/processes.Applications of the cascade nonlinearity include the mode-locking of lasers; and this hasbeen proposed and demonstrated with picosecond pulses. Previous workers noted that thephase shift produced by the cascade process is modulated significantly owing to group-velocity mismatch and saturation. Here we show that undistorted frequency chirps can beproduced in the cascade process; and describe the first KLM laser operating with an overallnegative nonlinear phase shift.,Lasers and Electro-Optics; 1999.

The monolayer of one subline; TC-1-C-3;directly supported the growth of nonadherent marrow cells in Dexter culture system for eightweeks. We report here the mechanism of the stromal cell effect on hemopoiesis in a long-term bone marrow culture system. When the hemopoietic blasts attach to the TC-1-C-3 cells;they are surrounded by the stromal cell cytoplasm within two hours and develop into cellclusters in a week. The developing hemopoietic cells show cell differentiation towards thegranulocytic lineage. A key function of the epithelioid stromal cell; then; is to providea'niche'or'envelope'for stem cells which supports long-term hemopoiesis in the Dexterculture system.,Proceedings of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and the Peking Union Medical College= Chung-kuo i hsueh k'o hsueh yuan; Chung-kuo hsieh ho i k'o ta hsueh hsueh pao,1989,*

A Loss of Function Screen of Epigenetic Modifiers and Splicing Factors during Early Stage of Cardiac Reprogramming,Yang Zhou; Sahar Alimohamadi; Li Wang; Ziqing Liu; Joseph B Wall; Chaoying Yin; Jiandong Liu; Li Qian; Li Qian,Abstract Direct reprogramming of cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) to induced cardiomyocytes(iCMs) is a newly emerged promising approach for cardiac regeneration; disease modelingand drug discovery. However; its potential has been drastically limited due to the lowreprogramming efficiency and largely unknown underlying molecular mechanisms. We havepreviously screened and identified epigenetic factors related to histone modification duringiCM reprogramming. Here; we used shRNAs targeting an additional battery of epigeneticfactors involved in chromatin remodeling and RNA splicing factors to further identifyinhibitors and facilitators of direct cardiac reprogramming. Knockdown of RNA splicingfactors Sf3a1 or Sf3b1 significantly reduced the percentage and total number of cardiacmarker positive iCMs accompanied with generally repressed gene expression.

Studies of Multi-layer Self-organized Quantum Dots Used as Gain materials Emitting Near 1.3µm,XQ Meng; B Xu; P Jin; XL Ye; ZY Zhang; CM Li; ZG Wang,Abstract Self-organized InAs quantum dots (QDs) have been fabricated by molecular beamepitaxy and characterized by photoluminescence (PL). At room temperature; the PL intensityof multi-layer QDs is less than that of the single layer QDs; which is due to defects in multi-layer sample acting as nonradiative centers. With the increasing number of QD layers; alllevels of QDs blueshift and the FWHMs become large; and intersublevel transition energybecomes small. The blueshift is caused by the interdiffusion and intermixing of In and Gaatoms. The wide size distribution of multi-layer QDs would broaden the FWHM of PL peaks.The GaAs spacer growth temperature of 5200C equaling to the growth temperature of dots isin favour of restraining the interdiffusion of Ga and In atoms and improving the opticalquality. At the spacers' growth temperature of 5200C; we have prepared the 5 layer QDs …,*,*,*

COINCIDENCE DETECTION WITH FREE-RUNNING ID220 DETECTORS APPLICATION NOTE,Eric Zhu; Li Qian,Recent progress in near-IR avalanche-photodiode (APD)-based single-photon detectors(SPD) have allowed for free-running operation [1]. The previous generation of telecom-bandAPD-SPDs needed to be gated to suppress the dark count of the detectors; resulting in lowduty cycles. In gated single-photon detection; an external trigger is used as the gating signaland the light source detected must be pulsed to allow for effective (synchronous) detection.The issues with gated SPDs are compounded when coincidence measurement (thedetection of two or more time-correlated photons) is required. In the case of detecting aphoton pair with two gated SPDs; not only must both SPDs be synchronously triggered; butone must also be able to vary the time-delay between the two trigger signals at a resolutionthat is smaller than the gate width of the SPDs. This is so that the light pulse from the …,*,*,*
Linear and Quadratic Dispersion Characterization of mm-length Fibers and Waveguides Using Common-path Interferometry,W Mohammed; J Meier; M Galle; L Qian; JS Aitchison; PWE Smith,Method The essential element of this technique; which employs a simple Fabry-Pérotinterferometer; is to rely on the highly precise measurement of the linear dispersion so thathigher order dispersion parameters can be extracted accurately. The experimental setup(Fig. 1) consists of a broadband source; a circulator; and the cleaved sample under test(fiber or waveguide). Light from the broadband source is launched into the sample throughthe circulator and an angle-cleaved connector; which eliminates the reflection from theconnector-air interface. The Fabry-Pérot interference fringe pattern produced by multiplereflections from both facets of the sample is recorded on the optical spectrum analyzer(OSA). In order to extract from the fringe pattern as accurately as possible the lineardispersion parameter; β′; defined as the first derivative of the propagation constant with …,*,*,*
