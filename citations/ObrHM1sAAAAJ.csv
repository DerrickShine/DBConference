One step green synthesis of silver nano/microparticles using extracts of Trachyspermum ammi and Papaver somniferum,K Vijayaraghavan; SP Kamala Nalini; N Udaya Prakash; D Madhankumar,Abstract A novel biosynthesis route for silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) was attempted in thispresent investigation using aqueous extracts of Trachyspermum ammi and Papaversomniferum. The main constituents in T. ammi are thymol; p-cymene and γ-terpinene; whileP. somniferum consists of morphine and codeine. The essential oil in T. ammi was found tobe a good reducing agent than the alkaloids present in P. somniferum for the formation ofbiocompatible Ag-NPs. The effectiveness of both the extracts was investigated by usingsame dosage of extract in the synthesis of silver nanoparticle. The results showed that forthe same dosage of extracts the T. ammi synthesized various size triangular shapednanoparticles measuring from 87 nm; to a fewer nanoparticles having a size of 998 nmdiagonally.

Nanoparticles as antimicrobials: Evaluation method,NK Udaya Prakash; N Sripriya; S Bhuvaneswari,Nanotechnology; emerging as a cutting-edge technology of recent times; has profoundapplications in all disciplines; tailoring from electrical and electronic appliances to targeteddrug delivery systems. This exploration has arisen mainly due to the size and accuracy ofthe nanoparticles. The impact of nanoparticles at workplaces has already been reviewed [1].Nanoparticles of different metals from different sources are being studied worldwide. Thephysical and chemical methods employed for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles are costlyand involve chemicals; which make them unfavorable methods. However; the biologicalapproach; involving microbes and plants; overcomes the obstacles posed by other methods.Plants are generally preferred; due to the fact that they are easily available and are non-toxic.

Mycometric Investigation of Carpets in Commercial Centres of Chennai; India,S Bhuvaneswari; N Abdul Azeez; S Aditya; B Sai Manohar; R Gurusamy; NK Udaya Prakash,Abstract: Exposure to indoor fungi is found to cause many diseases depending on theircomposition; the immunological reactivity of the exposed individuals; mode of exposure andthe circumstances of exposure. This causes a wide range of diseases through infection andalso through non-infectious and often immunological mechanisms. They are also significantfrom the point of their clinical importance ie their potency to serve as an agent of pathogenand/or toxigen as well as allergen. The distribution; their presence; and their quality dependupon the source available within indoor.
