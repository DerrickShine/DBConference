Variational characterization of the critical curve for pinning of random polymers,Dimitris Cheliotis; Frank den Hollander,Abstract In this paper we look at the pinning of a directed polymer by a one-dimensionallinear interface carrying random charges. There are two phases; localized and delocalized;depending on the inverse temperature and on the disorder bias. Using quenched andannealed large deviation principles for the empirical process of words drawn from a randomletter sequence according to a random renewal process [Birkner; Greven and denHollander; Probab. Theory Related Fields 148 (2010) 403–456]; we derive variationalformulas for the quenched; respectively; annealed critical curve separating the two phases.These variational formulas are used to obtain a necessary and sufficient criterion; stated interms of relative entropies; for the two critical curves to be different at a given inversetemperature; a property referred to as relevance of the disorder. This criterion in turn is …,The Annals of Probability,2013,25
One-dimensional diffusion in an asymmetric random environment,Dimitrios Cheliotis,Abstract According to a theorem of S. Schumacher; for a diffusion X in an environmentdetermined by a stable process that belongs to an appropriate class and has index a; itholds that X t/(log t) a converges in distribution as t→∞ to a random variable having anexplicit description in terms of the environment. We compute the density of this randomvariable in the case the stable process is spectrally one-sided. This computation extends aresult of H. Kesten and quantifies the bias that the asymmetry of the environment causes tothe behavior of the diffusion.,Annales de l'Institut Henri Poincare (B) Probability and Statistics,2006,16
Triangular random matrices and biorthogonal ensembles,Dimitris Cheliotis,Abstract: We study the singular values of certain triangular random matrices. When theirelements are iid standard complex Gaussian random variables; the squares of the singularvalues form a biorthogonal ensemble; and with an appropriate change in the distribution ofthe diagonal elements; they give the biorthogonal Laguerre ensemble. For triangular Wignermatrices; we give alternative proofs for the convergence of the empirical distribution of theappropriately scaled squares of the singular eigenvalues to a distribution with support $[0; e]$; as well as for the almost sure convergence of the rescaled largest singular eigenvalue to$\sqrt {e} $ under the additional assumption of mean zero and finite fourth moment for thelaw of the matrix elements.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1404.4730,2014,13
Localization of favorite points for diffusion in a random environment,Dimitris Cheliotis,Abstract For a diffusion X t in a one-dimensional Wiener medium W; it is known that there isa certain process (br (W)) r≥ 0 that depends only on the environment; so that X t− b log t (W)converges in distribution as t→∞. The paths of b are step functions. Denote by FX (t) thepoint with the most local time for the diffusion at time t. We prove that; modulo a relativelysmall time change; the paths of the processes (br (W)) r≥ 0;(FX (er)) r≥ 0 are close aftersome large r.,Stochastic Processes and their Applications,2008,13
Diffusion in random environment and the renewal theorem,Dimitrios Cheliotis,Abstract According to a theorem of Schumacher and Brox; for a diffusion X in a Brownianenvironment; it holds that (X t− b logt)/log 2 t→ 0 in probability; as t→∞; where b is astochastic process having an explicit description and depending only on the environment.We compute the distribution of the number of sign changes for b on an interval [1; x] andstudy some of the consequences of the computation; in particular; we get the probability of bkeeping the same sign on that interval. These results have been announced in 1999 in anonrigorous paper by Le Doussal; Monthus and Fisher [Phys. Rev. E 59 (1999) 4795–4840]and were treated with a Renormalization Group analysis. We prove that this analysis can bemade rigorous using a path decomposition for the Brownian environment and renewaltheory. Finally; we comment on the information these results give about the behavior of …,The Annals of Probability,2005,13
Efficient computation of popular phylogenetic tree measures,Constantinos Tsirogiannis; Brody Sandel; Dimitris Cheliotis,Abstract Given a phylogenetic tree T of n nodes; and a sample R of its tips (leaf nodes) avery common problem in ecological and evolutionary research is to evaluate a distancemeasure for the elements in R. Two of the most common measures of this kind are the MeanPairwise Distance (MPD) and the Phylogenetic Diversity (PD). In many applications; it isoften necessary to compute the expectation and standard deviation of one of thesemeasures over all subsets of tips of T that have a certain size. Unfortunately; existingmethods to calculate the expectation and deviation of these measures are inexact andinefficient. We present analytical expressions that lead to efficient algorithms for computingthe expectation and the standard deviation of the MPD and the PD. More specifically; ourmain contributions are: 1 We present efficient algorithms for computing the expectation …,International Workshop on Algorithms in Bioinformatics,2012,11

Patterns in Sinai’s walk,Dimitris Cheliotis; Bálint Virág,Abstract Sinai's random walk in random environment shows interesting patterns on theexponential time scale. We characterize the patterns that appear on infinitely many timescales after appropriate rescaling (a functional law of iterated logarithm). The curious ratefunction captures the difference between one-sided and two-sided behavior.,The Annals of Probability,2013,5
The spectrum of the random environment and localization of noise,Dimitris Cheliotis; Bálint Virág,Abstract We consider random walk on a mildly random environment on finite transitive d-regular graphs of increasing girth. After scaling and centering; the analytic spectrum of thetransition matrix converges in distribution to a Gaussian noise. An interesting phenomenonoccurs at d= 2: as the limit graph changes from a regular tree to the integers; the noisebecomes localized. The graphs of the noise covariance structure for d= 4; 3; 2.1 from above.,Probability theory and related fields,2010,3
Exact speed and transmission cost in a simple one-dimensional wireless delay-tolerant network,D Cheliotis; I Kontoyiannis; M Loulakis; S Toumpis,We study a simple one-dimensional; discrete-time network model that consists of two nodesmoving on a discrete circle; changing their direction of movement randomly; and a singlepacket travelling in the clockwise direction; using combinations of transmissions betweenthe two nodes (when they are co-located) and physical transports on their buffers. In thissetting; we provide exact; explicit expressions for the long-term averages of the packetspeed and the wireless transmission cost. Our work is a first step towards providing simpleand exact results for more realistic wireless delay-tolerant network models.,Information Theory (ISIT); 2017 IEEE International Symposium on,2017,2

A note on recurrent random walks,Dimitrios Cheliotis,Abstract For any recurrent random walk (S n) n⩾ 1 on R; there are increasing sequences(gn) n⩾ 1 converging to infinity for which (gn S n) n⩾ 1 has at least one finite accumulationpoint. For one class of random walks; we give a criterion on (gn) n⩾ 1 and the distribution ofS 1 determining the set of accumulation points for (gn S n) n⩾ 1. This extends; with a simplerproof; a result of Chung and Erdös. Finally; for recurrent; symmetric random walks; we give acriterion characterizing the increasing sequences (gn) n⩾ 1 of positive numbers for whichlim ̲ gn| S n|= 0.,Statistics & probability letters,2006,2

The random pinning model with correlated disorder given by a renewal set,Dimitris Cheliotis; Yuki Chino; Julien Poisat,Abstract: We investigate the effect of correlated disorder on the localization transitionundergone by a renewal sequence with loop exponent $\alpha> 0$; when the correlatedsequence is given by another independent renewal set with loop exponent $\hat\alpha> 0$.Using the renewal structure of the disorder sequence; we compute the annealed criticalpoint and exponent. Then; using a smoothing inequality for the quenched free energy andsecond moment estimates for the quenched partition function; combined with decouplinginequalities; we prove that in the case $\hat\alpha> 2$(summable correlations); disorder isirrelevant if $\alpha< 1/2$ and relevant if $\alpha> 1/2$; which extends the Harris criterion forindependent disorder. The case $\hat\alpha\in (1; 2) $(non-summable correlations) remainslargely open; but we are able to prove that disorder is relevant for $\alpha> 1/\hat\alpha …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.06899,2017,*
Estimates for Bellman functions related to dyadic-like maximal operators on weighted spaces,Antonios D Melas; Eleftherios N Nikolidakis; Dimitrios Cheliotis,Abstract: We provide some new estimates for Bellman type functions for the dyadic maximalopeator on $ R^ n $ and of maximal operators on martingales related to weighted spaces.Using a type of symmetrization principle; introduced for the dyadic maximal operator inearlier works of the authors we introduce certain conditions on the weight that imply estimatefor the maximal operator on the corresponding weighted space.

Metastable states in Brownian energy landscape,Dimitris Cheliotis,Abstract. Random walks and diffusions in symmetric random environment are known toexhibit metastable behavior: they tend to stay for long times in wells of the environment. Forthe case that the environment is a one-dimensional two-sided standard Brownian motion;we study the process of depths of the consecutive wells of increasing depth that the motionvisits. When these depths are looked in logarithmic scale; they form a stationary renewalcluster process. We give a description of the structure of this process and derive from it thealmost sure limit behavior and the fluctuations of the empirical density of the process.Résumé. Il est bien connu que les marches aléatoires et les diffusions dans unenvironnement symétrique aléatoire ont un comportement métastable: elles tendent à resterlongtemps dans les puits de l'environnement.
