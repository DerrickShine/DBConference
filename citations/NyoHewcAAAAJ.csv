Simulating the evolution of language,Angelo Cangelosi; Domenico Parisi,This book is the first to provide a comprehensive survey of the computational models andmethodologies used for studying the evolution and origin of language and communication.Comprising contributions from the most influential figures in the field; it presents andsummarises the state-of-the-art in computational approaches to language evolution; andhighlights new lines of development. Essential reading for researchers and students in thefields of evolutionary and adaptive systems; language evolution modelling and linguistics; itwill also be of interest to researchers working on applications of neural networks tolanguage problems. Furthermore; due to the fact that language evolution models use multi-agent methodologies; it will also be of great interest to computer scientists working on multi-agent systems; robotics and internet agents.,*,2012,473
The emergence of a'language'in an evolving population of neural networks,Angelo Cangelosi; Domenico Parisi,The evolution of language implies the parallel evolution of an ability to respondappropriately to signals (language understanding) and an ability to produce the appropriatesignals in the appropriate circumstances (language production). When linguistic signals areproduced to inform other individuals; individuals that respond appropriately to these signalsmay increase their reproductive chances but it is less clear what the reproductive advantageis for the language producers. We present simulations in which populations of neuralnetworks living in an environment evolve a simple language with an informative function.Signals are produced to help other individuals categorize edible and poisonousmushrooms; in order to decide whether to approach or avoid encountered mushrooms.Language production; while not under direct evolutionary pressure; evolves as a …,Connection Science,1998,287
The adaptive advantage of symbolic theft over sensorimotor toil: Grounding language in perceptual categories,Angelo Cangelosi; Stevan Harnad,Using neural nets to simulate learning and the genetic algorithm to simulate evolution in atoy world of mushrooms and mushroom-foragers; we place two ways of acquiring categoriesinto direct competition with one another: In (1)" sensorimotor toil;" new categories areacquired through real-time; feedback-corrected; trial and error experience in sorting them. In(2)" symbolic theft;" new categories are acquired by hearsay from propositions-booleancombinations of symbols describing them. In competition; symbolic theft always beatssensorimotor toil. We hypothesize that this is the basis of the adaptive advantage oflanguage. Entry-level categories must still be learned by toil; however; to avoid an infiniteregress (the" symbol grounding problem"). Changes in the internal representations ofcategories must take place during the course of learning by toil. These changes can be …,Evolution of communication,2001,270
Cell division and migration in a ‘genotype’for neural networks,Angelo Cangelosi; Domenico Parisi; Stefano Nolfi,Much research has recently been dedicated to applying genetic algorithms to populations ofneural networks. However. While in real organisms the inherited genotype maps in complexways into the resulting phenotype; in most of this research the development process thatcreates the individual phenotype is ignored. In this paper we present a model of neuraldevelopment which includes cell division and cell migration in addition to axonal growth andbranching. This reflects; in a very simplified way; what happens in the ontogeny of realorganisms. The development process of our artificial organisms shows successive phases offunctional differentiation and specialization. In addition; we find that mutations that affectdifferent phases of development have very different evolutionary consequences. A singlechange in the early stages of cell division and migration can have huge effects on the …,Network: computation in neural systems,1994,194
The mechanics of embodiment: A dialog on embodiment and computational modeling,Giovanni Pezzulo; Lawrence W Barsalou; Angelo Cangelosi; Martin H Fischer; Michael Spivey; Ken McRae,Embodied theories are increasingly challenging traditional views of cognition by arguingthat conceptual representations that constitute our knowledge are grounded in sensory andmotor experiences; and processed at this sensorimotor level; rather than being representedand processed abstractly in an amodal conceptual system. Given the established empiricalfoundation; and the relatively underspecified theories to date; many researchers areextremely interested in embodied cognition but are clamouring for more mechanisticimplementations. What is needed at this stage is a push toward explicit computationalmodels that implement sensory-motor grounding as intrinsic to cognitive processes. In thisarticle; six authors from varying backgrounds and approaches address issues concerningthe construction of embodied computational models; and illustrate what they view as the …,Frontiers in psychology,2011,188

An embodied model for sensorimotor grounding and grounding transfer: Experiments with epigenetic robots,Angelo Cangelosi; Thomas Riga,Abstract The grounding of symbols in computational models of linguistic abilities is one ofthe fundamental properties of psychologically plausible cognitive models. In this article; wepresent an embodied model for the grounding of language in action based on epigeneticrobots. Epigenetic robotics is one of the new cognitive modeling approaches to modelingautonomous mental development. The robot model is based on an integrative vision oflanguage in which linguistic abilities are strictly dependent on and grounded in otherbehaviors and skills. It uses simulated robots that learn through imitation the names of basicactions. Robots also learn higher order action concepts through the process of groundingtransfer. The simulation demonstrates how new; higher order behavioral abilities can beautonomously built on previously grounded basic action categories following linguistic …,Cognitive science,2006,166

This in turn will benefit the design ofcognitive robots capable of learning to handle and manipulate objects and toolsautonomously; to cooperate and communicate with other robots and humans; and to adapttheir abilities to changing internal; environmental; and social conditions. Four key areas ofresearch challenges are discussed; specifically for the issues related to the understandingof: 1) how agents learn and represent compositional actions; 2) how agents learn andrepresent compositional lexica; 3) the dynamics of social interaction and learning; and 4)how compositional action and language representations are integrated to bootstrap the …,IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development,2010,160
Developmental robotics: From babies to robots,Angelo Cangelosi; Matthew Schlesinger; Linda B Smith,Developmental robotics is a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach to robotics that isdirectly inspired by the developmental principles and mechanisms observed in children'scognitive development. It builds on the idea that the robot; using a set of intrinsicdevelopmental principles regulating the real-time interaction of its body; brain; andenvironment; can autonomously acquire an increasingly complex set of sensorimotor andmental capabilities. This volume; drawing on insights from psychology; computer science;linguistics; neuroscience; and robotics; offers the first comprehensive overview of a rapidlygrowing field. After providing some essential background information on robotics anddevelopmental psychology; the book looks in detail at how developmental robotics modelsand experiments have attempted to realize a range of behavioral and cognitive …,*,2015,158
Evolution of communication and language using signals; symbols; and words,Angelo Cangelosi,This paper describes different types of models for the evolution of communication andlanguage. It uses the distinction between signals; symbols; and words for the analysis ofevolutionary models of language. In particular; it shows how evolutionary computationtechniques such as artificial life can be used to study the emergence of syntax and symbolsfrom simple communication signals. Initially; a computational model that evolves repertoiresof isolated signal is presented. This study has simulated the emergence of signals fornaming foods in a population of foragers. This type of model studies communication systemsbased on simple signal-object associations. Subsequently; models that study theemergence of grounded symbols are discussed in general; including a detailed descriptionof a work on the evolution of simple syntactic rules. This model focuses on the emergence …,IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation,2001,157
From robotic toil to symbolic theft: Grounding transfer from entry-level to higher-level categories1,Angelo Cangelosi; Alberto Greco; Stevan Harnad,A bstract. Neural network models of categorical perception (compression of withincategorysimilarity and dilation of between-category differences) are applied to the symbol-groundingproblem (of how to connect symbols with meanings) by connecting analogue sensorimotorprojections to arbitrary symbolic representations via learned category-invariance detectorsin a hybrid symbolic/non-symbolic system. Our nets are trained to categorize and name 5050 pixel images (eg circles; ellipses; squares and rectangles) projected on to the receptive field of a 7 7 retina. They fi rst learn to do prototype matching and then entry-level naming forthe four kinds of stimuli; grounding their names directly in the input patterns via hidden-unitrepresentations ('sensorimotor toil'). We show that a higher-level categorization (eg'symmetric'versus 'asymmetric') can be learned in two very different ways: either (1) …,Connection Science,2000,153
Computational grounded cognition: a new alliance between grounded cognition and computational modeling,Giovanni Pezzulo; Lawrence W Barsalou; Angelo Cangelosi; Martin H Fischer; Ken McRae; Michael Spivey,Grounded theories assume that there is no central module for cognition. According to thisview; all cognitive phenomena; including those considered the province of amodal cognitionsuch as reasoning; numeric and language processing; are ultimately grounded in (andemerge from) a variety of bodily; affective; perceptual and motor processes. Thedevelopment and expression of cognition is constrained by the embodiment of cognitiveagents and various contextual factors (physical and social) in which they are immersed. Thegrounded framework has received numerous empirical confirmations. Still; there are veryfew explicit computational models that implement grounding in sensory; motor and affectiveprocesses as intrinsic to cognition; and demonstrate that grounded theories canmechanistically implement higher cognitive abilities. We propose a new alliance between …,Frontiers in psychology,2013,103
Symbol grounding and the symbolic theft hypothesis,Angelo Cangelosi; Alberto Greco; Stevan Harnad,Abstract Scholars studying the origins and evolution of language are also interested in thegeneral issue of the evolution of cognition. Language is not an isolated capability of theindividual; but has intrinsic relationships with many other behavioral; cognitive; and socialabilities. By understanding the mechanisms underlying the evolution of linguistic abilities; itis possible to understand the evolution of cognitive abilities. Cognitivism; one of the currentapproaches in psychology and cognitive science; proposes that symbol systems capturemental phenomena; and attributes cognitive validity to them. Therefore; in the same way thatlanguage is considered the prototype of cognitive abilities; a symbol system has become theprototype for studying language and cognitive systems. Symbol systems are advantageousas they are easily studied through computer simulation (a computer program is a symbol …,*,2002,103
Computer simulation: A new scientific approach to the study of language evolution,Angelo Cangelosi; Domenico Parisi,Abstract Language is such an important human characteristics that we would like to knowhow it first came into existence and how it managed to reach its present form. If we could goback in time for a sufficient number of generations we would encounter human ancestorsthat did not have language. In a succession of generations the descendants of those non-linguistic ancestors came to possess the ability to speak and to understand the speech ofothers. What made the transition possible? How did the transition occur? Were thereintermediate forms of language in the sense of communication systems different from knownanimal communication systems but also different from language as we know it and as isspoken today by all humans?,*,2002,98
Musical emotions: predicting second-by-second subjective feelings of emotion from low-level psychoacoustic features and physiological measurements.,Eduardo Coutinho; Angelo Cangelosi,Abstract We sustain that the structure of affect elicited by music is largely dependent ondynamic temporal patterns in low-level music structural parameters. In support of this claim;we have previously provided evidence that spatiotemporal dynamics in psychoacousticfeatures resonate with two psychological dimensions of affect underlying judgments ofsubjective feelings: arousal and valence. In this article we extend our previous investigationsin two aspects. First; we focus on the emotions experienced rather than perceived whilelistening to music. Second; we evaluate the extent to which peripheral feedback in musiccan account for the predicted emotional responses; that is; the role of physiological arousalin determining the intensity and valence of musical emotions. Akin to our previous findings;we will show that a significant part of the listeners' reported emotions can be predicted …,Emotion,2011,93
The emergence of communication in evolutionary robots,Davide Marocco; Angelo Cangelosi; Stefano Nolfi,Evolutionary robotics is a biologically inspired approach to robotics that is advantageous tostudying the evolution of communication. A new model for the emergence of communicationis developed and tested through various simulation experiments. In the first simulation; theemergence of simple signalling behaviour is studied. This is used to investigate the inter-relationships between communication abilities; namely linguistic production andcomprehension; and other behavioural skills. The model supports the hypothesis that theability to form categories from direct interaction with an environment constitutes the groundsfor subsequent evolution of communication and language. In the second simulation;evolutionary robots are used to study the emergence of simple syntactic categories; egaction names (verbs). Comparisons between the two simulations indicate that the …,Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A: Mathematical; Physical and Engineering Sciences,2003,92

Grounding language in action and perception: from cognitive agents to humanoid robots,Angelo Cangelosi,Abstract In this review we concentrate on a grounded approach to the modeling of cognitionthrough the methodologies of cognitive agents and developmental robotics. This work willfocus on the modeling of the evolutionary and developmental acquisition of linguisticcapabilities based on the principles of symbol grounding. We review cognitive agent anddevelopmental robotics models of the grounding of language to demonstrate theirconsistency with the empirical and theoretical evidence on language grounding andembodiment; and to reveal the benefits of such an approach in the design of linguisticcapabilities in cognitive robotic agents. In particular; three different models will be discussed;where the complexity of the agent's sensorimotor and cognitive system gradually increases:from a multi-agent simulation of language evolution; to a simulated robotic agent model …,*,2010,76
The processing of verbs and nouns in neural networks: Insights from synthetic brain imaging,Angelo Cangelosi; Domenico Parisi,Abstract The paper presents a computational model of language in which linguistic abilitiesevolve in organisms that interact with an environment. Each individual's behavior iscontrolled by a neural network and we study the consequences in the network's internalfunctional organization of learning to process different classes of words. Agents are selectedfor reproduction according to their ability to manipulate objects and to understand nouns(objects' names) and verbs (manipulation tasks). The weights of the agents' neural networksare evolved using a genetic algorithm. Synthetic brain imaging techniques are then used toexamine the functional organization of the neural networks. Results show that nounsproduce more integrated neural activity in the sensory-processing hidden layer; while verbsproduce more integrated synaptic activity in the layer where sensory information is …,Brain and Language,2004,68
Integration of speech and action in humanoid robots: iCub simulation experiments,Vadim Tikhanoff; Angelo Cangelosi; Giorgio Metta,Building intelligent systems with human level competence is the ultimate grand challenge forscience and technology in general; and especially for cognitive developmental robotics. Thispaper proposes a new approach to the design of cognitive skills in a robot able to interactwith; and communicate about; the surrounding physical world and manipulate objects in anadaptive manner. The work is based on robotic simulation experiments showing that ahumanoid robot (iCub platform) is able to acquire behavioral; cognitive; and linguistic skillsthrough individual and social learning. The robot is able to learn to handle and manipulateobjects autonomously; to understand basic instructions; and to adapt its abilities to changesin internal and environmental conditions.,IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development,2011,65
Cross-situational learning of object–word mapping using Neural Modeling Fields,José F Fontanari; Vadim Tikhanoff; Angelo Cangelosi; Roman Ilin; Leonid I Perlovsky,Abstract The issue of how children learn the meaning of words is fundamental todevelopmental psychology. The recent attempts to develop or evolve efficientcommunication protocols among interacting robots or virtual agents have brought that issueto a central place in more applied research fields; such as computational linguistics andneural networks; as well. An attractive approach to learning an object–word mapping is theso-called cross-situational learning. This learning scenario is based on the intuitive notionthat a learner can determine the meaning of a word by finding something in common acrossall observed uses of that word. Here we show how the deterministic Neural Modeling Fields(NMF) categorization mechanism can be used by the learner as an efficient algorithm to inferthe correct object–word mapping. To achieve that we first reduce the original on-line …,Neural Networks,2009,61
Spatial language; visual attention; and perceptual simulation,Kenny R Coventry; Dermot Lynott; Angelo Cangelosi; Lynn Monrouxe; Dan Joyce; Daniel C Richardson,Abstract Spatial language descriptions; such as The bottle is over the glass; direct theattention of the hearer to particular aspects of the visual world. This paper asks how they doso; and what brain mechanisms underlie this process. In two experiments employingbehavioural and eye tracking methodologies we examined the effects of spatial language onpeople's judgements and parsing of a visual scene. The results underscore previous claimsregarding the importance of object function in spatial language; but also show how spatiallanguage differentially directs attention during examination of a visual scene. We discussimplications for existing models of spatial language; with associated brain mechanisms.,Brain and language,2010,60
Reynolds flocking in reality with fixed-wing robots: communication range vs. maximum turning rate,Sabine Hauert; Severin Leven; Maja Varga; Fabio Ruini; Angelo Cangelosi; Jean-Christophe Zufferey; Dario Floreano,The success of swarm behaviors often depends on the range at which robots cancommunicate and the speed at which they change their behavior. Challenges arise whenthe communication range is too small with respect to the dynamics of the robot; preventinginteractions from lasting long enough to achieve coherent swarming. To alleviate thisdependency; most swarm experiments done in laboratory environments rely oncommunication hardware that is relatively long range and wheeled robotic platforms thathave omnidirectional motion. Instead; we focus on deploying a swarm of small fixed-wingflying robots. Such platforms have limited payload; resulting in the use of short-rangecommunication hardware. Furthermore; they are required to maintain forward motion toavoid stalling and typically adopt low turn rates because of physical or energy constraints …,Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS); 2011 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on,2011,59
Learning and the evolution of language: the role of cultural variation and learning costs in the Baldwin effect,Steve Munroe; Angelo Cangelosi,The Baldwin effect has been explicitly used by Pinker and Bloom as an explanation of theorigins of language and the evolution of a language acquisition device. This article presentsnew simulations of an artificial life model for the evolution of compositional languages. Itspecifically addresses the role of cultural variation and of learning costs in the Baldwin effectfor the evolution of language. Results show that when a high cost is associated withlanguage learning; agents gradually assimilate in their genome some explicit features (eg;lexical properties) of the specific language they are exposed to. When the structure of thelanguage is allowed to vary through cultural transmission; Baldwinian processes cause;instead; the assimilation of a predisposition to learn; rather than any structural propertiesassociated with a specific language.

Grounding action words in the sensorimotor interaction with the world: experiments with a simulated iCub humanoid robot,Davide Marocco; Angelo Cangelosi; Kerstin Fischer; Tony Belpaeme,This paper presents a cognitive robotics model for the study of the embodied representationof action words. The present research will present how a iCub humanoid robot can learn themeaning of action words (ie words that represent dynamical events that happen in time) byphysically acting on the environment and linking the effects of its own actions with thebehaviour observed on the objects before and after the action. The control system of therobot is an artificial neural network trained to manipulate an object through a Back-Propagation Through Time algorithm. We will show that in the presented model thegrounding of action words relies directly to the way in which an agent interacts with theenvironment and manipulates it.,Frontiers in neurorobotics,2010,54
Integrating language and cognition: A cognitive robotics approach,Angelo Cangelosi; Vadins Tikhanojff; Jose Fernando Fontanari; Emmanouil Hourdakis,In this paper; we present some recent cognitive robotics studies on language and cognitionintegration to demonstrate how the language acquired by robotic agents can be directlygrounded in action representations. These studies are characterized by the hypothesis thatsymbols are directly grounded into the agents' own categorical representations; while at thesame time having logical (eg syntactic) relationships with other symbols. The two roboticsstudies are based on the combination of cognitive robotics with neural modelingmethodologies; such as connectionist models and modeling field theory. Simulationsdemonstrate the efficacy of the mechanisms of action grounding of language and the symbolgrounding transfer in agents that acquire lexicon via imitation and linguistic instructions. Thepaper also discusses the scientific and technological implications of such an approach.,IEEE Computational intelligence magazine,2007,53
The grounding and sharing of symbols,Angelo Cangelosi,The double function of language; as a social/communicative means; and as anindividual/cognitive capability; derives from its fundamental property that allows us tointernally re-represent the world we live in. This is possible through the mechanism ofsymbol grounding; ie; the ability to associate entities and states in the external and internalworld with internal categorical representations. The symbol grounding mechanism; aslanguage; has both an individual and a social component. The individual component; calledthe “Physical Symbol Grounding”; refers to the ability of each individual to create an intrinsiclink between world entities and internal categorical representations. The social component;called “Social Symbol Grounding”; refers to the collective negotiation for the selection ofshared symbols (words) and their grounded meanings. The paper discusses these two …,Pragmatics & Cognition,2006,53
Electrophysiological examination of embodiment in vision and action,Jeremy Goslin; Thomas Dixon; Martin H Fischer; Angelo Cangelosi; Rob Ellis,A wealth of behavioral data has shown that the visual properties of objects automaticallypotentiate motor actions linked with them; but how deeply are these affordances embeddedin visual processing? In the study reported here; we used electrophysiological measures toexamine the time course of affordance resulting from the leftward or rightward orientation ofthe handles of common objects. Participants were asked to categorize those objects using aleft-or right-handed motor response. Lateralized readiness potentials showed rapid motorpreparation in the hand congruent with the affordance provided by the object only 100 to200 ms after stimulus presentation and up to 400 ms before the actual response.Examination of event-related potentials also revealed an effect of handle orientation andresponse-hand congruency on the visual P1 and N1 components. Both of these results …,Psychological science,2012,51
Language and cognition integration through modeling field theory: category formation for symbol grounding,Vadim Tikhanoff; José F Fontanari; Angelo Cangelosi; Leonid I Perlovsky,Abstract Neural Modeling Field Theory is based on the principle of associating lower-levelsignals (eg; inputs; bottom-up signals) with higher-level concept-models (eg internalrepresentations; categories/concepts; top-down signals) avoiding the combinatorialcomplexity inherent to such a task. In this paper we present an extension of the ModelingField Theory neural network for the classification of objects. Simulations show that (i) thesystem is able to dynamically adapt when an additional feature is introduced duringlearning;(ii) that this algorithm can be applied to the classification of action patterns in thecontext of cognitive robotics and (iii) that it is able to classify multi-feature objects fromcomplex stimulus set. The use of Modeling Field Theory for studying the integration oflanguage and cognition in robots is discussed.,International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks,2006,51
Spatial prepositions and vague quantifiers: Implementing the functional geometric framework,Kenny R Coventry; Angelo Cangelosi; Rohanna Rajapakse; Alison Bacon; Stephen Newstead; Dan Joyce; Lynn V Richards,Abstract There is much empirical evidence showing that factors other than the relativepositions of objects in Euclidean space are important in the comprehension of a wide rangeof spatial prepositions in English and other languages. We first the overview the functionalgeometric framework [11] which puts “what” and “where” information together to underpinthe situation specific meaning of spatial terms. We then outline an implementation of thisframework. The computational model for the processing of visual scenes and theidentification of the appropriate spatial preposition consists of three main modules:(1) VisionProcessing;(2) Elman Network;(3) Dual-Route Network.

Modeling the evolution of communication: From stimulus associations to grounded symbolic associations,Angelo Cangelosi,Abstract This paper describes a model for the evolution of communication systems usingsimple syntactic rules; such as word combinations. It also focuses on the distinction betweensimple word-object associations and symbolic relationships. The simulation methodcombines the use of neural networks and genetic algorithms. The behavioral task isinfluenced by Savage-Rumbaugh & Rumbaugh's (1978) ape language experiments. Theresults show that languages that use combination of words (eg “verb-object” rule) canemerge by auto-organization and cultural transmission. Neural networks are tested to see ifevolved languages are based on symbol acquisition. The implications of this model forDeacon's (1997) hypothesis on the role of symbolic acquisition for the origin of language arediscussed.,European Conference on Artificial Life,1999,43
The use of spatio-temporal connectionist models in psychological studies of musical emotions,Eduardo Coutinho; Angelo Cangelosi,THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A NOVEL METHODOLOGY TO analyze the dynamics ofemotional responses to music. It consists of a computational investigation based onspatiotemporal neural networks; which" mimic" human affective responses to music andpredict the responses to novel music sequences. The results provide evidence suggestingthat spatiotemporal patterns of sound resonate with affective features underlying judgmentsof subjective feelings (arousal and valence). A significant part of the listener9s affectiveresponse is predicted from a set of six psychoacoustic features of sound—â€” loudness;tempo; texture; mean pitch; pitch variation; and sharpness. A detailed analysis of the networkparameters and dynamics also allows us to identify the role of specific psychoacousticvariables (eg; tempo and loudness) in music emotional appraisal.

The grounding of higher order concepts in action and language: a cognitive robotics model,Francesca Stramandinoli; Davide Marocco; Angelo Cangelosi,Abstract In this paper we present a neuro-robotic model that uses artificial neural networksfor investigating the relations between the development of symbol manipulation capabilitiesand of sensorimotor knowledge in the humanoid robot iCub. We describe a cognitiverobotics model in which the linguistic input provided by the experimenter guides theautonomous organization of the robot's knowledge. In this model; sequences of linguisticinputs lead to the development of higher-order concepts grounded on basic concepts andactions. In particular; we show that higher-order symbolic representations can be indirectlygrounded in action primitives directly grounded in sensorimotor experiences. The use ofrecurrent neural network also permits the learning of higher-order concepts based ontemporal sequences of action primitives. Hence; the meaning of a higher-order concept is …,Neural Networks,2012,40
How affordances associated with a distractor object affect compatibility effects: A study with the computational model TRoPICALS,Daniele Caligiore; Anna M Borghi; Domenico Parisi; Rob Ellis; Angelo Cangelosi; Gianluca Baldassarre,Abstract Seeing an object activates both visual and action codes in the brain. Crucialevidence supporting this view is the observation of object to response compatibility effects:perception of an object can facilitate or interfere with the execution of an action (eg;grasping) even when the viewer has no intention of interacting with the object. TRoPICALSis a computational model that proposes some general principles about the brainmechanisms underlying compatibility effects; in particular the idea that top-down bias fromprefrontal cortex; and whether it conflicts or not with the actions afforded by an object; playsa key role in such phenomena. Experiments on compatibility effects using a target and adistractor object show the usual positive compatibility effect of the target; but also aninteresting negative compatibility effect of the distractor: responding with a grip …,Psychological Research,2013,38
Thinking with your body: Modelling spatial biases in categorization using a real humanoid robot,Anthony Morse; Tony Belpaeme; Angelo Cangelosi; Linda Smith,Abstract This paper presents a model of sensorimotor learning grounded in the sensorystreams of a real humanoid robot (the iCub robot). The robot participates in a replication oftwo developmental psychology experiments; in which it is shown how spatial cues aresufficient for associating linguistic labels with objects. The robot; using auto-associated self-organizing maps connecting is perceptual input and motor control; produces similarperformance and results to human participants. This model confirms the validity of a bodycentric account of the linking of words to objects as sufficient to account for the spatial biasesin learning that these experiments expose.,Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society,2010,38

Posture affects how robots and infants map words to objects,Anthony F Morse; Viridian L Benitez; Tony Belpaeme; Angelo Cangelosi; Linda B Smith,For infants; the first problem in learning a word is to map the word to its referent; a secondproblem is to remember that mapping when the word and/or referent are again encountered.Recent infant studies suggest that spatial location plays a key role in how infants solve bothproblems. Here we provide a new theoretical model and new empirical evidence on how thebody–and its momentary posture–may be central to these processes. The present studyuses a name-object mapping task in which names are either encountered in the absence oftheir target (experiments 1–3; 6 & 7); or when their target is present but in a locationpreviously associated with a foil (experiments 4; 5; 8 & 9). A humanoid robot model(experiments 1–5) is used to instantiate and test the hypothesis that body-centric spatiallocation; and thus the bodies' momentary posture; is used to centrally bind the multimodal …,PloS one,2015,36
How nouns and verbs differentially affect the behavior of artificial organisms,Angelo Cangelosi; Domenico Parisi,Abstract This paper presents an Artificial Life and Neural Network (ALNN) model for theevolution of syntax. The simulation methodology provides a unifying approach for the studyof the evolution of language and its interaction with other behavioral and neural factors. Themodel uses an object manipulation task to simulate the evolution of language based on asimple verb-noun rule. The analyses of results focus on the interaction between languageand other non-linguistic abilities; and on the neural control of linguistic abilities. The modelshows that the beneficial effects of language on non-linguistic behavior are explained by theemergence of distinct internal representation patterns for the processing of verbs and nouns.,Proceedings of the 23rd Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society; London: LEA,2001,36

On the foundations of perceptual symbol systems: Specifying embodied representations via connectionism,D Joyce; L Richards; Angelo Cangelosi; Kenny R Coventry,Abstract Embodied theories of cognition propose that symbol systems are analogue (egBarsalou; 1999; Glenberg; 1997); as opposed to the classicist view that they are amodal egNewell and Simon (1976); Fodor (1998). The fundamental problem of symbol grounding(Harnad; 1990) is resolved in embodied theories by admitting only theories of symbolicrepresentation that are grounded in the perceptual system's representation (rather than byreference or mapping of amodal symbols through the sensory systems of the agent). Theseare often called analogical representations (Mandler; 1998). Barsalou's (1999) proposal forperceptual symbol systems (PSS) provides just such a framework for how analogue symbolsmight come into being; but remains agnostic on the implementation of these PSSs. In thispaper; we advance an implementation of PSSs which might fill this explanatory gap. We …,The logic of cognitive systems.

Language acquisition and symbol grounding transfer with neural networks and cognitive robots,Angelo Cangelosi; Emmanouil Hourdakis; Vadim Tikhanoff,Neural networks have been proposed as an ideal cognitive modeling methodology to dealwith the symbol grounding problem. More recently; such neural network approaches havebeen incorporated in studies based on cognitive agents and robots. In this paper we presenta new model of symbol grounding transfer in cognitive robots. Language learningsimulations demonstrate that robots are able to acquire new action concepts via linguisticinstructions. This is achieved by autonomously transferring the grounding from directlygrounded action names to new higher-order composite actions. The robot's neural networkcontroller permits such a grounding transfer. The implications for such a modeling approachin cognitive science and autonomous robotics are discussed.,Neural Networks; 2006.

Evolution of symbolisation in chimpanzees and neural nets,Angelo Cangelosi,from Introduction: Animal communication systems and human languages can becharacterised by the type of cognitive abilities that are required. If we consider the mainsemiotic distinction between communication using icons; signals; or symbols (Peirce; 1955;Harnad; 1990; Deacon; 1997) we can identify different cognitive loads for each type ofreference. The use and understanding of icons require instinctive behaviour (eg emotions)or simple perceptual processes (eg visual similarities between an icon and its meaning).Communication systems that use signals are characterised by referential associationsbetween objects and visual or auditory signals. They require the cognitive ability to learnstimulus associations; such as in conditional learning. Symbols have double associations.Initially; symbolic systems require the establishment of associations between signals and …,*,2000,33
A neural network model of caenorhabditis elegans: the circuit of touch sensitivity,Angelo Cangelosi; Domenico Parisi,Abstract The paper presents a neural network model of the touch sensitivity circuit of thenematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We describe a serie of simulations in which neuralnetworks are trained; using a genetic algorithm; to reproduce the habituation of thenematode's touch sensitive behavior. A lesion study of the network allows to make a directcomparison between the fine functioning of the model and the data collected in realorganisms. The model accords well with the known neurobiological data and it suggestssome hypotheses about the functioning of the neural circuit and of single neurons.,Neural processing letters,1997,32

Autonomous learning in humanoid robotics through mental imagery,Alessandro G Di Nuovo; Davide Marocco; Santo Di Nuovo; Angelo Cangelosi,Abstract In this paper we focus on modeling autonomous learning to improve performance ofa humanoid robot through a modular artificial neural networks architecture. A model of aneural controller is presented; which allows a humanoid robot iCub to autonomouslyimprove its sensorimotor skills. This is achieved by endowing the neural controller with asecondary neural system that; by exploiting the sensorimotor skills already acquired by therobot; is able to generate additional imaginary examples that can be used by the controlleritself to improve the performance through a simulated mental training. Results and analysispresented in the paper provide evidence of the viability of the approach proposed and helpto clarify the rational behind the chosen model and its implementation.,Neural Networks,2013,29
Approaches to grounding symbols in perceptual and sensorimotor categories,Angelo Cangelosi,Abstract This chapter presents the Cognitive Symbol Grounding framework for the groundingof language into perception; cognition and action. This approach is characterized by thehypothesis that symbols are directly grounded in internal categorical representations; whileat the same time having logical (eg; syntactic) relationships with other symbols. The internalcategorical representations; constituting the meanings upon which symbols are grounded;include perceptual; sensorimotor; and social categories; as well as internal staterepresentations. Two main modeling approaches to the symbol grounding are presented:(i)the connectionist approach; based on artificial neural networks for category learning andnaming tasks; and (ii) the embodied modeling approach; based on adaptive agentsimulations and cognitive robots. These models provide an integrative view of the …,*,2005,29
Symbol grounding transfer with hybrid self-organizing/supervised neural networks,Thomas Riga; Angelo Cangelosi; Alberto Greco,This paper reports new simulations on an extended neural network model for the transfer ofsymbol grounding. It uses a hybrid and modular connectionist model; consisting of anunsupervised; self-organizing map for stimulus classification and a supervised network forcategory acquisition and naming. The model is based on a psychologically-plausible view ofsymbolic communication; where unsupervised concept formation precedes the supervisedacquisition of category names. The simulation results demonstrate that grounding istransferred from symbols denoting object properties to newly acquired symbols denoting theobject as a whole. The implications for cognitive models integrating neural networks andmulti-agent systems are discussed.,Neural Networks; 2004. Proceedings. 2004 IEEE International Joint Conference on,2004,28
Evolution of prehension ability in an anthropomorphic neurorobotic arm,Gianluca Massera; Angelo Cangelosi; Stefano Nolfi,In this paper; we show how a simulated anthropomorphic robotic arm controlled by anartificial neural network can develop effective reaching and grasping behaviour through atrial and error process in which the free parameters encode the control rules which regulatethe fine-grained interaction between the robot and the environment and variations of the freeparameters are retained or discarded on the basis of their effects at the level of the globalbehaviour exhibited by the robot situated in the environment. The obtained resultsdemonstrate how the proposed methodology allows the robot to produce effectivebehaviours thanks to its ability to exploit the morphological properties of the robot's body (ieits anthropomorphic shape; the elastic properties of its muscle-like actuators and thecompliance of its actuated joints) and the properties which arise from the physical …,Frontiers in neurorobotics,2007,27
A neural model of selective attention and object segmentation in the visual scene: An approach based on partial synchronization and star-like architecture of connect...,Roman Borisyuk; Yakov Kazanovich; David Chik; Vadim Tikhanoff; Angelo Cangelosi,Abstract A brain-inspired computational system is presented that allows sequential selectionand processing of objects from a visual scene. The system is comprised of three modules.The selective attention module is designed as a network of spiking neurons of the Hodgkin–Huxley type with star-like connections between the central unit and peripheral elements. Theattention focus is represented by those peripheral neurons that generate spikessynchronously with the central neuron while the activity of other peripheral neurons issuppressed. Such dynamics corresponds to the partial synchronization mode. It is shownthat peripheral neurons with higher firing rates are preferentially drawn into partialsynchronization. We show that local excitatory connections facilitate synchronization; whilelocal inhibitory connections help distinguishing between two groups of peripheral …,Neural Networks,2009,25
Affordances in psychology; neuroscience and robotics: a survey,Lorenzo Jamone; Emre Ugur; Angelo Cangelosi; Luciano Fadiga; Alexandre Bernardino; Justus Piater; José Santos-Victor,The concept of affordances appeared in psychology during the late 60's as an alternativeperspective on the visual perception of the environment. It was revolutionary in the intuitionthat the way living beings perceive the world is deeply influenced by the actions they areable to perform. Then; across the last 40 years; it has influenced many applied fields: egdesign; human-computer interaction; computer vision; robotics. In this paper we offer amultidisciplinary perspective on the notion of affordances: we first discuss the maindefinitions and formalizations of the affordance theory; then we report the most significantevidence in psychology and neuroscience that support it; and finally we review the mostrelevant applications of this concept in robotics.,IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems,2016,24
Adaptive agent modeling of distributed language: investigations on the effects of cultural variation and internal action representations,Angelo Cangelosi,Abstract In this paper we present the “grounded adaptive agent” computational frameworkfor studying the emergence of communication and language. This modeling framework isbased on simulations of population of cognitive agents that evolve linguistic capabilities byinteracting with their social and physical environment (internal and external symbolgrounding). These models provide an integrative vision of language where the linguisticabilities of cognitive agents strictly depend on other social; sensorimotor; neural andcognitive capabilities. Here language is not seen as an isolated and dedicated symbolprocessing system; but rather as a heterogeneous set of artifacts implicated in cultural andcognitive activities. The proposed modeling approach is also closely related to embodiedcognition theories of the grounding of language in the organism's perceptual and motor …,Language sciences,2007,23
Heterochrony and adaptation in developing neural networks,Angelo Cangelosi,Abstract This paper discusses the simulation results of a model of biological development forneural networks based on a regulatory genome. The model's results are analyzed using theframework of Heterochrony theory (McKinney and McNamara; 1991). The networkdevelopment is controlled by genes that produce elements regulating the activation;inhibition; and delay of neurogenetic events. The genome can also regulate the geneexpression mechanisms. An ecological task of foraging behavior is used to test the modelwith an evolving population of artificial organisms. Organisms evolve an optimal foragingbehavior and the ability to adapt to changing environments. The adaptive strategy consistsin changes of network architecture that are determined by the regulatory rearrangment ofneurogenetic events.

Visual and linguistic cues to graspable objects,Andriy Myachykov; Rob Ellis; Angelo Cangelosi; Martin H Fischer,Abstract Two experiments investigated (1) how activation of manual affordances is triggeredby visual and linguistic cues to manipulable objects and (2) whether graspable object partsplay a special role in this process. Participants pressed a key to categorize manipulabletarget objects copresented with manipulable distractor objects on a computer screen. Threefactors were varied in Experiment 1:(1) the target's and (2) the distractor's handles'orientation congruency with the lateral manual response and (3) the Visual Focus on one ofthe objects. In Experiment 2; a linguistic cue factor was added to these three factors—participants heard the name of one of the two objects prior to the target display onset.Analysis of participants' motor and oculomotor behaviour confirmed that perceptual andlinguistic cues potentiated activation of grasp affordances.

A unified simulation scenario for language development; evolution and historical change,Domenico Parisi; Angelo Cangelosi,Abstract When we see a human being who is talking or is listening to and understanding thelanguage produced by someone else; we may ask: What is the origin and past history of thisability? How has this ability taken its present form? Asking and answering questions aboutthe origin and past history of biological; behavioral; and cultural phenomena is a crucial stepto an understanding of these phenomena. Biological; behavioral; and cultural phenomenahave an intrinsically historical nature. Their current properties are the result of their pasthistory and they retain in themselves the traces of this past history. Language is at the sametime a biological; a behavioral; and a cultural phenomenon. Therefore; to understand whatlanguage is now requires that we reconstruct how it is has become what it is now.,*,2002,21
Object affordance influences instruction span,Jens K Apel; Angelo Cangelosi; Rob Ellis; Jeremy Goslin; Martin H Fischer,Abstract We measured memory span for assembly instructions involving objects withhandles oriented to the left or right side. Right-handed participants remembered moreinstructions when objects' handles were spatially congruent with the hand used inforthcoming assembly actions. No such affordance-based memory benefit was found for left-handed participants. These results are discussed in terms of motor simulation as anembodied rehearsal mechanism.,Experimental brain research,2012,20
Towards the grounding of abstract words: a neural network model for cognitive robots,Francesca Stramandinoli; Angelo Cangelosi; Davide Marocco,In this paper; a model based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) extends the symbolgrounding mechanism to abstract words for cognitive robots. The aim of this work is to obtaina semantic representation of abstract concepts through the grounding in sensorimotorexperiences for a humanoid robotic platform. Simulation experiments have been developedon a software environment for the iCub robot. Words that express general actions with asensorimotor component are first taught to the simulated robot. During the training stage therobot first learns to perform a set of basic action primitives through the mechanism of directgrounding. Subsequently; the grounding of action primitives; acquired via directsensorimotor experience; is transferred to higher-order words via linguistic descriptions. Theidea is that by combining words grounded in sensorimotor experience the simulated robot …,Neural Networks (IJCNN); The 2011 International Joint Conference on,2011,20

Themain aim of the research is to extend the range of domains that could be successfullytackled by the Evolutionary Robotics approach. The flying robots realm is an area that hasnot been yet thoroughly investigated by this discipline. This is due to the lack of anaffordable and reliable robotic platform to use for carrying out experiments; and to thedifficulty and the high computational load involved in experiments based upon a realisticsoftware simulator for aircraft.

The method proposed is based on anartificial ontogenetic process in which the genotype does not specify directly thecharacteristics of the creatures but rather the growing rules that determine how an initialartificial embryo will develop on a fully formed individual. More specifically; the creatures aregenerated through a developmental process which occurs in time and space and which isrealized through the progressive addition of both structural parts and regulatory substanceswhich affect the successive course of the morphogenetic process.

Towards a model for embodied emotions,Eduardo Coutinho; Eduardo R Miranda; Angelo Cangelosi,We are interested in developing A-Life-like models to study the evolution of emotionalsystems in artificial worlds inhabited by autonomous agents. This paper focuses on theemotional component of an agent at its very basic physical level. We adopt an evolutionaryperspective by modelling the agent based on biologically plausible principles; wherebyemotions emerge from homeostatic mechanisms. We suggest that the agent should beembodied so as to allow its behaviour to be affected by low-level physical tasks. Byembodiment we mean that the agent has a virtual physical body whose states can besensed by the agent itself. The simulations show the emergence of a stable emotionalsystem with emotional contexts resulting from dynamical categorization of objects in theworld. This proved to be effective and versatile enough to allow the agent to adapt itself to …,Artificial intelligence; 2005. epia 2005. portuguese conference on,2005,18

It puts together various constraints on object knowledge (“what”) andon object localisation (“where”) in order to influence the comprehension of a range oflinguistic terms; mirroring what participants do in experiments. The computational modelconsists of a vision processing module for input scenes; an Elman network module for therepresentation of object dynamics; and a dual-route network for the production of objectnames and linguistic prepositions describing the scene. Preliminary simulations on theprediction of spatial term ratings are presented; and extensions of the model to vaguequantifiers and other syntactic categories are considered.,*,2005,18
A connectionist model for categorical perception and symbol grounding,Alberto Greco; Angelo Cangelosi; Stevan Harnad,Abstract Neural network models of categorical perception can help solve the symbol-grounding problem [5; 6] by connecting analog sensory projections to symbolicrepresentations through learned category-invariance detectors in a hybridsymbolic/nonsymbolic system. Our nets learn to categorize and name geometric shapes.The nets first learn to do prototype matching and then entry-level naming; grounding theshape names directly in the input patterns via hidden-unit representations. Next; a higher-level categorization is learned indirectly from combinations of the grounded category names(symbols). We analyze the architectures and input conditions that allow grounding to be“transferred” from directly grounded entry-level category names to higher-order categorynames.,*,1998,18
Novel hybrid adaptive controller for manipulation in complex perturbation environments,Alex MC Smith; Chenguang Yang; Hongbin Ma; Phil Culverhouse; Angelo Cangelosi; Etienne Burdet,In this paper we present a hybrid control scheme; combining the advantages of task-spaceand joint-space control. The controller is based on a human-like adaptive design; whichminimises both control effort and tracking error. Our novel hybrid adaptive controller hasbeen tested in extensive simulations; in a scenario where a Baxter robot manipulator isaffected by external disturbances in the form of interaction with the environment and tool-likeend-effector perturbations. The results demonstrated improved performance in the hybridcontroller over both of its component parts. In addition; we introduce a novel method foronline adaptation of learning parameters; using the fuzzy control formalism to utilise expertknowledge from the experimenter. This mechanism of meta-learning induces furtherimprovement in performance and avoids the need for tuning through trial testing.,PloS one,2015,17
The sensorimotor bases of linguistic structure: Experiments with grounded adaptive agents,Angelo Cangelosi,Abstract This research uses grounded adaptive agents for investigating the evolutionaryorigins of syntactic categories; such as nouns and verbs. To analyze the sensorimotor basesof linguistic structure; the techniques of categorical perception and of synthetic brain imagingare employed. The simulation uses two different architectures for the adaptive agent's neuralcontroller. Analyses show that the neural processing of verbs is consistently localized in theregions of the networks that perform sensorimotor integration; while nouns are associatedwith sensory processing areas. The general implications of such model and of the analysistechniques for adaptive behavior and language evolution research are discussed.,Proceedings of the eighth international conference on the simulation of adaptive behaviour: from animals to animats,2004,17
Artificial life models of neural development,Angelo Cangelosi; Stefano Nolfi; Domenico Parisi,Artificial neural networks are computational models of nervous systems. Natural organisms;however; do possess not only nervous systems but also genetic information stored in thenucleus of their cells (genotype). The nervous system is part of the phenotype which isderived from the genotype through a process called development. The information specifiedin the genotype determines aspects of the nervous system which are expressed as innatebehavioural tendencies and predispositions to learn. When neural networks are viewed inthe broader biological context of artificial life; they tend to be accompanied by genotypesand to become members of evolving populations of networks in which genotypes areinherited from parents to offspring (Parisi; 1997; Nolfi and Parisi; 2001).

Generalisation; decision making; and embodiment effects in mental rotation: A neurorobotic architecture tested with a humanoid robot,Kristsana Seepanomwan; Daniele Caligiore; Angelo Cangelosi; Gianluca Baldassarre,Abstract Mental rotation; a classic experimental paradigm of cognitive psychology; tests thecapacity of humans to mentally rotate a seen object to decide if it matches a target object. Inrecent years; mental rotation has been investigated with brain imaging techniques to identifythe brain areas involved. Mental rotation has also been investigated through thedevelopment of neural-network models; used to identify the specific mechanisms thatunderlie its process; and with neurorobotics models to investigate its embodied nature.Current models; however; have limited capacities to relate to neuro-scientific evidence; togeneralise mental rotation to new objects; to suitably represent decision makingmechanisms; and to allow the study of the effects of overt gestures on mental rotation.

Toward a self-organizing pre-symbolic neural model representing sensorimotor primitives,Junpei Zhong; Angelo Cangelosi; Stefan Wermter,The acquisition of symbolic and linguistic representations of sensorimotor behavior is acognitive process performed by an agent when it is executing and/or observing own andothers' actions. According to Piaget's theory of cognitive development; these representationsdevelop during the sensorimotor stage and the pre-operational stage. We propose a modelthat relates the conceptualization of the higher-level information from visual stimuli to thedevelopment of ventral/dorsal visual streams. This model employs neural networkarchitecture incorporating a predictive sensory module based on an RNNPB (RecurrentNeural Network with Parametric Biases) and a horizontal product model. We exemplify thismodel through a robot passively observing an object to learn its features and movements.During the learning process of observing sensorimotor primitives; ie observing a set of …,Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2014,15

A cognitive neural architecture able to learn and communicate through natural language,Bruno Golosio; Angelo Cangelosi; Olesya Gamotina; Giovanni Luca Masala,Communicative interactions involve a kind of procedural knowledge that is used by thehuman brain for processing verbal and nonverbal inputs and for language production.Although considerable work has been done on modeling human language abilities; it hasbeen difficult to bring them together to a comprehensive tabula rasa system compatible withcurrent knowledge of how verbal information is processed in the brain. This work presents acognitive system; entirely based on a large-scale neural architecture; which was developedto shed light on the procedural knowledge involved in language elaboration. The maincomponent of this system is the central executive; which is a supervising system thatcoordinates the other components of the working memory.

Grounding fingers; words and numbers in a cognitive developmental robot,Alessandro Di Nuovo; M Vivian; Angelo Cangelosi,The young math learner must make the transition from a concrete number situation; such asthat of counting objects (fingers often being the most readily available); to that of using awritten symbolic form that stands for the quantities the sets of objects come to represent. Thischallenging process is often coupled to that of learning a verbal number system that is notalways transparent to children. A number of theoretical approaches have been advanced toexplain aspects of how this transition takes place in cognitive development. The resultsobtained with the model presented here; show that a symbol grounding approach can beused to implement aspects of this transition in a cognitive robot. In the current extendedversion; the model develops finger and word representations; through the use of fingercounting and verbal counting strategies; together with the visual representations of …,Computational Intelligence; Cognitive Algorithms; Mind; and Brain (CCMB); 2014 IEEE Symposium on,2014,14
The iCub learns numbers: An embodied cognition study,Alessandro Di Nuovo; M Vivian; Angelo Cangelosi; Santo Di Nuovo,Thanks to recent technological advances and the increasing interest towards the CognitiveDevelopmental Robotics (CDR) paradigm; many popular platforms for scientific researchhave been designed in order to resemble the shape of the human body. The motivationbehind this strongly humanoid design is the embodied cognition hypothesis; which affirmsthat all aspects of cognition are shaped by aspects of the body. Thus CDR is based on asynthetic approach that aims to provide new understanding on how human beings developtheir higher cognitive functions. Following this paradigm we have developed an artificialmodel; based on artificial neural networks; to explore finger counting and the association ofnumber words (or tags) to the fingers; as bootstrapping for the representation of numbers inthe humanoid robot iCub.

Modelling mental rotation in cognitive robots,Kristsana Seepanomwan; Daniele Caligiore; Gianluca Baldassarre; Angelo Cangelosi,Mental rotation concerns the cognitive processes that allow an agent mentally to rotate theimage of an object in order to solve a given task; for example to say if two objects withdifferent orientations are the same or different. Here we present a system-level bio-constrained model; developed within a neurorobotics framework; that provides an embodiedaccount of mental rotation processes relying on neural mechanisms involving motoraffordance encoding; motor simulation and the anticipation of the sensory consequences ofactions (both visual and proprioceptive).

Language emergence and grounding in sensorimotor agents and robots,Angelo Cangelosi; Thomas Riga; Barbara Giolito; Davide Marocco,The grounding of linguistic symbols in the organism'cognitive system; and indirectly in thephysical and social environment in which individuals live; is one of the most important issuesin recent experimental and computational approaches to language. This is normally referredas the Symbol Grounding Problem (Harnad 1990). In cognitive science; psychologicalexperiments have focused on the relationship between language and perception (Barsalou1999; Coventry & Garrod 2004) and language and action (Glenberg & Kaschak 2002).These empirical investigations show a strong interdependence between languagedevelopment and perceptual and embodiment factors. In robotics and artificial intelligence;various models have been proposed to ground language in neural networks (Joyce et al.2003; Cangelosi et al. 2000; Dyer 1994) and in interactive robots (Steels 2002; Vogt 2002 …,First International Workshop on Emergence and Evolution of Linguistic Communication,2004,14

Cross-situational and supervised learning in the emergence of communication,Jose Fernando Fontanari; Angelo Cangelosi,Scenarios for the emergence or bootstrap of a lexicon involve the repeated interactionbetween at least two agents who must reach a consensus on how to name N objects usingH words. Here we consider minimal models of two types of learning algorithms: cross-situational learning; in which the individuals determine the meaning of a word by looking forsomething in common across all observed uses of that word; and supervised operantconditioning learning; in which there is strong feedback between individuals about theintended meaning of the words. Despite the stark differences between these learningschemes; we show that they yield the same communication accuracy in the limits of large Nand H; which coincides with the result of the classical occupancy problem of randomlyassigning N objects to H words.

Distributed control in multi-agent systems: A preliminary model of autonomous MAV swarms,Fabio Ruini; Angelo Cangelosi,This article focuses on the use of Multi-Agent Systems for modelling of Micro-unmannedAerial Vehicles (MAVs) in a distributed control task. The task regards a search and destroyscenario in the context of security and urban counter-terrorism. In the simulations developed;a swarm composed of four autonomous flying robots; driven by an embodied neural networkcontroller; has to approach a target deployed somewhere within the given environment.When close enough to the target; one of the aircraft needs to carry out a detonation in orderto neutralize it. The controllers used by the MAVs evolve through a genetic algorithm. Thepreliminary results presented here demonstrate how the adaptive evolutionary approachcan be successfully employed to develop controllers of this kind.

Grounding natural language quantifiers in visual attention,Kenny R Coventry; Angelo Cangelosi; Stephen Newstead; Alison Bacon; Rohanna Rajapakse,Abstract The literature on vague quantifiers in English (words like “some”;“many”; etc.) isreplete with demonstrations of context effects. Yet little attention has been paid to the issueof where such effects come from. We explore the possibility that they emanate from a visualattentional bottleneck which limits the accuracy of judgments of number in visual scenesunder conditions of time pressure. We present the results of 3 experiments which reveal arange of new context effects on the acceptability of vague quantifiers to describe a number ofobjects in a visual scene; and show corresponding effects on judgments of number using thesame visual scenes under speeded conditions.,P Cogn Sci Soc,2005,13

An ecological task of foraging behavior is used to test the model with an evolvingpopulation of artificial organisms. Organisms evolve optimal useful behaviors and the abilityto adapt to changing environments. The adaptive strategy consists in changes in networkarchitecture that are determined by the regulatory rearrangment of neurogenetic events.Results are discussed in terms of heterochrony theory (McKinney and McNamara; 1991).,University of California; San Diego,1995,13
A web based multi-modal interface for elderly users of the robot-era multi-robot services,Alessandro Di Nuovo; Frank Broz; Tony Belpaeme; Angelo Cangelosi; Filippo Cavallo; Raffaele Esposito; Paolo Dario,In this paper we present the design and technical implementation of a web based Multi-Modal User Interface (MMUI) tailored for elderly users of the robotic services developed bythe EU FP7 Large-Scale Integration Project Robot-Era. The project partners are working tosignificantly enhance the performance and acceptability of technological services for ageingwell by delivering a fully realized system based on the cooperation of multipleheterogeneous robots and with the support of an Ambient Assisted Living environment. Tothis end; elderly users were involved in the definition of the services and in the design of thehardware and software of the robotic platforms from the first stages of the developmentprocess and in real experimentation in two test sites. In particular; here we detail theinterface software system for multi-modal elderly-robot interaction.

An embodied developmental robotic model of interactions between numbers and space,Marek Rucinski; Angelo Cangelosi; Tony Belpaeme,Abstract In this paper we describe an embodied developmental model of the interactionsbetween the neural representations of numbers and space in the humanoid robot iCub. Weshow how a simple developmental process that mimics real-world cultural biases leads tothe emergence of certain properties of the number and space representation system thatenable the robot to reproduce well-known experimental phenomena. We demonstrate thevalidity of the proposed approach by showing that it leads to the reproduction of threepsychological phenomena connected with number processing; namely size and distanceeffects; the SNARC effect and the Posner-SNARC effect.,Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society,2011,12

The model wasimplemented as part of Aquila cognitive robotics toolkit [9] that makes use of massivelyparallel GPU devices that significantly outperform standard CPU processors on paralleltasks. This allowed for the extension of the previously used MTRNN model [3] with a highernumber of neurons and sensorimotor sequences.,Proceedings of ICDL-Epirob,2011,12
Action and language integration: From humans to cognitive robots,Anna M Borghi; Angelo Cangelosi,Abstract The topic is characterized by a highly interdisciplinary approach to the issue ofaction and language integration. Such an approach; combining computational models andcognitive robotics experiments with neuroscience; psychology; philosophy; and linguisticapproaches; can be a powerful means that can help researchers disentangle ambiguousissues; provide better and clearer definitions; and formulate clearer predictions on the linksbetween action and language. In the introduction we briefly describe the papers and discussthe challenges they pose to future research. We identify four important phenomena thepapers address and discuss in light of empirical and computational evidence:(a) the roleplayed not only by sensorimotor and emotional information but also of natural language inconceptual representation;(b) the contextual dependency and high flexibility of the …,Topics in cognitive science,2014,11
The power of words,Anthony F Morse; Paul Baxter; Tony Belpaeme; Linda B Smith; Angelo Cangelosi,Language is special; yet its power to facilitate communication may have distractedresearchers from the power of another; potential precursor ability: the ability to label things;and the effect this can have in transforming or extending cognitive abilities.

Ocular drift along the mental number line,Andriy Myachykov; Rob Ellis; Angelo Cangelosi; Martin H Fischer,Abstract We examined the spontaneous association between numbers and space bydocumenting attention deployment and the time course of associated spatial-numericalmapping with and without overt oculomotor responses. In Experiment 1; participantsmaintained central fixation while listening to number names. In Experiment 2; they madehorizontal target-direct saccades following auditory number presentation. In bothexperiments; we continuously measured spontaneous ocular drift in horizontal space duringand after number presentation. Experiment 2 also measured visual-probe-directed saccadesfollowing number presentation. Reliable ocular drift congruent with a horizontal mentalnumber line emerged during and after number presentation in both experiments. Our resultsprovide new evidence for the implicit and automatic nature of the oculomotor resonance …,Psychological research,2016,10
Biomimetic joint/task space hybrid adaptive control for bimanual robotic manipulation,Alex Smith; Chenguang Yang; Hongbin Ma; Phil Culverhouse; Angelo Cangelosi; Etienne Burdet,In this paper; we study the adaptive control of a bimanual manipulator moving a dynamicobject through a trajectory. Impedance and force are adapted online using a novelbiomimetic algorithm that minimises both tracking error and control effort; as observed inhumans. On top of our previous work of impedance and force adaptation; a new taskspace/joint-space hybrid control scheme is developed. The task space controller adapts end-point impedance; to compensate for interactive dynamics; and the joint-space controlleradapts the impedance to improve robustness against external disturbances. Extensivesimulations demonstrate the efficiency of the developed adaptive motion controller. Theresults show that the proposed hybrid controller can perform well under large disturbanceconditions while minimising control effort and tracking error.,Control & Automation (ICCA); 11th IEEE International Conference on,2014,10
Do beliefs about a robot's capabilities influence alignment to its actions?,Anna-Lisa Vollmer; Britta Wrede; Katharina J Rohlfing; Angelo Cangelosi,Interlocutors in a dialog align on many aspects of behavior (word choice; speech rate;syntactic structure; gestures; facial expressions; etc.). Such alignment has been proposed tobe the basis for communicating successfully. We believe alignment could be beneficial forsmooth human-robot interaction and facilitate robot action learning from demonstration.Recent research put forward a mediated communicative design account of alignmentaccording to which interlocutors align stronger when they believe it will lead tocommunicative success. Branigan et al. showed that when interacting with an artificialsystem; participants aligned their lexical choices more to an artificial system they believed tobe basic than to one they believed to be advanced. Our work extends these results in twoways: First; instead of an artificial computer dialog system; participants interact with a …,Development and Learning and Epigenetic Robotics (ICDL); 2013 IEEE Third Joint International Conference on,2013,10
Modeling U shaped performance curves in ongoing development,Anthony Morse; Tony Belpaeme; Angelo Cangelosi; Caroline Floccia,Abstract This paper details a simple and general account; and model; of the U-shaped curvephenomena apparent in many developmental psychology experiments. The modelreplicates both the general form of the U-shape performance in ongoing development andaccounts for additional observations in the psychology literature such as the effect of noisein Switch task experiments. This leads to predictions both in psychology and neuroscience;and establishes an alternative hypothesis; which is simpler; more detailed; more predictive;and more general than those already established in the literature. This approach is alsosuitable for embodied robotic modeling of development.,Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society,2011,10
Talking about quantities in space: Vague quantifiers; context and similarity,Kenny R Coventry; Angelo Cangelosi; Stephen E Newstead; Davi Bugmann,Abstract In this paper we examine how vague quantifiers; such as few; several; lots of; maponto non-linguistic number systems. In particular our focus is to examine how judgementsabout vague quantifiers are affected by the presence of objects in visual scenes other thanthose being referred to. An experiment is presented that manipulated the number of objectsin a visual scene (men playing golf; the 'focus' objects) together with the number of otherobjects in those scenes and their similarity—in terms of form (women or crocodiles) andfunction (playing golf; not playing golf)—to the focus objects. We show that the number ofother objects in a scene impacts upon quantifiers judgements even when those objects arein a different category to the focus objects. We discuss the results in terms of the mappingbetween the large approximate number (estimation) system and language.,Language and Cognition,2010,10
Individual and cooperative tasks performed by autonomous MAV teams driven by embodied neural network controllers,Fabio Ruini; Angelo Cangelosi; Franck Zetule,The work presented here focuses on the use of embodied neural network controllers forMAV (Micro-unmanned Aerial Vehicles) teams. The computer model we have built aims todemonstrate how autonomous controllers for groups of flying robots can be successfullydeveloped through simulations based on multi-agent systems and evolutionary roboticsmethodologies. We first introduce the field of autonomous flying robots; reviewing the mostrelevant contributes on this research field and highlighting the elements of novelty containedin our approach. We then describe the simulation model we have elaborated and the resultsobtained in different experimental scenarios.

Computational and psycho-physiological investigations of musical emotions,Eduardo Coutinho,The ability of music to stir human emotions is a well known fact (Gabrielsson & Lindstrom.2001). However; the manner in which music contributes to those experiences remainsobscured. One of the main reasons is the large number of syndromes that characteriseemotional experiences. Another is their subjective nature: musical emotions can be affectedby memories; individual preferences and attitudes; among other factors (Scherer & Zentner;2001). But can the same music induce similar affective experiences in all listeners;somehow independently of acculturation or personal bias? A considerable corpus ofliterature has consistently reported that listeners agree rather strongly about what type ofemotion is expressed in a particular piece or even in particular moments or sections (Juslin& Sloboda; 2001). Those studies suggest that music features encode important …,*,2008,10
The role of social and cognitive abilities in the emergence of communication: Experiments in evolutionary robotics,Davide Marocco; Angelo Cangelosi; Stefano Nolfi,Abstract Evolutionary robotics is a biologically inspired approach to robotics that isadvantageous to studying the evolution of language. A new model for the evolution oflanguage is presented. This model is used to investigate the interrelationships betweencommunication abilities; namely linguistic production and comprehension; and otherbehavioral skills. For example; the model supports the hypothesis that the ability to formcategories from direct interaction with an environment constitutes the ground for subsequentevolution of communication and language. A variety of experiments; based on the role ofsocial and evolutionary variables in the emergence of communication; are described.,EPSRC/BBSRC international workshop biologically-inspired robotics,2002,10
A neural network model for the prediction of musical emotions,Eduardo Coutinho; Angelo Cangelosi,This chapter presents a novel methodology to analyse the dynamics of emotional responsesto music in terms of computational representations of perceptual processes (psychoacousticfeatures) and self-perception of physiological activation (peripheral feedback). Theapproach consists of a computational investigation of musical emotions based on spatio-temporal neural networks sensitive to structural aspects of music. We present twocomputational studies based on connectionist network models that predict human subjectivefeelings of emotion. The first study uses six basic psychoacoustic dimensions extracted fromthe music pieces as predictors of the emotional response. The second computational studyevaluates the additional contribution of physiological arousal to the subjective feeling ofemotion. Both studies are backed up by experimental data.

Connectionist modeling of linguistic quantifiers,Rohana K Rajapakse; Angelo Cangelosi; Kenny R Coventry; Steve Newstead; Alison Bacon,Abstract This paper presents a new connectionist model of the grounding of linguisticquantifiers in perception that takes into consideration the contextual factors affecting the useof vague quantifiers. A preliminary validation of the model is presented through the trainingand testing of the model with experimental data on the rating of quantifiers. The model isable to perform the “psychological” counting of objects (fish) in visual scenes and to selectthe quantifier that best describes the scene; as in psychological experiments.,International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks,2005,9
The emergence of language: neural and adaptive agent models,Angelo Cangelosi,Studies of the emergence of language focus on the evolutionary and developmental factorsthat affect the acquisition and auto-organization of a linguistic communication system(MacWhinney 1999; Knight et al. 2000). In particular; emergentist accounts of languageemphasize the extent to which a complex set of communicative behaviours and forms arisefrom a few simple mechanisms. Various factors can contribute to the emergence oflanguage. Some of these relate to language-specific abilities; such as speech; semanticsand syntax. Other factors involve more general cognitive (eg category acquisition; learningand plasticity) sensorimotor (eg action and embodiment) and social abilities (eg imitation;social networks). Some of the key research issues and topics in the emergence of languageinclude:(a) emergentism as an alternative to the nativism/empiricism dichotomy …,*,2005,9
Head pose estimation in the wild using convolutional neural networks and adaptive gradient methods,Massimiliano Patacchiola; Angelo Cangelosi,Abstract Head pose estimation is an old problem that is recently receiving new attentionbecause of possible applications in human-robot interaction; augmented reality and drivingassistance. However; most of the existing work has been tested in controlled environmentsand is not robust enough for real-world applications. In order to handle these limitations wepropose an approach based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) supplemented withthe most recent techniques adopted from the deep learning community. We evaluate theperformance of four architectures on recently released in-the-wild datasets. Moreover; weinvestigate the use of dropout and adaptive gradient methods giving a contribution to theirongoing validation. The results show that joining CNNs and adaptive gradient methodsleads to the state-of-the-art in unconstrained head pose estimation.,Pattern Recognition,2017,8
A Neural Network model for spatial mental imagery investigation: A study with the humanoid robot platform iCub,Alessandro G Di Nuovo; Davide Marocco; Santo Di Nuovo; Angelo Cangelosi,Understanding the process behind the human ability of creating mental images of eventsand experiences is a still crucial issue for psychologists. Mental imagery may be considereda multimodal biological simulation that activates the same; or very similar; sensorial andmotor modalities that are activated when we interact with the environment in real time. Neuro-psychological studies show that neural mechanisms underlying real-time visual perceptionand mental visualization are the same when a task is mentally recalled. Nevertheless; theneural mechanisms involved in the active elaboration of mental images might be differentfrom those involved in passive elaborations. The enhancement of this active and creativeimagery is the aim of most psychological and educational processes; although; moreempirical effort is needed in order to understand the mechanisms and the role of active …,Neural Networks (IJCNN); The 2011 International Joint Conference on,2011,8

Object representation-by-fragments in the visual system: A neurocomputational model,Dan W Joyce; Lynn V Richards; Angelo Cangelosi; Kenny R Coventry,The paper presents a model of visual object representation by fragment views; rather thancanonically-oriented whole-object views used in Chorus systems. Following recent results(Sheinberg and Logothetis; 2001) on object representation in inferotemporal cells duringfree viewing; we implemented a simplified attentional system which yields fragment views ofobjects; which are then used to train object-tuned modules. Each object is represented by acomplete RBF module; instantiating a representation space. We show that such a systemcan produce distributed representations; like Chorus of views systems; and that dissociatingobjects from retinotopy enables a fuller model of scene geometry analysis to be advanced.,Neural Information Processing; 2002.

Verbs; nouns; and simulated language games,Domenico Parisi; Angelo Cangelosi; Ilaria Falcetta,Abstract The paper describes some simple computer simulations that implementWittgenstein's notion of a language game; where the meaning of a linguistic signal is therole played by the linguistic signal in the individual's interactions with the nonlinguistic andlinguistic environment. In the simulations an artificial organism interacts at the sensory-motorlevel with an environment and its behavior is influenced by the linguistic signals theindividual receives from the environment (conspecifics). Using this approach we try tocapture the distinction between (proto) verbs and (proto) nouns; where (proto) verbs arelinguistic signals that tend to co-vary with the action with which the organism must respondto the sensory input whereas (proto) nouns are linguistic signals that tend to co-vary with theparticular sensory input to which the organism must respond with its actions.

Why are there developmental stages in language learning? A developmental robotics model of language development,Anthony F Morse; Angelo Cangelosi,Abstract Most theories of learning would predict a gradual acquisition and refinement ofskills as learning progresses; and while some highlight exponential growth; this fails toexplain why natural cognitive development typically progresses in stages. Models that dospan multiple developmental stages typically have parameters to “switch” between stages.We argue that by taking an embodied view; the interaction between learning mechanisms;the resulting behavior of the agent; and the opportunities for learning that the environmentprovides can account for the stage-wise development of cognitive abilities. We summarizework relevant to this hypothesis and suggest two simple mechanisms that account for somedevelopmental transitions: neural readiness focuses on changes in the neural substrateresulting from ongoing learning; and perceptual readiness focuses on the perceptual …,Cognitive science,2017,7
Diverse; noisy and parallel: a new spiking neural network approach for humanoid robot control,Ricardo de Azambuja; Angelo Cangelosi; Samantha V Adams,How exactly our brain works is still an open question; but one thing seems to be clear:biological neural systems are computationally powerful; robust and noisy.

A cross-situational algorithm for learning a lexicon using Neural Modeling Fields,José F Fontanari; Vadim Tikhanoff; Angelo Cangelosi; Leonid I Perlovsky,Cross-situational learning is based on the idea that a learner can determine the meaning ofa word by finding something in common across all observed uses of that word. Althoughcross-situational learning is usually modeled through stochastic guessing games in whichthe input data vary erratically with time (or rounds of the game); here we investigate thepossibility of applying the deterministic neural modeling fields (NMF) categorizationmechanism to infer the correct object-word mapping. Two different representations of theinput data were considered. The first is termed object-word representation because it takesas inputs all possible object-word pairs and weighs them by their frequencies of occurrencein the stochastic guessing game. A re-interpretation of the problem within the perspective oflearning with noise indicates that the cross-situational scenario produces a too low signal …,Neural Networks; 2009. IJCNN 2009.

Toward abstraction from multi-modal data: empirical studies on multiple time-scale recurrent models,Junpei Zhong; Angelo Cangelosi; Tetsuya Ogata,The abstraction tasks are challenging for multi-modal sequences as they require a deepersemantic understanding and a novel text generation for the data. Although the recurrentneural networks (RNN) can be used to model the context of the time-sequences; in mostcases the long-term dependencies of multi-modal data make the back-propagation throughtime training of RNN tend to vanish in the time domain. Recently; inspired from Multiple Time-scale Recurrent Neural Network (MTRNN)[1]; an extension of Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU);called Multiple Time-scale Gated Recurrent Unit (MTGRU); has been proposed [2] to learnthe long-term dependencies in natural language processing. Particularly it is also able toaccomplish the abstraction task for paragraphs given that the time constants are welldefined.

Spatial language and converseness,Michele Burigo; Kenny R Coventry; Angelo Cangelosi; Dermot Lynott,Typical spatial language sentences consist of describing the location of an object (thelocated object) in relation to another object (the reference object) as in “The book is abovethe vase”. While it has been suggested that the properties of the located object (the book)are not translated into language because they are irrelevant when exchanging locationinformation; it has been shown that the orientation of the located object affects theproduction and comprehension of spatial descriptions. In line with the claim that spatiallanguage apprehension involves inferences about relations that hold between objects it hasbeen suggested that during spatial language apprehension people use the orientation of thelocated object to evaluate whether the logical property of converseness (eg; if “the book isabove the vase” is true; then also “the vase is below the book” must be true) holds across …,The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology,2016,6
Development of kinect based teleoperation of NAO robot,Chunxu Li; Chenguang Yang; Peidong Liang; Angelo Cangelosi; Jian Wan,In this paper; an online tracking system has been developed to control the arm and head ofa Nao robot using Kinect sensor. The main goal of this work is to achieve that the robot isable to follow the motion of a human user in real time to track. This objective has beenachieved using a RGB-D camera (Kinect v2) and a Nao robot; which is a humanoid robotwith 5 degree of freedom (DOF) for each arm. The joint motions of the operator's head andarm in the real world captured by a Kinect camera can be transferred into the workspacemathematically via forward and inverse kinematics; realitically through data based UDPconnection between the robot and Kinect sensor.

We also examined whether prior experience witha humanlike robot would lead people to extend this advantage to the less-anthropomorphicrobot. A measure of credibility was provided by agreement on the pricing of objects; whereparticipants negotiated with either a more (iCub) or less-anthropomorphic robot (Scitos G5)that was engaged in more (using social gaze) or less-humanlike (fixed gaze) socialbehaviour. In the first experiment participants only interacted with Scitos G5; in the secondthey interacted with Scitos G5 only after having first interacted iCub.

When interacting with users in the home;outdoors; or in assisted living facilities; the interpretability of a robot's behaviour is critical toits usability and acceptance. Well-designed feedback from the robot is necessary both whena robot is acting autonomously and when it is being controlled by a human user. In thisposition paper we describe our approach to the design of multimodal feedback for the Robot-Era project; including handheld devices as well as the robot itself. We will also discuss someof the unique challenges present in designing feedback for an elderly user population.,Workshop on Robot Feedback in Human-Robot Interaction: How to Make a Robot Readable for a Human Interaction Partner at Ro-MAN,2012,6

Children’s referent selection and word learning: insights from a developmental robotic system,Katherine E Twomey; Anthony F Morse; Angelo Cangelosi; Jessica S Horst,It is well-established that toddlers can correctly select a novel referent from an ambiguousarray in response to a novel label. There is also a growing consensus that robust wordlearning requires repeated label-object encounters. However; the effect of the context inwhich a novel object is encountered is less well-understood. We present two embodiedneural network replications of recent empirical tasks; which demonstrated that the context inwhich a target object is encountered is fundamental to referent selection and word learning.Our model offers an explicit account of the bottom-up associative and embodiedmechanisms which could support children's early word learning and emphasises theimportance of viewing behaviour as the interaction of learning at multiple timescales.

System limitations: the simple and usually proprietary nature of neuromorphicand robotic platforms; have often been the fundamental barrier. Here we present anintegration of a mature “neuromimetic” chip; SpiNNaker; with the humanoid iCub robot usinga direct AER-address-event representation-interface that overcomes the need for complexproprietary protocols by sending information as UDP-encoded spikes over an Ethernet link.Using an existing neural model devised for visual object selection; we enable the robot toperform a real-world task: fixating attention upon a selected stimulus.

Scaling up of action repertoire in linguistic cognitive agents,Vadim Tikhanoff; Angelo Cangelosi; José F Fontanari; Leonid I Perlovsky,We suggest the utilization of the modeling field theory (MFT) to deal with the combinatorialcomplexity problem of language modeling in cognitive robotics. In new simulations weextend our previous MFT model of language to deal with the scaling up of the robotic agent'saction repertoire. Simulations are divided into two stages. First agents learn to classify 112different actions inspired by an alphabet system (the semaphore flag signaling system). Inthe second stage; agents also learn a lexical item to name each action. At this stage theagents will start to describe the action as a" word" comprised of three letters (consonant-vowel-consonant). The results of the simulations demonstrate that:(i) agents are able toacquire a complex set of actions by building sensorimotor concept-models;(ii) agents areable to learn a lexicon to describe these objects/actions through a process of cultural …,Integration of Knowledge Intensive Multi-Agent Systems; 2007.

Developing a reaching behaviour in a simulated anthromorphic robotic arm through an evolutionary technique,Gianluca Massera; Angelo Cangelosi; Stefano Nolfi,Abstract In this article we present an evolutionary technique for developing a neural networkbased controller for an anthropomorphic robotic arm with 4 DOF able to exhibit a reachingbehaviour. Evolved neural controllers display an ability to reach targets accurately andgeneralize their ability to moving targets. This study demonstrates that it is possible to obtainsolutions that are extremely parsimonious from the point of view of the control system.Evolutionary training techniques allow us to evolve parameters of the control system on thebasis of the global effects that they produce on the dynamics arising from the interactionbetween the control system; the robot's body and the environment.,Artificial Life X: Proceeding of the Tenth International Conference on the simulation and synthesis of living systems (Cambridge; MA; MIT Press),2006,5
Concepts in artificial organisms,Angelo Cangelosi; Domenico Parisi,Abstract Simulations with neural networks living in a virtual environment can be used toexplore and test hypotheses concerning concepts and language. The advantages that resultfrom this approach include (1) the notion that a concept can be precisely defined andexamined;(2) that concepts can be studied in both nonverbal and verbal artificial organisms;and (3) concepts have properties that depend on the environment as well as on theorganism's adaptive behavior in response to the environment.,Behavioral and Brain Sciences,1998,5
Convolutional neural networks with balanced batches for facial expressions recognition,Elena Battini Sönmez; Angelo Cangelosi,This paper considers the issue of fully automatic emotion classification on 2D faces. In spiteof the great effort done in recent years; traditional machine learning approaches based onhand-crafted feature extraction followed by the classification stage failed to develop a real-time automatic facial expression recognition system. The proposed architecture usesConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN); which are built as a collection of interconnectedprocessing elements to simulate the brain of human beings. The basic idea of CNNs is tolearn a hierarchical representation of the input data; which results in a better classificationperformance. In this work we present a block-based CNN algorithm; which uses noise; asdata augmentation technique; and builds batches with a balanced number of samples perclass. The proposed architecture is a very simple yet powerful CNN; which can yield state …,Ninth International Conference on Machine Vision (ICMV 2016),2017,4
Making sense of words: a robotic model for language abstraction,Francesca Stramandinoli; Davide Marocco; Angelo Cangelosi,Abstract Building robots capable of acting independently in unstructured environments is stilla challenging task for roboticists. The capability to comprehend and produce language in a'human-like'manner represents a powerful tool for the autonomous interaction of robots withhuman beings; for better understanding situations and exchanging information during theexecution of tasks that require cooperation. In this work; we present a robotic model forgrounding abstract action words (ie USE; MAKE) through the hierarchical organization ofterms directly linked to perceptual and motor skills of a humanoid robot. Experimental resultshave shown that the robot; in response to linguistic commands; is capable of performing theappropriate behaviors on objects.

Competition affects word learning in a developmental robotic system,KE Twomey; AF Morse; Angelo Cangelosi; JS Horst,It is well-established that toddlers can correctly select a novel referent from an ambiguousarray in response to a novel label; or fast-map. There is also a growing consensus thatrobust word learning requires repeated label-object encounters. However; the effect of thecontext in which a novel object is encountered is less clear. Horst; Scott & Pollard presentedtoddlers with arrays of objects and asked them to choose the single novel object using anovel label; and showed that the more competitor objects children saw; the harder it was forchildren to retain that label. Here; we present a developmental robotic replication of thisstudy using a variant of the Epigenetic Robotic Architecture implemented in the iCubhumanoid robot. We discuss children's word learning in terms of the real-time processesgoverning the iCub's performance in the word learning task.,*,2017,4

This generalisation process is donevia the grounding process: different objects are being interacted; and associated; withdifferent motor behaviours; following a learning approach inspired by developmentallanguage acquisition in infants. This cognitive model is based on Multiple Time-scaleRecurrent Neural Networks (MTRNN). With the data obtained from object manipulation taskswith a humanoid robot platform; the robotic agent implemented with this model can groundthe primitive embodied structure of verbs through training with verb-noun combinationsamples.

The oculomotor resonance effect in spatial–numerical mapping,Andriy Myachykov; Angelo Cangelosi; Rob Ellis; Martin H Fischer,Abstract We investigated automatic Spatial–Numerical Association of Response Codes(SNARC) effect in auditory number processing. Two experiments continually measuredspatial characteristics of ocular drift at central fixation during and after auditory numberpresentation. Consistent with the notion of a spatially oriented mental number line; we foundspontaneous magnitude-dependent gaze adjustments; both with and without a concurrentsaccadic task. This fixation adjustment (1) had a small-number/left-lateralized bias and (2) itwas biphasic as it emerged for a short time around the point of lexical access and it receivedlater robust representation around following number onset. This pattern suggests a two-stepmechanism of sensorimotor mapping between numbers and space—a first-pass bottom-upactivation followed by a top-down and more robust horizontal SNARC.

Grounding abstract action words through the hierarchical organization of motor primitives,Francesca Stramandinoli; Davide Marocco; Angelo Cangelosi,Cognitive developmental robotics is facing the challenge of building robots capable ofworking independently and/or with other agents in non-structured scenarios; which canautonomously react to dynamic changes that occur in the environment. Providing robots withthe capability to comprehend and produce language in a “human-like” manner represents apowerful tool for flexible and intelligent interaction between robots and human beings.Robots endowed with linguistic capabilities; in fact; could better understand situations andexchange information; through language robots could cooperate and negotiate with humanbeings in order to accomplish shared plans. This work describes a neuro-robotics model forthe acquisition of abstract action words in the iCub humanoid robot.

Attention deployment during memorizing and executing complex instructions,Jens K Apel; Gavin F Revie; Angelo Cangelosi; Rob Ellis; Jeremy Goslin; Martin H Fischer,Abstract We investigated the mental rehearsal of complex action instructions by recordingspontaneous eye movements of healthy adults as they looked at objects on a monitor.Participants heard consecutive instructions; each of the form “move [object] to [location]”.Instructions were only to be executed after a go signal; by manipulating all objectssuccessively with a mouse. Participants re-inspected previously mentioned objects alreadywhile listening to further instructions. This rehearsal behavior broke down after 4instructions; coincident with participants' instruction span; as determined from subsequentexecution accuracy. These results suggest that spontaneous eye movements while listeningto instructions predict their successful execution.,Experimental brain research,2011,4

Emotion and embodiment in cognitive agents: from instincts to music,Eduardo Coutinho; Angelo Cangelosi,This paper suggests the use of modeling techniques to tack into the emotion/cognitionparadigm. We presented two possible frameworks focusing on the embodiment basis ofemotions. The first one explores the emergence of emotion mechanisms; by establishing theprimary conditions of survival and exploring the basic roots of emotional systems. Thesesimulations show the emergence of a stable motivational system with emotional contextsresulting from dynamical categorization of objects in the environment; in answer to survivalpressures and homeostatic processes. The second framework uses music as a source ofinformation about the mechanism of emotion and we propose a model based on recurrentconnectionist architectures for the prediction of emotional states in response to musicexperience.

Symbol grounding in connectionist and adaptive agent models,Angelo Cangelosi,Abstract This paper presents the Cognitive Symbol Grounding framework for modelinglanguage in neural networks and adaptive agent simulations. This approach ischaracterized by the hypothesis that symbols are directly grounded into the agents' owncategorical representations; whilst at the same time having syntactic relationships with othersymbols. The mechanism of grounding transfer is also introduced. This is the process bywhich the grounding of basic words; acquired via direct sensorimotor experience; istransferred to higher-order words via linguistic descriptions.

Putting geometry and function together-towards a psychologically-plausible computational model for spatial language comprehension,Kenny R Coventry; Angelo Cangelosi; Dan Joyce; Lynn V Richards,Describing the position of objects in space necessitates a mapping between the spatialrepresentation (s); computed by the visual system; and the language processing system.However; it turns out that spatial description is influenced not only by where objects are inspace; but also by the functions that objects afford; and the functional relations betweenobjects. For example; the preposition at in the woman is at her desk indicates not only thatthe woman is in close proximity to the desk (a topological-geometric relation); but that she islikely to be working there (an extrageometric functional relation). Indeed; there is muchempirical work showing that meaning of spatial prepositions across a range of languagesinvolves the instantiation of both geometric and extra-geometric factors (eg; Carlson-Radvansky & Radvansky; 1996; Coventry; Prat-Sala & Richards; 2001).

A newstrategy utilizing the vector approach has been developed to accomplish a specific motioncapture task. The arm motion of the operator is captured by a Kinect sensor andprogrammed with Processing software. Two MYO armbands with the inertial measurementunit embedded are worn on the operator's arm; which is used to detect the upper arm motionof the human operator. This is utilized to recognize and to calculate the precise speed of thephysical motion of the operator's arm.

Embodied language and number learning in developmental robots,Angelo Cangelosi; Anthony Morse; Alessandro Di Nuovo; Marek Rucinski; Francesca Stramandinoli; Davide Marocco; Vivian De La,Computational models can play an important role in cognitive science as they permit thetesting and validation of psychology theories by forcing the operationalization of general(and sometimes loose) theoretical concepts into detailed operations which must run on acomputer program. Models capable of replicating known behavioral and cognitivephenomena; including the reproduction of errors and impaired performance; can also beused to make further predictions to revise and refine psychological theories (Pezzulo et al.2013; Cangelosi & Parisi 2002).

Affordances of distractors and compatibility effects: a study with the computational model TRoPICALS,Daniele Caligiore; Anna M Borghi; Domenico Parisi; Rob Ellis; Angelo Cangelosi; Gianluca Baldassarre,Abstract: Seeing an object activates in the brain both visual and action codes. Crucialevidence supporting this view is offered by compatibility effect experiments (Ellis etal.(2007).

TRoPICALS (Caligiore et al.(2010). Psychol Rev) is acomputational model developed to study compatibility effects. It provides a generalhypothesis about the brain mechanisms underlying compatibility effects; suggesting that thetop-down bias from prefrontal cortex (PFC); and its agreement or disagreement with theaffordances of objects; plays a key role in such phenomena.

Hierarchical reinforcement learning as creative problem solving,Thomas R Colin; Tony Belpaeme; Angelo Cangelosi; Nikolas Hemion,Abstract Although creativity is studied from philosophy to cognitive robotics; a definition hasproven elusive. We argue for emphasizing the creative process (the cognition of the creativeagent); rather than the creative product (the artifact or behavior). Owing to developments inexperimental psychology; the process approach has become an increasingly attractive wayof characterizing creative problem solving. In particular; the phenomenon of insight; in whichan individual arrives at a solution through a sudden change in perspective; is a crucialcomponent of the process of creativity. These developments resonate with advances inmachine learning; in particular hierarchical and modular approaches; as the field of artificialintelligence aims for general solutions to problems that typically rely on creativity in humansor other animals.

Co-exploring actuator antagonism and bio-inspired control in a printable robot arm,Martin F Stoelen; Fabio Bonsignorio; Angelo Cangelosi,Abstract The human arm is capable of performing fast targeted movements with highprecision; say in pointing with a mouse cursor; but is inherently 'soft'due to the muscles;tendons and other tissues of which it is composed. Robot arms are also becoming softer; toenable robustness when operating in real-world environments; and to make them safer touse around people. But softness comes at a price; typically an increase in the complexity ofthe control required for a given task speed/accuracy requirement. Here we explore how fastand precise joint movements can be simply and effectively performed in a soft robot arm; bytaking inspiration from the human arm.

Alignment to the Actions of a Robot,Anna-Lisa Vollmer; Katharina J Rohlfing; Britta Wrede; Angelo Cangelosi,Abstract Alignment is a phenomenon observed in human conversation: Dialog partners'behavior converges in many respects. Such alignment has been proposed to be automaticand the basis for communicating successfully. Recent research on human–computer dialogpromotes a mediated communicative design account of alignment according to which theextent of alignment is influenced by interlocutors' beliefs about each other. Our work aims atadding to these findings in two ways.(a) Our work investigates alignment of manual actions;instead of lexical choice.(b) Participants interact with the iCub humanoid robot; instead of anartificial computer dialog system. Our results confirm that alignment also takes place in thedomain of actions. We were not able to replicate the results of the original study in general inthis setting; but in accordance with its findings; participants with a high questionnaire …,International Journal of Social Robotics,2015,2
Embodied intelligence,Angelo Cangelosi; Josh Bongard; Martin H Fischer; Stefano Nolfi,Abstract Embodied intelligence is the computational approach to the design andunderstanding of intelligent behavior in embodied and situated agents through theconsideration of the strict coupling between the agent and its environment (situatedness);mediated by the constraints of the agent's own body; perceptual and motor system; andbrain (embodiment). The emergence of the field of embodied intelligence is closely linked toparallel developments in computational intelligence and robotics; where the focus is onmorphological computation and sensory–motor coordination in evolutionary roboticsmodels; and in neuroscience and cognitive sciences where the focus is on embodiedcognition and developmental robotics models of embodied symbol learning.

Talking about task progress: towards integrating task planning and dialog for assistive robotic services,Frank Broz; Alessandro Di Nuovo; Tony Belpaeme; Angelo Cangelosi,Abstract: The use of service robots to assist ageing people in their own homes has thepotential to allow people to maintain their independence; increasing their health and qualityof life. In many assistive applications; robots perform tasks on people's behalf that they areunable or unwilling to monitor directly. It is important that users be given useful andappropriate information about task progress. People being assisted in homes and otherrealworld environments are likely be engaged in other activities while they wait for a service;so information should also be presented in an appropriate; nonintrusive manner. This paperpresents a human-robot interaction experiment investigating what type of feedback peopleprefer in verbal updates by a service robot about distributed assistive services.

Machine learning of visual object categorization: an application of the SUSTAIN model,Giovanni Sirio Carmantini; Angelo Cangelosi; Andy J Wills,Formal models of categorization are psychological theories that try to describe the processof categorization in a lawful way; using the language of mathematics. Their mathematicalformulation makes it possible for the models to generate precise; quantitative predictions.SUSTAIN (Love; Medin & Gureckis; 2004) is a powerful formal model of categorization thathas been used to model a range of human experimental data; describing the process ofcategorization in terms of an adaptive clustering principle. Love et al.(2004) suggested apossible application of the model in the field of object recognition and categorization. Thepresent study explores this possibility; investigating at the same time the utility of using aformal model of categorization in a typical machine learning task.

Online learning of sensorimotor interactions using a neural network with time-delayed inputs,Martin F Stoelen; Fabio Bonsignorio; Carlos Balaguer; Davide Marocco; Angelo Cangelosi,The work described here explores an approach for learning online the sensorimotorinteraction that a robot has with the world; and the higher-level concepts grounded in thisinteraction. A type of spatiotemporal connectionist neural network was implemented. Inconsists of a set of time-delayed input layers which receive both low-level sensor inputs andhigh-level labels and hypotheses. Each input value activates a range of neurons; based ona Gaussian distribution. A Hebb-like learning rule is used online to associate activationsfrom inputs in the past with activations from inputs in the present. Prediction of futureactivation is then performed by shifting all inputs one time-step back in time and propagatingactivation to the present time layers.

Towards a bio-inspired cognitive architecture for short-term memory in humanoid robots,Fabio Ruini; Jens K Apel; Anthony F Morse; Angelo Cangelosi; Rob Ellis; Jeremy Goslin; Martin H Fischer,Abstract Short-Term Memory (STM) is a crucial weapon in humans' cognitive arsenal as itallows them to avoid a purely sensory-motor existence. Many theoretical models have beenproposed over the years attempting to capture the essential mechanisms of STM. Amongstthese; one of the most prominent is the “Multi-Store Model” proposed by Atkinson andShiffrin [1]; later extended into the “Search of Associative Memory” model [2]. ReplicatingSTM capabilities on a robotic platform is not a challenging issue if we just look at it as amechanism to store information for the time needed to perform a certain task. Rather; moreinteresting is to investigate how to provide a robot with such feature in a simple andbiologically-inspired fashion.

More specifically; higher-achieving studentstend to be more accurate but underconfident when compared to their lower-achievingcounterparts who are less accurate and overconfident. Calibration inaccuracy andoverconfidence among the lower-achieving students has been linked to theories of self-serving bias; attribution theory; self-handicapping strategies; and ego defense (Bol et al.2005; Hacker et al. 2008). Lowerachieving students seem to anchor their calibrationjudgments on optimistic yet inaccurate beliefs about their own abilities rather than priorperformance in an effort to protect their sense of self-worth. Another consistent finding is thatpredictions are almost always less accurate than postdictions. This phenomenon is knownas the testing effect or the upgrading of prediction accuracy (Pressley and Ghatala 1990) …,*,2012,2
Communication and Distributed Control in Multi-Agent Systems,Angelo Cangelosi; Fabio Ruini,Abstract: This project has focused on the design of distributed autonomous controllers forcollective behavior of Micro-unmanned Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). Two alternative approachesto this topic are introduced: one based upon the Evolutionary Robotics (ER) paradigm; theother one upon flocking principles. Three computer simulators have been developed inorder to carry out the required experiments; all of them having their focus on the modeling offixed-wing aircraft flight dynamics. The employment of fixed-wing aircraft rather than theomni-directional robots typically employed in collective robotics significantly increases thecomplexity of the challenges that an autonomous controller has to face. This is mostly due tothe strict motion constraints associated with fixed-wing platforms that require a high degreeof accuracy by the controller.

From sensorimotor knowledge to abstract symbolic representations,Francesca Stramadinoli; Marek Ruciński; Joanna Znajdek; Katharina J Rohlfing; Angelo Cangelosi,Developmental cognitive robotics permits the modeling of different brain and behavioral processesthat take place during child development. In contrast to purely computational modelingmethods; the principal advantage of the robotic approach is that it enables inherent inclusionof different aspects of sensorimotor control and representation in the model; consistent with theembodied view of cognition. Traditional cognitive robotic modeling research puts however alot of emphasis on the processes connected with motor behavior itself.

Cellular Automata Models of Human Traffic,Richard Holden; Angelo Cangelosi,In the area of artificial life and multi-agent systems traffic flow has been modelled withcellular automata; ie using simple locally defined rules of communication in the medium ofcellular space (Nagel and Rasmussen 1994; Blue and Adler 2000a; 2000b). This use ofcellular automata for traffic modelling demonstrates how populations of simple units caninteract through time and produce different levels of complexity and unpredictabilitydepending on the level of interaction within the system. We replicate a car traffic model(Nagel and Rasmussen 1994) in order to show how 'phase transition'behaviour depends onspecific pre-defined parameters. We also replicate and extend some more complex two-dimensional pedestrian movement models (Blue and Adler 2000a; 2000b).

Language and the acquisition of implicit and explicit knowledge: A pilot study using neural networks,Alberto Greco; Angelo Cangelosi,Abstract In experimental psychology there is wide evidence that language supports thinking.Bow this" support" works; however; is still not clear. One hypothesis is that categorization iseasier when linguistic labels are available; because implicitly detected similarities and rulescan be made explicit. We want to test this hypothesis using a neural-network simulation.Language is not a common sensorial input; but acts as a" commenf'on the world (Parisi;1994). When linguistic labels are systematically coupled with objects; either of the two inputscan elicit one single response (eg articulating a name). In real situations labels can benames for the objects or may denotate specific features or functions of them. We constructeda neural-network simulation which learned to label a small set of stimuli in three inputconditions (visual features; label; label+ visual features); classifjing them according to …,Cognitive Systems,1999,2

Previous attempts mostly focused on theanalysis of hand-crafted geometric features and the use of external sensors in order to allowthe vehicle to approach the land-pad. In this article; we propose a method based on deepreinforcement learning which only requires low-resolution images taken from a down-looking camera in order to identify the position of the marker and land the quadrotor on it.The proposed approach is based on a hierarchy of Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) which areused as high-level control policy for the navigation toward the marker.

Understanding Natural Language Sentences with Word Embedding and Multi-modal Interaction,Junpei Zhong; A Cangelosi; T Ogata; Chenguang Yang,Abstract—Understanding and grounding human commands with natural languages havebeen a fundamental requirement for service robotic applications. Although there have beenseveral attempts toward this goal; the bottleneck still exists to store and process the corporaof natural language in an interaction system. Currently; the neural-and statstical-based(N&S) natural language processing have shown potential to solve this problem. With theavailability of large data-sets nowadays; these processing methods are able to extractsemantic relationships while parsing a corpus of natural language (NL) text without muchhuman design; compared with the rule-based language processing methods.

Graceful degradation under noise on brain inspired robot controllers,Ricardo de Azambuja; Frederico B Klein; Martin F Stoelen; Samantha V Adams; Angelo Cangelosi,Abstract How can we build robot controllers that are able to work under harsh conditions; butwithout experiencing catastrophic failures? As seen on the recent Fukushima's nucleardisaster; standard robots break down when exposed to high radiation environments. Herewe present the results from two arrangements of Spiking Neural Networks; based on theLiquid State Machine (LSM) framework; that were able to gracefully degrade under theeffects of a noisy current injected directly into each simulated neuron. These noisy currentscould be seen; in a simplified way; as the consequences of exposition to non-destructiveradiation. The results show that not only can the systems withstand noise; but one of theconfigurations; the Modular Parallel LSM; actually improved its results; in a certain range;when the noise levels were increased.

A developmental Bayesian model of trust in artificial cognitive systems,Massimiliano Patacchiola; Angelo Cangelosi,In human-robot interaction trust is one of the main factors to take into account for enablingeffective interaction. Limited models exist that delineate the development of trust in realworld scenarios. Reshaping one of these models we show how a probabilistic frameworkbased on Bayesian Networks (BNs) can incorporate the reliability of information sources intothe decisional process of artificial systems. Furthermore; using a developmental approachwe gain some insight on how children estimate people's reliability and how some aspects ofthe Theory of Mind (ToM) can affect that estimation. To test the model we reproduced adevelopmental experiment in a computational simulation and we embedded the BNs insidean artificial agent. The simulation results are in line with the real data; and confirm that BNshave the potential for being included as trust evaluator modules in robotic systems.,Development and Learning and Epigenetic Robotics (ICDL-EpiRob); 2016 Joint IEEE International Conference on,2016,1

Children in a wonderland: How language and scale errors may be linked,Beata J Grzyb; Allegra Cattani; Angelo Cangelosi; Caroline Floccia,Previous research showed that young children sometimes fail to use information aboutobject size and make a serious attempt to perform impossible actions on miniature objects.Such scale errors have been hypothesized to result from immaturity in the interaction of thetwo visual streams; namely the visual stream for action and the visual stream for perception;coupled to a lack of inhibitory control in children. Here we propose that such dissociation inthe action-perception system may be influenced by the developing language skills andreport new evidence showing that children in a particular period of their languagedevelopment are more prone to show scale errors. The results showed that the total numberof nouns; but not adjectives in children's productive vocabulary seems to be an importantfactor for predicting scale errors.

A cognitive robotic model of mental rotation,Kristsana Seepanomwan; Daniele Caligiore; Gianluca Baldassarre; Angelo Cangelosi,Mental rotation processes allow an agent to mentally rotate an image of an object in order tosolve a given task; for example to make a decision on whether two objects presented withdifferent rotational orientation are same or different. This article proposes a bio-constrainedneural network model that accounts for the mental rotation processes based on neuralmechanisms involving not only visual imagery but also affordance encoding; motorsimulation; and the anticipation of the visual consequences of actions. The proposed modelis in agreement with the theoretical and empirical research on mental rotation. The model isvalidated with a simulated humanoid robot (iCub) engaged in solving a typical mentalrotation task.

Active vision and depth estimation: Towards a peripersonal space encoding in a humanoid robot,Salomon Ramirez-Contla; Davide Marocco; Angelo Cangelosi,Peripersonal space is defined as the space around a person's body; which is the space thatdefines the region of interactions between an agents and its environment. Estimating thedistances at which objects are; in other words delimiting reachable (peripersonal) and notreachable (extrapersonal) space; is very important in order to properly interact with theenvironment and learn from it. Interestingly; behavioural and neurophysiological studiessuggest that the brain encodes the peripersonal space differently from the extrapersonalspace and that the coding of the former is achieved through the integration of differentmodalities (Farné et al.; 1998).

A representational redescription method using competitive learning,Alberto Greco; Angelo Cangelosi,Abstract In a previous simulation a network learned labeling a small set of stimuli in threeinput conditions (visual features; label; label+ visual features); classifying them according tocolour; function; object name. Results suggested that in different input conditions thenetwork internal representation reflects the explicit semantic structure of stimuli. Evidence onthe mediating role of linguistic label was suggested by cluster analysis: in the three inputconditions a single object is represented very similarly but it has different representations inthe label+ features condition; depending on the label. One limit of this kind of models is thattransferring acquired knowledge to other tasks would require network retraining.

From Babies to Robots: The Contribution of Developmental Robotics to Developmental Psychology,Angelo Cangelosi; Matthew Schlesinger,Abstract The latest developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning; and theparallel advances in robotics; have contributed recently to a shift in the scientific approach tomodeling human intelligence. These innovations; accompanied by the new emphasis onembodied and grounded cognition in AI and psychology; have led to the establishment ofthe field of developmental robotics. This field features an interdisciplinary approach; built oncollaboration between cognitive robotics and child psychology; to the autonomous design ofbehavioral and cognitive capabilities in artificial cognitive agents; such as robots; which isinspired by developmental principles and mechanisms observed in children. In this article;we illustrate the benefits of this approach by presenting a case study of a baby robot with afocus on the role of embodiment during early word learning; as well as an overview of …,Child Development Perspectives,2018,*

Emotion recognition in the wild using deep neural networks and Bayesian classifiers,Luca Surace; Massimiliano Patacchiola; Elena Battini Sönmez; William Spataro; Angelo Cangelosi,Abstract Group emotion recognition in the wild is a challenging problem; due to theunstructured environments in which everyday life pictures are taken. Some of the obstaclesfor an effective classification are occlusions; variable lighting conditions; and image quality.In this work we present a solution based on a novel combination of deep neural networksand Bayesian classifiers. The neural network works on a bottom-up approach; analyzingemotions expressed by isolated faces. The Bayesian classifier estimates a global emotionintegrating top-down features obtained through a scene descriptor.

This architecture is presented in light ofthis inspiration; mapping the modules to the different functions in the brain. We emphasizethe importance and effects of these modules in the robot; and their similarity to the effects inhumans with lesions on the frontal lobe. Developmental studies related to these functionsare also considered; focusing on how they relate to the robot's different modules and howthe developmental stages in a child relate to improvements in the different modules in thissystem.

Active lead-in variability affects motor memory formation and slows motor learning,Ian S Howard; Christopher Ford; Angelo Cangelosi; David W Franklin,Abstract Rapid learning can be critical to ensure elite performance in a changing world or torecover basic movement after neural injuries. Recently it was shown that the variability offollow-through movements affects the rate of motor memory formation. Here we investigate iflead-in movement has a similar effect on learning rate. We hypothesized that both modalityand variability of lead-in movement would play critical roles; with simulations suggesting thatonly changes in active lead-in variability would exhibit slower learning. We tested thisexperimentally using a two-movement paradigm; with either visual or active initial lead-inmovements preceeding a second movement performed in a force field. As predicted;increasing active lead-in variability reduced the rate of motor adaptation; whereas changesin visual lead-in variability had little effect. This demonstrates that distinct neural tuning …,Scientific reports,2017,*

Where is my forearm? Clustering of body parts from simultaneous tactile and linguistic input using sequential mapping,Karla Stepanova; Matej Hoffmann; Zdenek Straka; Frederico B Klein; Angelo Cangelosi; Michal Vavrecka,Abstract: Humans and animals are constantly exposed to a continuous stream of sensoryinformation from different modalities. At the same time; they form more compressedrepresentations like concepts or symbols. In species that use language; this process isfurther structured by this interaction; where a mapping between the sensorimotor conceptsand linguistic elements needs to be established. There is evidence that children might belearning language by simply disambiguating potential meanings based on multipleexposures to utterances in different contexts (cross-situational learning). In existing models;the mapping between modalities is usually found in a single step by directly usingfrequencies of referent and meaning co-occurrences. In this paper; we present an extensionof this one-step mapping and introduce a newly proposed sequential mapping algorithm …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1706.02490,2017,*

Short-term plasticity in a liquid state machine biomimetic robot arm controller,R De Azambuja; FB Klein; SV Adams; MF Stoelen; A Cangelosi,Biological neural networks are able to control limbs in different scenarios; with highprecision and robustness. As neural networks in living beings communicate through spikes;modern neuromorphic systems try to mimic them making use of spike-based neuron models.Liquid State Machines (LSM); a special type of Reservoir Computing system made of spikingunits; when it was first introduced; had plasticity on an external layer and also through Short-Term Plasticity (STP) within the reservoir itself. However; most neuromorphic hardwarecurrently available does not implement both Short-Term Depression and Facilitation andsome of them don't support STP at all.

Decreased attention to object size information in scale errors performers,Beata J Grzyb; Angelo Cangelosi; Allegra Cattani; Caroline Floccia,Abstract Young children sometimes make serious attempts to perform impossible actions onminiature objects as if they were full-size objects. The existing explanations of these curiousaction errors assume (but never explicitly tested) children's decreased attention to objectsize information. This study investigated the attention to object size information in scaleerrors performers. Two groups of children aged 18–25 months (N= 52) and 48–60 months(N= 23) were tested in two consecutive tasks: an action task that replicated the original scaleerrors elicitation situation; and a looking task that involved watching on a computer screenactions performed with adequate to inadequate size object. Our key finding–that childrenperforming scale errors in the action task subsequently pay less attention to size changesthan non-scale errors performers in the looking task–suggests that the origins of scale …,Infant Behavior and Development,2017,*
Cross-Situational Learning with Bayesian Generative Models for Multimodal Category and Word Learning in Robots,Akira Taniguchi; Tadahiro Taniguchi; Angelo Cangelosi,Abstract In this paper; we propose a Bayesian generative model that can form multiplecategories based on each sensory-channel and can associate words with any of the foursensory-channels (action; position; object; and color).

Learning bidirectional connections between areas with standard spike-timing-dependent plasticity,M Klein; A Cangelosi; T Wennekers,Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a learning algorithm that is simple; biologicallyplausible; and powerful. Hence; one would expect STDP (likely in combination with otherlearning algorithms) to be a key component in cortical models of higher cognitive functions;such as language comprehension or production. Such models would need to involvemultiple brain areas and bidirectional links between representations in those different areas.However; STDP is an asymmetrical learning algorithm (in contrast to classical Hebbianlearning; which is symmetrical). This makes the acquisition of bilateral connections betweentwo neurons almost impossible and bilateral connections between representations verychallenging. Here; we propose a solution based on specific connectivity patterns. Then;using numerical simulations; we show that our approach allows STDP to create strong …,*,2017,*

These regulation can bedepicted in the Bayesian framework; that is why cognitive agents are able to generatebehaviours with subtle differences according to their emotion or recognize the emotion byperception. A novel recurrent neural network called recurrent neural network with parametricbias units (RNNPB) runs in three modes; constructing a two-level emotion regulatedlearning model; was further applied to testify this theory in two different cases.,Control and Decision Conference (CCDC); 2016 Chinese,2016,*

What must come down goes up-the effect of noise on weights in spike-timing-dependent plasticity,Michael Klein; Angelo Cangelosi; Thomas Wennekers,In large-scale spiking neural models that learn with spike-timing-dependent plasticity(STDP); it is a crucial; but difficult problem to balance synaptic potentiation (necessary tolearn a task) and synaptic depression (necessary to counteract accidental weight increaseand to balance overall firing rates). Adding random noise and choosing parameters suchthat inhibition slightly dominates excitation [1; 2] is considered one way of accomplishingthis. With the learning rule being standard STDP [2]; the parameter that determines whetherinhibition or excitation dominates is the so-called a-parameter; defined as the ratio betweenparameters that determine amount of depression and those that determine amount ofpotentiation [3]. If the a-parameter is set to a value greater than 1; the weights are assumedto go down. However; using numerical simulations; we demonstrate that this is not the …,BMC neuroscience,2015,*

A Unified Simulation Scenario for Language Development; Evolution and Historical,Domenico Parisi; Angelo Cangelosi,When we see a human being who is talking or is listening to and understanding thelanguage produced by someone else; we may ask: What is the origin and past history of thisability? How has this ability taken its present form? Asking and answering questions aboutthe origin and past history of biological; behavioral; and cultural phenomena is a crucial stepto an understanding of these phenomena. Biological; behavioral; and cultural phenomenahave an intrinsically historical nature. Their current properties are the result of their pasthistory and they retain in themselves the traces of this past history. Language is at the sametime a biological; a behavioral; and a cultural phenomenon. Therefore; to understand whatlanguage is now requires that we reconstruct how it is has become what it is now.

A Neuro-Robotics Model for the Acquisition of Higher Order Concepts in Action and Language.,Francesca Stramandinoli; Davide Marocco; Angelo Cangelosi,Recent neurophysiological experiments have shown that motor neurons responsible forencoding specific motor acts present different activation patterns according to the final goalof the action sequence in which that particular motor act is embedded (Fogassi et al.; 2005).This is consistent with the chain model hypothesis (Chersi et al.; 2006) according to whichthe processing of action-related sentences involves the activation of the sequence of motorneurons (chain) directly involved in the sentence. We have developed a cognitive roboticmodel for the learning of compositional actions from combination of motor primitives. Thismodel uses recurrent neural networks. Simulation results have shown that motor primitiveshave different activation patterns according to the action's sequence in which they arecontained.

Calibration inaccuracy andoverconfidence among the lower-achieving students has been linked to theories of self-serving bias; attribution theory; self-handicapping strategies; and ego defense (Bol et al.2005; Hacker et al. 2008). Lowerachieving students seem to anchor their calibrationjudgments on optimistic yet inaccurate beliefs about their own abilities rather than priorperformance in an effort to protect their sense of self-worth.

Robotics and embodied agent modelling of the evolution of language,Angelo Cangelosi,A robotic and embodied approach to the modeling of the evolution of language addresses variousaspects of language origins such as prelinguistic social coordination; signaling behavior; andthe emergence of compositional lexicons. Robot language experiments typically involve tasksin which the robots must communicate about objects and entities in the environment; about theirphysical interaction with objects; and about their body posture. Embodied agents are multiagentsystems in which a population of simulated agents live in a shared environment; can receivevisual; auditory; and tactile information about the world; and can act on it. These experimentstypically involve communication about spatial navigation and foraging tasks.

Lexicon acquisition algorithms and random occupancy problems,José F Fontanari; Angelo Cangelosi,Lexicon acquisition algorithms involve the repeated interaction between at least two agentswho must reach a consensus on how to name N objects using H words. Here we considerminimal models of two types of learning algorithms: cross-situational learning in which thelearner determines the meaning of a word by looking for something in common across allobserved uses of that word; and operant conditioning learning in which there is strongfeedback between speaker and hearer about the intended meaning of the words. Despitethe stark differences between these learning schemes we show that they yield the samecommunication accuracy in the limits of large N and H; which coincides with result of theclassical occupancy problem of randomly assigning N objects to H words.,CoRR,2009,*

Psycho-physiological patterns of musical emotions and their relation with music structure,Eduardo Coutinho; Angelo Cangelosi,We asked 39 participants to give continuous self-reports of the intensity (Arousal) andhedonic value (Valence) of the emotions felt while listening to 9 pieces of westerninstrumental art (classical) music. Simultaneously we recorded their Heart Rate (HR) andSkin Conductance Response (SCR) for the full length of the pieces. Arousal was found toincrease for higher levels of tempo; loudness; mean pitch; sharpness and timbral width; andValence was correlated with variations in tempo and (tonal) dissonance. Psychological andphysiological reports showed that increased Arousal and Valence are related with increasedSCR; while increased HR related with higher Arousal.

Language; categorization; and representation,Alberto Greco; Angelo Cangelosi,Abstract In experimental psychology there is wide evidence that language supports thinking.How this “support” works; however; is still not clear. One hypothesis is that categorization iseasier when linguistic labels are available; because implicitly detected similarities and rulescan be made explicit. We want to test this hypothesis using a NN simulation. Language isnot a common sensorial input; but acts as a “comment” on the world (Parisi; 1994). Whenlinguistic labels are sistematically coupled with objects; either of the two inputs can elicit onesingle response (eg articulating a name). In real situations labels can be names for theobjects or may denotate specific features or functions of them. We constructed a NN whichlearned labeling a small set of stimuli in three input conditions (visual features; label; label+visual features); classifying them according to color; category; object name.

Designing Autonomous Robot Controllers for Planetary Exploration: A Model of a Mars Rover,Martin Peniak; Barry Bentley; Davide Marocco; Christos Ampatzis; Francesco Biscani; Dario Izzo; Angelo Cangelosi,After the successful mission of the Mars Pathfinder; in which the first semi-autonomousvehicle explored the Martian surface; other missions to Mars have been launched or areunder development. Research on Mars robots provides an ideal test platform for the study ofautonomous robotics; for example the ability of robots to navigate efficiently within unknownenvironments. We have developed a computer model of a planetary rover and Martianenvironment using the ODE physics engine. This simulation model is being used toinvestigate the design of autonomous neural controllers with different sensor configurationsusing the evolutionary robotics approach. In a first study; we investigated the use of aninfrared sensor system for planetary rover exploration in rough terrains. The control systemfor the robot consisted of an artificial neural network trained using evolutionary …,*,*,*

L'EMERGERE DEL LINGUAGGIO,Angelo Cangelosi; Huck Turner,In diverse parti di questo volume è stato più volte discusso come la mente sia un sistemacomplesso; gli organismi biologici siano sistemi complessi; e il cervello sia a sua voltacomplesso. Il linguaggio dipende da tutti questi sistemi; e di conseguenza ne condivide ivari livelli di complessità. Questa complessità è spiegata dal fatto che il sistema linguistico ècaratterizzato da una serie di elementi che interagiscono tra loro in maniera distribuita;autonoma; e non lineare. Il processo di interazione e autoorganizzazione di questecomponenti porta all'emergenza di strutture linguistiche e comportamenti complessi; comela sintassi e la comunicazione linguistica tra gruppi di individui. Le componenti di base delsistema linguistico appartengono a una varietà di domini. Alcune sono abilità biologiche eadattive; altre dipendono da fattori individuali; altre ancora da fattori sociali.

Sensorimotor Input as a Language Generalisation Tool,Junpei Zhong; Martin Peniak; Jun Tani; Tetsuya Ogata; Angelo Cangelosi,Abstract The paper presents a neurorobotics cognitive model to explain the understandingand generalisation of nouns and verbs combinations when a vocal command consisting of averb-noun sentence is provided to a humanoid robot. This generalisation process is donevia the grounding process: different objects are being interacted; and associated; withdifferent motor behaviours; following a learning approach inspired by developmentallanguage acquisition in infants. This cognitive model is based on Multiple Time-scaleRecurrent Neural Networks (MTRNN). With the data obtained from object manipulation taskswith a humanoid robot platform; the robotic agent implemented with this model can groundthe primitive embodied structure of verbs through training with verb-noun combinationsamples. Moreover; we show that a functional hierarchical architecture; based on MTRNN …,*,*,*

Visual and linguistic cues to graspable objects and graspable parts.,Andriy Myachykov; Rob Ellis; Angelo Cangelosi; Martin H Fischer; Martin H Fischer,Abstract Mentally representing manipulable objects involves automatic encoding of theircorresponding affordances–options for interacting with the object. Two experimentsinvestigated how activation of objects' manual affordances is triggered by visual andlinguistic cues and whether graspable object parts play a special role in this process. First;analysis of participants' motor and oculomotor behaviour confirmed that perceptual andlinguistic cues potentiate activation of grasp affordances. Second; a differentialvisualattention mechanism is proposed for the activation of individual compatibility effectsassociated with target and distractor objects. Third; we registered an implicit attentionattraction effect from an object's handles suggesting that graspable parts automaticallyattract attention during object identification.

Visual and linguistic cues to graspable objects.,Martin H Fischer; Andriy Myachykov; Rob Ellis; Angelo Cangelosi; Martin H Fischer,Abstract Two experiments investigated (1) how activation of manual affordances is triggeredby visual and linguistic cues to manipulable objects and (2) whether graspable object partsplay a special role in this process. Participants pressed a key to categorize manipulabletarget objects co-presented with manipulable distractor objects on a computer screen. Threefactors were varied in Experiment 1:(1) the target's and (2) the distractor's handles'orientation congruency with the lateral manual response and (3) the visual focus on one ofthe objects. In Experiment 2; a linguistic cue factor was added to these three factors–participants heard the name of one of the two objects prior to the target display onset.Analysis of participants' motor and oculomotor behaviour confirmed that perceptual andlinguistic cues potentiated activation of grasp affordances.

Multiple Time Scales Recurrent Neural Network for Complex Action Acquisition: Model Enhancement with GPU-CUDA Processing,Martin PENIAK; Angelo CANGELOSI,Abstract. This chapter presents novel results of complex action learning experiments basedon the use of extended multiple time-scales recurrent neural networks (MTRNN). Theexperiments were carried out with the iCub humanoid robot; as a model of thedevelopmental learning of motor primitives as the basis of sensorimotor and linguisticcompositionality. The model was implemented through the Aquila cognitive robotics toolkit;which supports the CUDA architecture and makes use of massively parallel GPUs (graphicsprocessing units). The results show that the model was able to learn and successfullyreproduce multiple behavioral sequences of actions in an object manipulation task scenariousing large-scale MTRNNs. This forms the basis on ongoing experiments on action andlanguage compositionality.,Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science IV,*,*

GPU-accelerated Action Acquisition Through Multiple Time Scales Recurrent Neural Network,Martin Peniak; Davide Marocco; Angelo Cangelosi,• Humans are able to acquire many skilled behaviors during their life-times. The learning ofcomplex behaviours is achieved through a constant repetition of the same movements overand over; with certain components segmented into reusable elements known as motorprimitives. These motor primitives are then flexibly reused and dynamically integrated intonovel sequences of actions [1].• For example; the action of lifting an object can be brokendown into a combination of multiple motor primitives. Some motor primitives would beresponsible for reaching the object; some for grasping it and some for lifting it. Theseprimitives are represented in a general manner and should therefore be applicable toobjects with different properties.,*,*,*

The term'embodiment'has come to mean; epistemologicallyand ontologically at least; very different things across these disciplines depending upon thestatus of a central entity: what we may understand as the body. We can take the view of thebody as a functional tool that extends the neuroplasticity of the developing brain into theenvironment (Chalmers and Clark; 2008). Or of the body as a developing multi-sensoryorganism that is structurally and historically coupled to an environment (Varela et al; 1993).Or disregard the body altogether as a stumbling block that unnecessarily separates' …,*,*,*

Learning and Transition of Symbols: Towards a Dynamical Model of a Symbolic Individual,C Lyon; A Cangelosi; CL Nehaniv,Abstract. We aim at constructing a model for an agent showing symbolic activities. Based ona discussion of the concept of a symbolic system we propose correspondences betweensymbolic activities and the behaviour of dynamical systems in which attractors develop inresponse to inputs. We examine correspondences such as; symbols to attractors; symbolmanipulations to transitions among attractors; and regularities in symbol manipulation to theorder of the transitions. By using a dynamical system showing transitions among attractors;we may be able to represent symbolic activities; in part. We try to construct such a systemwith a kind of chaotic neural networks; derived from the Hopfield model. We confirm that thissystem has multi-attractors and shows transitions among attractors in some parameterregions. Further; we investigate the response of the system to certain external inputs …,*,*,*
Speech and Action Integration in Humanoid Robots: Simulation Experiments with iCub Platform,V Tikhanoff; A Cangelosi; G Metta,Abstract—Building intelligent systems with human level of competence is the ultimate grandchallenge for science and technology in general; and especially for the computationalintelligence community. Recent theories in autonomous cognitive systems have focused onthe close integration (grounding) of communication with perception; categorization andaction. Cognitive systems are essential for integrated multi-platform systems that arecapable of sensing and communicating. This paper presents a cognitive system for ahumanoid robot that integrates abilities such as object detection and recognition; which aremerged with natural language understanding and refined motor control. The work includesrobotic simulation experiments showing that a humanoid robot (iCub platform) is able toacquire behavioral; cognitive; and linguistic skills through individual and social learning …,*,*,*
Grounding transfer di simboli con reti neurali,A Greco; T Riga; A Cangelosi,Il symbol grounding è uno dei principali problemi incontrati dalla metodologia simulativa inpsicologia. Nelle simulazioni di tipo tradizionale; il significato dei simboli non è intrinseco alsistema ma dipende da una interpretazione esterna ad esso. I programmi; infatti; sonoinsiemi di regole o algoritmi per manipolare simboli; che non hanno di per sé significato mache vengono sistematicamente interpretati come significativi. Lo stesso problema si puòriscontrare nelle simulazioni con reti neurali; quando agli input e output vengano attribuitisignificati psicologici che dipendono in realtà dall'interpretazione di chi le costruisce o usa.Lo scopo del presente lavoro è mostrare come questo problema possa essere affrontato conla metodologia connessionista.

Categories and word meanings are not single entities in the mind,Domenico Parisi Daniele Denaro; Angelo Cangelosi,Abstract But the idea that categories and word meanings are single mental entities can alsohave a distributed connectionist interpretation. In distributed connectionist models an entityis not represented by a single network unit as in localist connectionist models. However;categories or word meanings can be considered as corresponding to some particularpattern of activation on an ensemble of network units and therefore still interpreted as singleentities. Categories and word meanings tend to be interpreted as single entities that areactivated in the mind when an individual categorizes the world or uses language. We arguethat this view is mistaken. Connectionist simulations of populations of neural networks thatlive and reproduce in an environment show that categories and word meanings are openand changing collections of activation patterns in the network's internal units rather than …,*,*,*
