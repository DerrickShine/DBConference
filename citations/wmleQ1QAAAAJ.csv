Ensuring distributed accountability for data sharing in the cloud,Smitha Sundareswaran; Anna Squicciarini; Dan Lin,Cloud computing enables highly scalable services to be easily consumed over the Interneton an as-needed basis. A major feature of the cloud services is that users' data are usuallyprocessed remotely in unknown machines that users do not own or operate. While enjoyingthe convenience brought by this new emerging technology; users' fears of losing control oftheir own data (particularly; financial and health data) can become a significant barrier to thewide adoption of cloud services. To address this problem; in this paper; we propose a novelhighly decentralized information accountability framework to keep track of the actual usageof the users' data in the cloud.

Privacy preserving multi-factor authentication with biometrics,Abhilasha Bhargav-Spantzel; Anna C Squicciarini; Shimon Modi; Matthew Young; Elisa Bertino; Stephen J Elliott,Abstract An emerging approach to the problem of identity theft is represented by theadoption of biometric authentication systems. Such systems however present severalchallenges; related to privacy; reliability and security of the biometric data. Inter-operability isalso required among the devices used for authentication. Moreover; very often biometricauthentication in itself is not sufficient as a conclusive proof of identity and has to becomplemented with multiple other proofs of identity such as passwords; SSN; or other useridentifiers. Multi-factor authentication mechanisms are thus required to enforce strongauthentication based on the biometric and identifiers of other nature.,Journal of Computer Security,2007,143

Trust negotiations: concepts; systems; and languages,Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Anna Squicciarini,Trust negotiation is a promising approach for establishing trust in open systems like theInternet; where sensitive interactions may often occur among entities with no priorknowledge of each other. In this article; the authors present a model for trust negotiationsystems; and delineate the desiderata that ideal trust negotiation systems should satisfy. Indefining trust negotiation requirements; they consider two different issues; policy languagerequirements and system requirements. They then survey the most interesting proposals thathave been presented so far and evaluate them with respect to the identified requirements.Finally; they outline future research directions and identify the open issues that still have tobe explored.,Computing in science & engineering,2004,117
A brokerage-based approach for cloud service selection,Smitha Sundareswaran; Anna Squicciarini; Dan Lin,The expanding Cloud computing services offer great opportunities for consumers to find thebest service and best pricing; which however raises new challenges on how to select thebest service out of the huge pool. It is time-consuming for consumers to collect the necessaryinformation and analyze all service providers to make the decision. This is also a highlydemanding task from a computational perspective; because the same computations may beconducted repeatedly by multiple consumers who have similar requirements. Therefore; inthis paper; we propose a novel brokerage-based architecture in the Cloud; where the Cloudbrokers is responsible for the service selection. In particular; we design a unique indexingtechnique for managing the information of a large number of Cloud service providers. Wethen develop efficient service selection algorithms that rank potential service providers …,Cloud Computing (CLOUD); 2012 IEEE 5th International Conference on,2012,111
Establishing and protecting digital identity in federation systems,Abhilasha Bhargav-Spantzel; Anna C Squicciarini; Elisa Bertino,Abstract We develop solutions for the security and privacy of user identity information in afederation. By federation we mean a group of organizations or service providers which havebuilt trust among each other and enable sharing of user identity information amongstthemselves. Our solution supports a step by step approach according to which an individualcan first establish a digital identity followed by a secure and protected use of such identity.We first introduce a flexible approach to establish a single sign-on (SSO) ID in a federation.Then we show how a user can leverage this SSO ID to establish certified and uncertifieduser identity attributes without the dependence on PKI for user authentication. This makesthe process more usable and enhances privacy. The major contribution of this paper is anovel solution for protection against identity theft of these identity attributes.

Preventing information leakage from indexing in the cloud,Anna Squicciarini; Smitha Sundareswaran; Dan Lin,Cloud computing enables highly scalable services to be easily consumed over the Interneton an as-needed basis. While cloud computing is expanding rapidly and used by manyindividuals and organizations internationally; data protection issues in the cloud have notbeen carefully addressed at current stage. Users' fear of confidential data (particularlyfinancial and health data) leakage and loss of privacy in the cloud may become a significantbarrier to the wide adoption of cloud services. In this paper; we explore a newly emergingproblem of information leakage caused by indexing in the cloud.

Thelanguage provides a flexible way of qualifying the parties involved in the negotiation; whichrelies on a distinction between credentials and declarations. Additionally; it provides anexpressive XML encoding of disclosure policies; where a disclosure policy regulates thedisclosure of a resource by imposing conditions on both credentials and negotiations. Thelanguage we provide has been especially conceived for handling multiple andheterogeneous credentials and it is flexible enough to express a wide range of protectionrequirements.

PP-trust-X: A system for privacy preserving trust negotiations,Anna Squicciarini; Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Federica Paci; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract Trust negotiation is a promising approach for establishing trust in open systems; inwhich sensitive interactions may often occur between entities with no prior knowledge ofeach other. Although; to date several trust negotiation systems have been proposed; none ofthem fully address the problem of privacy preservation. Today; privacy is one of the majorconcerns of users when exchanging information through the Web and thus we believe thattrust negotiation systems must effectively address privacy issues in order to be widelyapplicable. For these reasons; in this paper; we investigate privacy in the context of trustnegotiations.

Achieving privacy in trust negotiations with an ontology-based approach,Anna Cinzia Squicciarini; Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Indrakshi Ray,The increasing use of Internet in a variety of distributed multiparty interactions andtransactions with strong real-time requirements has pushed the search for solutions to theproblem of attribute-based digital interactions. A promising solution today is represented byautomated trust negotiation systems. Trust negotiation systems allow subjects in differentsecurity domains to securely exchange protected resources and services. These trustnegotiation systems; however; by their nature; may represent a threat to privacy in thatcredentials; exchanged during negotiations; often contain sensitive personal information thatmay need to be selectively released. In this paper; we address the problem of preservingprivacy in trust negotiations.

PriMa access rules are tailored by the users' privacy preferences for theirprofile data; the sensitivity of the data itself; and the objective risk of disclosing this data toother users. The resulting rules are simple; yet powerful specifications indicating theadequate level of protection for each user; and are dynamically adapted to the everchanging setting of the users' preferences and SN configuration.,Proceedings of the 5th ACM Symposium on Information; Computer and Communications Security,2010,50

Although several proposals today exist of systems for the management of trustnegotiations none of them addresses in a comprehensive way the problem of privacypreservation. Privacy is today one of the major concerns of users exchanging informationthrough the Web and thus we believe that trust negotiation systems must effectively addressprivacy issues to be widely acceptable. For these reasons; in this paper we investigateprivacy in the context of trust negotiations.

Privacy policy inference of user-uploaded images on content sharing sites,Anna Cinzia Squicciarini; Dan Lin; Smitha Sundareswaran; Joshua Wede,With the increasing volume of images users share through social sites; maintaining privacyhas become a major problem; as demonstrated by a recent wave of publicized incidentswhere users inadvertently shared personal information. In light of these incidents; the needof tools to help users control access to their shared content is apparent. Toward addressingthis need; we propose an Adaptive Privacy Policy Prediction (A3P) system to help userscompose privacy settings for their images. We examine the role of social context; imagecontent; and metadata as possible indicators of users' privacy preferences.

Adaptive reordering and clustering-based framework for efficient XACML policy evaluation,Said Marouf; Mohamed Shehab; Anna Squicciarini; Smitha Sundareswaran,The adoption of XACML as the standard for specifying access control policies for variousapplications; especially web services is vastly increasing. This calls for high performanceXACML policy evaluation engines. A policy evaluation engine can easily become abottleneck when enforcing XACML policies with a large number of rules. In this paper wepropose an adaptive approach for XACML policy optimization. We apply a clusteringtechnique to policy sets based on the K-means algorithm. In addition to clustering we findthat; since a policy set has a variable number of policies and a policy has a variable numberof rules; their ordering is important for efficient execution. By clustering policy sets andreordering policies and rules in a policy set and policies respectively; we formulated andsolved the optimal policy execution problem.

The design and evaluation of accountable grid computing system,Wonjun Lee; Anna Squicciarini; Elisa Bertino,Accountability is an important aspect of any computer system. It assures that every actionexecuted in the system can be traced back to some entity. Accountability is even morecrucial for assuring the safety and security in grid systems; given the very large number ofusers active in these sophisticated environments. However; to date no comprehensiveapproach to accountability for grid systems exists. Our work addresses such inadequacy bydeveloping a comprehensive accountability system driven by policies and supported byaccountability agents. In this paper we first discuss the requirements that have driven thedesign of our accountability system and then present some interesting aspects related to ouraccountability framework.

Security and privacy in social networks,Gail-Joon Ahn; Mohamed Shehab; Anna Squicciarini,Over the past several years; social networking sites have arisen to facilitate socialinteractions on the Internet while revolutionizing how online users interact with others. Mostsocial networking sites offer the basic features of online interaction; communication; andinterest sharing; letting individuals create online profiles that other users can view.Unfortunately; current trends in social networks indirectly require users to become systemand policy administrators to protect their online contents. Social networks' security andprivacy requirements still aren't well understood or fully defined. Nevertheless; it's clear thatthey'll be quite different from classic security and privacy requirements because socialnetworks involve user-centric concerns and allow multiple users to specify security policieson shared data.

An informed model of personal information release in social networking sites,Anna Cinzia Squicciarini; Christopher Griffin,The emergence of online social networks and the growing popularity of digitalcommunication has resulted in an increasingly amount of information about individualsavailable on the Internet. Social network users are given the freedom to create complexdigital identities; and enrich them with truthful or even fake personal information. However;this freedom has led to serious security and privacy incidents; due to the role users' identitiesplay in establishing social and privacy settings. In this paper; we take a step toward a betterunderstanding of online information exposure. Based on the detailed analysis of a sample ofreal-world data; we develop a deception model for online users. The model uses a gametheoretic approach to characterizing a user's willingness to release; withhold or lie aboutinformation depending on the behavior of individuals within the user's circle of friends.

Enabling privacy-preserving image-centric social discovery,Xingliang Yuan; Xinyu Wang; Cong Wang; Anna Squicciarini; Kui Ren,The increasing popularity of images at social media sites is posing new opportunities forsocial discovery applications; ie; suggesting new friends and discovering new social groupswith similar interests via exploring images. To effectively handle the explosive growth ofimages involved in social discovery; one common trend for many emerging social mediasites is to leverage the commercial public cloud as their robust backend data center. Whileextremely convenient; directly exposing content-rich images and the related social discoveryresults to the public cloud also raises new acute privacy concerns. In light of the observation;in this paper we propose a privacy-preserving social discovery service architecture basedon encrypted images.

Thus; choosing theappropriate VO partners is a crucial aspect. Ensuring trustworthiness of the members is alsofundamental for making the best decisions. In this paper; we show how trust negotiationrepresents an effective means to select the best possible members during different stages inthe VO lifecycle.

Unfortunately; limited tools are available to address suchneeds and reduce users' workload on managing their social relationships. To tackle thisissue; we propose an approach to facilitate online social network users to group theircontacts into social circles with common interests. Further; we leverage the social grouppractice to automate the privacy setting process for users who add new contacts or uploadnew data items. We evaluate our approach using real-world data collected through a userstudy. The study also includes an analysis of the properties that are most critical for privacyrelated decisions.,Computers & Security,2014,27

The mostdistinguishing features of this model are the flexible granularity in protection objects andnegotiation capabilities. Under Ws-AC1; an authorization can be associated with a singleservice and can specify for which parameter values the service can be authorized for use;thus providing a fine access control granularity. Ws-AC1 also supports coarse granularitiesin protection objects in that it provides the notion of service class under which severalservices can be grouped. Authorizations can then be associated with a service class andautomatically propagated to each element in the class. The negotiation capabilities of Ws-AC1 are related to the negotiation of identity attributes and the service parameters …,International Journal of Web Services Research,2006,26

Machinelearning can help with this by prioritizing the tweets with respect to various classificationcriteria. However; supervised learning algorithms require labeled data to learn accurateclassifiers. Unfortunately; for a new disaster; labeled tweets are not easily available; whilethey are usually available for previous disasters. Furthermore; unlabeled tweets from thecurrent disaster are accumulating fast. We study the usefulness of labeled data from a priorsource disaster; together with unlabeled data from the current target disaster to learn domainadaptation classifiers for the target.

Toward a game theoretic model of information release in social media with experimental results,Christopher Griffin; Anna Squicciarini,Social sites frequently ask for rich sets of user identity properties before granting access.Users are given the freedom to fail to respond to some of these requests; or can choose tosubmit fake identity properties; so as to reduce the risk of identification; surveillance orobservation of any kind. However; this freedom has led to serious security and privacyincidents; due to the role users' identities play in establishing social and privacy settings. Inthis paper; we take a step toward addressing this open problem; by analyzing the dynamicsof social identity verification protocols.

In particular; one unsolved problem is to ensure thatcustomers data protection policies are honored; regardless of where the data is physicallystored and how often it is accessed; modified; and duplicated. This issue calls for tworequirements to be satisfied. First; data should be managed in accordance to both owners'preferences and to the local regulations that may apply. Second; although multiple copiesmay exist; a consistent view across copies should be maintained. Toward addressing theseissues; in this work we propose innovative policy enforcement techniques for adaptivesharing of users' outsourced data. We introduce the notion of autonomous self-controllingobjects (SCO); that by means of object-oriented programming techniques; encapsulate …,Proceedings of the third ACM conference on Data and application security and privacy,2013,20
A privacy-preserving approach for web service selection and provisioning,Anna Squicciarini; Barbara Carminati; Sushama Karumanchi,The growing success of WS-related technologies has resulted in a large number ofproviders; which implement services of varying degree of sophistication and complexity.While on the one hand the availability of a wide array of services has created a competitiveand flexible market that suits well the needs of different type of users; on the other hand; itrequires them to select among possibly hundreds of similar services. As such; Web serviceselection plays a crucial role in Web service life-cycle. Here; several application-dependentrequirements might constrain the selection of the best service. In this paper; we study theprivacy implications caused by the exchange of large amount of potentially sensitive datarequired by optimized strategies for service-selection. In particular; we propose acomprehensive framework to uniformly protect users' and service providers' privacy …,Web Services (ICWS); 2011 IEEE International Conference on,2011,20
User centric policy management in online social networks,Mohamed Shehab; Gorrell Cheek; Hakim Touati; Anna C Squicciarini; Pau-Chen Cheng,Online social networking sites are experiencing tremendous user growth with hundreds ofmillions of active users. As a result; there is a tremendous amount of user profile data online;eg; name; birth date; etc. Protecting this data is a challenge. The task of access policycomposition is a tedious and confusing effort for the average user having hundreds offriends. In this paper; we propose a Policy Manager (PolicyMgr) Framework for socialnetworks. PolicyMgr assists users in composing and managing their access control policiesfor objects posted to their profiles. Our approach is based on a supervised learningmechanism that leverages user provided example policy settings as training sets to buildclassifiers that are the basis for auto-generated policies. Furthermore; we providemechanisms to enable users to fuse policy decisions that are provided by their friends or …,Policies for Distributed Systems and Networks (POLICY); 2010 IEEE International Symposium on,2010,20
Towards automatic privacy management in web 2.0 with semantic analysis on annotations,Nitya Vyas; Anna C Squicciarini; Chih-Cheng Chang; Danfeng Yao,Sharing personal information and documents is pervasive in Web 2.0 environments; whichcreates the need for properly controlling shared data. Most existing authorization and policymanagement systems are for organizational use by IT professionals. Average Web users;however; do not have the sophistication to specify and maintain privacy policies for theirshared content. In this paper; we aim to utilize personal and social annotations to developautomatic tools for managing content sharing; and demonstrate a new application of socialannotations in access control. We use annotation data to predict privacy preferences ofusers and automatically derive policies for shared content. We carry out a series of userstudies to evaluate the accuracy of our predicted techniques. We also perform extensiveanalysis on static and dynamic approaches of analyzing semantic similarities of tags …,Collaborative Computing: Networking; Applications and Worksharing; 2009.

Statistics & clustering based framework for efficient XACML policy evaluation,Said Marouf; Mohamed Shehab; Anna Squicciarini; Smitha Sundareswaran,The adoption of XACML as the standard for specifying access control policies for variousapplications; especially web services is vastly increasing. A policy evaluation engine caneasily become a bottleneck when enforcing large policies. In this paper we propose anadaptive approach for XACML policy optimization. We proposed a clustering technique thatcategorizes policies and rules within a policy set and policy respectively in respect to targetsubjects. Furthermore; we propose a usage based framework that computes access requeststatistics to dynamically optimize the ordering of policies within a policy set and rules withina policy. Reordering is applied to categorized policies and rules from our proposedclustering technique. To evaluate the performance of our framework; we conductedextensive experiments on XACML policies.

Supporting robust and secure interactions in open domains through recovery of trust negotiations,Anna Cinzia Squicciarini; Alberto Trombetta; Elisa Bertino,Trust negotiation supports authentication and access control across multiple securitydomains by allowing parties to use non-forgeable digital credentials to establish trust. Bytheir nature trust negotiation systems are used in environments that are not always reliable.In particular; it is important not only to protect negotiations against malicious attacks; but alsoagainst failures and crashes of the parties or of the communication means. To address theproblem of failures and crashes; we propose an efficient and secure recovery mechanism.The mechanism includes two recovery protocols; one for each of the two main negotiationphases. In fact; because of the requirements that both services and credentials have to beprotected on the basis of the associated disclosure policies; most approaches distinguishbetween a phase of disclosure policy evaluation from a phase devoted to actual …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2007.

MoZo: A moving zone based routing protocol using pure V2V communication in VANETs,Dan Lin; Jian Kang; Anna Squicciarini; Yingjie Wu; Sashi Gurung; Ozan Tonguz,Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) are an emerging field; whereby vehicle-to-vehiclecommunications can enable many new applications such as safety and entertainmentservices. Most VANET applications are enabled by different routing protocols. The design ofsuch routing protocols; however; is quite challenging due to the dynamic nature of nodes(vehicles) in VANETs. To exploit the unique characteristics of VANET nodes; we design amoving-zone based architecture in which vehicles collaborate with one another to formdynamic moving zones so as to facilitate information dissemination. We propose a novelapproach that introduces moving object modeling and indexing techniques from the theoryof large moving object databases into the design of VANET routing protocols. The results ofextensive simulation studies carried out on real road maps demonstrate the superiority of …,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2017,17
Group-based negotiations in p2p systems,Anna C Squicciarini; Federica Paci; Elisa Bertino; Alberto Trombetta; Stefano Braghin,In P2P systems; groups are typically formed to share resources and/or to carry on joint tasks.In distributed environments formed by a large number of peers conventional authenticationtechniques are inadequate for the group joining process; and more advanced ones areneeded. Complex transactions among peers may require more elaborate interactions basedon what peers can do or possess instead of peers' identity. In this work; we propose a novelpeer group joining protocol. We introduce a highly expressive resource negotiationlanguage; able to support the specification of a large variety of conditions applying to singlepeers or groups of peers. Moreover; we define protocols to test such resource availabilitycustomized to the level of assurance required by the peers. Our approach has been testedand evaluated on an extension of the JXTA P2P platform. Our results show the …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2010,17
Web-traveler policies for images on social networks,Anna C Squicciarini; Smitha Sundareswaran,Abstract Images are one of the most popular type of contents shared on these sites. One ofthe most popular types of contents shared on these sites is image. Most of these networksoffer some rudimentary forms of access controls such as allowing the users to choose whocan view their profiles or the images uploaded by them. These controls however apply onlyin the perimeter of the users' direct control such as desktops; profiles etc. Users have nocontrol over their content once it is downloaded by others. In order to enable a user to trulymaintain control over his content; new access control mechanisms must be designed so asto enable users to control their content even when managed by others. Towards fulfilling thisgap; in this paper we propose the concept of “web-traveler policies”. Web-traveler policiesallow the user to specify who can view; upload or download a given image within a social …,World wide web,2009,17
Automatic social group organization and privacy management,Anna Squicciarini; Sushama Karumanchi; Dan Lin; Nicole DeSisto,With the dramatic increase of users on social network websites; the needs to assist users tomanage their large number of contacts as well as providing privacy protection become moreand more evident. Unfortunately; limited tools are available to address such needs andreduce users' workload on managing their social relationships. To tackle this issue; wepropose an approach to facilitate online social network users to group their contacts intosocial circles with common interests. Further; we leverage the social group practice toautomate the privacy setting process for users who add new contacts or upload new dataitems. We conducted a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of our solution.,Collaborative Computing: Networking; Applications and Worksharing (CollaborateCom); 2012 8th International Conference on,2012,16
Auth-sl-a system for the specification and enforcement of quality-based authentication policies,Anna C Squicciarini; Abhilasha Bhargav-Spantzel; Elisa Bertino; Alexei B Czeksis,Abstract This paper develops a language and a reference architecture supporting themanagement and enforcement of authentication policies. Such language directly supportsmulti-factor authentication and the high level specification of authentication factors; in termsof conditions against the features of the various authentication mechanisms and modules. Inaddition the language supports a rich set of constraints; by using these constraints; one canspecify for example that a subject must be authenticated by two credentials issued bydifferent authorities. The paper presents a logical definition of the language and itscorresponding XML encoding. It also reports an implementation of the proposedauthentication system in the context of the FreeBSD Unix operating system (OS). Criticalissues in the implementation are discussed and performance results are reported. These …,International Conference on Information and Communications Security,2007,16
A framework for contractual resource sharing in coalitions,Babak Sadighi Firozabadi; Marek Sergot; A Squicciarin; Elisa Bertino,We develop a framework for specifying and reasoning about policies for sharing resourcesin coalitions; focussing here on a particular; common type of contract in which coalitionmembers agree to make available some total amount of specified resource over a given timeperiod. The main part of the framework is a policy language with two basicelements:'obligations'(of a member enterprise to provide a total amount of resource over agiven time period) express the coalition policy; and'entitlements'(granted by an enterprise toother coalition members) express the local policies of the coalition members. We discuss theconditions under which a local policy can be said to be in compliance with; or meet; theobligations of a coalition policy; and the conditions under which an obligation; and byextension a contract; can be said to be violated or fulfilled.,Policies for Distributed Systems and Networks; 2004.

Identification and characterization of cyberbullying dynamics in an online social network,A Squicciarini; S Rajtmajer; Y Liu; Christopher Griffin,Cyberbullying is an increasingly prevalent phenomenon impacting young adults. In thispaper; we present a study on both detecting cyberbullies in online social networks andidentifying the pairwise interactions between users through which the influence of bulliesseems to spread. In particular; we investigate the role of user demographics and socialnetwork features in predicting how users will respond to a cyberbullying comment. Wecharacterize the influencer/influenced relationship by which a user who has no history ofabuse observes a peer engaging in bullying and follows suit. To our knowledge; this is thefirst effort modeling peer pressure and social dynamics with analytical models. We validateour models on two distinct social network datasets; totalling over 16; 000 posts.

Identity-based long running negotiations,Anna C Squicciarini; Alberto Trombetta; Elisa Bertino; Stefano Braghin,Abstract Identity based negotiations are convenient protocols to closely control users'personal data; that empower users to negotiate the trust of unknown counterparts bycarefully governing the disclosure of their identities. Such type of negotiations presents;however; unique challenges; mainly caused by the way identity attributes are distributed andmanaged. In this paper we present novel approach for conducting long running negotiationsin the context of digital identity management systems. We propose some major extensions toan existing trust negotiation protocol to support negotiations that are conducted duringmultiple sessions. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first time a protocol for conductingtrust negotiations over multiple sessions is presented.,Proceedings of the 4th ACM workshop on Digital identity management,2008,15
End-to-end accountability in grid computing systems for coalition information sharing,Elisa Bertino; Wonjun Lee; Anna C Squicciarini; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract Accountability is crucial for any computer system. It assures that every actionexecuted in the system can be traced back to some entity. Accountability for grid computingsystems is even more crucial given the very large number of users and active entities inthese systems. However; so far no comprehensive approach to accountability for gridsystems exists. Our work addresses such lack by developing a comprehensiveaccountability system driven by policies and supported by accountability agents. This paperfirst discusses the requirements that have driven the design of our accountability system. Itthen presents the key elements of our approach; namely the accountability data; theaccountability policy language; and the agents.,Proceedings of the 4th annual workshop on Cyber security and information intelligence research: developing strategies to meet the cyber security and information intelligence challenges ahead,2008,15

Minimal credential disclosure in trust negotiations,Federica Paci; David Bauer; Elisa Bertino; Douglas M Blough; Anna Squicciarini; Aditi Gupta,Abstract The secure release of identity attributes is a key enabler for electronic businessinteractions. Users should have the maximum control possible over the release of theiridentity attributes and should state under which conditions these attributes can be disclosed.Moreover; users should disclose only the identity attributes that are actually required for thetransactions at hand. In this paper we present an approach for the controlled release ofidentity attributes that addresses such requirements. The approach is based on theintegration of trust negotiation and minimal credential disclosure techniques. Trustnegotiation supports selective and incremental disclosure of identity attributes; whileminimal credential disclosure guarantees that only the attributes necessary to complete theon-line interactions are disclosed.,Identity in the Information Society,2009,14

Information-oriented trustworthiness evaluation in vehicular ad-hoc networks,Sashi Gurung; Dan Lin; Anna Squicciarini; Elisa Bertino,Abstract In Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs); applications are typically realized byforwarding and exchanging messages among vehicles. The integrity and trustworthiness ofmessages directly impacts the quality of the applications. Though there have been extensiveworks on authentication protocols in VANETs; authentication can only certify message originbut cannot guarantee that the identity holders will send truthful and accurate messages.Therefore; in this paper; we propose a novel trust model to directly evaluate thetrustworthiness of the content of a message received from other vehicles. The model is builtbased on various factors such as content similarity; content conflict and route similarity.Trustworthiness of message content will be evaluated at the individual vehicle level and willnot introduce any additional architectural assumptions.

In this paper we present a layeredarchitecture for addressing the end-to-end accountability problem. We introduce the conceptof {\em accountability agents}; entities in charge of collecting accountability data; keepingtrack of submitted jobs and their users. We present a simple yet effective language to specifythe relevant accountability data to be collected and selectively distributed by theaccountability agents.

Towards provenance-based anomaly detection in MapReduce,Cong Liao; Anna Squicciarini,MapReduce enables parallel and distributed processing of vast amount of data on a clusterof machines. However; such computing paradigm is subject to threats posed by maliciousand cheating nodes or compromised user submitted code that could tamper data andcomputation since users maintain little control as the computation is carried out in adistributed fashion. In this paper; we focus on the analysis and detection of anomalies duringthe process of MapReduce computation. Accordingly; we develop a computationalprovenance system that captures provenance data related to MapReduce computationwithin the MapReduce framework in Hadoop. In particular; we identify a set of invariantsagainst aggregated provenance information; which are later analyzed to uncover anomaliesindicating possible tampering of data and computation.

Multifactor identity verification using aggregated proof of knowledge,Abhilasha Bhargav-Spantzel; Anna Cinzia Squicciarini; Rui Xue; Elisa Bertino,The problem of identity theft; that is; the act of impersonating others' identities by presentingstolen identifiers or proofs of identities; has been receiving increasing attention because ofits high financial and social costs. In this paper; we address the problem of verification ofsuch identifiers and proofs of identity. Our approach is based on the concept of privacypreserving multifactor verification of such identifiers and proofs achieved by thedevelopment of a new cryptographic primitive; which uses aggregate signatures oncommitments that are then used for aggregate zero-knowledge proof of knowledge (ZKPK)protocols. The resultant signatures are very short and the ZKPs are succinct and efficient.We prove the security of our scheme under the co-gap Diffie-Hellman (co-GDH) assumptionfor groups with bilinear maps.

In this paper we propose an approach to manage electronic receipts oncellular devices by assuring their secure and privacy-preserving usage. We provide acomprehensive notion of transactions history including both on-line transaction and in-person transactions.

Traceable and automatic compliance of privacy policies in federated digital identity management,Anna Squicciarini; Abhilasha Bhargav-Spantzel; Alexei Czeskis; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Digital identity is defined as the digital representation of the information knownabout a specific individual or organization. An emerging approach for protecting identities ofindividuals while at the same time enhancing user convenience is to focus on inter-organization management of identity information. This is referred to as federated identitymanagement. In this paper we develop an approach to support privacy controlled sharing ofidentity attributes and harmonization of privacy policies in federated environments. Policyharmonizations mechanisms make it possible to determine whether or not the transfer ofidentity attributes from one entity to another violate the privacy policies stated by the former.We also provide mechanisms for tracing the release of user's identity attributes within thefederation. Such approach entails a form of accountability since an entity non-compliant …,International Workshop on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,2006,12

Towards a game theoretical model for identity validation in social network sites,Anna Cinzia Squicciarini; Christopher Griffin; Smitha Sundareswaran,Social sites frequently ask for rich sets of user identity properties before granting access.Users are given the freedom to fail to respond to some of these requests; or can choose tosubmit fake identity properties; so as to reduce the risk of identification; surveillance orobservation of any kind. However; this freedom has led to serious security and privacyincidents; due to the role users' identities play in establishing social and privacy settings. Inthis paper; we take a step toward addressing this open problem; by analyzing the dynamicsof social identity verification protocols. We use a game theoretical framework to describe asimple two-player general sum game describing the behavior of a server system (like Facebook) that provides utility to users. Users can choose to register a new identity using the trueinformation; false information or no information (and remain anonymous).

Biometrics-based identifiers for digital identity management,Abhilasha Bhargav-Spantzel; Anna Squicciarini; Elisa Bertino; Xiangwei Kong; Weike Zhang,Abstract We present algorithms to reliably generate biometric identifiers from a user'sbiometric image which in turn is used for identity verification possibly in conjunction withcryptographic keys. The biometric identifier generation algorithms employ image hashingfunctions using singular value decomposition and support vector classification techniques.Our algorithms capture generic biometric features that ensure unique and repeatablebiometric identifiers. We provide an empirical evaluation of our techniques using 2569images of 488 different individuals for three types of biometric images; namely fingerprint;iris and face. Based on the biometric type and the classification models; as a result of theempirical evaluation we can generate biometric identifiers ranging from 64 bits up to 214bits.

Sentiment analysis during Hurricane Sandy in emergency response,Venkata K Neppalli; Cornelia Caragea; Anna Squicciarini; Andrea Tapia; Sam Stehle,Abstract Sentiment analysis has been widely researched in the domain of online reviewsites with the aim of generating summarized opinions of users about different aspects ofproducts. However; there has been little work focusing on identifying the polarity ofsentiments expressed by users during disaster events. Identifying such sentiments fromonline social networking sites can help emergency responders understand the dynamics ofthe network; eg; the main users' concerns; panics; and the emotional impacts of interactionsamong members. In this paper; we perform a sentiment analysis of tweets posted on Twitterduring the disastrous Hurricane Sandy and visualize online users' sentiments on ageographical map centered around the hurricane. We show how users' sentiments changeaccording not only to their locations; but also based on the distance from the disaster. In …,International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,2017,10
Identifying valuable information from twitter during natural disasters,Brandon Truong; Cornelia Caragea; Anna Squicciarini; Andrea H Tapia,ABSTRACT Social media is a vital source of information during any major event; especiallynatural disasters. However; with the exponential increase in volume of social media data; socomes the increase in conversational data that does not provide valuable information;especially in the context of disaster events; thus; diminishing peoples' ability to find theinformation that they need in order to organize relief efforts; find help; and potentially savelives. This project focuses on the development of a Bayesian approach to the classificationof tweets (posts on Twitter) during Hurricane Sandy in order to distinguish “informational”from “conversational” tweets. We designed an effective set of features and used them asinput to Naïve Bayes classifiers. In comparison to a “bag of words” approach; the newfeature set provides similar results in the classification of tweets.

In this paper; we present a multisession dependable approach to trustnegotiations. The proposed framework supports voluntary and unpredicted interruptions;enabling the negotiating parties to complete the negotiation despite temporary unavailabilityof resources. Our protocols address issues related to validity; temporary loss of data; andextended unavailability of one of the two negotiators.

Constrained social-energy minimization for multi-party sharing in online social networks,Sarah Rajtmajer; Anna Squicciarini; Christopher Griffin; Sushama Karumanchi; Alpana Tyagi,Abstract The development of fair and practical policies for shared content online is a primarygoal of the access control community. Multi-party access control; in which access controlpolicies are determined by multiple users each with vested interest in a piece of sharedcontent; remains an outstanding challenge. Purposeful or accidental disclosures by oneuser in an online social network (OSN) may have negative consequences for others;highlighting the importance of appropriate sharing mechanisms. In this work; we develop agame-theoretic framework for modeling multi-party privacy decisions for shared content. Weassume that the content owner (uploader) selects an initial privacy policy that constrains theprivacy settings of other users. We prove the convergence of users' access control policiesassuming a multi-round consensus-building game in which all players are fully rational …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Autonomous Agents & Multiagent Systems,2016,9

When MapReduce is carried out in distributed settings; usersmaintain very little control over these computations; causing several security and privacyconcerns. MapReduce activities may be subverted or compromised by malicious or cheatingnodes. In this paper; we focus on the analysis and detection of attacks launched bymalicious or mis configured nodes; which may tamper with the ordinary functions of theMapReduce framework. Our goal is to investigate the extent to which integrity andcorrectness of computation in a MapReduce environments can be verified while introducingno modifications on the original MapReduce operations or introductions of extra operations;neither computational nor cryptographic.

Automatic compliance of privacy policies in federated digital identity management,Anna Squicciarini; Marco Casassa Mont; Abhilasha Bhargav-Spantzel; Elisa Bertino,Privacy in the digital world is an important problem which is becoming even more pressingas new collaborative applications are developed. The lack of privacy preservingmechanisms is particularly problematic in federated identity management contexts. In such acontext; users can seamlessly interact with a variety of federated web services; throughtheuse of single-sign-on mechanisms and the capability of sharing personal data amongthese web services. We argue that comprehensive privacy policies should be stated byfederated service providers and proactively checked by these providers; before disclosingusers' data to federated partners. To address such requirements; we introduce mechanismsand algorithms for policy compliance checking between federated service providers; basedon an innovative policy subsumption approach.

A privacy preserving assertion based policy language for federation systems,Anna C Squicciarini; Ayca Azgin Hintoglu; Elisa Bertino; Yucel Saygin,Abstract Identity federation systems enable participating organizations to provide services toqualified individuals and manage their identity attributes at an inter-organizational level.Most importantly; they empower individuals with control over the usage of their attributeswithin the federation via enforcement of various policies. Among such policies; one of themost important yet immature one is the privacy policy. Existing frameworks proposed forprivacy-preserving federations lack the capability to support complex data-usagepreferences in the form of obligations; ie the privacy related actions that must be performedupon certain actions on a specific piece of information. Moreover; they do not account for thehistory of events resulting from the interactions among federation entities. To address thesedeficiencies we propose an extension to an existing assertion based policy language …,Proceedings of the 12th ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2007,9

Though searchable encryption allows users to encrypt their stored data whilepreserving some search capabilities; few efforts have sought to consider the reliability of thesearchable encrypted data outsourced to the clouds. In this paper; we propose a privacy-preserving STorage and REtrieval (STRE) mechanism that not only ensures security andprivacy but also provides reliability guarantees for the outsourced searchable encrypteddata. The STRE mechanism enables the cloud users to distribute and search their …,IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing,2017,8
MMB $^{cloud} $-Tree: Authenticated Index for Verifiable Cloud Service Selection,Jingwei Li; Anna Cinzia Squicciarini; Dan Lin; Smitha Sundareswaran; Chunfu Jia,Cloud brokers have been recently introduced as an additional computational layer tofacilitate cloud selection and service management tasks for cloud consumers. However;existing brokerage schemes on cloud service selection typically assume that brokers arecompletely trusted; and do not provide any guarantee over the correctness of the servicerecommendations. It is then possible for a compromised or dishonest broker to easily takeadvantage of the limited capabilities of the clients and provide incorrect or incompleteresponses. To address this problem; we propose an innovative cloud service selectionverification (CSSV) scheme and index structures (MMB cloud-tree) to enable cloud clients todetect misbehavior of the cloud brokers during the service selection process. Wedemonstrate correctness and efficiency of our approaches both theoretically and …,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,2017,8
Secloc: Securing location-sensitive storage in the cloud,Jingwei Li; Anna Squicciarini; Dan Lin; Shuang Liang; Chunfu Jia,Abstract Cloud computing offers a wide array of storage services. While enjoying thebenefits of flexibility; scalability and reliability brought by the cloud storage; cloud users alsoface the risk of losing control of their own data; in partly because they do not know wheretheir data is actually stored. This raises a number of security and privacy concerns regardingone's sensitive data such as health records. For example; according to Canadian laws; datarelated to personal identifiable information must be stored within Canada. Nevertheless; incontrast to the urgent demands; privacy requirements regarding to cloud storage locationshave not been well investigated in the current cloud computing market; fostering securityand privacy concerns among potential adopters. Aiming at addressing this emerging criticalissue; we propose a novel secure location-sensitive storage framework; called SecLoc …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM Symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies,2015,8
Toward de-anonymizing bitcoin by mapping users location,Jules DuPont; Anna Cinzia Squicciarini,Abstract The Bitcoin system (https://bitcoin. org) is a pseudo-anonymous currency that candissociate a user from any real-world identity. In that context; a successful breach of thevirtual and physical divide represents a signficant aw in the Bit-coin system [1]. In this projectwe demonstrate how to glean information about the real-world users behind Bitcointransactions. We analyze publicly available data about the cryptocurrency. In particular; wefocus on determining information about a Bitcoin user's physical location by examining thatuser's spending habits.,Proceedings of the 5th ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy,2015,8
An overview of VeryIDX-A privacy-preserving digital identity management system for mobile devices,Federica Paci; Elisa Bertino; Sam Kerr; Anna Cinzia Squicciarini; Jungha Woo,Abstract—Users increasingly use their mobile devices to communicate; to conduct businesstransaction and access resources and services. In such a scenario; digital identitymanagement (DIM) technology is fundamental in customizing user experience; protectingprivacy; underpinning accountability in business transactions; and in complying withregulatory controls. Users identity consists of data; referred to as identity attributes; thatencode relevant-security properties of the clients. However; identity attributes can be targetof several attacks: the loss or theft of mobile devices results in a exposure of identityattributes; identity attributes that are send over WI-FI or 3G networks can be easilyintercepted; identity attributes can also be captured via Bluetooth connections without theuser's consent; and mobile viruses; worms and Trojan horses can access the identity …,Journal of Software,2009,8
Standards for web services security,Elisa Bertino; Lorenzo D Martino; Federica Paci; Anna C Squicciarini,Abstract Over time; different languages; mechanisms; and tools have been developed ondifferent software and hardware platforms for specifying and implementing a variety ofsecurity mechanisms; such as encryption and access control. In a Web service setting;security mechanisms protect the confidentiality and integrity of the so-called information intransit; that is; the data and messages exchanged between a client and aWeb service; andof the so-called information at rest; that is; the information stored in a Web host. Furthermore;protection of the information must not only consider simple two-way client-serverinteractions; but also extend to more complex interactions; as in the case of businessprocesses implemented through multiple Web services.,*,2009,8
Access control strategies for virtualized environments in grid computing systems,Anna Cinzia Squicciarini; Elisa Bertino; Sebastien Goasguen,The development of adequate security solutions and in particular of authentication andauthorization techniques for grid computing systems is a challenging task. Challenges arisefrom the heterogeneity of users; the presence of multiple security administration entities; theheterogeneity of security techniques used at the various grid hosts; the scalabilityrequirements; and the need for high-level policies concerning resource sharing. Recenttrends; like accessing grid through science gateways and the use of virtual organizations(VO) for managing user communities; further complicate the problem of security for gridcomputing systems. Currently; the GSI component developed as part of the Globus Toolkit;the de-facto standard for grid infrastructures is not fully suited to meet those challenges.

The relativity of privacy preservation based on social tagging,Baozhen Lee; Weiguo Fan; Anna C Squicciarini; Shilun Ge; Yun Huang,Abstract Privacy preservation has gained importance with the development of tools forpersonal information retrieval and social information sharing in Web 2.0 environments. Thispaper addresses the need for a paradigm shift concerning publicity and privacy together inthe process of personal information service and privacy preservation. In addition; we alsobridge the conflict between interactivity and independency in the process of social sharingand privacy preservation. By analyzing the paradigm and conflict; we identify the criteria ofprivacy relativity; such as publicity vs. privacy and interactivity vs. independency. Usinghierarchical clustering methods; we analyze the hierarchical community characteristics oftag networks which reflect users' preferences and the features of information resourcesthrough social tagging.

A moving zone based architecture for message dissemination in VANETs,Sashi Gurung; Anna Squicciarini; Dan Lin; Ozan K Tonguz,Abstract Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) are an emerging field; whereby vehicle-to-vehicle communication can contribute to many new applications such as infotainmentservices. Most VANET applications are based on routing protocols; the development ofwhich however are challenging due to the dynamic nature of nodes (vehicles) in VANETs.To adequately capture the characteristics of VANET nodes; we propose a novel and uniqueapproach that integrates moving object modeling and indexing techniques into VANETrouting protocols. In particular; we design a moving-zone based architecture in whichvehicles collaborate with one another to form dynamic moving zones so as to facilitateinformation dissemination. The experiments have been carried out on real road maps andthe results obtained demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to existing …,Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Network and Service Management,2012,7
Paim: Peer-based automobile identity management in vehicular ad-hoc network,Anna Squicciarini; Dan Lin; Alessandro Mancarella,The emerging Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) technology will enable many excitingapplications such as vehicular safety assistance and mobile entertainment. One of the keychallenges toward successful roll-out of VANET applications is to provide security andprivacy preserving mechanisms for users. Existing efforts on this topic rely heavily oninfrastructure like road-side units which however are not available everywhere. To minimizethe dependence on infrastructure; we propose a novel Peer-based Automobile IdentityManagement (PAIM) Framework which is mainly based on vehicle-to-vehiclecommunication.

A flexible access control model for web services,Elisa Bertino; Anna C Squicciarini,Abstract A Web service [8] is a Web-based application that can be published; located andinvoked across the Web. Compared to centralized systems and client-server environments;a Web service environment is much more dynamic and security for such an environmentposes unique challenges. However; while Web services are rapidly becoming afundamental paradigm for the development of complex Web applications; several securityissues still need to be addressed. Some proposals for securing Web services have beenpresented [1; 2; 4] over the last two years.

Why and how to deceive: game results with sociological evidence,Anna Squicciarini; Christopher Griffin,Abstract As social networking sites continue to proliferate; online deception is becoming asignificant problem. Deceptive users are now not only lone wolves propagating hatemessages and inappropriate content; but also are more frequently seemingly honest userschoosing to deceive for selfish reasons. Their behavior negatively influences otherwisehonest online community members; creating a snowball effect that damages entire onlinecommunities. In this paper; we study the phenomenon of deception and attempt tounderstand the dynamics of users' deception; using a game-theoretic approach. We beginby formulating the decision process of a single user as a Markov chain with time-varyingrewards. We then study the specific optimization problem a user may face in choosing todeceive when they are influenced by (1) their potential reward;(2) peer pressure and (3) …,Social Network Analysis and Mining,2014,6
Privacy aware service selection of composite web services invited paper,Anna Cinzia Squicciarini; Barbara Carminati; Sushama Karumanchi,Web service selection involves finding services from a possibly huge database of similarservices. Hence; the challenges involved in finding a suitable service include large timeconsumption; and difficulty of finding a perfect match according to the user specified searchkeywords. In addition; significant privacy and security concerns arise; as the informationinvolved with service selection and provisioning may be sensitive for both providers andusers. In this paper; we propose a comprehensive framework to uniformly protect users andservice providers at the time of service selection. We define a solution that (a) supportsprivate service selection; such that both criteria and service attributes are kept private duringthe matching and (b) includes an approach to protect service provisioning rules fromunwanted disclosure; both from the user and the service provider's perspective.

Web services threats; vulnerabilities; and countermeasures,Elisa Bertino; Lorenzo D Martino; Federica Paci; Anna C Squicciarini,Abstract Securing a Web service requires us to protect; as far as possible; all of its basiccomponents; shown in Figure 3.1; and their interactions; along with the Web service lifecycle; from the design to the operational phase. This is a complex and difficult task; due tothe vulnerabilities which each software component may have; the large number of attacksthat can eventually exploit the vulnerabilities of a specific component; and to the interactionsbetween the components themselves. It requires us to combine and enhance methods;tools; and techniques for computers; networks; distributed systems; and application securityand adopt an engineered security process. Such an engineered process consists of detailedplans and designs for security features and controls that support the delivery of solutionssatisfying not only functional requirements; but also preventing misuse and malicious …,*,2009,6

In this paper; we propose a comprehensive study on WebService vulnerabilities. We consider not only well known Web-based vulnerabilities such asSQL injection; session replay etc; but we also analyze Web-Service specific vulnerabilitiesand their potential of attacks due to poor service construction and service maintenance. Inour analysis; we classify each of the studied vulnerability according to a new taxonomy;discuss remedies and impact; and propose methods of detection based on real-timeanalysis. Our analysis is supported by the results of a large scale study involving over 2;000real-world Web Services.

Policy-compliant search query routing for web service discovery in peer to peer networks,Sushama Karumanchi; Anna Cinzia Squicciarini; Barbara Carminati,Web services are increasingly hosted on peer to peer networks; to facilitate resource sharingand cooperation. In these settings; each peer hosts a set of services which can be invokedby other peers of the network through a service query. In a pure peer to peer network; itmight not be possible to maintain directory for publishing the services; rather; the peers needto search for the required service through query forwarding in the network. For such non-directory based peer to peer networks; in this paper; we introduce an efficient and fullydecentralized policy-compliant search query routing method for service discovery. Our maingoal is to protect the search query from traversing unwanted peers in the network; whileachieving service discovery. To this end; we design and develop a policy-driven approachthat allows distributed searches through service queries taking into account any security …,Web Services (ICWS); 2013 IEEE 20th International Conference on,2013,5
Early detection of policies violations in a social media site: A bayesian belief network approach,Anna Cinzia Squicciarini; William Mcgill; Giuseppe Petracca; Shuo Huang,One of the main goals of all online social communities is to promote a stable; or perhaps;growing membership built around topics of like interest. Yet; communities are notimpermeable to the potentially damaging effects resulting from those few participants thatchoose to behave in a manner that is counter to established norms of behavior. Typicalmoderators in online social communities are the ones tasked to reduce the risks associatedwith unhealthy user behavior by rapidly identifying and removing damaging posts andconsequently taking action against the perpetrating user. Yet; the sheer volume of postsrelative to the number of moderators available for review suggests a need for modern toolsaimed at prioritizing posts based on the assessed risk each user poses to the community.

Privacy policies compliance across digital identity management systems,Anna C Squicciarini; Alexei Czeskis; Abhilasha Bhargav-Spantzel,Abstract An emerging approach for protecting identities of individuals; while at the same timeenhancing user convenience; is represented by federated identity management systems. Inthis paper we develop an approach to support privacy controlled sharing of identity attributesin federated environments. We present a wide range of strategies that enable users to tracetheir personal information across the federation and verify whether it has been managedaccording to their privacy preferences. Users can employ one or more of these strategiesaccording to their goals and priorities. Additionally; we analyze the challenging issue ofdata; privacy policy; and preference updates in a federated system. Our algorithm allowsusers and federated service providers to control whether new versions of data and users'privacy references have been used; and detect possible inconsistencies.,Proceedings of the SIGSPATIAL ACM GIS 2008 International Workshop on Security and Privacy in GIS and LBS,2008,5
Policy languages for digital identity management in federation systems,Elisa Bertino; Abhilasha Bhargav-Spantzel; Anna Cinzia Squicciarini,The goal of service provider federations is to support a controlled method by whichdistributed organizations can provide services to qualified individuals and manage theiridentity attributes at an inter-organizational level. In order to make access control decisionsthe history of activities should be accounted for; therefore it is necessary to recordinformation on interactions among the federation entities. To achieve these goals wepropose a comprehensive assertion language able to support description of static anddynamic properties of the federation system. The assertions are a powerful means todescribe the behavior of the entities interacting in the federation; and to define policiescontrolling access to services and privacy policies. We also propose a log-based approachfor capturing the history of activities within the federation implemented as a set of tables …,Policies for Distributed Systems and Networks; 2006. Policy 2006.

Anonymity preserving techniques in trust negotiations,Indrakshi Ray; Elisa Bertino; Anna C Squicciarini; Elena Ferrari,Abstract Trust negotiation between two subjects require each one proving its properties tothe other. Each subject specifies disclosure policies stating the types of credentials andattributes the counterpart has to provide to obtain a given resource. The counterpart; inresponse; provides a disclosure set containing the necessary credentials and attributes. Ifthe counterpart wants to remain anonymous; its disclosure sets should not contain identityrevealing information. In this paper; we propose anonymization techniques using which asubject can transform its disclosure set into an anonymous one. Anonymization transforms adisclosure set into an alternative anonymous one whose information content is different fromthe original one. This alternative disclosure set may no longer satisfy the original disclosurepolicy causing the trust negotiation to fail. To address this problem; we propose that trust …,International Workshop on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,2005,5

Adaptive data management for self-protecting objects in cloud computing systems,Anna Cinzia Squicciarini; Giuseppe Petracca; Elisa Bertino,While Cloud data services are a growing successful business and computing paradigm;data privacy and security are major concerns. One critical problem is to ensure that dataowners' policies are honored; regardless of where the data is physically stored and howoften it is accessed; and modified. This scenario calls for an important requirement to besatisfied. Data should be managed in accordance to owners' preferences; Cloud providersservice agreements; and the local regulations that may apply. In this work we proposeinnovative policy enforcement techniques for adaptive sharing of users' outsourced data.

Profile-based selection of accountability policies in grid computing systems,Wonjun Lee; Anna C Squicciarini; Elisa Bertino,Accountability in grid computing systems is an important requirement; in that it makes itpossible to control activities of users and resource providers through the collection andanalysis of accountability data. The accountability policies specify what to collect and when;and more importantly how to coordinate the data collection among different administrativedomains. If elements of the data to be sent from a node to another are missing or differentfrom the ones required by the policy due to the insufficient capabilities of the node to collectdata; conflicts--inability to comply-may occur. To solve such conflicts and yet obtain flexibleaccountability processes; we propose a profile-based policy selection mechanism.

In order to achieve this vision; ICT supportedbusiness processes should be able to adapt to the changing needs of business in a settingcharacterized by the globalization of the markets; mergers and acquisitions; cross-organization and even cross-boundary operations; and the extension of the businessboundaries due to the pervasiveness of the Internet.,*,2009,4
Veryidx-a digital identity management system for pervasive computing environments,Federica Paci; Elisa Bertino; Sam Kerr; Aaron Lint; Anna Squicciarini; Jungha Woo,Abstract The problem of identity theft; that is; the act of impersonating others' identities bypresenting stolen identifiers or proofs of identities; has been receiving increasing attentionbecause of its high financial and social costs. In this paper we address such problem byproposing an approach to manage user identity attributes by assuring their privacy-preserving usage. The approach is based on the concept of privacy preserving multi-factorauthentication achieved by a new cryptographic primitive which uses aggregate signatureson commitments that are then used for aggregate zero-knowledge proof of knowledge(ZKPK) protocols. We present the implementation of such approach on Nokia NFC cellularphones and report performance evaluation results.,IFIP International Workshop on Software Technolgies for Embedded and Ubiquitous Systems,2008,4
Trust negotiations with customizable anonymity,Anna Cinzia Squicciarini; Abhilasha Barghav-Spantzel; Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Indrakshi Ray,Abstract Trust negotiation makes it possible for two parties to carry on secure transactions byfirst establishing trust through a bilateral; iterative process of requesting and disclosingdigital credentials and policies. Credentials; exchanged during trust negotiations; oftencontain sensitive attributes that attest to the properties of the credential owner. Uncontrolleddisclosure of such sensitive attributes may cause grave damage to the credential owner.Research has shown that disclosing non-sensitive attributes only can cause identity to berevealed as well. Consequently; we impose a stronger requirement: our negotiations shouldhave the k-anonymity property--the set of credentials submitted by a subject during anegotiation should be equal to k other such sets received by the counterpart during earliernegotiations. In this paper we propose a protocol that ensures k-anonymity. Our protocol …,Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE/WIC/ACM international conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology,2006,4

Uncovering the spatio-temporal dynamics of memes in the presence of incomplete information,Hancheng Ge; James Caverlee; Nan Zhang; Anna Squicciarini,Abstract Modeling; understanding; and predicting the spatio-temporal dynamics of onlinememes are important tasks; with ramifications on location-based services; social mediasearch; targeted advertising and content delivery networks. However; the raw data revealingthese dynamics are often incomplete and error-prone; for example; API limitations and datasampling policies can lead to an incomplete (and often biased) perspective on thesedynamics. Hence; in this paper; we investigate new methods for uncovering the full(underlying) distribution through a novel spatio-temporal dynamics recovery frameworkwhich models the latent relationships among locations; memes; and times. By integratingthese hidden relationships into a tensor-based recovery framework--called AirCP--we findthat high-quality models of meme spread can be built with access to only a fraction of the …,Proceedings of the 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2016,3
XSS-Dec: A hybrid solution to mitigate cross-site scripting attacks,Smitha Sundareswaran; Anna Cinzia Squicciarini,Abstract Cross-site scripting attacks represent one of the major security threats in today'sWeb applications. Current approaches to mitigate cross-site scripting vulnerabilities rely oneither server-based or client-based defense mechanisms. Although effective for manyattacks; server-side protection mechanisms may leave the client vulnerable if the server isnot well patched. On the other hand; client-based mechanisms may incur a significantoverhead on the client system. In this work; we present a hybrid client-server solution thatcombines the benefits of both architectures. Our Proxy-based solution leverages thestrengths of both anomaly detection and control flow analysis to provide accurate detection.We demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our approach through extended testing usingreal-world cross-site scripting exploits.,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2012,3

A Gifar-based attack relies on a form of steganography; combining images or anyother file types (such as word file or flash etc) with Jar files. The modified file is used to carrythe payloads of various attacks; that can be triggered when posted on Web portals. In thepaper; we explore the capabilities of Gifar-based attacks; expose the efficacy and the state ofthe art of the existing protection mechanisms against these type of attacks. We show thatdespite some initial steps taken by many Web portals to prevent from similar attacks; Gifarattacks can be launched from any sites; and can be used as carriers of a variety of disruptiveattacks; such as denial of service; command and control; and data theft.

Access control for business processes,Elisa Bertino; Lorenzo D Martino; Federica Paci; Anna C Squicciarini,Abstract Todays business environment is undergoing dramatic change. Competitivepressure from traditional and non-traditional sources; the rapid emergence and growth ofnew channels; increasing pressure to outsource selected business processes; anddemands for compliance with a plethora of new regulatory and legal requirements are allcontributing to an ever growing demand for change. Traditionally; many organizations havestruggled to manage change. In order to survive and prosper in the coming years; theseorganizations will need to develop a capability to sustain a state of change and evolution.The ability of an organizations IT systems to cope with this level of change will be asignificant factor in the organizations success in adapting to this increasingly dynamicbusiness environment.,*,2009,3
Authorization Strategies for Virtualized Environments in Grid Computing Systems∗,Xinming Ou; Anna Squicciarini; Sebastien Goasguen; Elisa Bertino,Abstract The development of adequate security solutions; and in particular of authenticationand authorization techniques; for grid computing systems is a challenging task. Recenttrends of service oriented architectures (SOA); where users access grids through a sciencegateway—a web service that serves as a portal between users of a virtual organizations(VO) and the various computation resources; further complicate the authorization problem.Currently; the security component developed as part of the Globus Toolkit; the de factostandard for grid infrastructures; is not fully equiped with the capabilities to meet thosechallenges. The main drawback of the current approach is that it relies on a low level identity-based authorization scheme. A low-level access control policy maps a user's identity(distinguished name) to a local account. This approach does not scale and is hard to …,*,2006,3
A secure publishing protocol for virtual community contracts,Anna Cinzia Squicciarini; Federica Paci; Elisa Bertino,ABSTRACT The notion of Virtual Community (VC) is today an important paradigm to enabledynamic and large-scale collaboration activities over the Web. In many of those activities;security is an important key requirement that to date has not been widely investigated. In thispaper; we make a step towards addressing such problem. We focus on the issue of securepublishing of VC policies because policies represent a key component for any VC. Theirsecurity is thus crucial for the proper function of the VC. In the paper; after discussing themotivation for the proposed work; we develop protocols for secure publication of protocolsaddressing integrity and confidentiality of the policy publication process. Our protocols coverboth community policies and community member local policies.

Toward automated online photo privacy,Anna Squicciarini; Cornelia Caragea; Rahul Balakavi,Abstract Online photo sharing is an increasingly popular activity for Internet users. More andmore users are now constantly sharing their images in various social media; from socialnetworking sites to online communities; blogs; and content sharing sites. In this article; wepresent an extensive study exploring privacy and sharing needs of users' uploaded images.We develop learning models to estimate adequate privacy settings for newly uploadedimages; based on carefully selected image-specific features. Our study investigates bothvisual and textual features of images for privacy classification. We consider both basic image-specific features; commonly used for image processing; as well as more sophisticated andabstract visual features. Additionally; we include a visual representation of the sentimentevoked by images. To our knowledge; sentiment has never been used in the context of …,ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB),2017,2
Towards privacy-preserving and practical image-centric social discovery,Xingliang Yuan; Xinyu Wang; Cong Wang; Anna C Squicciarini; Kui Ren,Images are becoming one of the key enablers of user connectivity in social mediaapplications. Many of them are directly exploring image content to suggest new friends withsimilar interests. To handle the explosive volumes of images; one common trend is toleverage the public cloud as their robust service backend. Despite the convenience;exposing content-rich images to the cloud inevitably raises acute privacy concerns. In thispaper; we propose a privacy-preserving architecture for image-centric social discoveryservices; designed to function over encrypted images. We first adopt the effective Bag-of-Words model to extract the “visual content” of users' images into respective image profilevectors. We then model the core problem as similarity retrieval of encrypted high-dimensional vectors. To achieve scalable services over millions of encrypted images; we …,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,2016,2
A cooperate-defect model for the spread of deviant behavior in social networks,Sarah Rajtmajer; Christopher Griffin; Derek Mikesell; Anna Squicciarini,Abstract: We present a game-theoretic model for the spread of deviant behavior in onlinesocial networks. We utilize a two-strategy framework wherein each player's behavior isclassified as normal or deviant and evolves according to the cooperate-defect payoffscheme of the classic prisoner's dilemma game. We demonstrate convergence of individualbehavior over time to a final strategy vector and indicate counterexamples to thisconvergence outside the context of prisoner's dilemma. Theoretical results are validated ona real-world dataset collected from a popular online forum.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1408.2770,2014,2

Online abusive users analytics through visualization,Anna Cinzia Squicciarini; Jules Dupont; Ruyan Chen,Abstract In this demo; we present Abuse User Analytics (AuA); an analytical frameworkaiming to provide key information about the behavior of online social network users. AuAefficiently processes data from users' discussions; and renders information about users'activities in a easy to-understand graphical fashion with the goal of identifying deviant orabusive activities. Using animated graphics; AuA visualizes users' degree of abusiveness;measured by several key metrics; over user selected time intervals. It is therefore possible tovisualize how users' activities lead to complex interaction networks; and highlight thedegenerative connections among users and within certain threads.,Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on World Wide Web,2014,2
Two species evolutionary game model of user and moderator dynamics,Christopher Griffin; Douglas Mercer; James Fan; Anna Squicciarini,We construct a two species evolutionary game model of an online society consisting ofordinary users and behavior enforcers (moderators). Among themselves; moderators play acoordination game choosing between being “positive” or” negative”(or harsh) while ordinaryusers play prisoner's dilemma. When interacting; moderators motivate good behavior(cooperation) among the users through punitive actions while the moderators themselvesare encouraged or discouraged in their strategic choice by these interactions. We show thefollowing results:(i) We show that the ω-limit set of the proposed system is sensitive both tothe degree of punishment and the proportion of moderators in closed form.(ii) Wedemonstrate that the basin of attraction for the Pareto optimal strategy (Cooperate; Positive)can be computed exactly.(iii) We demonstrate that for certain initial conditions the system …,Social Informatics (SocialInformatics); 2012 International Conference on,2012,2
Vulnerabilities leading to denial of services attacks in grid computing systems: a survey,Wonjun Lee; Anna Squicciarini; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Grid is designed with no security in mind at first. The complexity and scalability ofgrid architecture make easy for intruders to attack the system in several ways. In this paper;we discuss several possible or known vulnerabilities existing in each layer of the gridsystem. Attackers can take advantage of such vulnerabilities to break into grid systems andexploit grid resource to launch Denial of Service attack targeting servers located outside thegrid such as mission critical web servers; or internal node inside the grid by shutting downone of important grid components.,Proceedings of the Sixth Annual Workshop on Cyber Security and Information Intelligence Research,2010,2
Defending against Attribute-Correlation Attacks in Privacy-Aware Information Brokering,Fengjun Li; Bo Luo; Peng Liu; Anna C Squicciarini; Dongwon Lee; Chao-Hsien Chu,Abstract Nowadays; increasing needs for information sharing arise due to extensivecollaborations among organizations. Organizations desire to provide data access to theircollaborators while preserving full control over the data and comprehensive privacy of theirusers. A number of information systems have been developed to provide efficient andsecure information sharing. However; most of the solutions proposed so far are built atop ofconventional data warehousing or distributed database technologies. Recently; informationbrokering systems have been proposed to provide privacy-preserving information sharingamong loosely federated data sources. However; they are still vulnerable to attribute-correlation attacks during query routing; due to the lack of protection of the routed queries.

A unified theory of trust and collaboration,Guoray Cai; Anna Squicciarini,Abstract We consider a type of applications where collaboration and trust are tightly coupledwith the need to protect sensitive information. Existing trust management technologies havebeen limited to offering generic mechanisms for enforcing access control policies based onexchanged credentials; and rarely deal with the situated meaning of trust in a specificcollaborative context. Towards trust management for highly dynamic and collaborativeactivities; this paper describes a theory of trust intention and semantics that makes explicitconnections between collaborative activities and trust. The model supports inferring truststate based on knowledge about state of collaborative activity. It is the first step towards aunified approach for computer-mediated trust communication in the context of collaborativework.,International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking; Applications and Worksharing,2008,2
k-anonymous Attribute-Based Access Control⋆,Anna Squicciarini; Alberto Trombetta; Abilasha Bhargav-Spantzel; Elisa Bertino,Abstract. Access control in a distributed system can be achieved by requesting digitalcredentials of the entity wanting to access the system. Credentials contain attributes thatattest information concerning a given subject. Because such information can be sensitive;uncontrolled disclosure of such sensitive attributes may result in privacy breaches. Previousresearch efforts have shown that; even if one discloses only non-sensitive attributes; theseattributes can still be linked to specific individuals. In this work; we propose attribute-basedauthorizations to satisfy the kanonymity property: the set of credentials submitted by asubject during an access control operation should be equal to at least k other such setsreceived by the counterpart during earlier access controls operations. We thus propose aprotocol that ensures k-anonymity for users accessing services in a distributed setting …,International Conference on Information and Computer Security (ICICS’07),2007,2

An Ultimatum Game Model for the Evolution of Privacy in Jointly Managed Content,Sarah Rajtmajer; Anna Squicciarini; Jose M Such; Justin Semonsen; Andrew Belmonte,Abstract Content sharing in social networks is now one of the most common activities ofinternet users. In sharing content; users often have to make access control or privacydecisions that impact other stakeholders or co-owners. These decisions involve negotiation;either implicitly or explicitly. Over time; as users engage in these interactions; their ownprivacy attitudes evolve; influenced by and consequently influencing their peers. In thispaper; we present a variation of the one-shot Ultimatum Game; wherein we model individualusers interacting with their peers to make privacy decisions about shared content. Weanalyze the effects of sharing dynamics on individuals' privacy preferences over repeatedinteractions of the game. We theoretically demonstrate conditions under which users' accessdecisions eventually converge; and characterize this limit as a function of inherent …,International Conference on Decision and Game Theory for Security,2017,1
Toward group-based user-attribute policies in azure-like access control systems,Anna Lisa Ferrara; Anna Squicciarini; Cong Liao; Truc L Nguyen,Abstract Cloud resources are increasingly pooled together for collaboration among usersfrom different administrative units. In these settings; separation of duty between resourceand identity management is strongly encouraged; as it streamlines organization of resourceaccess in cloud. Yet; this separation may hinder availability and accessibility of resources;negating access to authorized and entitled subjects.

In this paper;we describe a novel approach to investigate negative behavior dynamics in online socialnetworks as epidemic phenomena. We show that using hybrid automata; it is possible toexplain the contagion of antinormative behavior in certain online commentaries. We presenttwo variations of a finite-state machine model for time-varying epidemic dynamics; namelytriggered state transition and iterative local regression; which differ with respect to accuracyand complexity. We validate the model with experiments over a dataset of 400;000comments on 800 YouTube videos; classified by genre; and indicate how different epidemicpatterns of behavior can be tied to specific interaction patterns among users.,Social Network Analysis and Mining,2016,1

Last-hdfs: Location-aware storage technique for hadoop distributed file system,Cong Liao; Anna Squicciarini; Dan Lin,Enabled by the state-of-the-art cloud computing technologies; cloud storage has gainedincreasing popularity in recent years. Despite of the benefit of flexible and reliable dataaccess offered by such services; users have to bear with the fact of not actually knowing thewhereabouts of their data. The lack of knowledge and control of the physical locations ofdata could raise legal and regulatory issues; especially for certain sensitive data that aregoverned by laws to remain within certain geographic boundaries and borders. In this paper;we study the problem of data placement control within distributed file systems supportingcloud storage.

Efficient Network Path Verification for Policy-routedQueries,Sushama Karumanchi; Jingwei Li; Anna Squicciarini,Abstract Resource discovery in unstructured peer-to-peer networks causes a search queryto be flooded throughout the network via random nodes; leading to security and privacyissues. The owner of the search query does not have control over the transmission of itsquery through the network. Although algorithms have been proposed for policy-compliantquery or data routing in a network; these algorithms mainly deal with authentic routecomputation and do not provide mechanisms to actually verify the network paths taken bythe query. In this work; we propose an approach to deal with the problem of verifyingnetwork paths taken by a search query during resource discovery; and detection ofmalicious forwarding of search query. Our approach aims at being secure and yet veryscalable; even in the presence of huge number of nodes in the network.,Proceedings of the Sixth ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy,2016,1

Securing resource discovery in content hosting networks,Sushama Karumanchi; Jingwei Li; Anna Squicciarini,Abstract Secure search query routing is a long-standing problem in distributed networks;which has often been addressed using “all-or-nothing” approaches; that require either fullanonymity and encrypted routing or full trust on the routing nodes. An important problem withsecure routing is how to guarantee the search query is transmitted in an expected way. Inthis paper; we tackle the problem of secure routing by considering a generic policy-drivenrouting approach; and focus on the steps required to verify in a fully distributed manner thata search query is routed in accordance to a requester's preferences and detect cheatingnodes. We present an efficient and effective verification method for query routes; that isagnostic to the specific routing algorithm being used and achieves strong securityguarantees.

An assessment of accountability policies for large-scale distributed computing systems,Wonjun Lee; Anna C Squicciarini; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Grid computing systems offer resources to solve large-scale computationalproblems and are thus widely used in a large variety of domains; including computationalsciences; energy management; and defense. Accountability in these application domains isan important requirement; in that it enables controlling activities of users and resourceproviders through the collection and analysis of accountability data. However; because it isnot feasible to simply collect all the potentially useful data; we propose an accountabilitypolicy language to simplify administration tasks. In this paper; we show the efficiency of asystem that we have developed to implement the language. We first present a shortoverview of the system; and then assess the proposed accountability policies based on theexperiments.,Proceedings of the 5th Annual Workshop on Cyber Security and Information Intelligence Research: Cyber Security and Information Intelligence Challenges and Strategies,2009,1

Opinion Dynamics in the Presence of Increasing Agreement Pressure,Justin Semonsen; Christopher Griffin; Anna Squicciarini; Sarah Rajtmajer,In this paper; we study a model of agent consensus in a social network in the presenceincreasing interagent influence; ie; increasing peer pressure. Each agent in the socialnetwork has a distinct social stress function given by a weighted sum of internal and externalbehavioral pressures. We assume a weighted average update rule consistent with theclassic DeGroot model and prove conditions under which a connected group of agentsconverge to a fixed opinion distribution; and under which conditions the group reachesconsensus. We show that the update rule converges to gradient descent and explain itstransient and asymptotic convergence properties. Through simulation; we study the rate ofconvergence on a scale-free network.,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2018,*
Survey on Access Control for Community-Centered Collaborative Systems,Federica Paci; Anna Squicciarini; Nicola Zannone,Abstract The last decades have seen a growing interest and demand for community-centered collaborative systems and platforms. These systems and platforms aim to providean environment in which users can collaboratively create; share; and manage resources.While offering attractive opportunities for online collaboration and information sharing; theyalso open several security and privacy issues. This has attracted several research effortstoward the design and implementation of novel access control solutions that can handle thecomplexity introduced by collaboration. Despite these efforts; transition to practice has beenhindered by the lack of maturity of the proposed solutions.

A group-based personalized model for image privacy classification and labeling,Haoti Zhong; Anna Squicciarini; David Miller; Cornelia Caragea,Abstract We address machine prediction of an individual's label (private or public) for agiven image. This problem is difficult due to user subjectivity and inadequate labeledexamples to train individual; personalized models. It is also time and space consuming totrain a classifier for each user. We propose a Group-Based Personalized Model for imageprivacy classification in online social media sites; which learns a set of archetypical privacymodels (groups); and associates a given user with one of these groups. Our system can beused to provide accurate “early warnings” with respect to a user's privacy awareness level.,Proceedings of the 26th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2017,*
Real-Time Detection of Illegal File Transfers in the Cloud,Adam Bowers; Dan Lin; Anna Squicciarini; Ali Hurson,There has been a prolific rise in the popularityof cloud storage in recent years. While cloudstorage offersmany advantages such as flexibility and convenience; users arenow unable totell or control the actual locations of their data. This limitation may affect users' confidenceand trust in thestorage provider; or even be unsuitable for storing data withstrict locationrequirements. To address this issue; we proposean illegal file transfer detection frameworkthat constantlymonitors the real-time file transfers in the cloud and is capableof detectingpotential illegal transfers which moves sensitivedata outside the (" legal") boundariesspecified by the fileowner. The main idea is to classifying multiple users' locationpreferences when making the data storage arrangement inthe cloud nodes.

Dynamic Contract Design for Heterogenous Workers in Crowdsourcing for Quality Control,Chenxi Qiu; Anna Cinzia Squicciarini; Sarah Michele Rajtmajer; James Caverlee,Crowdsourcing sites heavily rely on paid workers to ensure completion of tasks. Yet;designing a pricing strategies able to incentivize users' quality and retention is non trivial.Existing payment strategies either simply set a fixed payment per task without consideringchanges in workers' behaviors; or rule out poor quality responses and workers based oncoarse criteria. Hence; task requesters may be investing significantly in work that isinaccurate or even misleading. In this paper; we design a dynamic contract to incentivizehigh-quality work. Our proposed approach offers a theoretically proven algorithm tocalculate the contract for each worker in a cost-efficient manner. In contrast to existing work;our contract design is not only adaptive to changes in workers' behavior; but also adjustspricing policy in the presence of malicious behavior.

From Tag to Protect: A Tag-Driven Policy Recommender System for Image Sharing,Anna Squicciarini; Andrea Novelli; Dan Lin; Cornelia Caragea; Haoti Zhong,Abstract—Sharing images on social network sites has become a part of daily routine formore and more online users. However; in face of the considerable amount of images sharedonline; it is not a trivial task for a person to manually configure proper privacy settings foreach of the images that he/she uploaded. The lack of proper privacy protection during imagesharing could raise many potential privacy breaches of people's private lives that they arenot aware of. In this work; we propose a privacy setting recommender system to help peopleeffortlessly set up the privacy settings for their online images. The key idea is developedbased on our finding that there are certain correlations between a number of genericpatterns of image privacy settings and image tags; regardless of the image owners'individual privacy bias and levels of awareness.

A Model of Paradoxical Privacy Behavior in Online Users,Christopher Griffin; Sarah Rajtmajer; Anna Squicciarini,Recent privacy research has identified some paradoxical behavior that online users oftendisplay; such as claiming to be conservative and then actually oversharing. In particular;recent work by Brandimarte et al. discussed an apparent privacy paradox in onlineinteractions. According to the study; users tend to over-disclose private information if theyperceive to have control over the disclosure of their content. In this paper; we formallyexplain this apparent paradox in user privacy behavior as a straightforward optimization ofcomfort with sharing and perceived control. We describe the interests of a social network sitein managing user privacy options. Namely; a site seeks to maximize perceived user control;while managing costs associated with providing that control. Furthermore; we extend thediscussion for the case of ynamic time; and study an optimal control problem for the site …,Collaboration and Internet Computing (CIC); 2016 IEEE 2nd International Conference on,2016,*
Cloud Computing Essentials,Anna Squicciarini; Daniela Oliveira; Dan Lin,1.1 INTRODUCTION TO CLOUD COMPUTING Cloud computing is being acclaimed as thepenultimate solution to the problems of uncertain traffic spikes; computing overloads; andpotentially expensive investments in hardware for data processing and backups [1].

The first is cryptography;which conceals plain text information using mathematical transformations. The second isaccess control; which defines the parties permitted access to certain parts of the system orcertain pieces of information. The third is authorization; which determines what actions eachauthorized party is allowed to do with a piece of data or a system module [1–3].

Privacy through web-traveler policies in social network environments,Smitha Sundareswaran; Anna C Squicciarini,Social networking sites are ingrained in the fabric of our day-to-day lives; with these sitesbeing widely used to exchange personal information and content. Some forms of accesscontrol are provided by the sites themselves to protect the user-uploaded content. However;these types of control are limited in that they require the user's input for the effectiveprotection; otherwise a default policy which provides minimal protection is often applied.Towards providing extended content protection; in this paper we propose an approach forautomated user-uploaded content control. Automatic enforcement allows us to extend theprotection of content for unprotected files; preventing underage viewers from accessing adultcontent; tracking stolen or misused copyright-free images.

This is; to the best of our knowledge; the firstattempt to integrate a federated IdM system with a trust-negotiation system.

Inter-operability is also required among the devices used for the authentication.Moreover; very often biometric authentication in itself is not sufficient as a conclusive proof ofidentity and has to be complemented with multiple other proofs of identity like passwords;SSN; or other user identifiers. Multi-factor authentication mechanisms are thus required toenforce strong authentication based on the biometric and identifiers of other nature.

Privacy Preserving Multi-Factor Identity Verification Concepts and Issues,E Bertino; A Bhargav-Spantzel; A Squicciarini; R Xue,Abstract-The problem of identity theft; that is; the act of impersonating others' identities bypresenting stolen identifiers or proofs of identities; has been receiving increasing attentionbecause of its high financial and social costs. In this paper we discuss relevant concepts andissues and survey an approach based on the notion of multi-factor verification. Suchapproach; developed for federated digital identity management systems; is based on privacy-preserving cryptographic protocols and thus achieves high assurance privacy.,*,*,*

Integrating Federated Digital Identity Management and Trust Negotiation–issues and solutions,Abhilasha Bhargav-Spantzel Anna C Squicciarini; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Most organizations today require the verification of personal information pertainingto users in order to provide service to users. Privacy of such information is of growingconcern and because organizations often ask for similar information; this process can alsobe redundant and inefficient. Recent proposals dealing with federated identity managementhave the potential to alleviate such problems. The trust negotiation paradigm has severalsimilarities with federated identity management as they both aim at better handling users'sensitive information. It is thus important to clearly assess their differences and theirsimilarities in order to better understand the potential advantages deriving from theirintegration. In this paper we develop such a comparison according to a number of relevantcriteria; and we review the most well known initiatives and projects. Based on such an …,*,*,*
Practical Identity Theft Prevention using Aggregated Proof of Knowledge,Abhilasha Bhargav-Spantzel Anna C Squicciarini; Rui Xue; Elisa Bertino,Abstract The problem of identity theft; that is; the act of impersonating others' identities bypresenting stolen identifiers or proofs of identities; has been receiving increasing attentionbecause of its high financial and social costs. In this paper we address such problem bydeveloping a solution for federated organizations. Our approach is based on the concept ofprivacy preserving multi-factor authentication achieved by the implementation of a newcryptographic primitive which uses aggregate signatures on commitments that are then usedfor aggregate zero-knowledge proof of knowledge (ZKPK) protocols. The resultantsignatures are very short and the zero-knowledge proofs are succinct and efficient. Weprove the security of our scheme under the co-GDH assumption for groups with bilinearmaps. Our cryptographic scheme is superior in terms of the performance; flexibility and …,*,*,*
