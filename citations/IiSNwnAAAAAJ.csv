Scalable influence maximization for prevalent viral marketing in large-scale social networks,Wei Chen; Chi Wang; Yajun Wang,Abstract Influence maximization; defined by Kempe; Kleinberg; and Tardos (2003); is theproblem of finding a small set of seed nodes in a social network that maximizes the spreadof influence under certain influence cascade models. The scalability of influencemaximization is a key factor for enabling prevalent viral marketing in large-scale onlinesocial networks. Prior solutions; such as the greedy algorithm of Kempe et al.(2003) and itsimprovements are slow and not scalable; while other heuristic algorithms do not provideconsistently good performance on influence spreads. In this paper; we design a newheuristic algorithm that is easily scalable to millions of nodes and edges in our experiments.Our algorithm has a simple tunable parameter for users to control the balance between therunning time and the influence spread of the algorithm.

Social influence analysis in large-scale networks,Jie Tang; Jimeng Sun; Chi Wang; Zi Yang,Abstract In large social networks; nodes (users; entities) are influenced by others for variousreasons. For example; the colleagues have strong influence on one's work; while the friendshave strong influence on one's daily life. How to differentiate the social influences fromdifferent angles (topics)? How to quantify the strength of those social influences? How toestimate the model on real large networks? To address these fundamental questions; wepropose Topical Affinity Propagation (TAP) to model the topic-level social influence on largenetworks. In particular; TAP can take results of any topic modeling and the existing networkstructure to perform topic-level influence propagation. With the help of the influence analysis;we present several important applications on real data sets such as 1) what are therepresentative nodes on a given topic? 2) how to identify the social influences of …,Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2009,711
Multi-view clustering via joint nonnegative matrix factorization,Jialu Liu; Chi Wang; Jing Gao; Jiawei Han,Abstract Many real-world datasets are comprised of different representations or views whichoften provide information complementary to each other. To integrate information frommultiple views in the unsupervised setting; multi-view clustering algorithms have beendeveloped to cluster multiple views simultaneously to derive a solution which uncovers thecommon latent structure shared by multiple views. In this paper; we propose a novel NMF-based multi-view clustering algorithm by searching for a factorization that gives compatibleclustering solutions across multiple views. The key idea is to formulate a joint matrixfactorization process with the constraint that pushes clustering solution of each view towardsa common consensus instead of fixing it directly. The main challenge is how to keepclustering solutions across different views meaningful and comparable. To tackle this …,*,2013,219
On community outliers and their efficient detection in information networks,Jing Gao; Feng Liang; Wei Fan; Chi Wang; Yizhou Sun; Jiawei Han,Abstract Linked or networked data are ubiquitous in many applications. Examples includeweb data or hypertext documents connected via hyperlinks; social networks or user profilesconnected via friend links; co-authorship and citation information; blog data; movie reviewsand so on. In these datasets (called" information networks"); closely related objects thatshare the same properties or interests form a community. For example; a community inblogsphere could be users mostly interested in cell phone reviews and news. Outlierdetection in information networks can reveal important anomalous and interesting behaviorsthat are not obvious if community information is ignored. An example could be a low-incomeperson being friends with many rich people even though his income is not anomalously lowwhen considered over the entire population.

Mining advisor-advisee relationships from research publication networks,Chi Wang; Jiawei Han; Yuntao Jia; Jie Tang; Duo Zhang; Yintao Yu; Jingyi Guo,Abstract Information network contains abundant knowledge about relationships amongpeople or entities. Unfortunately; such kind of knowledge is often hidden in a network wheredifferent kinds of relationships are not explicitly categorized. For example; in a researchpublication network; the advisor-advisee relationships among researchers are hidden in thecoauthor network. Discovery of those relationships can benefit many interesting applicationssuch as expert finding and research community analysis. In this paper; we take a computerscience bibliographic network as an example; to analyze the roles of authors and to discoverthe likely advisor-advisee relationships. In particular; we propose a time-constrainedprobabilistic factor graph model (TPFG); which takes a research publication network as inputand models the advisor-advisee relationship mining problem using a jointly likelihood …,Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2010,162
Scalable influence maximization for independent cascade model in large-scale social networks,Chi Wang; Wei Chen; Yajun Wang,Abstract Influence maximization; defined by Kempe et al.(SIGKDD 2003); is the problem offinding a small set of seed nodes in a social network that maximizes the spread of influenceunder certain influence cascade models.

Scalable topical phrase mining from text corpora,Ahmed El-Kishky; Yanglei Song; Chi Wang; Clare R Voss; Jiawei Han,Abstract While most topic modeling algorithms model text corpora with unigrams; humaninterpretation often relies on inherent grouping of terms into phrases. As such; we considerthe problem of discovering topical phrases of mixed lengths. Existing work either performspost processing to the results of unigram-based topic models; or utilizes complex n-gram-discovery topic models. These methods generally produce low-quality topical phrases orsuffer from poor scalability on even moderately-sized datasets. We propose a differentapproach that is both computationally efficient and effective. Our solution combines a novelphrase mining framework to segment a document into single and multi-word phrases; and anew topic model that operates on the induced document partition. Our approach discovershigh quality topical phrases with negligible extra cost to the bag-of-words topic model in a …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,87
Mining evidences for named entity disambiguation,Yang Li; Chi Wang; Fangqiu Han; Jiawei Han; Dan Roth; Xifeng Yan,Abstract Named entity disambiguation is the task of disambiguating named entity mentionsin natural language text and link them to their corresponding entries in a knowledge basesuch as Wikipedia. Such disambiguation can help enhance readability and add semantics toplain text. It is also a central step in constructing high-quality information network orknowledge graph from unstructured text. Previous research has tackled this problem bymaking use of various textual and structural features from a knowledge base. Most of theproposed algorithms assume that a knowledge base can provide enough explicit and usefulinformation to help disambiguate a mention to the right entity. However; the existingknowledge bases are rarely complete (likely will never be); thus leading to poorperformance on short queries with not well-known contexts. In such cases; we need to …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2013,70
Mining quality phrases from massive text corpora,Jialu Liu; Jingbo Shang; Chi Wang; Xiang Ren; Jiawei Han,Abstract Text data are ubiquitous and play an essential role in big data applications.However; text data are mostly unstructured. Transforming unstructured text into structuredunits (eg; semantically meaningful phrases) will substantially reduce semantic ambiguityand enhance the power and efficiency at manipulating such data using databasetechnology. Thus mining quality phrases is a critical research problem in the field ofdatabases. In this paper; we propose a new framework that extracts quality phrases from textcorpora integrated with phrasal segmentation. The framework requires only limited trainingbut the quality of phrases so generated is close to human judgment. Moreover; the method isscalable: both computation time and required space grow linearly as corpus size increases.Our experiments on large text corpora demonstrate the quality and efficiency of the new …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,61
User profiling in an ego network: co-profiling attributes and relationships,Rui Li; Chi Wang; Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang,Abstract User attributes; such as occupation; education; and location; are important for manyapplications. In this paper; we study the problem of profiling user attributes in social network.To capture the correlation between attributes and social connections; we present a newinsight that social connections are discriminatively correlated with attributes via a hiddenfactor--relationship type. For example; a user's colleagues are more likely to share the sameemployer with him than other friends. Based on the insight; we propose to co-profile users'attributes and relationship types of their connections. To achieve co-profiling; we develop anefficient algorithm based on an optimization framework. Our algorithm captures our insighteffectively. It iteratively profiles attributes by propagation via certain types of connections;and profiles types of connections based on attributes and the network structure.

A phrase mining framework for recursive construction of a topical hierarchy,Chi Wang; Marina Danilevsky; Nihit Desai; Yinan Zhang; Phuong Nguyen; Thrivikrama Taula; Jiawei Han,Abstract A high quality hierarchical organization of the concepts in a dataset at differentlevels of granularity has many valuable applications such as search; summarization; andcontent browsing. In this paper we propose an algorithm for recursively constructing ahierarchy of topics from a collection of content-representative documents. We characterizeeach topic in the hierarchy by an integrated ranked list of mixed-length phrases. Our miningframework is based on a phrase-centric view for clustering; extracting; and ranking topicalphrases. Experiments with datasets from three different domains illustrate our ability togenerate hierarchies of high quality topics represented by meaningful phrases.,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2013,51
LikeMiner: a system for mining the power of'like'in social media networks,Xin Jin; Chi Wang; Jiebo Luo; Xiao Yu; Jiawei Han,Abstract Social media is becoming increasingly ubiquitous and popular on the Internet. Dueto the huge popularity of social media websites; such as Facebook; Twitter; YouTube andFlickr; many companies or public figures are now active in maintaining pages on thosewebsites to interact with online users; attracting a large number of fans/followers by postinginteresting objects; eg;(product) photos/videos and text messages.'Like'has now become avery popular social function by allowing users to express their like of certain objects. Itprovides an accurate way of estimating user interests and an effective way ofsharing/promoting information in social media.

Learning online discussion structures by conditional random fields,Hongning Wang; Chi Wang; ChengXiang Zhai; Jiawei Han,Abstract Online forum discussions are emerging as valuable information repository; whereknowledge is accumulated by the interaction among users; leading to multiple threads withstructures. Such replying structure in each thread conveys important information about thediscussion content. Unfortunately; not all the online forum sites would explicitly record suchreplying relationship; making it hard to for both users and computers to digest theinformation buried in a thread discussion. In this paper; we propose a probabilistic model inthe Conditional Random Fields framework to predict the replying structure for a threadedonline discussion. Different from previous thread reconstruction methods; most of which failto consider dependency between the posts; we cast the problem as a supervised structurelearning problem to incorporate the features describing the structural dependency among …,Proceedings of the 34th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in Information Retrieval,2011,48
Learning relevance from heterogeneous social network and its application in online targeting,Chi Wang; Rajat Raina; David Fong; Ding Zhou; Jiawei Han; Greg Badros,Abstract The rise of social networking services in recent years presents new researchchallenges for matching users with interesting content. While the content-rich nature of thesesocial networks offers many cues on" interests" of a user such as text in user-generatedcontent; the links in the network; and user demographic information; there is a lack ofsuccessful methods for combining such heterogeneous data to model interest andrelevance. This paper proposes a new method for modeling user interest fromheterogeneous data sources with distinct but unknown importance. The model leverageslinks in the social graph by integrating the conceptual representation of a user's linkedobjects. The proposed method seeks a scalable relevance model of user interest; that canbe discriminatively optimized for various relevance-centric problems; such as Internet …,Proceedings of the 34th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in Information Retrieval,2011,46
Clustype: Effective entity recognition and typing by relation phrase-based clustering,Xiang Ren; Ahmed El-Kishky; Chi Wang; Fangbo Tao; Clare R Voss; Jiawei Han,Abstract Entity recognition is an important but challenging research problem. In reality; manytext collections are from specific; dynamic; or emerging domains; which poses significantnew challenges for entity recognition with increase in name ambiguity and context sparsity;requiring entity detection without domain restriction. In this paper; we investigate entityrecognition (ER) with distant-supervision and propose a novel relation phrase-based ERframework; called ClusType; that runs data-driven phrase mining to generate entity mentioncandidates and relation phrases; and enforces the principle that relation phrases should besoftly clustered when propagating type information between their argument entities.

The wisdom of minority: Unsupervised slot filling validation based on multi-dimensional truth-finding,Dian Yu; Hongzhao Huang; Taylor Cassidy; Heng Ji; Chi Wang; Shi Zhi; Jiawei Han; Clare Voss; Malik Magdon-Ismail,Abstract Information Extraction using multiple information sources and systems is beneficialdue to multisource/system consolidation and challenging due to the resulting inconsistencyand redundancy. We integrate IE and truth-finding research and present a novelunsupervised multi-dimensional truth finding framework which incorporates signals frommultiple sources; multiple systems and multiple pieces of evidence by knowledge graphconstruction through multi-layer deep linguistic analysis. Experiments on the case study ofSlot Filling Validation demonstrate that our approach can find truths accurately (9.4% higherF-score than supervised methods) and efficiently (finding 90% truths with only one half thecost of a baseline without credibility estimation).,Proceedings of COLING 2014; the 25th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers,2014,40
Targeted disambiguation of ad-hoc; homogeneous sets of named entities,Chi Wang; Kaushik Chakrabarti; Tao Cheng; Surajit Chaudhuri,Abstract In many entity extraction applications; the entities to be recognized are constrainedto be from a list of" target entities". In many cases; these target entities are (i) ad-hoc; ie; donot exist in a knowledge base and (ii) homogeneous (eg; all the entities are IT companies).We study the following novel disambiguation problem in this unique setting: given thecandidate mentions of all the target entities; determine which ones are true mentions of atarget entity. Prior techniques only consider target entities present in a knowledge baseand/or having a rich set of attributes. In this paper; we develop novel techniques that requireno knowledge about the entities except their names. Our main insight is to leverage thehomogeneity constraint and disambiguate the candidate mentions collectively across alldocuments. We propose a graph-based model; called MentionRank; for that purpose …,Proceedings of the 21st international conference on World Wide Web,2012,38
Dynamic social influence analysis through time-dependent factor graphs,Chi Wang; Jie Tang; Jimeng Sun; Jiawei Han,Social influence; the phenomenon that the actions of a user can induce her/his friends tobehave in a similar way; plays a key role in many (online) social systems. For example; acompany wants to market a new product through the effect of" word of mouth''in the socialnetwork. It wishes to find and convince a small number of influential users to adopt theproduct; and the goal is to trigger a large cascade of further adoptions. Fundamentally; weneed to answer the following question: how to quantify the influence between two users in alarge social network? To address this question; we propose a pair wise factor graph (PFG)model to model the social influence in social networks. An efficient algorithm is designed tolearn the model and make inference. We further propose a dynamic factor graph (DFG)model to incorporate the time information.

Automatic construction and ranking of topical keyphrases on collections of short documents,Marina Danilevsky; Chi Wang; Nihit Desai; Xiang Ren; Jingyi Guo; Jiawei Han,Abstract We introduce a framework for topical keyphrase generation and ranking; based onthe output of a topic model run on a collection of short documents. By shifting from theunigramcentric traditional methods of keyphrase extraction and ranking to a phrase-centricapproach; we are able to directly compare and rank phrases of different lengths. Our methoddefines a function to rank topical keyphrases so that more highly ranked keyphrases areconsidered to be more representative phrases for that topic.

Decomposition: privacy preservation for multiple sensitive attributes,Yang Ye; Yu Liu; Chi Wang; Dapeng Lv; Jianhua Feng,Abstract Aiming at ensuring privacy preservation in personal data publishing; the topic ofanonymization has been intensively studied in recent years. However; existinganonymization techniques all assume each tuple in the microdata table contains one singlesensitive attribute (the SSA case); while none paid attention to the case of multiple sensitiveattributes in a tuple (the MSA case). In this paper; we conduct the pioneering study on theMSA case; and propose a new framework; decomposition; to tackle privacy preservation inthe MSA case.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2009,21
Sample+ seek: Approximating aggregates with distribution precision guarantee,Bolin Ding; Silu Huang; Surajit Chaudhuri; Kaushik Chakrabarti; Chi Wang,Abstract Data volumes are growing exponentially for our decision-support systems making itchallenging to ensure interactive response time for ad-hoc queries without increasing cost ofhardware. Aggregation queries with Group By that produce an aggregate value for everycombination of values in the grouping columns are the most important class of ad-hocqueries. As small errors are usually tolerable for such queries; approximate queryprocessing (AQP) has the potential to answer them over very large datasets much faster.,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,20
Constructing topical hierarchies in heterogeneous information networks,Chi Wang; Jialu Liu; Nihit Desai; Marina Danilevsky; Jiawei Han,Abstract Many digital documentary data collections (eg; scientific publications; enterprisereports; news articles; and social media) can be modeled as a heterogeneous informationnetwork; linking text with multiple types of entities. Constructing high-quality hierarchies thatcan represent topics at multiple granularities benefits tasks such as search; informationbrowsing; and pattern mining. In this work; we present an algorithm for recursivelyconstructing multi-typed topical hierarchies. Contrary to traditional text-based topicmodeling; our approach handles both textual phrases and multiple types of entities by anewly designed clustering and ranking algorithm for heterogeneous network data; as well asmining and ranking topical patterns of different types. Our experiments on datasets from twodifferent domains demonstrate that our algorithm yields high-quality; multi-typed topical …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2015,20
Content coverage maximization on word networks for hierarchical topic summarization,Chi Wang; Xiao Yu; Yanen Li; Chengxiang Zhai; Jiawei Han,Abstract This paper studies text summarization by extracting hierarchical topics from a givencollection of documents. We propose a new approach of text modeling via network analysis.We convert documents into a word influence network; and find the words summarizing themajor topics with an efficient influence maximization algorithm. Besides; the influencecapability of the topic words on other words in the network reveal the relations among thetopic words. Then we cluster the words and build hierarchies for the topics. Experiments onlarge collections of Web documents show that a simple method based on the influenceanalysis is effective; compared with existing generative topic modeling and random walkbased ranking.,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Information & Knowledge Management,2013,15

Concept expansion using web tables,Chi Wang; Kaushik Chakrabarti; Yeye He; Kris Ganjam; Zhimin Chen; Philip A Bernstein,Abstract We study the following problem: given the name of an ad-hoc concept as well as afew seed entities belonging to the concept; output all entities belonging to it. Sinceproducing the exact set of entities is hard; we focus on returning a ranked list of entities.Previous approaches either use seed entities as the only input; or inherently requirenegative examples. They suffer from input ambiguity and semantic drift; or are not viableoptions for ad-hoc tail concepts. In this paper; we propose to leverage the millions of tableson the web for this problem. The core technical challenge is to identify the``exclusive''tablesfor a concept to prevent semantic drift; existing holistic ranking techniques like personalizedPageRank are inadequate for this purpose. We develop novel probabilistic ranking methodsthat can model a new type of table-entity relationship.

Ranking-based name matching for author disambiguation in bibliographic data,Jialu Liu; Kin Hou Lei; Jeffery Yufei Liu; Chi Wang; Jiawei Han,Abstract Author name ambiguity is a frequently encountered problem in digital publicationlibraries such as Microsoft Academic Search. The cause of this problem mostly is thatdifferent authors may publish under the same name; while the same author could publishunder various names due to abbreviations; nicknames; etc. Author disambiguation is exactlythe goal of the Track II of KDD Cup Data Mining Contest 2013. In this paper we introduce ourranking-based name matching algorithm and system called RankMatch. One importantfeature of our solution is using heterogeneous meta-paths to evaluate the similarity betweentwo potential duplicate authors whose names are compatible.

Therefore; groupingsemantically similar relations into clusters would facilitate and improve many applications;including knowledge base completion; information extraction; information retrieval; andmore.

Trust; but verify: Optimistic visualizations of approximate queries for exploring big data,Dominik Moritz; Danyel Fisher; Bolin Ding; Chi Wang,Abstract Analysts need interactive speed for exploratory analysis; but big data systems areoften slow. With sampling; data systems can produce approximate answers fast enough forexploratory visualization; at the cost of accuracy and trust. We propose optimisticvisualization; which approaches these issues from a user experience perspective. Thismethod lets analysts explore approximate results interactively; and provides a way to detectand recover from errors later. Pangloss implements these ideas. We discuss design issuesraised by optimistic visualization systems. We test this concept with five expert visualizers ina laboratory study and three case studies at Microsoft. Analysts reported that they felt moreconfident in their results; and used optimistic visualization to check that their preliminaryresults were correct.,Proceedings of the 2017 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2017,8
Semantic frame-based document representation for comparable corpora,Hyungsul Kim; Xiang Ren; Yizhou Sun; Chi Wang; Jiawei Han,Document representation is a fundamental problem for text mining. Many efforts have beendone to generate concise yet semantic representation; such as bag-of-words; phrase;sentence and topic-level descriptions.

In this paper; we propose the use of frame; a high-level semantic unit; and construct frame-based representations to semantically describedocuments by bags of frames; using an information network approach. One major challengein this representation is that semantically similar frames may be of different forms.

A privacy mechanism for mobile-based urban traffic monitoring,Chi Wang; Hua Liu; Kwame-Lante Wright; Bhaskar Krishnamachari; Murali Annavaram,Abstract In mobile-based traffic monitoring applications; each user provides real-timeupdates on their location and speed while driving. This data is collected by a centralizedserver and aggregated to provide participants with current traffic conditions. Successfulparticipation in traffic monitoring applications utilizing participatory sensing depends on twofactors: the information utility of the estimated traffic condition; and the amount of privateinformation (position and speed) each participant reveals to the server. We assume eachuser prefers to reveal as little private information as possible; but if everyone withholdsinformation; the quality of traffic estimation will deteriorate. In this paper; we model theseopposing requirements by considering each user to have a utility function that combines thebenefit of high quality traffic estimates and the cost of privacy loss.

Scalable moment-based inference for latent dirichlet allocation,Chi Wang; Xueqing Liu; Yanglei Song; Jiawei Han,Abstract Topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation have been useful text analysismethods of wide interest. Recently; moment-based inference with provable performance hasbeen proposed for topic models. Compared with inference algorithms that approximate themaximum likelihood objective; moment-based inference has theoretical guarantee inrecovering model parameters. One such inference method is tensor orthogonaldecomposition; which requires only mild assumptions for exact recovery of topics.

Itis efficient in both time and space; and only requires scanning the corpus twice.

Entity role discovery in hierarchical topical communities,Marina Danilevsky; Chi Wang; Nihit Desai; Jiawei Han,ABSTRACT People and social communities are often characterized by the topics andthemes they are working on; or communicating about. Discovering the roles played bydifferent entities in these communities are of great interest in many real-world contexts insocial network analysis. We are also often interested in discovering such roles at differentlevels of granularity. In this paper we study a new problem of mining entity roles inhierarchical topical communities. We first detect topical communities from the textcomponent of a social or information network. Since we mine phrases from the network; andrepresent topical communities by ranked lists of mixed-length phrases; the communitieshave a good interpretation at multiple levels of the hierarchy. We are therefore able todiscover topical roles of different types of entities in both large communities …,Proc. ACM SIGKDD Int. Conf. on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2013,6
Automatic entity recognition and typing in massive text corpora,Xiang Ren; Ahmed El-Kishky; Chi Wang; Jiawei Han,Abstract In today's computerized and information-based society; we are soaked with vastamounts of natural language text data; ranging from news articles; product reviews;advertisements; to a wide range of user-generated content from social media. To turn suchmassive unstructured text data into actionable knowledge; one of the grand challenges is togain an understanding of entities and the relationships between them. In this tutorial; weintroduce data-driven methods to recognize typed entities of interest in different kinds of textcorpora (especially in massive; domain-specific text corpora). These methods canautomatically identify token spans as entity mentions in text and label their types (eg; people;product; food) in a scalable way. We demonstrate on real datasets including news articlesand yelp reviews how these typed entities aid in knowledge discovery and management.,Proceedings of the 25th International Conference Companion on World Wide Web,2016,5
Scalable and robust construction of topical hierarchies,Chi Wang; Xueqing Liu; Yanglei Song; Jiawei Han,Abstract: Automated generation of high-quality topical hierarchies for a text collection is adream problem in knowledge engineering with many valuable applications. In this paper ascalable and robust algorithm is proposed for constructing a hierarchy of topics from a textcollection. We divide and conquer the problem using a top-down recursive framework;based on a tensor orthogonal decomposition technique. We solve a critical challenge toperform scalable inference for our newly designed hierarchical topic model. Experimentswith various real-world datasets illustrate its ability to generate robust; high-qualityhierarchies efficiently. Our method reduces the time of construction by several orders ofmagnitude; and its robust feature renders it possible for users to interactively revise thehierarchy. Subjects: Learning (cs.

Targeted disambiguation of named entities,*,A targeted disambiguation system is described herein which determines true mentions of alist of named entities in a collection of documents. The list of named entities is homogenousin the sense that the entities pertain to the same subject matter domain. The systemdetermines the true mentions by leveraging the homogeneity in the list; and; morespecifically by applying a context similarity hypothesis; a co-mention hypothesis; and aninterdependency hypothesis. In one implementation; the system executes its analysis usinga graph-based model. The system can operate without the existence of additionalinformation regarding the entities in the list; nevertheless; if such information is available; thesystem can integrate it into its analysis.,*,2017,4
AMETHYST: A system for mining and exploring topical hierarchies of heterogeneous data,Marina Danilevsky; Chi Wang; Fangbo Tao; Son Nguyen; Gong Chen; Nihit Desai; Lidan Wang; Jiawei Han,Abstract In this demo we present AMETHYST; a system for exploring and analyzing a topicalhierarchy constructed from a heterogeneous information network (HIN). HINs; composed ofmultiple types of entities and links are very common in the real world. Many have a textcomponent; and thus can benefit from a high quality hierarchical organization of the topics inthe network dataset. By organizing the topics into a hierarchy; AMETHYST helps understandsearch results in the context of an ontology; and explain entity relatedness at differentgranularities. The automatically constructed topical hierarchy reflects a domain-specificontology; interacts with multiple types of linked entities; and can be tailored for both free textand OLAP queries.,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2013,4

Social patterns: Community detection using behavior-generated network datasets,Alice Leung; William Dron; John P Hancock; Matthew Aguirre; Jon Purnell; Jiawei Han; Chi Wang; Jaideep Srivastava; Amogh Mahapatra; Atanu Roy; Lisa Scott,A set of behavior rules; personal characteristics; group affiliations and roles was used togenerate a dataset of mixed communication actions modeling those at a large organization.Several different approaches to community detection and modeling were applied to thisgenerated dataset; in order to compare the strengths and range of applicability of differentalgorithms. Graph partitioning methods performed well at assigning membership to formal;exclusive groups such as organizational departments; if there is a priori knowledge of thetarget number of groups. SSDE-cluster; a fast and scalable algorithm; performed well indetecting normal departments and can be used when the number of groups is not known. Italso was able to detect small overlapping groups; but with only moderate accuracy.

Towards interactive construction of topical hierarchy: A recursive tensor decomposition approach,Chi Wang; Xueqing Liu; Yanglei Song; Jiawei Han,Abstract Automatic construction of user-desired topical hierarchies over large volumes of textdata is a highly desirable but challenging task. This study proposes to give users freedom toconstruct topical hierarchies via interactive operations such as expanding a branch andmerging several branches. Existing hierarchical topic modeling techniques are inadequatefor this purpose because (1) they cannot consistently preserve the topics when the hierarchystructure is modified; and (2) the slow inference prevents swift response to user requests. Inthis study; we propose a novel method; called STROD; that allows efficient and consistentmodification of topic hierarchies; based on a recursive generative model and a scalabletensor decomposition inference algorithm with theoretical performance guarantee. Empiricalevaluation shows that STROD reduces the runtime of construction by several orders of …,Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2015,3

Bringing Structure to Text: Mining Phrases; Entity Concepts; Topics; and Hierarchies,Jiawei Han; Chi Wang; Ahmed El-Kishky,Abstract Mining phrases; entity concepts; topics; and hierarchies from massive text corpus isan essential problem in the age of big data. Text data in electronic forms are ubiquitous;ranging from scientific articles to social networks; enterprise logs; news articles; social mediaand general web pages. It is highly desirable but challenging to bring structure tounstructured text data; uncover underlying hierarchies; relationships; patterns and trends;and gain knowledge from such data. In this tutorial; we provide a comprehensive survey onthe state-of-the art of data-driven methods that automatically mine phrases; extract and inferlatent structures from text corpus; and construct multi-granularity topical groupings andhierarchies of the underlying themes. We study their principles; methodologies; algorithmsand applications using several real datasets including research papers and news articles …,KDD2014 conference tutorial,2014,2

On the Detectability of Node Grouping in Networks.,Chi Wang; Hongning Wang; Jialu Liu; Ming Ji; Lu Su; Yuguo Chen; Jiawei Han,Abstract In typical studies of node grouping detection; the grouping is presumed to have acertain type of correlation with the network structure (eg; densely connected groups of nodesthat are loosely connected in between). People have defined different fitness measures(modularity; conductance; etc.) to quantify such correlation; and group the nodes byoptimizing a certain fitness measure. However; a particular grouping with desired semantics;as the target of the detection; is not promised to be detectable by each measure. We study afundamental problem in the process of node grouping discovery: Given a particular groupingin a network; whether and to what extent it can be discovered with a given fitness measure.We propose two approaches of testing the detectability; namely ranking-based andcorrelation-based randomization tests. Our methods are evaluated on both synthetic and …,SDM,2013,1
Concept expansion using tables,*,Concept expansion using tables; such as web tables; can return entities belonging to aconcept based on an input of the concept and at least one seed entity that belongs to theconcept. A concept expansion frontend can receive the concept and seed entity and providethem to a concept expansion framework. The concept expansion framework can expand thecoverage of entities for concepts; including tail concepts; using tables by leveraging richcontent signals corresponding to concept names. Such content signals can include contentmatching the concept that appear in captions; early headings; page titles; surrounding text;anchor text; and queries for which the page has been clicked. The concept expansionframework can use the structured entities in tables to infer exclusive tables. Such inferencediffers from previous label propagation methods and involves modeling a table-entity …,*,2016,*

Expansion of Tail Concept Using Web Tables,Chi Wang; Kaushik Chakrabarti; Yeye He; Kris Ganjam; Zhimin Chen; Philip A Bernstein,Abstract Human-curated knowledgebases like Freebase and DBPedia cover popularconcepts such as persons; organizations and locations; but many more specific concepts fallinto the long tail outside current knowledgebases; such as acidic fruits; HD video formatsand renewable resources. These concepts are found in conceptentity pairs automaticallyextracted from text documents; but they cover a limited number of entities per concept due toinsufficient mentions in text. In this paper; we propose to expand the coverage of entities fortail concepts using web tables. It is challenging to apply existing techniques because a tailconcept often overlaps many other concepts. Our solution is based on the fact that manyweb tables contain a set of entities all belonging to a fine grained concept. We leverage therich content signals and the structured entities in web tables to infer such exclusive tables …,*,2014,*
MSR-TR-2010-2 January 2010,Wei Chen; Chi Wang; Yajun Wang,Abstract Influence maximization; defined by Kempe; Kleinberg; and Tardos (2003); is theproblem of finding a small set of seed nodes in a social network that maximizes the spreadof influence under certain influence cascade models. The scalability of influencemaximization is a key factor for enabling prevalent viral marketing in large-scale onlinesocial networks. Prior solutions; such as the greedy algorithm of Kempe et al.(2003) and itsimprovements are slow and not scalable; while other heuristic algorithms do not provideconsistently good performance on influence spreads. In this paper; we design a newheuristic algorithm that is easily scalable to millions of nodes and edges in our experiments.Our algorithm has a simple tunable parameter for users to control the balance between therunning time and the influence spread of the algorithm.
