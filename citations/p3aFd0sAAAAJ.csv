Automatic web spreadsheet data extraction,Zhe Chen; Michael Cafarella,Abstract Spreadsheets contain a huge amount of high-value data but do not observe astandard data model and thus are difficult to integrate. A large number of data integrationtools exist; but they generally can only work on relational data. Existing systems forextracting relational data from spreadsheets are too labor intensive to support ad-hocintegration tasks; in which the correct extraction target is only learned during the course ofuser interaction. This paper introduces a system that automatically extracts relational datafrom spreadsheets; thereby enabling relational spreadsheet integration. The resultingintegrated relational data can be queried directly or can be translated into RDF triples. Whencompared to standard techniques for spreadsheet data extraction on a set of 100 randomWeb spreadsheets; the system reduces the amount of human labor by 72% to 92%.

Integrating spreadsheet data via accurate and low-effort extraction,Zhe Chen; Michael Cafarella,Abstract Spreadsheets contain valuable data on many topics. However; spreadsheets aredifficult to integrate with other data sources. Converting spreadsheet data to the relationalmodel would allow data analysts to use relational integration tools. We propose a two-phasesemiautomatic system that extracts accurate relational metadata while minimizing user effort.Based on an undirected graphical model; our system enables downstream spreadsheetintegration applications. First; the automatic extractor uses hints from spreadsheets'graphical style and recovered metadata to extract the spreadsheet data as accurately aspossible. Second; the interactive repair identifies similar regions in distinct spreadsheetsscattered across large spreadsheet corpora; allowing a user's single manual repair to beamortized over many possible extraction errors. Our experiments show that a human can …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2014,29
Senbazuru: a prototype spreadsheet database management system,Zhe Chen; Michael Cafarella; Jun Chen; Daniel Prevo; Junfeng Zhuang,Abstract Spreadsheets have become a critical data management tool; but they lack explicitrelational metadata; making it difficult to join or integrate data across multiple spreadsheets.Because spreadsheet data are widely available on a huge range of topics; a tool that allowseasy spreadsheet integration would be hugely beneficial for a variety of users. Wedemonstrate that Senbazuru; a prototype spreadsheet database management system(SSDBMS); is able to extract relational information from spreadsheets. By doing so; it opensup opportunities for integration among spreadsheets and with other relational sources.Senbazuru allows users to search for relevant spreadsheets in a large corpus;probabilistically constructs a relational version of the data; and offers several relationaloperations over the resulting extracted data (including joins to other spreadsheet data) …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,25
Long-tail Vocabulary Dictionary Extraction from the Web,Zhe Chen; Michael Cafarella; HV Jagadish,Abstract A dictionary---a set of instances belonging to the same conceptual class---is centralto information extraction and is a useful primitive for many applications; including query loganalysis and document categorization. Considerable work has focused on generatingaccurate dictionaries given a few example seeds; but methods to date cannot obtain long-tail (rare) items with high accuracy and recall. In this paper; we develop a novel method toconstruct high-quality dictionaries; especially for long-tail vocabularies; using just a few user-provided seeds for each topic. Our algorithm obtains long-tail (ie; rare) items by building andexecuting high-quality webpage-specific extractors. We use webpage-specific structural andtextual information to build more accurate per-page extractors in order to detect the long-tailitems from a single webpage. These webpage-specific extractors are obtained via a co …,WSDM,2016,13
DiagramFlyer: A Search Engine for Data-Driven Diagrams,Zhe Chen; Michael Cafarella; Eytan Adar,Abstract A large amount of data is available only through data-driven diagrams such as barcharts and scatterplots. These diagrams are stylized mixtures of graphics and text and arethe result of complicated data-centric production pipelines. Unfortunately; neither text norimage search engines exploit these diagram-specific properties; making it difficult for usersto find relevant diagrams in a large corpus. In response; we propose DiagramFlyer; a searchengine for finding data-driven diagrams on the web. By recovering the semantic roles ofdiagram components (eg; axes; labels; etc.); we provide faceted indexing and retrieval forvarious statistical diagrams. A unique feature of DiagramFlyer is that it is able to" expand"queries to include not only exactly matching diagrams; but also diagrams that are likely to berelated in terms of their production pipelines. We demonstrate the resulting search system …,Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web Companion,2015,13
Egoset: Exploiting word ego-networks and user-generated ontology for multifaceted set expansion,Xin Rong; Zhe Chen; Qiaozhu Mei; Eytan Adar,Abstract A key challenge of entity set expansion is that multifaceted input seeds can lead tosignificant incoherence in the result set. In this paper; we present a novel solution tohandling multifaceted seeds by combining existing user-generated ontologies with a novelword-similarity metric based on skip-grams. By blending the two resources we are able toproduce sparse word ego-networks that are centered on the seed terms and are able tocapture semantic equivalence among words. We demonstrate that the resulting networkspossess internally-coherent clusters; which can be exploited to provide non-overlappingexpansions; in order to reflect different semantic classes of the seeds. Empirical evaluationagainst state-of-the-art baselines shows that our solution; EgoSet; is able to not only capturemultiple facets in the input query; but also generate expansions for each facet with higher …,Proceedings of the Ninth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2016,12
Searching for statistical diagrams,Shirley Zhe Chen; Michael J Cafarella; Eytan Adar,Statistical; or data-driven; diagrams are an important method for communicating complexinformation. For many technical documents; the diagrams may be readers' only access to theraw data underlying the documents' conclusions. Unfortunately; finding diagrams online isvery difficult using current search systems. Standard text-based search will only retrieve thediagrams' enclosing documents. Web image search engines may retrieve some diagrams;but they generally work by examining textual content that surrounds images; thus missingout on many important signals of diagram content (Bhatia et al.; 2010; Carberry et al.; 2006).Even the text that is present in diagrams has meaning that is hugely dependent on theirgeometric positioning within the diagram's frame; a number in the caption means somethingquite different from the same number in the x-axis scale (Bertin; 1983).,Frontiers of Engineering; National Academy of Engineering,2011,9
Spreadsheet Property Detection With Rule-assisted Active Learning,Zhe Chen; Xin Rong; Sasha Dadiomov; Richard Wesley; Gang Xiao; Daniel Cory; Michael Cafarella; Jock Mackinlay,Abstract Spreadsheets are a critical and widely-used data management tool. Convertingspreadsheet data into relational tables would bring benefits to a number of fields; includingpublic policy; public health; and economics. Research to date has focused on designingdomain-specific languages to describe transformation processes or automatically convertinga specific type of spreadsheets. To handle a larger variety of spreadsheets; we have toidentify various spreadsheet properties; which correspond to a series of transformationprograms that contribute towards a general framework that converts spreadsheets torelational tables. In this paper; we focus on the problem of spreadsheet property detection.We propose a hybrid approach of building a variety of spreadsheet property detectors toreduce the amount of required human labeling effort. Our approach integrates an active …,2017 International Conference on Information and Knowledge management,2017,2
Information Extraction on Para-Relational Data.,Zhe Chen,Para-relational data (such as spreadsheets and diagrams) refers to a type of nearlyrelational data that shares the important qualities of relational data but does not present itselfin a relational format. Para-relational data often conveys highly valuable information and iswidely used in many different areas. If we can convert para-relational data into the relationalformat; many existing tools can be leveraged for a variety of interesting applications; such asdata analysis with relational query systems and data integration applications. Thisdissertation aims to convert para-relational data into a high-quality relational form with littleuser assistance. We have developed four standalone systems; each addressing a specifictype of para-relational data. Senbazuru is a prototype spreadsheet database managementsystem that extracts relational information from a large number of spreadsheets. Anthias …,*,2016,2
A semiautomatic approach for accurate and low-effort spreadsheet data extraction,Zhe Chen; Michael Cafarella,ABSTRACT Spreadsheets contain valuable data on many topics; but they are difficult tointegrate with other sources. Converting spreadsheet data to the relational model wouldallow relational integration tools to be used; but using manual methods to do this requireslarge amounts of work for each integration candidate. Automatic data extraction would beuseful but it is very challenging: spreadsheet designs generally requires human knowledgeto understand the metadata being described. Even if it is possible to obtain this metadatainformation automatically; a single mistake can yield an output relation with a huge numberof incorrect tuples. We propose a two-phase semiautomatic system that extracts accuraterelational metadata while minimizing user effort. Based on conditional random fields (CRFs);our system enables downstream spreadsheet integration applications. First; the automatic …,Ann Arbor,2014,2
Efficient Relaxed XML Path Query Matching Based on Extended Dewey Labeling  Scheme,Zhe Chen,With the rapid increasing popularity of XML for data representation; there is a lot of interest inrelaxed query processing due to the flexible model characteristics of XML data. In this paper;we research the problem of XML path query relaxation. We define two relaxation operations;PC to AD edge relaxation and leaf-node-deletion. Two efficient algorithms are proposed tofind relaxed answers with the minimal cost of relaxation. Specifically; DynamicStack; basedon extended Dewey labeling scheme; calculates relaxed answers with stack data structureto compactly encode the potential maximal matches of path pattern. DynamicStack+recursively constructs relaxed query pattern with leaf-node-deletion using DynamicStack toget approximate answers. Finally; extensive experiments are performed and results showthat our proposed algorithms are effective to find approximate answers.,*,2009,*
