On indexing mobile objects,George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract We show how to index mobile objects in one and two dimensions using efficientdynamic external memory data structures. The problem is motivated by real life applicationsin traffic monitoring; intelligent navigation and mobile communications domains. For the l-dimensional case; we give (i) a dynamic; external memory algorithm with guaranteed worstcase performance and linear space and (ii) a practical approximation algorithm also in thedynamic; external memory setting; which has linear space and expected logarithmic querytime. We also give an algorithm with guaranteed logarithmic query time for a restrictedversion of the problem. We present extensions of our techniques to two dimensions. Inaddition we give a lower bound on the number of I/O's needed to answer the d-dimensionalproblem.

Efficient structural joins on indexed XML documents,Shu-Yao Chien; Zografoula Vagena; Donghui Zhang; Vassilis J Tsotras; Carlo Zaniolo,This chapter proposes efficient structural join algorithms in the presence of tag indices.Queries on XML documents typically combine selections on element contents; and; via pathexpressions; the structural relationships between tagged elements. Structural joins are usedto find all pairs of elements satisfying the primitive structural relationships specified in thequery; namely; parent–child and ancestor descendant relationships. Efficient support forstructural joins is thus the key to efficient implementations of XML queries. The recentlyproposed node numbering schemes enable the capturing of the XML document structureusing traditional indices. The problem of managing and querying XML documents efficientlypose interesting challenges for database researchers. XML documents can have a rathercomplex internal structure; in fact; an XML document can be viewed as an ordered tree …,*,2002,457
Comparison of access methods for time-evolving data,Betty Salzberg; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract This paper compares different indexing techniques proposed for supporting efficientaccess to temporal data. The comparison is based on a collection of important performancecriteria; including the space consumed; update processing; and query time forrepresentative queries. The comparison is based on worst-case analysis; hence noassumptions on data distribution or query frequencies are made. When a number ofmethods have the same asymptotic worst-case behavior; features in the methods that affectaverage case behavior are discussed. Additional criteria examined are the pagination of anindex; the ability to cluster related data together; and the ability to efficiently separate oldfrom current data (so that larger archival storage media such as write-once optical disks canbe used). The purpose of the paper is to identify the difficult problems in accessing …,ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR),1999,435
Broadcast scheduling for information distribution,Chi-Jiun Su; Leandros Tassiulas; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Broadcast data delivery is encountered in many applications where there is a needto disseminate information to a large user community in a wireless asymmetriccommunication environment. In this paper; we consider the problem of scheduling the databroadcast such that average response time experienced by the users is low. In a push-based system; where the users cannot place requests directly to the server and thebroadcast schedule should be determined based solely on the access probabilities; weformulate a deterministic dynamic optimization problem; the solution of which provides theoptimal broadcast schedule. Properties of the optimal solution are obtained and then wepropose a suboptimal dynamic policy which achieves average response time close to thelower bound. The policy has low complexity; it is adaptive to changing access statistics …,Wireless Networks,1999,333
Approximating multi-dimensional aggregate range queries over real attributes,Dimitrios Gunopulos; George Kollios; Vassilis J Tsotras; Carlotta Domeniconi,Abstract Finding approximate answers to multi-dimensional range queries over real valuedattributes has significant applications in data exploration and database query optimization.In this paper we consider the following problem: given a table of d attributes whose domainis the real numbers; and a query that specifies a range in each dimension; find a goodapproximation of the number of records in the table that satisfy the query. We present a newhistogram technique that is designed to approximate the density of multi-dimensionaldatasets with real attributes. Our technique finds buckets of variable size; and allows thebuckets to overlap. Overlapping buckets allow more efficient approximation of the density.The size of the cells is based on the local density of the data. This technique leads to a fasterand more compact approximation of the data distribution. We also show how to …,Acm Sigmod Record,2000,226
Efficient indexing of spatiotemporal objects,Marios Hadjieleftheriou; George Kollios; Vassilis J Tsotras; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Spatiotemporal objects ie; objects which change their position and/or extent overtime; appear in many applications. This paper addresses the problem of indexing largevolumes of such data. We consider general object movements and extent changes. Wefurther concentrate on “snapshot” as well as small “interval” historical queries on thegathered data. The obvious approach that approximates spatiotemporal objects with MBRsand uses a traditional multidimensional access method to index them is inefficient. Objectsthat “live” for long time intervals have large MBRs which introduce a lot of empty space.Clustering long intervals has been dealt in temporal databases by the use of partiallypersistent indices. What differentiates this problem from traditional temporal indexing is thatobjects are allowed to move/change during their lifetime. Better methods are thus needed …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2002,192
Designing access methods for bitemporal databases,Anil Kumar; Vassilis J Tsotras; Christos Faloutsos,By supporting the valid and transaction time dimensions; bitemporal databases representreality more accurately than conventional databases. The authors examine the issuesinvolved in designing efficient access methods for bitemporal databases; and propose thepartial-persistence and the double-tree methodologies. The partial-persistence methodologyreduces bitemporal queries to partial persistence problems for which an efficient accessmethod is then designed. The double-tree methodology" sees" each bitemporal data objectas consisting of two intervals (a valid-time and a transaction-time interval) and dividesobjects into two categories according to whether the right endpoint of the transaction timeinterval is already known. A common characteristic of both methodologies is that they takeinto account the properties of each time dimension. Their performance is compared with a …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1998,167
Efficient management of multiversion documents by object referencing,Shu-Yao Chien; Vassilis J Tsotras; Carlo Zaniolo,Abstract Traditional approaches to versioning documents are edit-based; and representsuccessive versions using edit scripts. This paper proposes a reference-based versioningscheme that preserves the rich logical structure of the evolving document via objectreferences. This approach produces better support for queries; and reconciles the storage-level and transport-level representations of multiversioned XML documents. In particular; wepresent efficient algorithms for supporting projection and selection queries; and for queryingthe document evolution history. Then; we show that our representation is also efficient at thetransport level; where XML documents are exchanged between remote parties. In fact; withthe reference-based scheme; an XML document's history can also be viewed and processedas yet another XML document. Finally; we demonstrate the effectiveness of the new …,VLDB,2001,157

On-line discovery of flock patterns in spatio-temporal data,Marcos R Vieira; Petko Bakalov; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract With the recent advancements and wide usage of location detection devices; largequantities of data are collected by GPS and cellular technologies in the form of trajectories.While most previous work on trajectory-based queries has concentrated on traditional range;nearest-neighbor and similarity queries; there is an increasing interest in queries thatcapture the" aggregate" behavior of trajectories as groups. Consider; for example; findinggroups of moving objects that move" together"; ie within a predefined distance to each other;for a certain continuous period of time. Such queries typically arise in surveillanceapplications; eg identify groups of suspicious people; convoys of vehicles; flocks of animals;etc. In this paper we first show that the on-line flock discovery problem is polynomial andthen propose a framework and several strategies to discover such patterns in streaming …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGSPATIAL international conference on advances in geographic information systems,2009,134
Nearest neighbor queries in a mobile environment,George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Nearest neighbor queries have received much interest in recent years due to theirincreased importance in advanced database applications. However; past work hasaddressed such queries in a static setting. In this paper we consider instead a dynamicsetting where data objects move continuously. Such a mobile spatiotemporal environment ismotivated by real life applications in traffic management; intelligent navigation and cellularcommunication systems. We consider two versions of nearest neighbor queries dependingon whether the temporal predicate is a single time instant or an interval. For example:“findthe closest object to a given object o after 10 minutes from now”; or;“find the object that willbe the closest to object o between 10 and 15 minutes from now”. Since data objects movecontinuously it is inefficient to update the database about their position at each time …,*,1999,132
Indexing animated objects using spatiotemporal access methods,George Kollios; Vassilis J.  Tsotras; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Alex Delis; Marios Hadjieleftheriou,We present an approach for indexing animated objects and efficiently answering queriesabout their position in time and space. In particular; we consider an animated movie as aspatiotemporal evolution. A movie is viewed as an ordered sequence of frames; where eachframe is a 2D space occupied by the objects that appear in that frame. The queries ofinterest are range queries of the form;" find the objects that appear in area S between framesf/sub i/and f/sub j//sup"/as well as nearest neighbor queries such as;" find the q nearestobjects to a given position A between frames f/sub i/and f/sub j//sup"/. The straightforwardapproach to index such objects considers the frame sequence as another dimension anduses a 3D access method (such as an R-Tree or its variants). This; however; assigns long"lifetime" intervals to objects that appear through many consecutive frames. Long intervals …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2001,127

Efficient schemes for managing multiversionXML documents,S-Y Chien; Vassilis J Tsotras; Carlo Zaniolo,Abstract Multiversion support for XML documents is needed in many critical applications;such as software configuration control; cooperative authoring; web information warehouses;and” e-permanence” of web documents. In this paper; we introduce efficient and robusttechniques for:(i) storing and retrieving;(ii) viewing and exchanging; and (iii) queryingmultiversion XML documents. We first discuss the limitations of traditional version controlmethods; such as RCS and SCCS; and then propose novel techniques that overcome theirlimitations. Initially; we focus on the problem of managing secondary storage efficiently; andintroduce an edit-based versioning scheme that enhances RCS with an effective clusteringpolicy based on the concept of page-usefulness. The new scheme drastically improvesversion retrieval at the expense of a small (linear) space overhead.

On query result diversification,Marcos R Vieira; Humberto L Razente; Maria CN Barioni; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Divesh Srivastava; Caetano Traina; Vassilis J Tsotras,In this paper we describe a general framework for evaluation and optimization of methodsfor diversifying query results. In these methods; an initial ranking candidate set produced bya query is used to construct a result set; where elements are ranked with respect torelevance and diversity features; ie; the retrieved elements should be as relevant aspossible to the query; and; at the same time; the result set should be as diverse as possible.While addressing relevance is relatively simple and has been heavily studied; diversity is aharder problem to solve. One major contribution of this paper is that; using the aboveframework; we adapt; implement and evaluate several existing methods for diversifyingquery results.

Complex spatio-temporal pattern queries,Marios Hadjieleftheriou; George Kollios; Petko Bakalov; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract This paper introduces a novel type of query; what we name Spatio-temporal PatternQueries (STP). Such a query specifies a spatiotemporal pattern as a sequence of distinctspatial predicates where the predicate temporal ordering (exact or relative) matters. STPqueries can use various types of spatial predicates (range search; nearest neighbor; etc.)where each such predicate is associated (1) with an exact temporal constraint (a time-instantor a time-interval); or (2) more generally; with a relative order among the other querypredicates. Using traditional spatiotemporal index structures for these types of queries wouldbe either inefficient or not an applicable solution. Alternatively; we propose specializedquery evaluation algorithms for STP queries With Time. We also present a novel indexstructure; suitable for STP queries With Order.

Efficient aggregation over objects with extent,Donghui Zhang; Vassilis J Tsotras; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract We examine the problem of efficiently computing sum/count/avg aggregates overobjects with non-zero extent. Recent work on computing multi-dimensional aggregates hasconcentrated on objects with zero extent (points) on a multi-dimensional grid; or one-dimensional intervals. However; in many spatial and/or spatio-temporal applications objectshave extent in various dimensions; while they can be located anywhere in the applicationspace. The aggregation predicate is typically described by a multi-dimensional box (box-sum aggregation). We examine two variations of the problem. In the simple case an object'svalue contributes to the aggregation result as a whole as long as the object intersects thequery box. More complex is the functional box-sum aggregation introduced in this paper;where objects participate in the aggregation proportionally to the size of their intersection …,Proceedings of the twenty-first ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2002,108

On-line discovery of dense areas in spatio-temporal databases,Marios Hadjieleftheriou; George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Moving object databases have received considerable attention recently. Previouswork has concentrated mainly on modeling and indexing problems; as well as queryselectivity estimation. Here we introduce a novel problem; that of addressing density-basedqueries in the spatio-temporal domain. For example:“Find all regions that will contain morethan 500 objects; ten minutes from now”. The user may also be interested in finding the timeperiod (interval) that the query answer remains valid. We formally define a new class ofdensity-based queries and give approximate; on-line techniques that answer themefficiently. Typically the threshold above which a region is considered to be dense is part ofthe query. The difficulty of the problem lies in the fact that the spatial and temporal predicatesare not specified by the query. The techniques we introduce find all candidate dense …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2003,106
The snapshot index: an I/O-optimal access method for timeslice queries,Vassilis J Tsotras; Nickolas Kangelaris,Abstract We present an access method for timeslice queries that reconstructs a past state s(t) of a time-evolving collection of objects; in O (sol log b n+¦ s (t)¦ b) I/O's; where¦ s (t)¦denotes the size of the collection at time t; n is the total number of changes in the collection'sevolution and b is the size of an I/O transfer. Changes include the addition; deletion orattribute modification of objects; they are assumed to occur in increasing time order andalways affect the most current state of the collection (thus our index supports transaction-time.) The space used is O (nb) while the update processing is constant per change; ie;independent of n. This is the first I/O-optimal access method for this problem using O (nb)space and O (1) updating (in the expected amortized sense due to the use of hashing.) Thisperformance is also achieved for interval intersection temporal queries. An advantage of …,Information Systems,1995,102
Efficient computation of temporal aggregates with range predicates,Donhui Zhang; Alexander Markowetz; Vassilis Tsotras; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Bernhard Seeger,Abstract A temporal aggregation query is an important but costly operation for applicationsthat maintain time-evolving data (data warehouses; temporal databases; etc.). Due to thelarge volume of such data; performance improvements for temporal aggregation queries arecritical. In this paper we examine techniques to compute temporal aggregates that includekey-range predicates (range temporal aggregates). In particular we concentrate on SUM;COUNT and AVG aggregates. This problem is novel; to handle arbitrary key ranges;previous methods would need to keep a separate index for every possible key range.

Selectivity estimators for multidimensional range queries over real attributes,Dimitrios Gunopulos; George Kollios; Vassilis Tsotras; Carlotta Domeniconi,Abstract. Estimating the selectivity of multidimensional range queries over real valuedattributes has significant applications in data exploration and database query optimization.In this paper; we consider the following problem: given a table of d attributes whose domainis the real numbers and a query that specifies a range in each dimension; find a goodapproximation of the number of records in the table that satisfy the query. The simplestapproach to tackle this problem is to assume that the attributes are independent. Moreaccurate estimators try to capture the joint data distribution of the attributes. In databases;such estimators include the construction of multidimensional histograms; random sampling;or the wavelet transform. In statistics; kernel estimation techniques are being used.

The threshold join algorithm for top-k queries in distributed sensor networks,Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Zografoula Vagena; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vana Kalogeraki; V Tsotras; Michail Vlachos; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract In this paper we present the Threshold Join Algorithm (TJA); which is an efficientTOP-k query processing algorithm for distributed sensor networks. The objective of a top-kquery is to find the k highest ranked answers to a user defined similarity function. Theevaluation of such a query in a sensor network environment is associated with the transfer ofdata over an extremely expensive communication medium. TJA uses a non-uniformthreshold on the queried attribute in order to minimize the number of tuples that have to betransferred towards the querying node. Additionally; TJA resolves queries in the networkrather than in a centralized fashion; which minimizes even more the consumption ofbandwidth and delay. Our preliminary experimental results; using our trace driven simulator;show that TJA is both practical and efficient.,Proceedings of the 2nd international workshop on Data management for sensor networks,2005,87

Indexing spatiotemporal archives,Marios Hadjieleftheriou; George Kollios; Vassilis J Tsotras; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Spatiotemporal objects–that is; objects that evolve over time–appear in manyapplications. Due to the nature of such applications; storing the evolution of objects throughtime in order to answer historical queries (queries that refer to past states of the evolution)requires a very large specialized database; what is termed in this article a spatiotemporalarchive. Efficient processing of historical queries on spatiotemporal archives requiresequally sophisticated indexing schemes. Typical spatiotemporal indexing techniquesrepresent the objects using minimum bounding regions (MBR) extended with a temporaldimension; which are then indexed using traditional multidimensional index structures.However; rough MBR approximations introduce excessive overlap between index nodes;which deteriorates query performance.

Version management of XML documents,Chien Shu-Yao; Vassilis J Tsotras; Carlo Zaniolo,Abstract The problem of ensuring efficient storage and fast retrieval for multi-versionstructured documents is important because of the recent popularity of XML documents andsemistructured information on the web. Traditional document version control systems; egRCS; which model documents as a sequence of lines of text and use the shortest edit scriptto represent version differences; can be inefficient and they do not preserve the logicalstructure of the original document. Therefore; we propose a new approach where thestructure of the documents is preserved intact; and their sub-objects are timestampedhierarchically for efficient reconstruction of current and past versions.

On the spatiotemporal burstiness of terms,Theodoros Lappas; Marcos R Vieira; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Thousands of documents are made available to the users via the web on a dailybasis. One of the most extensively studied problems in the context of such documentstreams is burst identification. Given a term t; a burst is generally exhibited when anunusually high frequency is observed for t. While spatial and temporal burstiness have beenstudied individually in the past; our work is the first to simultaneously track and measurespatiotemporal term burstiness. In addition; we use the mined burstiness information towardan efficient document-search engine: given a user's query of terms; our engine returns aranked list of documents discussing influential events with a strong spatiotemporal impact.We demonstrate the efficiency of our methods with an extensive experimental evaluation onreal and synthetic datasets.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,75
Efficient complex query support for multiversion XML documents,Shu-Yao Chien; Vassilis J Tsotras; Carlo Zaniolo; Donghui Zhang,Abstract Managing multiple versions of XML documents represents a critical requirement formany applications. Also; there has been much recent interest in supporting complex querieson XML data (eg; regular path expressions; structural projections; DIFF queries). In thispaper; we examine the problem of supporting efficiently complex queries on multiversionedXML documents. Our approach relies on a scheme based on durable node numbers (DNNs)that preserve the order among the XML tree nodes and are invariant with respect to updates.Using the document's DNNs various complex queries are reduced to combinations of partialversion retrieval queries. We examine three indexing schemes to efficiently evaluate partialversion retrieval queries in this environment.

Tree-pattern queries on a lightweight XML processor,Mirella M Moro; Zografoula Vagena; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Popular XML languages; like XPath; use" tree-pattern" queries to select nodesbased on their structural characteristics. While many processing methods have already beenproposed for such queries; none of them has found its way to any of the existing" lightweight"XML engines (ie engines without optimization modules). The main reason is the lack of asystematic comparison of query methods under a common storage model. In this work; weaim to fill this gap and answer two important questions: what the relative similarities andimportant differences among the tree-pattern query methods are; and if there is a prominentmethod among them in terms of effectiveness and robustness that an XML processor shouldsupport.

Efficient temporal join processing using indices,Donghui Zhang; Vassilis J Tsotras; Bernhard Seeger,We examine the problem of processing temporal joins in the presence of indexing schemes.Previous work on temporal joins has concentrated on non-indexed relations which were fullyscanned. Given the large data volumes created by the ever increasing time dimension;sequential scanning is prohibitive. This is especially true when the temporal join involvesonly parts of the joining relations (eg; a given time interval instead of the whole timeline).Utilizing an index becomes then beneficial as it directs the join to the data of interest. Weconsider temporal join algorithms for three representative indexing schemes; namely a B+-tree; an R*-tree and a temporal index; the Multiversion B+-tree (MVBT). Both the B+-tree andR*-tree result in simple but not efficient join algorithms because neither index achieves goodtemporal data clustering.

We introduce a new shortestpath query type in which dynamic constraints may be placed on the allowable set of edgesthat can appear on a valid shortest path (eg; dynamically restricting the type of roads ormodes of travel which may be considered in a multimodal transportation network). Weformalize this problem as a specific variant of formal language constrained shortest pathproblems; which we call the Kleene Language Constrained Shortest Paths problem.

Access methods for bi-temporal databases,Anil Kumar; Vassilis J Tsotras; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract While much work has recently appeared in literature on access methods fortransaction-time databases; not much has been done for indexing bitemporal databases; ie;databases that incorporate both transaction and valid time dimensions. In this paper we firstdiscuss the issues involved in addressing general bitemporal queries and then propose twogeneral approaches in solving such queries. For simplicity we present our findings inrelation to the so-called bitemporal pure-timeslice query. However our methodology appliesto more complex bitemporal queries. The first approach reduces bitemporal queries topartial persistence problems for which an efficient method is then designed. Using thisapproach we introduce a new access method for the bitemporal pure-timeslice query; theBitemporal Interval Tree. The second approach “sees” bitemporal data objects as …,*,1995,57
Efficient trajectory joins using symbolic representations,Petko Bakalov; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Eamonn Keogh; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Efficiently and accurately discovering similarities among moving object trajectoriesis a difficult problem that appears in many spatiotemporal applications. In this paper weconsider how to efficiently evaluate trajectory joins; ie; how to identify all pairs of similartrajectories between two datasets. Our approach represents an object trajectory as asequence of symbols (ie; a string). Based on special lower-bounding distances between twostrings; we propose a pruning heuristic for reducing the number of trajectory pairs that needto be examined. Furthermore; we present an indexing scheme designed to support efficientevaluation of string similarities in secondary storage. Through a comprehensiveexperimental evaluation we present the advantages of the proposed techniques.,Proceedings of the 6th international conference on Mobile data management,2005,53
An extensible notation for spatiotemporal index queries,Vassilis J Tsotras; Christian S Jensen; Richard Thomas Snodgrass,Abstract Temporal; spatial and spatiotemporal queries are inherently multidimensional;combining predicates on explicit attributes with predicates on time dimension (s) and spatialdimension (s). Much confusion has prevailed in the literature on access methods becauseno consistent notation exists for referring to such queries. As a contribution towardseliminating this problem; we propose a new and simple notation for spatiotemporal queries.The notation aims to address the selection-based spatiotemporal queries commonly studiedin the literature of access methods. The notation is extensible and can be applied to moregeneral multidimensional; selection-based queries.,ACM Sigmod Record,1998,51
Boosting XML filtering with a scalable FPGA-based architecture,Abhishek Mitra; Marcos Vieira; Petko Bakalov; Walid Najjar; Vassilis Tsotras,Abstract: The growing amount of XML encoded data exchanged over the Internet increasesthe importance of XML based publish-subscribe (pub-sub) and content based routingsystems. The input in such systems typically consists of a stream of XML documents and aset of user subscriptions expressed as XML queries. The pub-sub system then filters thepublished documents and passes them to the subscribers. Pub-sub systems arecharacterized by very high input ratios; therefore the processing time is critical. In this paperwe propose a" pure hardware" based solution; which utilizes XPath query blocks on FPGA tosolve the filtering problem. By utilizing the high throughput that an FPGA provides for parallelprocessing; our approach achieves drastically better throughput than the existing software ormixed (hardware/software) architectures. The XPath queries (subscriptions) are …,arXiv preprint arXiv:0909.1781,2009,50
Indexing mobile objects using dual transformations,George Kollios; Dimitris Papadopoulos; Dimitrios Gunopulos; J Tsotras,Abstract With the recent advances in wireless networks; embedded systems; and GPStechnology; databases that manage the location of moving objects have received increasedinterest. In this paper; we present indexing techniques for moving object databases. Inparticular; we propose methods to index moving objects in order to efficiently answer rangequeries about their current and future positions. This problem appears in real-lifeapplications such as predicting future congestion areas in a highway system or allocatingmore bandwidth for areas where a high concentration of mobile phones is imminent. Weaddress the problem in external memory and present dynamic solutions; both for the one-dimensional and the two-dimensional cases.

Twig query processing over graph-structured xml data,Zografoula Vagena; Mirella M Moro; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract XML and semi-structured data is usually modeled using graph structures. Structuralsummaries; which have been proposed to speedup XML query processing have graphforms as well. The existent approaches for evaluating queries over tree structured data (iedata whose underlying structure is a tree) are not directly applicable when the data ismodeled as a random graph. Moreover; they cannot be applied when structural summariesare employed and; to the best of our knowledge; no analogous techniques have beenreported for this case either. As a result; the potential of structural summaries is not fullyexploited. In this paper; we investigate query evaluation techniques applicable to graph-structured data. We propose efficient algorithms for the case of directed acyclic graphs;which appear in many real world situations. We then tailor our approaches to handle …,Proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on the Web and Databases: colocated with ACM SIGMOD/PODS 2004,2004,48
Indexing mobile objects on the plane,Dimitris Papadopoulos; George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vassilis J Tsotras,We present a method to index objects moving on the plane in order to efficiently answerrange queries about their position in the future. This problem is motivated by real-lifeapplications; like predicting future congestion areas in a highway system; or allocating morebandwidth for areas where high concentration of mobile phones is imminent. We considerthe problem in the external memory model of computation and present a dynamic technique.An experimental evaluation is included that shows the applicability of our method.,Database and Expert Systems Applications; 2002.

Performance evaluation of spatio-temporal selectivity estimation techniques,Marios Hadjieleftheriou; George Kollios; VT Tsotras,Many novel spatio-temporal applications deal with moving objects. In such environments; adatabase typically maintains the initial position and the moving function for each object.Instead of updating the database whenever an object position changes (which is notmanageable); updates are issued whenever the moving function deviates beyond a giventhreshold. For simplicity; we assume that objects move with linear trajectories. Maintainingthe moving functions in a database introduces novel problems. For example; the databasecan answer queries about object positions in the future:" find all objects that will be in area A;10 minutes from now". In this paper we present a thorough performance evaluation oftechniques for estimating the selectivity of such queries. We consider various existingestimators that can be stored in main memory and are updated dynamically.

Early profile pruning on XML-aware publish-subscribe systems,Mirella M Moro; Petko Bakalov; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Publish-subscribe applications are an important class of content-baseddissemination systems where the message transmission is defined by the message content;rather than its destination IP address. With the increasing use of XML as the standard formaton many Internet-based applications; XML aware pub-sub applications become necessary.In such systems; the messages (generated by publishers) are encoded as XML documents;and the profiles (defined by subscribers) as XML query statements. As the number ofdocuments and query requests grow; the performance and scalability of the matching phase(ie matching of queries to incoming documents) become vital. Current solutions have limitedor no flexibility to prune out queries in advance. In this paper; we overcome such limitationby proposing a novel early pruning approach called Bounding-based XML Filtering or …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,43
Querying trajectories using flexible patterns,Marcos R Vieira; Petko Bakalov; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract The wide adaptation of GPS and cellular technologies has created manyapplications that collect and maintain large repositories of data in the form of trajectories.Previous work on querying/analyzing trajectorial data typically falls into methods that eitheraddress spatial range and NN queries; or; similarity based queries. Nevertheless;trajectories are complex objects whose behavior over time and space can be better capturedas a sequence of interesting events. We thus facilitate the use of motion" pattern" querieswhich allow the user to select trajectories based on specific motion patterns. Such patternsare described as regular expressions over a spatial alphabet that can be implicitly orexplicitly anchored to the time domain. Moreover; we are interested in" flexible" patterns thatallow the user to include" variables" in the query pattern and thus greatly increase its …,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2010,41
Copy-based versus edit-based version management schemes for structured documents,Shu-Yao Chien; Vassilis J Tsotras; Carlo Zaniolo,Managing multiple versions of XML documents and semistructured data represents aproblem of growing interest. Traditional version control methods; such as RCS; use editscripts representing changes in the document to support the incremental reconstruction ofdifferent versions. The edit-based approaches have been enhanced with a replicationscheme called UBCC (Chien et al.; 2000). UBCC is based on the notion of page usefulnessand ensures effective management for multi-version documents in terms of both retrievaland storage cost. These improvements notwithstanding; the edit-based representationsuffers from limited generality and flexibility-eg; it cannot represent changes such asrearranging the document or duplicating parts of its content. To solve these problems; thepaper proposes a copy-based UBCC versioning scheme; which also provides a simpler …,Research Issues in Data Engineering; 2001. Proceedings.

Time relaxed spatiotemporal trajectory joins,Petko Bakalov; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Many spatiotemporal applications store moving object data in the form oftrajectories. Various recent works have addressed interesting queries on trajectorial data;mainly focusing on range queries and Nearest Neighbor queries. Here we examine anotherinteresting query; the Time Relaxed Spatiotemporal Trajectory Join (TRSTJ) whicheffectively finds groups of moving objects that have followed similar movements in differenttimes. We first attempt to address the TRSTJ problem using a symbolic representationalgorithm; which we have recently proposed for trajectory joins. However we showexperimentally that this solution produces false positives that grow rapidly with the increaseof the problem size. As a result; it is inefficient for TRSTJ queries as it leads to large querytime overhead. In order to improve query performance; we propose two important …,Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international workshop on Geographic information systems,2005,37
A comparative study of version management schemes for XML documents,Shu-Yao Chien; Vassilis J Tsotras; Carlo Zaniolo,Abstract The problem of managing multiple versions for XML documents and semistructureddata is of significant interest in many DB applications and web-related services. Traditionaldocument version control schemes; such as RCS; suffer from the following two problems. Atthe logical level; they conceal the structure of the documents by modeling them assequences of text lines; and storing a document's evolution as a line-edit script. At thephysical level; they can incur in severe storage or processing costs because of their inabilityto trade-off storage with computation. To solve these problems; we propose versionmanagement strategies that preserve the structure of the original document; and apply andextend DB techniques to minimize storage and processing costs. Therefore; we propose andcompare three schemes for XML version management; namely; the Usefulness-Based …,Time Center Technical Report TR. 51,2000,36
Efficient management of time-evolving databases,Vassilis J Tsotras; B Gopinath; George W Hart,Efficiently managing the history of a time-evolving system is one of the central problems inmany database environments; like database systems that incorporate versioning; or object-oriented databases that implicitly or explicitly maintain the history of persistent objects. In thispaper we propose algorithms that reconstruct past states of an evolving system for twogeneral cases; ie; when the system's state is represented by a set or by a hierarchy (a forestof trees). Sets are widely used as a canonical form of representing information in databasesor program states. For more complex applications; like schema evolution in object-orienteddatabases; it becomes necessary to manage the history of data structures that have the formof forests or even graphs. The proposed algorithms use minimal space (proportional to thenumber of changes occurring in the evolution) and have the advantage of being on-line …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1995,36
Optimal versioning of objects,Vassilis J Tsotras; B Gopinath,The purpose of versioning is to reconstruct any past state of an object class. The authorsshow that access to any past version is possible in almost constant time; while the spaceused is only linear to the number of changes occurring in the class evolution. As a result;versioning with fast reconstruction can be supported in an object-oriented environmentwithout using excessive space requirements. It is also proved that the solution is optimalamong all approaches that use the same space limitations. A crucial characteristic of theresults is that they can be easily implemented on a storage facility that uses a magnetic diskand an optical disk.,Data Engineering; 1992. Proceedings.

Finding regions of interest from trajectory data,Md Reaz Uddin; Chinya Ravishankar; Vassilis J Tsotras,We show how to find regions of interest (ROIs) in trajectory databases. ROIs are regionswhere a large number of moving objects remain for at least a given time interval. Previoustechniques use somewhat restrictive definitions for ROIs; and are parameter-dependent.They require sequential scanning of the entire dataset to find ROIs when the ROI parameterschange. Our approach is parameter independent; so that the user can quickly identify ROIsunder different parametric definitions without rescanning the whole database. We alsogeneralize ROIs to be regions of arbitrary shape of some predefined density. We have testedour methods with large real and synthetic datasets to test the scalability and verify the outputof our methods. Our methods give meaningful output and scale very well.,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2011 12th IEEE International Conference on,2011,29
Roxsum: Leveraging data aggregation and batch processing for xml routing,Zografoula Vagena; Mirella M Moro; Vassilis J Tsotras,Content-based routing is the primary form of communication within publish/subscribesystems. In those systems data transmission is performed by sophisticated overlay networksof content-based routers; which match data messages against registered subscriptions andforward them based on this matching. Despite their inherent complexities; such systems areexpected to deliver information in a timely and scalable fashion. As a result; their successfuldeployment is a strenuous task. Relevant efforts have so far focused on the construction ofthe overlay network and the filtering of messages at each broker. However; the efficienttransmission of messages has received less attention. In this work; we propose a solutionthat gracefully handles the transmission task; while providing performance benefits for thematching task as well. Along those lines; we design RoXSum; a message representation …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007. IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,28
Improving min/max aggregation over spatial objects,Donghui Zhang; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract We examine the problem of computing MIN/MAX aggregates over a collection ofspatial objects. Each spatial object is associated with a weight (value); for example; theaverage temperature or rainfall over the area covered by the object. Given a queryrectangle; the MIN/MAX problem computes the minimum/maximum weight among all objectsintersecting the query rectangle. Traditionally such queries have been performed as rangesearch queries. Assuming that the objects are indexed by a spatial access method; theMIN/MAX is computed as objects are retrieved. This requires effort proportional to thenumber of objects intersecting the query interval; which may be large. A better approach is tomaintain aggregate information among the index nodes of the spatial access method; thenvarious index paths can be eliminated during the range search.

Accelerating XML query matching through custom stack generation on FPGAs,Roger Moussalli; Mariam Salloum; Walid Najjar; Vassilis Tsotras,Abstract Publish-subscribe systems present the state of the art in information disseminationto multiple users. Such systems have evolved from simple topic-based to the current XML-enabled systems. Here; users pose complex queries (expressed in XPath) on the structureand content of the streaming documents. The parts of the documents that match the userqueries are then returned to the users. This paper proposes a novel hardware architecturethat would exploit the parallelism found in XPath filtering systems. Using an incoming XMLstream; parsing and matching with thousands of user profiles are performed simultaneouslyon a single FPGA; thus yielding up to three orders of magnitude higher throughput whencompared to conventional approaches bound by the sequential aspect of softwarecomputing. By converting XPath expressions into custom stacks; our architecture is the …,International Conference on High-Performance Embedded Architectures and Compilers,2010,27
On computing temporal aggregates with range predicates,Donghui Zhang; Alexander Markowetz; Vassilis J Tsotras; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Bernhard Seeger,Abstract Computing temporal aggregates is an important but costly operation forapplications that maintain time-evolving data (data warehouses; temporal databases; etc.)Due to the large volume of such data; performance improvements for temporal aggregatequeries are critical. Previous approaches have aggregate predicates that involve only thetime dimension. In this article we examine techniques to compute temporal aggregates thatinclude key-range predicates as well (range-temporal aggregates). In particular weconcentrate on the SUM aggregate; while COUNT is a special case. To handle arbitrary keyranges; previous methods would need to keep a separate index for every possible keyrange. We propose an approach based on a new index structure called the Multiversion SB-Tree; which incorporates features from both the SB-Tree and the Multiversion B+--tree; to …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2008,27
Massively parallel XML twig filtering using dynamic programming on FPGAs,Roger Moussalli; Mariam Salloum; Walid Najjar; Vassilis J Tsotras,In recent years; XML-based Publish-Subscribe Systems have become popular due to theincreased demand of timely event-notification. Users (or subscribers) pose complex profileson the structure and content of the published messages. If a profile matches the message;the message is forwarded to the interested subscriber. As the amount of published contentcontinues to grow; current software-based systems will not scale. We thus propose a novelarchitecture to exploit parallelism of twig matching on FPGAs. This approach yields up tothree orders of magnitude higher throughput when compared to conventional approachesbound by the sequential aspect of software computing. This paper; presents a novel methodfor performing unordered holistic twig matching on FPGAs without any false positives; andwhose throughput is independent of the complexity of the user queries or the …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,25
Supporting complex queries on multiversion XML documents,Shu-Yao Chien; Vassilis J Tsotras; Carlo Zaniolo; Donghui Zhang,Abstract Managing multiple versions of XML documents represents a critical requirement formany applications. Recently; there has been much work on supporting complex queries onXML data (eg; regular path expressions; structural projections; etc.). In this article; weexamine the problem of implementing efficiently such complex queries on multiversion XMLdocuments. Our approach relies on a numbering scheme; whereby durable node numbers(DNNs) are used to preserve the order among the nodes of the XML tree while remaininginvariant with respect to updates. Using the document's DNNs; we show that many complexqueries are reduced to combinations of range version retrieval queries. We thus examinethree alternative storage organizations/indexing schemes to efficiently evaluate rangeversion retrieval queries in this environment.

Efficient XML Path Filtering Using GPUs.,Roger Moussalli; Robert J Halstead; Mariam Salloum; Walid A Najjar; Vassilis J Tsotras,ABSTRACT Publish-subscribe (pub-sub) systems present the state of the art in informationdissemination to multiple users. Current XML-based pub-sub systems provide users withconsiderable flexibility allowing the formulation of complex queries on the content as well asthe structure of the streaming messages. Messages that contain one or more matches for agiven user profile (query) are forwarded to the user. Recently various approaches focusedon accelerating XML path query filtering using dedicated hardware architectures; likeFPGAs.

Efficient temporal shortest path queries on evolving social graphs,Wenyu Huo; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Graph-like data appears in many applications; such as social networks; internethyperlinks; roadmaps; etc. and in most cases; graphs are dynamic; evolving through time. Inthis work; we study the problem of efficient shortest-path query evaluation on evolving socialgraphs. Our shortest-path queries are" temporal": they can refer to any time-point or time-interval in the graph's evolution; and corresponding valid answers should be returned. Toefficiently support this type of temporal query; we extend the traditional Dijkstra's algorithm tocompute shortest-path distance (s) for a time-point or a time-interval. To speed up queryprocessing; we explore preprocessing index techniques such as Contraction Hierarchies(CH). Moreover; we examine how to maintain the evolving graph along with the index byutilizing temporal partition strategies.

Route planning with flexible edge restrictions,Robert Geisberger; Michael N Rice; Peter Sanders; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract In this work; we explore a new type of flexible shortest-path query; in which thequery can be dynamically parameterized to constrain the type of edges that may be includedin the resulting shortest path (eg; find the shortest path in a road network that avoids tollroads and low overpasses; respective of the specified vehicle height). We extend thehierarchical preprocessing technique known as Contraction Hierarchies to efficiently supportsuch flexible queries. We also present several effective algorithmic optimizations for furtherimproving the overall scalability and query times of this approach; including the addition ofgoal-directed search techniques; search space pruning techniques; and generalizing theconstraints of the local search. Experiments are presented for both the North American andthe European road networks; showcasing the general effectiveness and scalability of our …,Journal of Experimental Algorithmics (JEA),2012,22
Querying spatio-temporal patterns in mobile phone-call databases,Marcos R Vieira; Enrique Frías-Martínez; Petko Bakalov; Vanessa Frías-Martínez; Vassilis J Tsotras,Call Detail Record (CDR) databases contain many millions of records with information aboutmobile phone calls; including the users' location when the call was made/received. Thishuge amount of spatio-temporal data opens the door for the study of human trajectories on alarge scale without the bias that other sources; like GPS or WLAN networks; introduce in thepopulation studied. Furthermore; it provides a platform for the development of a wide varietyof studies ranging from the spread of diseases to planning of public transportation.Nevertheless; previous work on spatio-temporal queries does not provide a framework"flexible" enough for expressing the complexity of human trajectories. In this paper wepresent Spatio-Temporal Pattern System (STPS) to query spatio-temporal patterns in verylarge CDR databases.

Hashing methods for temporal data,George Kollios; Vassilis J Tsotras,External dynamic hashing has been used in traditional database systems as a fast methodfor answering membership queries. Given a dynamic set S of objects; a membership queryasks whether an object with identity k is in (the most current state of) S. This paperaddresses the more general problem of temporal hashing. In this setting; changes to thedynamic set are time-stamped and the membership query has a temporal predicate; as in:"Find whether object with identity k was in set S at time t". We present an efficient solution forthis problem that takes an ephemeral hashing scheme and makes it partially persistent. Oursolution; also termed partially persistent hashing; uses a space that is linear on the totalnumber of changes in the evolution of set S and has a small {O [log/sub B/(n/B)]} queryoverhead.

Historical queries along multiple lines of time evolution,Gad M Landau; Jeanette P Schmidt; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Traditional approaches to addressing historical queries assume a single line of timeevolution; that is; a system (database; relation) evolves over time through a sequence oftransactions. Each transaction always applies to the unique; current state of the system;resulting in a new current state. There are; however; complex applications where thesystem's state evolves into multiple lines of evolution. In general; this creates a tree(hierarchy) of evolution lines; where each tree node represents the time evolution of aparticular subsystem. Multiple lines create novel historical queries; such as vertical orhorizontal historical queries. The key characteristic of these problems is that portions of thehistory are shared; answering historical queries should not necessitate duplication of sharedhistories as this could increase the storage requirements dramatically.

Efficient algorithms for managing the history of evolving databases,Vassilis J Tsotras; B Gopinath,Abstract We propose a novel method for representing evolving databases by “evolving sets”;which is particularly useful when we are interested in reconstructing any past state of adatabase. This theoretical framework therefore reduces the problem concerning the historymanagement of databases to the problem of efficiently managing the history of a setevolving in time. We present a dynamic algorithm that reconstructs the state of the set at agiven time t in the past in O (| s (t)|+ loglogT) time; where| s (t)| is the size of the answer and Tis the maximal size of the time interval (t≤ T). The space used is linear to the number ofchanges that occurred during the set's evolution. The resulting algorithm is thereby moreefficient than all previous methods dealing with the history management of evolvingdatabases. In fact the proposed algorithm is optimal within a constant factor; because a …,International Conference on Database Theory,1990,18
R-trees: A dynamic index structure for spatial searching,Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Yannis Manolopoulos; Yannis Theodoridis; Vassilis J Tsotras,The R*-tree; an improvement of the R-tree; is one of the most popular access methods forpoints and rectangles. This is achieved by modifying the insert and split algorithms of theoriginal R-tree which is based on the heuristic optimization of the area of the enclosingrectangle in each inner node. The R*-tree incorporates a combined optimization of area;margin and overlap of each enclosing rectangle in the directory. From a practical point ofview; the R*-tree is very attractive because of the following two reasons. It efficiently supportspoint and spatial data at the same time and its implementation cost is only slightly higherthan that of other R-tree variants.,*,2017,17
FPGA-based Multithreading for In-Memory Hash Joins.,Robert J Halstead; Ildar Absalyamov; Walid A Najjar; Vassilis J Tsotras,ABSTRACT Large relational databases often rely on fast join implementations for goodperformance. Recent paradigm shifts in processor architectures has reinvigorated researchinto how the join operation can be implemented. The FPGA community has also beendeveloping new architectures with the potential to push performance even further. Hashingis a common method used to implement joins; but its poor spatial locality can hinderperformance on processor architectures. Multithreaded architectures can better cope withpoor spatial locality by masking memory/cache latencies with many outstanding requests. Inthis paper we present the first end-to-end in-memory FPGA hash join implementation. TheFGPA uses massive multithreading during the build and probe phases to mask long memorydelays; while it concurrently manages hundreds of thread states locally. Throughput …,CIDR,2015,17
Parameterized algorithms for generalized traveling salesman problems in road networks,Michael N Rice; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract The Generalized Traveling Salesman (Path) Problem involves finding a minimum-cost tour (or path) through exactly one location from each of a set of generalized locationcategories (eg; gas stations; coffee shops). This problem type has many practicalapplications in personal navigation and logistics. While NP-hard in general; this problemalso admits fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms with run times of the form f (k) n O (1)for some function f (independent of the problem size; n) with respect to the number oflocation categories; k (typically very small in practice). We present both exact andapproximate FPT algorithms for this problem.

Supporting branched versions on XML documents,Zografoula Vagena; Mirella Moura Moro; Vassilis J Tsotras,Many e-commerce and e-government applications are collaborative in nature (egnegotiation and e-catalog management). In collaborative environments; users typicallydefine new document versions from any past version; which creates the need for supportingmultiversion XML documents; particularly branched versioning. In this paper; we address theproblem of evaluating path expression queries over XML documents with branchedversions. We extend path joins to work in a branched version environment and to allowqueries on multiple versions. We propose a storage scheme that efficiently maintains allbranched document versions and describe changes required on Pathstack; an optimalpattern matching algorithm. Finally; we investigate the effectiveness of our techniquesthrough experimental evaluation.,Research Issues on Data Engineering: Web Services for e-Commerce and e-Government Applications; 2004.

Flextrack: A system for querying flexible patterns in trajectory databases,Marcos R Vieira; Petko Bakalov; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract We describe the FlexTrack system for querying trajectories using flexible patternqueries. Such queries are composed of a sequence of simple spatio-temporal predicates;eg; range and nearest-neighbors; as well as complex motion pattern predicates; eg;predicates that contain variables and constraints. Users can interactively select spatio-temporal predicates to construct such pattern queries using a hierarchy of regions thatpartition the spatial domain. Several different query processing algorithms are currentlyimplemented and available in the FlexTrack system.,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2011,14
Engineering generalized shortest path queries,Michael N Rice; Vassilis J Tsotras,Generalized Shortest Path (GSP) queries represent a variant of constrained shortest pathqueries in which a solution path of minimum total cost must visit at least one location fromeach of a set of specified location categories (eg; gas stations; grocery stores) in a specifiedorder. This problem type has many practical applications in logistics and personalizedlocation-based services; and is closely related to the NP-hard Generalized TravelingSalesman Path Problem (GTSPP). In this work; we present a new dynamic programmingformulation to highlight the structure of this problem. Using this formulation as ourfoundation; we progressively engineer a fast and scalable GSP query algorithm for use onlarge; real-world road networks.

Optimizing spatial min/max aggregations,Donghui Zhang; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract. Aggregate computation over a collection of spatial objects appears in many real-life applications. Aggregates are computed on values (weights) associated with spatialobjects; for example; the temperature or rainfall over the area covered by the object. In thispaper we concentrate on MIN/MAX aggregations:“given a query rectangle; find theminimum/maximum weight among all objects intersecting the query rectangle.” Traditionallysuch queries have been performed as range searches. Assuming that objects are indexedby a spatial access method (SAM); the MIN/MAX is computed while retrieving those objectsintersecting the query interval. This requires effort proportional to the number of objectssatisfying the query; which may be large. A better approach is to maintain aggregateinformation among the index nodes of the spatial access method; then various index …,The VLDB Journal,2005,13
Efficient processing of XML containment queries using partition-based schemes,Zografoula Vagena; Mirella Moura Moro; Vassilis J Tsotras,XML query languages provide facilities to query XML data both on their value as well astheir structure. A basic operation in processing and optimizing such queries is thecontainment join; which takes two sets of elements and returns pairs of elements where oneis the ancestor (or descendant) of the other. Most of the techniques proposed so far assumethat the two sets are already sorted or utilize preexisting indexing schemes. In contrast; apartition-based technique does not require indexing or sorting. Instead; the containment joinis processed by dividing the input sets into smaller partitions. In this paper; we present a newpartition-based scheme that gracefully adapts to different document sizes. The advantagesof our approach are validated through an experimental comparison with previous work.Moreover; the experiments demonstrate that our solution provides a viable alternative to …,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2004.

Path-expression Queries over Multiversion XML Documents.,Zografoula Vagena; Vassilis J Tsotras,ABSTRACT In this paper we address the problem of evaluating path expression queries onmultiversion XML documents. Such queries are typically implemented on static (ie; non-versioned) documents as path joins; using numbering schemes that maintain the structuralrelationships among the document elements. We extend previously proposed patternmatching techniques so as to support versions. We first present an easily updatablenumbering scheme that efficiently captures structural relationships among the elements ofthe dynamically evolving document. We then propose a variation of Pathstack; an optimalpattern matching algorithm; that addresses the characteristics of our environment. Finally;through a thorough experimental evaluation we investigate two storage techniques in termsof space utilization and query efficiency.,WebDB,2003,13
Finding the K highest-ranked answers in a distributed network,Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Zografoula Vagena; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vassilis J Tsotras; Michail Vlachos; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract In this paper; we present an algorithm for finding the k highest-ranked (or Top-k)answers in a distributed network. A Top-K query returns the subset of most relevant answers;in place of all answers; for two reasons:(i) to minimize the cost metric that is associated withthe retrieval of all answers; and (ii) to improve the recall and the precision of the answer-set;such that the user is not overwhelmed with irrelevant results. Our study focuses on multi-hopdistributed networks in which the data is accessible by traversing a network of nodes. Such asetting captures very well the computation framework of emerging Sensor Networks; Peer-to-Peer Networks and Vehicular Networks. We present the Threshold Join Algorithm (TJA); anefficient algorithm that utilizes a non-uniform threshold on the queried attribute in order tominimize the transfer of data when a query is executed. Additionally; TJA resolves queries …,Computer Networks,2009,12

Diversifying query results on semi-structured data,Mahbub Hasan; Abdullah Mueen; Vassilis Tsotras; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract Queries on the web can easily result in a large number of results. ResultDiversification; a process by which the query provides the k most diverse set of matches;enables the user to better understand/explore such large results. Computing the diversesubset from a large set of results needs a massive number of pair-wise distancecomputations as well as finding the subset that maximizes the total pair-wise distance; whichis NP-hard and requires efficient approximate algorithm. The problem becomes more difficultwhen querying semi-structured data; since diversity can occur not only in the documentcontent but also (and more importantly) in the document structure; thus one needs toefficiently measure the structural differences between results. The tree edit distance is thestandard choice but; is too expensive for large result sets. Moreover; the generalized tree …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,11
Efficient and Scalable Sequence-Based XML Filtering.,Mariam Salloum; Vassilis J Tsotras,ABSTRACT The ubiquitous adoption of XML as the standard of data exchange over the webhas led to increased interest in building efficient and scalable XML publish-subscribe (pub-sub) systems. The central function of an XML-based pub-sub system is to perform XMLfiltering efficiently; ie identify those XPath expressions that have a match in a streaming XMLdocument. In this paper; we propose a new sequence-based approach; which transformsboth XML documents and XPath twig expressions into Node Encoded Tree Sequences(NETS). In terms of this encoding; we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for anXPath twig to represent a match in a given XML document. The proposed filtering procedureis based on a new subsequence matching algorithm devised for NETS; which identifies theset of matched queries free of false positives with a single scan of the XML document …,WebDB,2009,11

High performance FPGA and GPU complex pattern matching over spatio-temporal streams,Roger Moussalli; Ildar Absalyamov; Marcos R Vieira; Walid Najjar; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract The wide and increasing availability of collected data in the form of trajectories hasled to research advances in behavioral aspects of the monitored subjects (eg; wild animals;people; and vehicles). Using trajectory data harvested by devices; such as GPS; RFID andmobile devices; complex pattern queries can be posed to select trajectories based onspecific events of interest. In this paper; we present a study on FPGA-and GPU-basedarchitectures processing complex patterns on streams of spatio-temporal data. Complexpatterns are described as regular expressions over a spatial alphabet that can be implicitlyor explicitly anchored to the time domain. More importantly; variables can be used tosubstantially enhance the flexibility and expressive power of pattern queries.

Online ordering of overlapping data sources,Mariam Salloum; Xin Luna Dong; Divesh Srivastava; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Data integration systems offer a uniform interface for querying a large number ofautonomous and heterogeneous data sources. Ideally; answers are returned as sources arequeried and the answer list is updated as more answers arrive. Choosing a good ordering inwhich the sources are queried is critical for increasing the rate at which answers arereturned. However; this problem is challenging since we often do not have complete orprecise statistics of the sources; such as their coverage and overlap. It is further exacerbatedin the Big Data era; which is witnessing two trends in Deep-Web data: first; obtaining a fullcoverage of data in a particular domain often requires extracting data from thousands ofsources; second; there is often a big variation in overlap between different data sources.

Bidirectional A* Search with Additive Approximation Bounds.,Michael N Rice; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract In this paper; we present new theoretical and experimental results for bidirectionalA∗ search.

Ourtheoretical work examines new results on the worst-case number of node expansions forinconsistent heuristic functions with bounded estimation errors. Additionally; we considerseveral alternative termination criteria in order to more quickly terminate the bidirectionalsearch; and we provide worst-case approximation bounds for our suggested criteria.

Efficient handling of positional predicates within XML query processing,Zografoula Vagena; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract The inherent order within the XML document-centric data model is typicallyexposed through positional predicates defined over the XPath navigation axes. Althoughprocessing algorithms for each axis have already been proposed; the incorporation ofpositional predicates in them has received very little attention. In this paper; we presenttechniques that leverage the power of existing; state of the art methods; to efficiently supportpositional predicates as well.

Spatio-temporal data services in a shared-nothing environment,Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Vassil Kriakov; Yangui Tao; George Kollios; Alex Delis; Vassilis J Tsotras,Recently; there has been a proliferation of applications that produce spatiotemporal datathat has to be processed; stored and queried efficiently. These applications necessitate theexecution of millions of updates in order to keep the underlying database up-to-date.Consequently; there is a need for spatiotemporal data management systems that are able tosupport such update intensive operations. Moreover; these systems should offer users thecapability to examine present as well as past (historical) data versions in an on-line fashion.We propose a system that exploits the inherent parallelism of a shared-nothing computingenvironment for storing and indexing the spatiotemporal data.

User effort minimization through adaptive diversification,Mahbub Hasan; Abhijith Kashyap; Vagelis Hristidis; Vassilis Tsotras,Abstract Ambiguous queries; which are typical on search engines and recommendationsystems; often return a large number of results from multiple interpretations. Given that manyusers often perform their searches on limited size screens (eg mobile phones); an importantproblem is which results to display first. Recent work has suggested displaying a set ofresults (Top-k) based on their relevance score with respect to the query and their diversitywith respect to each other. However; previous works balance relevance and diversity mostlyby a predefined fixed way. In this paper; we show that for different search tasks there is adifferent ideal balance of relevance and diversity. We propose a principled method foradaptive diversification of query results that minimizes the user effort to find the desiredresults; by dynamically balancing the relevance and diversity at each query step (eg …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2014,9
Access Methods for Intervals,Yannis Manolopoulos; Yannis Theodoridis; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Intervals provide a compact way to represent the duration of a property. Theyappear in many database applications; including spatial; temporal [Jensen and Snodgrass;1999]; constraint [Bertino et al.; 1997; Ramaswamy; 1997] and object-oriented databases[Kanellakis et al.; 1993]. Due to their importance; many techniques have been proposed inliterature for indexing intervals. Here we concentrate on the 1-dimensional dynamic intervalmanagement problem and in particular the so-called stabbing query. We first presentclassical main-memory solutions to the stabbing query; namely: the Interval Tree; theSegment Tree and the Priority Search Tree. These structures have been extended in variousways to support intervals in external memory (ie; on the disk). Among other structures in thischapter we discuss: the Segment R-tree; the External Segment Tree; the External Priority …,*,2000,9
Temporal top-k search in social tagging sites using multiple social networks,Wenyu Huo; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract In social tagging sites; users are provided easy ways to create social networks; topost and share items like bookmarks; videos; photos and articles; along with comments andtags.

In particular; besides the globalconnection; we consider two main social networks; namely the friendship and the commoninterest networks in our scoring functions. Based on the degree of participation in variousnetworks; users can be categorized into specific classes that differ in their weights on eachscoring component.

A comparison of indexed temporal joins,Donghui Zhang; Vassilis J Tsotras; Bernhard Seeger,Abstract We examine temporal joins in the presence of indexing schemes. Utilizing an indexwhen processing join queries is especially advantageous if the join predicates involve onlya portion of the temporal relations. This is a novel problem since temporal indices havevarious characteristics that can affect join processing drastically. For example; temporalindices commonly introduce record copies to achieve better clustering of records with longintervals. We first identify such issues and show that naïve approaches do not work. Weconcentrate on common temporal join queries and examine various index-based algorithmsfor processing them. Two optimization techniques for indexed joins are proposed; namely;the balancing condition optimization and the virtual height optimization.

A scalable parallel XQuery processor,E Preston Carman; Till Westmann; Vinayak R Borkar; Michael J Carey; Vassilis J Tsotras,The wide use of XML for document management and data exchange has created the needto query large repositories of XML data. To efficiently query such large data and takeadvantage of parallelism; we have implemented Apache VXQuery; an open-source scalableXQuery processor. The system builds upon two other open-source frameworks: Hyracks; aparallel execution engine; and Algebricks; a language agnostic compiler toolbox. ApacheVXQuery extends these frameworks and provides an implementation of the XQuery specifics(data model; data-model dependent functions and optimizations; and a parser).

Algebricks: A data model-agnostic compiler backend for big data languages,Vinayak Borkar; Yingyi Bu; E Preston Carman Jr; Nicola Onose; Till Westmann; Pouria Pirzadeh; Michael J Carey; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract A number of high-level query languages; such as Hive; Pig; Flume; and Jaql; havebeen developed in recent years to increase analyst productivity when processing andanalyzing very large datasets. The implementation of each of these languages includes acomplete; data model-dependent query compiler; yet each involves a number of similaroptimizations.

Exact graph search algorithms for generalized traveling salesman path problems,Michael N Rice; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract The Generalized Traveling Salesman Path Problem (GTSPP) involves finding theshortest path from a location s to a location t that passes through at least one location fromeach of a set of generalized location categories (eg; gas stations; grocery stores). This NP-hard problem type has many applications in transportation and location-based services. Wepresent two exact algorithms for solving GTSPP instances; which rely on a unique product-graph search formulation. Our exact algorithms are exponential only in the number ofcategories (not in the total number of locations) and do not require the explicit construction ofa cost matrix between locations; thus allowing us to efficiently solve many real-worldproblems to optimality. Experimental analysis on the road network of North Americademonstrates that we can optimally solve large-scale; practical GTSPP instances typically …,International Symposium on Experimental Algorithms,2012,7
Grid file (and family),Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos; Yannis Theodoridis; Vassilis Tsotras,A simple definition is that gazetteers are dictionaries of placenames. The digital gazetteer asa component of georeferenced information systems; however; is more formally modeled. Agazetteer is defined as a collection of gazetteer entries; each of which contains; at aminimum; the tuple N; F; T where N is a place name; F is a formal expression of geographiclocation–a footprint; and T is a place type expressed with a term (or code) from a typingscheme. Applications often require; in addition; relationships between gazetteer entries;documentation of time frames; and additional information (as described below). Thegazetteer model is a type of knowledge organization system (KOS)–or ontology–which canbe modified to represent other classes of spatial-temporal information; such as named timeperiods and named events [3].,*,2009,7

In this paper we examine trajectory joins overstreaming spatiotemporal data. Given a stream of spatiotemporal trajectories created bymonitored moving objects; the outcome of a Continuous Spatiotemporal Trajectory Join(CSTJ) query is the set of objects in the stream; which have shown similar behavior over aquery-specified time interval; relative to the current timestamp. We propose a novel indexingscheme for streaming spatiotemporal data and develop algorithms for CSTJ evaluation;which utilize the proposed indexing scheme and effectively reduce the computation cost andI/O operations.

The pub/sub infrastructure manages the delivery of the messages; which is guidedby user subscriptions that specify the type of information the subscribers are interested in.Since XML prevails as the standard for information exchange; efficient XML-aware pub/subsystems become necessary. Within that context; we propose VA-RoXSum; a novel messagerepresentation scheme that aggregates the content of messages in a space efficient manner.Coupled with specialized processing algorithms that operate on its aggregated content; theVA-RoXSum enables the batch processing of groups of messages and considerablyimproves the performance of the subscription-guided filtering task.

A new method to design broadcast schedules in a wireless communication environment,CJ Su; L Tassiulas; V Tsotras,Wireless data broadcasting is a promising way of disseminating information to a massivenumber of clients in an asymmetric communication environment where client-to-servercommunication is infeasible. An important issue to be addressed in data broadcasting ishow to organize the data in the broadcast in such a way that the access latency of clientpage requests is minimized. Due to the lack of communication from clients to the server; theserver cannot know what a client needs at the current slot. We consider a broadcastingpolicy in which the server transmits; at each slot; the page which is most likely to berequested by the client; given the history of previous broadcasts. The policy is easilyimplementable since a simple recursive algorithm provides the conditional distribution ofpage requests at slot n from the same distribution at slot n-1.

Maintaining connectivity in dynamic multimodal network models,Petko Bakalov; Erik Hoel; Wee-Liang Heng; Vassilis J Tsotras,Network data models are frequently used as a mechanism to describe the connectivitybetween spatial features in many existing and emerging GIS applications (location-basedservices; transportation design; navigational systems; etc.). Connectivity information isrequired for solving a wide range of location-based queries like finding the shortest path;service areas discovery; allocation; and distance matrix computation. Nevertheless; real-lifenetworks are dynamic in nature since spatial features can be periodically modified. Suchupdates may change the connectivity relations with the other features and connectivity mustbe reestablished. Existing approaches are not suitable for a dynamic environment; sincewhenever a feature change occurs; the whole network connectivity has to be reconstructedfrom scratch.

A generic framework for continuous motion pattern query evaluation,Petko Bakalov; Vassilis J Tsotras,We introduce a novel query type defined over streaming moving object data; namely; theContinuous Motion Pattern (CMP) Queries. A motion pattern is defined as a sequence ofdistinct spatial predicates; each attached to a temporal constraint. The spatial predicates canbe of various types (range; nearest neighbor; etc.) The temporal constraints are relative tothe current time instant and are used to specify the order of the spatial predicates on the timeaxis. A CMP query is continuously reevaluated over streaming spatiotemporal data;producing the moving objects which satisfy the query's motion pattern. We first introduce aneasily maintainable indexing scheme for spatiotemporal streams that facilitates theevaluation of the spatial predicates over their temporal constraints. Using this scheme wepropose a generic framework for efficiently answering a wide range of CMP queries. The …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,6

A comparison of Top-k temporal keyword querying over versioned text collections,Wenyu Huo; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract As the web evolves over time; the amount of versioned text collections increasesrapidly. Most web search engines will answer a query by ranking all known documents atthe (current) time the query is posed. There are applications however (for example customerbehavior analysis; crime investigation; etc.) that would need to efficiently query thesesources as of some past time; that is; retrieve the results as if the user was posing the queryin a past time instant; thus accessing data known as of that time. Ranking and searchingover versioned documents considers not only keyword constraints but also the timedimension; most commonly; a time point or time range of interest. In this paper; we deal withtop-k query evaluations with both keyword and temporal constraints over versioned textualdocuments.

The preferred method to resolve conflicts in GISsystems is to encapsulate the modifications generated by the end users through the use ofmultiple versions. Multiuser (or versioned) geographic databases allow users to operate asthough they have full access to the entire dataset. Instead of relying upon row locking;versioned databases allow multiple users to simultaneously edit the same row. Theyimplement a model for conflict detection and resolution where the first to commit the changewins by default (though clients can manually intervene and select the latter change as thewinner).

Indexing Schemes for Efficient Aggregate Computation over Structural Joins.,Priya Mandawat; Vassilis J Tsotras,ABSTRACT With the increasing popularity of XML as a standard for data representation andexchange; efficient XML query processing has become a necessity. One popular approachencodes the hierarchical structure of XML data through a node numbering scheme; thusreducing typical queries to special forms (structural; path; twig) of containment joins. In thispaper we consider how using an index can facilitate the computation of (exact) aggregatesover structural joins. Consider for example; counting how many times item nodes appearunder store nodes in a chain-store database. One straightforward solution would be toactually compute the result of the structural join (store//item) and count all such occurrences.However; this requires time proportional to the join computation (which with appropriatebuffering is O (n) where n is the total number of store and item elements in the database) …,WebDB,2005,5
Spatio-temporal databases: complex motion pattern queries,Marcos R Vieira; Vassilis J Tsotras,This book presents several novel query processing techniques; called complex motionpattern queries; specifically designed for very large Spatio-Temporal Databases of movingobjects (also called trajectories). First; it begins with the definition of flexible pattern query; avery powerful; yet easy to use motion pattern query that allows users to select trajectoriesbased on specific events of interest. Flexible pattern query is described as regularexpressions over a spatial alphabet that can be implicitly/explicitly ''anchored''to the timedomain. Moreover; it allows users to include variables in the pattern query; and thus greatlyincrease its expressive power. Second; the Spatio-Temporal Pattern System (STPS) ispresented; which is an adaptation of flexible pattern query for large mobile phonecalldatabases.

Conclusion,Marcos R Vieira; Vassilis J Tsotras,This book introduces the flexible pattern query; a very powerful; yet easy to use motion patternquery which allows users to select trajectories based on specific events of interest. Such queriescombine the ability of fixed and variable predicates; with explicit or implicit temporal constraintsand distance-based constraints. Two query processing techniques are described: one basedon merge joins (IJP) and one based on subsequence matching (DPP). The experimental evaluationshows that our techniques improve substantially even over optimized (using indexing and preprocessingtechniques) previous approaches. Among all the described approaches; IJP is more robust inthat it can easily support NN queries; while DPP is better for patterns with smaller number ofpredicates or wild-cards. Since; however; both approaches are implemented in the same FlexTracksystem; they can both be available to the user … Then; the Spatio-Temporal Pattern …,*,2013,4

In this paper; we describe several typesof motion pattern queries for trajectories. In particular; we describe in detail two types ofmotion pattern queries: the flexible pattern queries; which focus on trajectories that follow asequence of spatiotemporal events; and the density-based pattern queries; where the goalis to search trajectories that “stay together” for a long period of time.

If thecensus microdata also contain the “Salary;” attribute; one can generate a magnitude tabledisplaying the average salary for each job type in each town. The number n of cells in atable is normally much less than the number r of respondent records in a microdata file.However; tables must satisfy several linear constraints: marginal row and column totals.Additionally; a set of tables is called linked if they share some of the crossed categorical …,*,2009,4

In this paper we introduce TS2 tree; a novel indexing structurefor organizing trajectory data based on similarity between trajectories. TS2 tree provideslower and upper bounds on distance between trajectories; based on which we propose ageneral framework for effectively answering a wide range of similarity-based trajectoryqueries such as similarity threshold (ST) query and similarity best fit (SBF) query.

Indexing Animated Objects.,George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract We examine the problem of indexing objects in animated movies. We consider ananimated movie as consisting of a frame sequence where each frame is described byobjects in a 2-dimensional space. The queries of interest are of the form:\nd the objects thatwere in area S between frames fi and fj". The straightforward approach to index such objectsis to consider the frame sequence as another dimension and use a 3-dimensional accessmethod (like an R-tree) to index all objects. Instead we propose to reduce the problem to apartial-persistence problem; that is; use a 2-dimensional access method that is madepartially persistent. We show that this approach leads to faster query time while still usingspace proportional to the total number of changes in the frame evolution.,Multimedia Information Systems,1999,4
Hashing methods for temporal data,George Kollios; Vassilis J Tsotras,ABSTRACT External dynamic hashing has been used in traditional database systems as afast method to answer membership queries. Given a dynamic set S of objects; a membershipquery asks whether an object with identity k is in the most current S. This paper addressesthe more general problem of Temporal Hashing. In this setting changes to the dynamic setare timestamped and the membership query has a temporal predicate; as in:“find whetherobject with identity k was in the set S at time t”. We present an efficient solution to theTemporal Hashing problem. Our solution; also termed partially persistent hashing; behavesas if a separate; ephemeral (ie; non-temporal) dynamic hashing scheme is available onevery state assumed by set S over time. However if the buckets of these hashing schemeswere to be stored for each time of interest; the space would become prohibitively large …,History,1998,4
A load-balanced parallel sorting algorithm for shared-nothing architectures,Anil Kumar; Tony T Lee; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract With the popularity of parallel database machines based on the shared-nothingarchitecture; it has become important to find external sorting algorithms which lead to a load-balanced computation; ie; balanced execution; communication and output. If during thecourse of the sorting algorithm each processor is equally loaded; parallelism is fullyexploited. Similarly; balanced communication will not congest the network traffic. Sincesorting can be used to support a number of other relational operations (joins; duplicateelimination; building indexes etc.) data skew produced by sorting can further lead toexecution skew at later stages of these operations. In this paper we present a load-balancedparallel sorting algorithm for shared-nothing architectures. It is a multiple-input multiple-output algorithm with four stages; based on a generalization of Batcher's odd-even merge …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,1995,4

Fpga-accelerated group-by aggregation using synchronizing caches,Ildar Absalyamov; Prerna Budhkar; Skyler Windh; Robert J Halstead; Walid A Najjar; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Recent trends in hardware have dramatically dropped the price of RAM and shiftedfocus from systems operating on disk-resident data to in-memory solutions. In thisenvironment high memory access latency; also known as memory wall; becomes the biggestdata processing bottleneck. Traditional CPU-based architectures solved this problem byintroducing large cache hierarchies. However algorithms which experience poor locality canlimit the benefits of caching. In turn; hardware multithreading provides a generic solution thatdoes not rely on algorithm-specific locality properties. In this paper we present an FPGA-accelerated implementation of in-memory group-by hash aggregation. Our design relies onhardware multithreading to efficiently mask long memory access latency by implementing acustom operation datapath on FPGA. We propose using CAMs (Content Addressable …,Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware,2016,3
RICC: fast reachability query processing on large spatiotemporal datasets,Elena V Strzheletska; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Spatiotemporal reachability queries arise naturally when determining howdiseases; information; physical items can propagate through a collection of moving objects;such queries are significant for many important domains like epidemiology; public health;security monitoring; surveillance; and social networks. While traditional reachability querieshave been studied in graphs extensively; what makes spatiotemporal reachability queriesdifferent and challenging is that the associated graph is dynamic and space-time dependent.As the spatiotemporal dataset becomes very large over time; a solution needs to be I/O-efficient. Previous work assumes an 'instant exchange'scenario (where information can beinstantly transferred and retransmitted between objects); which may not be the case in manyreal world applications. In this paper we propose the RICC (Reachability Index …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2015,3
A study on parallelizing XML path filtering using accelerators,Roger Moussalli; Mariam Salloum; Robert Halstead; Walid Najjar; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Publish-subscribe systems present the state of the art in information disseminationto multiple users. Such systems have evolved from simple topic-based to the current XML-based systems. XML-based pub-sub systems provide users with more flexibility by allowingthe formulation of complex queries on the content as well as the structure of the streamingmessages. Messages that match a given user query are forwarded to the user. This articleexamines how to exploit the parallelism found in XPath filtering. Using an incoming XMLstream; parsing and matching thousands of user profiles are performed simultaneously bymatching engines. We show the benefits and trade-offs of mapping the proposed filteringapproach onto FPGAs; processing streams of XML at wire speed; and GPUs; providing theflexibility of software. This is in contrast to conventional approaches bound by the …,ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS),2014,3
Distributed diversification of large datasets,Mahbub Hasan; Abdullah Mueen; Vassilis Tsotras,Diversification has been recently proposed as an approach to allow a user to better grasp alarge result set without having to look through all relevant results. In this paper; we expandthe use of diversification as an analytical tool to explore large datasets dispersed over manynodes. The diversification problem is in general NP-complete and existing uniprocessoralgorithms are unfortunately not suitable for the distributed setting of our environment. Usingthe MapReduce framework we consider two distinct approaches to solve the distributeddiversification problem; one that focuses on optimizing disk I/O and one that optimizes fornetwork I/O. Our approaches are iterative in nature; allowing the user to continue refining thediversification process if more time is available. Moreover; we prove that (i) this iterationprocess converges and (ii) it produces a 2-approximate diversified result set when …,Cloud Engineering (IC2E); 2014 IEEE International Conference on,2014,3
STEM: A spatio-temporal miner for bursty activity,Theodoros Lappas; Marcos R Vieira; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Burst identification has been extensively studied in the context of documentstreams; where a burst is generally exhibited when an unusually high frequency is observedfor a term t. Previous works have focused exclusively on either temporal or spatial burstinesspatterns. The former represents bursty timeframes within a single stream; while the lattercharacterizes sets of streams that simultaneously exhibited a bursty behavior for a user-specified timeframe. Our previous work was the first to study the spatiotemporal burstiness ofterms. In this context; a burstiness pattern consists of both a timeframe and a set of streams;both of which need to be identified automatically. In this paper we describe STEM (Spatio-TEmporal Miner); a system for finding spatiotemporal burstiness patterns in a collection ofspatially distributed frequency streams.

High-performance holistic XML twig filtering using GPUs,Ildar Absalyamov; Roger Moussalli; Walid Najjar; Vassilis J Tsotras,ABSTRACT Current state of the art in information dissemination comprises of publishersbroadcasting XML-coded documents; in turn selectively forwarded to interested subscribers.The deployment of XML at the heart of this setup greatly increases the expressive power ofthe profiles listed by subscribers; using the XPath language. On the other hand; with greatexpressive power comes great performance responsibility: it is becoming harder for thematching infrastructure to keep up with the high volumes of data and users. Traditionally;general purpose computing platforms have generally been favored over customizedcomputational setups; due to the simplified usability and significant reduction ofdevelopment time. The sequential nature of these general purpose computers howeverlimits their performance scalability. In this work; we propose the implementation of the …,ADMS@ VLDB,2013,3
Editing and versioning for high performance network models in a multiuser environment,Petko Bakalov; Erik Hoel; Wee-Liang Heng; Sudhakar Menon; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Network data models are frequently used as a mechanism to describe theconnectivity between spatial features in GIS applications. Real-life network models aredynamic in nature since spatial features can be periodically modified to reflect changes inthe real world objects that they model. Such updates may change the connectivity relationswith the other features in the model. In order to perform analysis the connectivity must bereestablished. Existing editing frameworks are not suitable for a dynamic environment; sincethey require network connectivity to be reconstructed from scratch. Another requirement forGIS network models is to provide support for a multiuser environment; where users aresimultaneously creating and updating large amounts of geographic information. The systemmust support edit sessions that typically span a number of days or weeks; the facility to …,GeoInformatica,2011,3

Designing Broadcast Schedules for Information Dissemination through Braodcasting,Chi-Jiun Su; Leandros Tassiulas; Vassilis Tsotras,Abstract: Broadcast data delivery is encountered in many applications where there is a needto disseminate information to a large user community in a wireless asymmetriccommunication environment. In this paper; the authors consider the problem of schedulingthe data broadcast such that the average response time experienced by users is low. In apush-based system; where the users cannot place requests directly to the server and thebroadcast schedule should be determined based solely on access probabilities; theyformulate a deterministic dynamic optimization problem; the solution of which provides theoptimal broadcast schedule. Properties of the optimal solution are obtained and then theypropose a suboptimal dynamic policy that achieves average response time close to thelower bound. The policy has low complexity; is adaptive to changing access statistics; and …,*,1997,3

INTRODUCTION The amount of user generated data increases every year; as more socialinteraction tools like Twitter; Instagram and Facebook are being created and more users usethem to share their everyday experiences. Most research on analyzing so- cial data has focusedon detecting trends and patterns such as bursty topics [11] and popular spatiotemporal paths[10]; event extraction [7]; studying how information is spread [12]; or analyzing properties of thesocial graph. In contrast; in this paper; we study how to search so- cial network data items; postsand images; based on spa- tiotemporal keyword queries. That is; we created methods to findthe right needles (social data items) in the haystack (social networks); which we refer to as investigativesearch; to contrast it to the trending queries studied by previous work.

Revisiting Aggregation for Data Intensive Applications: A Performance Study,Jian Wen; Vinayak R Borkar; Michael J Carey; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract: Aggregation has been an important operation since the early days of relationaldatabases. Today's Big Data applications bring further challenges when processingaggregation queries; demanding adaptive aggregation algorithms that can process largevolumes of data relative to a potentially limited memory budget (especially in multiusersettings). Despite its importance; the design and evaluation of aggregation algorithms hasnot received the same attention that other basic operators; such as joins; have received inthe literature. As a result; when considering which aggregation algorithm (s) to implement ina new parallel Big Data processing platform (AsterixDB); we faced a lack of" off the shelf"answers that we could simply read about and then implement based on prior performancestudies. In this paper we revisit the engineering of efficient local aggregation algorithms …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1311.0059,2013,2
Querying transaction–time databases under branched schema evolution,Wenyu Huo; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Transaction-time databases have been proposed for storing and querying thehistory of a database. While past work concentrated on managing the data evolutionassuming a static schema; recent research has considered data changes under a linearlyevolving schema. An ordered sequence of schema versions is maintained and the databasecan restore/query its data under the appropriate past schema. There are however manyapplications leading to a branched schema evolution where data can evolve in parallel;under different concurrent schemas. In this work; we consider the issues involved inmanaging the history of a database that follows a branched schema evolution. To maintaineasy access to any past schema; we use an XML-based approach with an optimized sharingstrategy. As for accessing the data; we explore branched temporal indexing techniques …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2012,2

Managing the history of dynamic data structures,Vassilis John Tsotras,Abstract Dynamic and persistent data structures play an increasing role in several areas ofcomputer science and engineering; such as object oriented programming; temporaldatabases and new parallel computation models and languages that allow historicalreferences. A key feature to the above is the ability of efficiently reconstructing the history ofevolving data structures. The first part of this thesis provides optimal solutions to such historyreconstruction problems. More specifically; we start with the problem of efficientlymaintaining the history of a set evolving in time; since this is the simplest data structure veryoften used to represent the state of a program or a database. The evolution of the set isrealized by the following allowable operations on the set's state: the addition of a newelement and the deletion or the value change of an existing element.

Flock Pattern Queries,Marcos R Vieira; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract With the recent advancements and wide usage of location detection devices; largequantities of data are collected; for example; by GPS and cellular technologies in the form oftrajectories. While most previous work on trajectory-based queries has concentrated ontraditional range; nearest-neighbor; similarity queries; and clustering techniques; there is anincreasing interest in queries that capture the “aggregate” behavior of trajectories as groups.Consider; for example; finding groups of moving objects that move “together”; ie; within apredefined distance to each other for a continuous period of time. Such type of queriestypically arises in many surveillance and monitoring applications; eg identify groups ofsuspicious people; convoys of vehicles; flocks of animals. In this chapter; we first show thatthe on-line flock discovery problem is polynomial; and then we propose a framework and …,*,2013,1
A spatial caching framework for map operations in geographical information systems,Marcos R Vieira; Petko Bakalov; Erik Hoel; Vassilis J Tsotras,Caching is a well-known approach to achieve good performance and scalability in mobilecomputing environments. Using this technique; the query response time and the overallsystem performance can be extremely improved by decreasing the volume of datatransferred between the server and the mobile device. However; the effectiveness of cachingtechniques depend greatly on the nature of the data processed by the application and thedata access patterns which are specific for this type of analysis. Cache managementtechniques for Geographical Information Systems (GIS) deviate substantially from existingmethods used with relational data; since GIS map navigation operations (eg panning;zooming in/out) have their own unique access patterns that differ greatly from its relationalequivalents.

On continuously monitoring the top-k moving objects with relational group and score functions,Jian Wen; Vassilis J Tsotras; Donghui Zhang,Abstract With the wide usage of location tracking system; continuously mining relationshipsamong moving objects over their location changes is possible and also important to manyreal applications. This paper shows a novel continuous location-based query; calledcontinuous relational top-k query; or CRTQ; which continuously monitors the k movingobjects with the most significant relations with other objects by user-defined relational groupand score functions. Although this kind of query can be implemented as a special case of thetop-k join query using SQL; this straight-forward way is too expensive to be applicablewidely. This paper also discusses the properties of this novel query; which leads to theflexibility of the query and also the difficulty for a generalized solution.

Linear Hashing,Donghui Zhang; Yannis Manolopoulos; Yannis Theodoridis; Vassilis J Tsotras,A language model assigns a probability to a piece of unseen text; based on some trainingdata. For example; a language model based on a big English newspaper archive isexpected to assign a higher probability to ''a bit of text''than to ''aw pit tov tags;''because thewords in the former phrase (or word pairs or word triples if so-called N-Gram Models areused) occur more frequently in the data than the words in the latter phrase. For informationretrieval; typical usage is to build a language model for each document. At search time; thetop ranked document is the one whose language model assigns the highest probability tothe query.,*,2009,1
Primary index,Yannis Manolopoulos; Yannis Theodoridis; Vassilis J Tsotras,P/FDM [5–7] integrated a functional data model with the logic programming language Prologfor general-purpose computation. The data model can be seen as an Entity-Relationshipdiagram with sub-types; much like a UML Class Diagram. The idea was for the user to beable to define a computation over objects in the diagram; instead of just using it as a schemadesign aid. Later versions of P/FDM included a graphic interface [2; 4] to build queries inDAPLEX syntax by clicking on the diagram and filling in values from menus.,*,2009,1
Hash-based Indexing,Mirella M Moro; Donghui Zhang; Vassilis J Tsotras,A hash function is a well-defined deterministic algorithm that takes as input data of arbitrarylength and produces a short fixed-length digital representation of the data; or a digest; as itsoutput. The output of a hash function can serve the role of a digital ''fingerprint''of the inputdata; as an important design property of hash functions is that of collision resilience: twohashes produced on different inputs are very unlikely to result in the same value.Furthermore; given a hash function output; it is normally infeasible to find a (previouslyunseen) input that matches that output (this property is called preimage resistance).,*,2009,1
Spatial indexing techniques,Yannis Manolopoulos; Yannis Theodoridis; Vassilis J Tsotras,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}. A query Q is called domain independent if the value of Qwhen applied to any database is the same for any two domains containing the databasevalues or; equivalently; if the value of Q when applied to a database contains only values …,*,2009,1
Experimental Evaluation of Query Processing Techniques over Multiversion XML Documents.,Adam Woss; Vassilis J Tsotras,ABSTRACT Various approaches have been recently proposed for storing the evolution of anXML document; thereby preserving useful past information about the document and thus theability to query it. While the importance of maintaining a document's evolution has beenrecognized; relatively little research has been done on how to adapt efficient XML queryingtechniques in a multiversion environment. Such methods would allow the user to efficientlyperform structural queries over any past version or interval of versions of the XML document.In this paper; we examine query processing techniques on (linear) multiversion XMLdocuments. Specifically; we propose efficient modifications to existing XML queryprocessing algorithms and compare them to more traditional approaches.

Editing and versioning dynamic network models,Petko Bakalov; Erik Hoel; Wee-Liang Heng; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Network data models are widely used to describe the connectivity between spatialfeatures in GIS architectures. Recent applications demand that such models are editable inmultiuser environments. The preferred method to resolve conflicts in GIS systems is the useof multiple versions of the data to encapsulate the modifications generated by the end users.In this demo we present a flexible versioning scheme for network models. Our solution isbased on marking" dirty areas"(regions which contain conflicts between multiple versions)and subsequent cleaning of these dirty areas. We have implemented a prototype of thisversioning scheme and have used it extensively to support various ESRI applications whichutilize network models.,Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGSPATIAL international conference on Advances in geographic information systems,2008,1
Index based processing of semi-restrictive temporal joins,Donghui Zhang; Vassilis J Tsotras,Temporal joins are important but very costly operations. While a temporal join can involvethe whole time (and/or key) domain; we consider the more general case where the join isdefined by some time-key rectangle from the whole space (ie; when the user is interested injoining portions of the-usually large-temporal data). In the most restrictive join; objects(within this rectangle) are joined together based on key equality and interval intersection.This paper concentrates on semi-restrictive joins; ie; when either the key equality (equi-join)or the interval intersection (time-join) predicates are used. Given the large relations createdby the ever increasing time dimension; we assume that each temporal relation is indexedand examine efficient ways to process semi-restrictive temporal joins. Utilizing an index ishelpful since it directs the join towards the objects that are within the time-key rectangle. A …,Temporal Representation and Reasoning; 2002. TIME 2002. Proceedings.

Spatiotemporal access methods,Yannis Manolopoulos; Yannis Theodoridis; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Spatiotemporal Database Management Systems (STDBMSs) manage data whosegeometry changes over time. There are many applications that create such data; includingglobal change (as in climate or land cover changes); transportation (traffic surveillance data;intelligent transportation systems); social (demographic; health; etc.); and multimedia(animated movies) applications. For simplicity we consider two spatial attributes; the objectposition and extent; either (or both) of which can change with time. Based on the rate thatspatial attributes change; we identify two cases: the discrete and the continuousspatiotemporal environments. We first introduce the basic characteristics and interestingqueries for each environment and then present efficient spatiotemporal indexing techniques.,*,2000,1

To support such Temporal Views anefficient dataorganization; or access method; is neededfor storing and updating network related data (asthenetwork evolves over time) and for retrieving requested past network states. Forapplications where thenetwork manager is not interested in the full (and maybetoo large)snapshot of a past network state it is usefulif partial state snapshots can be extracted quickly.It is thus of particular interest toconstruct an access method that can efficiently supportPartialTemporal Views.

Optimally managing the history of an evolving forest,Vassilis J Tsotras; B Gopinath; George W Hart,Abstract There are many applications where data to be archived have the form of anevolving forest. In this paper we address the problem of efficiently reconstructing the historyof a forest evolving in time. A forest is a set of trees and at each time instant a constantnumber of changes occur in the forest. We propose an optimal; dynamic algorithm thatreconstructs the state of any subtree in the forest at a given instant t in the past; in O (| s (t)|+loglog T) time; where| s (t)| is the cardinality of the requested subtree and T is the total lengthof the evolution. The space used is linear to the total number of changes that occurredduring the forest's evolution. If a total of O ((log T) 1/c) parallel processors is available; wherec is a constant (c≥ 1); the loglog T factor is eliminated from the previous time bound. Finally;we optimally address the following query: given a path p in the forest; find all the lifetimes …,*,1990,1
Efficient Processing of Reachability Queries with Meetings,Elena V Strzheletska; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract The prevalence of location tracking systems has resulted in large volumes ofspatiotemporal data generated every day. Addressing reachability queries on such datasetsis important for a wide range of applications; such as security monitoring; surveillance;public health; epidemiology; social networks; etc. Given two objects OS; OT and a timeinterval I; a reachability query identifies whether information (or physical items etc.) couldhave transferred from OS to OT during I (typically indirectly through intermediaries). Whiletraditional graph reachability queries have been studied extensively; little work exists onprocessing spatiotemporal reachability queries for large disk-resident trajectory datasets.Moreover; previous research assumed that information can be passed from one object toanother instantaneously.

Assembly Queries: Planning and Discovering Assemblies of Moving Objects Using Partial Information,Reaz Uddin; Michael N Rice; Chinya V Ravishankar; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Consider objects moving in a road network (eg; groups of people or deliveryvehicles); who may be free to choose routes; yet be required to arrive at certain locations atcertain times. Such objects may need to assemble in groups within the network (friends meetwhile visiting a city; vehicles need to exchange items or information) without violating arrivalconstraints. Planning for such assemblies is hard when the network or the number of objectsis large. Conversely; discovering actual or potential assemblies of such objects is importantin many surveillance; security; and law-enforcement applications. This can be hard whenobject arrival observations are sparse due to inadequate sensor coverage or objectcountermeasures.

To this end; theintroduction of approximation-based methods helped speed-up queries by providingcompact representations of stored data. Approximation methods exploit vector quantizationto index data mainly presumed to follow a uniform distribution. In real-world environmentshowever; we mostly encounter both skewed data and query distributions. To address thisdual challenge; we propose DiVA that combines the selective use of an approximationapproach with an indexing mechanism to organize data subspaces in a high fan-outhierarchical structure.

Letter from the Special Issue Editors.,David Maier; VM Megler; Kristin Tufte,Most data related to people and the built world originates in urban settings. There isincreasing demand to capture and exploit this data to support efforts in areas such as SmartCities; City Science and Intelligent Transportation Systems. Urban informatics deals with thecollection; organization; dissemination and analysis of urban information used in suchapplications. However; the dramatic growth in the volume of this urban data createschallenges for existing data-management and analysis techniques. The collected data isalso increasingly diverse; with a wide variety of sensor; GIS; imagery and graph data arisingin cities.

Diversified Pattern Queries,Marcos R Vieira; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract In this chapter we describe a general framework; called DivDB; for evaluation andoptimization of methods for diversifying query results. In these methods; an initial rankingcandidate set produced by a query is used to construct a result set. The elements in theresult set are ranked with respect to relevance and diversity features; ie; the retrievedelements should be as relevant as possible to the query; and; at the same time; the result setshould be as diverse as possible. While addressing relevance is relatively simple and hasbeen heavily studied; diversity is a harder problem to solve. One major contribution of thiswork is that; we adapt; implement and evaluate several existing methods for diversifyingquery results in the DivDB framework. We also propose two new approaches; namely theGreedy with Marginal Contribution (GMC) and the Greedy Randomized with …,*,2013,*
Pattern Queries for Mobile Phone-Call Databases,Marcos R Vieira; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Call Detail Record (CDR) databases contain many millions of records withinformation about mobile phone calls; including the users' location; when the call wasmade/received; and call duration; among other data. This huge amount of spatio-temporaldata opens the door for the study of human trajectories on a large scale without the bias thatother sources; like GPS or WLAN networks; introduce in the population studied.Furthermore; it provides a platform for the development of a wide variety of studies rangingfrom the spread of diseases to planning of public transportation. Nevertheless; previouswork on spatio-temporal queries does not provide a framework flexible enough forexpressing the complexity of human trajectories. In this chapter; we present Spatio-TemporalPattern System (STPS) to query spatio-temporal patterns in very large CDR databases …,*,2013,*
Flexible Pattern Queries,Marcos R Vieira; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract The wide adaptation of GPS and cellular technologies has created manyapplications (eg; location-based; tracking; geo-fencing; and surveillance) that collect andmaintain large repositories of data in the form of trajectories. Each trajectory contains thespatial locations collected for a given moving object over an ordered sequence of timeinstants. Previous work on querying and analyzing trajectorial data typically falls intomethods that either addresses spatial range and nearest neighbor queries; or similaritybased queries. Nevertheless; trajectories are complex moving objects whose behavior overtime and space can be better captured as a sequence of interesting events. We thusfacilitate the use of motion pattern queries that allow the user to select trajectories based onspecific motion patterns. Such patterns are described as regular expressions over a …,*,2013,*

Online Identification of Dwell Regions for Moving Objects,M Reaz Uddin; Chinya V Ravishankar; Vassilis J Tsotras,A region R is a dwell region for a moving object O if; given a threshold distance d andduration t; every point of R remains within distance d of O for at least time t. Clearly; pointswithin R are likely to be of interest to O; so identification of O and R has applications in areassuch as monitoring and surveillance; as well as to trajectory simplification. We propose anonline algorithm to solve this problem; which can handle dynamic addition and deletion ofdata in logarithmic time. We assume an incoming stream of object positions; and maintainthe upper and lower bounds for the radius of the smallest circle enclosing these positions; aspoints are added and deleted. These bounds allow us to greatly reduce the number oftrajectory points we need to consider in the query; as well as to defer query evaluation.

Often times; theowner of the road network data (eg; a transport authority) provides its database to third-partyquery services; which are responsible for answering shortest path queries posed by theirclients. The issue arising here is that a query service might be returning sub-optimal pathseither purposely (in order to serve its own purposes like computational savings orcommercial reasons) or because it has been compromised by Internet attackers who falsifythe results.

On continuous monitoring top-k unsafe moving objects,Jian Wen; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract With the wide usage of location tracking systems; continuously trackingrelationships among moving objects over their location changes is possible and important tomany real applications. This paper proposes a novel continuous location-based query;called the continuous top-k unsafe moving objects query or CTUO.

Structured Queries Over XML Documents with Branched Versioning,Wanxing Xu; J Tsotras Vassilis,Over the last few years; there is an increasing use of XML documents as the standard fortree-structured data over the Internet. Moreover; the vast majority of XML documents beingdisseminated undergo modifications (for example; insertions; deletions and updates) overtime. In most cases; the past versions are of historic importance so that we need to manageevery version of the XML document with the effects of the modifications as the timeprogresses. As a result; many research interest has been raised to devise an effectivesolution to storing multiversion XML documents. Conventional temporal databases assumea single line of time evolution; called data with linear versioning; which allows only the latestversion to be modified; ie a new version is created by modify only the latest version at thattime.

Efficient Complex Query Support,Shu-Yao Chien; Vassilis J Tsotras; Carlo Zaniolo; Donghui Zhang,Abstract. Managing multiple versions of XML documents represents a critical requirement formany applications. Also; there has been much recent interest in supporting complex querieson XML data (eg; regular path expressions; structural projections; DIFF queries). In thispaper; we examine the problem of supporting efficiently complex queries on multiversionedXML documents. Our approach relies on a scheme based on durable node numbers (DNNs)that preserve the order among the XML tree nodes and are invariant with respect to updates.Using the document's DNNs various complex queries are reduced to combinations of partialversion retrieval queries. We examine three indexing schemes to efficiently evaluate partialversion retrieval queries in this environment. A thorough performance analysis is thenpresented to reveal the advantages of each scheme.,Advances in Database Technology-EDBT 2002: 8th International Conference on Extending Database Technology; Prague; Czech Republic; March 25-27; Proceedings,2003,*

Fundamental Access Methods,Yannis Manolopoulos; Yannis Theodoridis; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract A major performance goal of a DBMS is to minimize the number of I/O's (ie; blocksor pages transferred) between the disk and main memory. One way to achieve this goal is tominimize the number of I/O's when answering a query. Note that many queries referenceonly a small portion of the records in a database file. For example the query:“find theemployees who reside in Santa Monica” references only a fraction of the records in theEmployee relation. It would be very inefficient to have the database system sequentially readall the pages of the Employee file and check the residence field of each employee record forthe name “Santa Monica”. Instead the system should be able to locate the pages with “SantaMonica” employee records directly. To allow such fast access additional data structurescalled access methods are designed per database file. There are two fundamental …,*,2000,*

For example; even if we apply the best sorting algorithm on a set of 10;000;000records; the real-time constraints that are posed by the application may not be satisfied.Therefore; apart from the design and implementation of efficient algorithms; the researchcommunity is still developed new techniques aiming at more efficient processing.

To address these applications temporaldatabases have been proposed. Such databases model reality through the use of twoorthogonal time dimensions: the valid and transaction times. Depending on which timedimension (s) is supported; a temporal database is characterized as transaction-time; valid-time or bitemporal. Supporting temporal data adds extra database functionality since itallows queries about the modeled reality's past; current or future behavior. However; it alsocreates the novel problem of efficiently managing temporal data. In this chapter we first …,*,2000,*

An Extensible Notation for Spatiotemporal Index Queries,Vassilis J Tsotras; Christian S Jensen; Richard T Snodgrass,Abstract Temporal; spatial and spatiotemporal queries are inherently multidimensional;combining predicates on explicit attributes with predicates on time dimension (s) and spatialdimension (s). Much confusion has prevailed in the literature on access methods becauseno consistent notation exists for referring to such queries. As a contribution towardseliminating this problem; we propose a new and simple notation for spatiotemporal queries.The notation aims to address the selection-based spatiotemporal queries commonly studiedin the literature of access methods. The notation is extensible and can be applied to moregeneral multidimensional; selection-based queries.,SIGMOD Record,1997,*

Using universe knowledge and arithmetic to get faster parallel algorithms,Vassilis J Tsotras; B Gopinath; George W Hart,The authors provide algorithms that achieve better upper bounds for three classical parallelproblems; ie; searching; merging and maximum finding. The algorithms assume that the pparallel processors can use arithmetic and that the universe U of the input elements isbounded and known. They show that parallel searching is done in O (loglogU/logp); whileparallel merging and maximum finding in O (logloglogU). The results hold for the CRCW andCREW PRAM models.,Parallel and Distributed Processing; 1990. Proceedings of the Second IEEE Symposium on,1990,*
252 and Industry,CJ Su; L Tassiulas; V Tsotras,Abstract Wireless data broadcasting is a promising way of disseminating information to amassive number of clients in an assymetric communication environment where client-to-server communication is infeasible. An important issue to be addressed in data broadcastingis how to organize the data in the broadcast in such a way that the access latency of clientpage requests is minimized. Due to the lack of communication from clients to the server; theserver cannot know what a client needs at the current slot. We consider a broadcastingpolicy in which the server transmits; at each slot; the page which is most likely to berequested by the client; given the history of previous broadcasts. The policy is easilyimplementable since a simple recursive algorithm provides the conditional distribution ofpage requests at slot n from the same distribution at slot n–1. The policy derives …,*,*,*
E cient Management of Multiversion Documents by Object Referencing,Shu-Yao Chien Vassilis J Tsotras; Carlo Zaniolo,Abstract Traditional approaches to versioning documents are edit-based; and representsuccessive versions using edit scripts. This paper proposes a reference-based versioningscheme that preserves the rich logical structure of the evolving document via objectreferences. This approach produces better support for queries; and reconciles the storage-level and transport-level representations of multiversioned XML documents. In particular; wepresent e cient algorithms for supporting projection and selection queries; and for queryingthe document evolution history. Then; we show that our representation is also e cient at thetransport level; where XML documents are exchanged between remote parties. In fact; withthe reference-based scheme; an XML document's history can also be viewed and processedas yet another XML document. Finally; we demonstrate the e ectiveness of the new …,Change,*,*
Efficient Aggregation over Multidimensional Objects Donghui Zhang* Vassilis Tsotras† Alexander Markowetz Marios Hadjieleftheriou § Dimitrios Gunopulosk Bernh...,Donghui Zhang,Abstract Multi-dimensional aggregation queries are very useful but costly operations.Previous approaches on multidimensional aggregations works either for point objects (theDynamic Data Cube; etc.); or for one-dimensional interval objects (the SB-tree; etc.). Thispaper proposes efficient techniques to compute and incrementally maintain multi-dimensional aggregates for objects which may have non-zero extent in any dimension (s).We propose a new index structure called the BA-tree which absorbs features from both theDynamic Data Cube and the SB-tree. We further examine multi-dimensional aggregationswhere object values are not constant but are described by functions. This has a non-trivialconsequence in aggregation computations. An object's participation in the aggregation isthe function integral over the intersection between the object's multidimensional extent …,*,*,*

On the Spatiotemporal Burstiness of Terms,Marcos R Vieira; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Thousands of documents are made available to the users via the web on a dailybasis. One of the most extensively studied problems in the context of such documentstreams is burst identification. Given a term t; a burst is generally exhibited when anunusually high frequency is observed for t. While spatial and temporal burstiness have beenstudied individually in the past; our work is the first to simultaneously track and measurespatiotemporal term burstiness. In addition; we use the mined burstiness information towardan efficient document-search engine: given a user's query of terms; our engine returns aranked list of documents discussing influential events with a strong spatiotemporal impact.We demonstrate the efficiency of our methods with an extensive experimental evaluation onreal and synthetic datasets. 1.,*,*,*
Efficient Indexing for Spatiotemporal Applications,Vassilis J Tsotras; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Indexing spatiotemporal data is an important problem for many applications (global change;transportation; social and multimedia applications). The goal of this project is to provideefficient access methods for data whose geometry changes over time. Two time-varyingspatial attributes are considered; the object position and extent. Based on the rate by whichthese spatial attributes change; the discrete and continuous spatiotemporal environmentsare identified. In the discrete environment; spatiotemporal data changes in discrete steps.Efficient ways to answer historical queries on any past state of such spatiotemporal data areexamined. In particular; selection; neighbor; aggregate; join and similarity queries areaddressed using a" partial persistence" methodology. In the continuous spatiotemporalenvironment; data changes continuously. Instead of keeping the data position/extent at …,*,*,*
AL oad-B alanced P arallel S orting A lgorithm for S hared-N othing A rchitectures,Anil Kumar Tony T Lee Vassilis; J Tsotras,ABSTRACT With the popularity of parallel database machines based on the shared-nothingarchitecture; it has become important to find external sorting algorithms which lead to a load-balanced computation; ie; balanced execution; communication and output. If during thecourse of the sorting algorithm each processor is equally loaded; then parallelism is fullyexploited. Similarly; balanced communication will not congest the network traffic. Sincesorting can be used to support a number of other relational operations (joins; duplicateelimination; building indexes etc.) data skew produced by sorting can further lead toexecution skew at later stages of these operations. In this paper we present a load-balancedparallel sorting algorithm for shared-nothing architectures. It is a multipleinput multiple-output algorithm with four stages; based on a generalization of Batcher's odd-even merge …,*,*,*

Historical Queries along Multiple Lines of Time Evolution,Gad M Landau Jeanette P Schmidt; Vassilis J Tsotras,ABSTRACT Traditional approaches to addressing historical queries assume a single line oftime evolution; ie; a system (database; relation) evolves over time by applying a sequence oftransactions on it. Each transaction always applies to the unique; current state of the system;resulting in a new current state. There are however; complex applications where thesystem's state evolves in a way that results in multiple lines of evolution. Consider forexample a company that splits into a number of subsidiaries; which in turn may split into newsubsidiaries and so on. In general; this creates a tree (hierarchy) of evolution lines; whereeach tree node represents the time evolution of a particular subsidiary. Multiple lines of timeevolution create novel historical queries; such as the vertical historical query:“find allemployees that were working for subsidiary C or one of its ancestors; on January 1st …,*,*,*

Approximating multi-dimensional aggregate range queries over real attributes Dimitrios Gunopulos Univ. of California Riverside,Vassilis J Tsotras; Carlotta Domeniconi,Abstract Finding approximate answers to multi-dimensional range queries over real valuedattributes has significant applications in data exploration and database query optimization.In this paper we consider the following problem: given a table of d attributes whose domainis the real numbers; and a query that specifies a range in each dimension; find a goodapproximation of the number of records in the table that satisfy the query. We present a newhistogram technique that is designed to approximate the density of multi-dimensionaldatasets with real attributes. Our technique finds buckets of variable size; and allows thebuckets to overlap. Overlapping buckets allow more efficient approximation of the density.The size of the cells is based on the local density of the data. This technique leads to a fasterand more compact approximation of the data distribution. We also show how to …,*,*,*

In this paper we propose algorithms that reconstruct past states of anevolving system for two general cases; ie; when the system's state is represented by a set orby a hierarchy (a forest of trees). Sets are widely used as a canonical form of representinginformation in databases or program states. For more complex applications; like schemaevolution in object-oriented databases; it becomes necessary to manage the history of datastructures that have the form of forests or even graphs. The proposed algorithms useminimal space (proportional to the number of changes occurring in the evolution) and …,*,*,*
Efficient Structural Joins on Indexed XML Documents,Vassilis J Tsotras; Carlo Zaniolo,Abstract Queries on XML documents typically combine selections on element contents; and;via path expressions; the structural relationships between tagged elements. Structural joinsare used to find all pairs of elements satisfying the primitive structural relationships specifiedin the query; namely; parent-child and ancestordescendant relationships. Efficient supportfor structural joins is thus the key to efficient implementations of XML queries. Recentlyproposed node numbering schemes enable the capturing of the XML document structureusing traditional indices (such as B+-trees or R-trees). This paper proposes efficientstructural join algorithms in the presence of tag indices. We first concentrate on using B+-trees and show how to expedite a structural join by avoiding collections of elements that donot participate in the join. We then introduce an enhancement (based on sibling pointers) …,*,*,*

Temporal Aggregation with Range Predicates,Donghui Zhang; Alexander Markowetz; Vassilis Tsotras; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Bernhard Seeger,Abstract A temporal aggregation query is an important but costly operation for applicationsthat maintain time-evolving data (data warehouses; temporal databases; etc.). Due to thelarge volume of such data; performance improvements for temporal aggregation queries arecritical. Previous approaches have aggregate predicates that involve only the timedimension. In this paper we examine techniques to compute temporal aggregates thatinclude key-range predicates as well (range-temporal aggregates). In particular weconcentrate on the SUM aggregate; while COUNT is a special case. This problem is novel;to handle arbitrary key ranges; previous methods would need to keep a separate index forevery possible key range. We propose an approach based on a new index structure calledthe Multiversion SB-Tree; which incorporates features from both the SB-Tree and the …,*,*,*
Multidimensional Membership Queries for Temporal Databases,Lifei Tan; Vassilis J Tsotras; George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Consider a dynamic set of multidimensional objects S; that evolves over time. Atemporal membership query asks whether an object with given key attributes was in the setS at some time t. This paper provides efficient solutions to this temporal query. In particular;we present partially persistent extensions to (i) a hashing based scheme-the BANG file and(ii) the hB-tree. The performance of both methods is compared with a persistent R-tree andan ephemeral R tree. Our experiments show the efficiency of the proposed methods.,*,*,*

In thispaper; we examine the problem of supporting efficiently complex queries on multiversionedXML documents. Our approach relies on a scheme based on durable node numbers (DNNs)that preserve the order among the XML tree nodes and are invariantwith respect to updates.Using the document's DNNs various complex queries are reduced to combinations of partialversion retrieval queries. We examine three indexing schemes to efficiently evaluate partialversion retrieval queries in this environment. A thorough performance analysis is thenpresented to reveal the advantages of each scheme.,*,*,*
A Comparative Study of Version Management Schemes for XML Docu,Shu-Yao Chien; Vassilis J Tsotras; Carlo Zaniolo,Abstract The problem of managing multiple versions for XML documents and semistructureddata is of significant interest in many DB applications and web-related services. Traditionaldocument version control schemes; such as RCS; suffer from the following two problems. Atthe logical level; they conceal the structure of the documents by modeling them assequences of text lines; and storing a document's evolution as a line-edit script. At thephysical level; they can incur in severe storage or processing costs because of their inabilityto trade-off storage with computation. To solve these problems; we propose versionmanagement strategies that preserve the structure of the original document; and apply andextend DB techniques to minimize storage and processing costs. Therefore; we propose andcompare three schemes for XML version management; namely; the Usefulness-Based …,History,*,*
