Top-k query evaluation with probabilistic guarantees,Martin Theobald; Gerhard Weikum; Ralf Schenkel,Abstract Top-k queries based on ranking elements of multidimensional datasets are afundamental building block for many kinds of information discovery. The best known general-purpose algorithm for evaluating top-k queries is Fagin's threshold algorithm (TA). Since theuser's goal behind top-k queries is to identify one or a few relevant and novel data items; it isintriguing to use approximate variants of TA to reduce run-time costs. This paper introducesa family of approximate top-k algorithms based on probabilistic arguments. When scanningindex lists of the underlying multidimensional data space in descending order of localscores; various forms of convolution and derived bounds are employed to predict when it issafe; with high probability; to drop candidate items and to prune the index scans. Theprecision and the efficiency of the developed methods are experimentally evaluated …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,283
Fedx: Optimization techniques for federated query processing on linked data,Andreas Schwarte; Peter Haase; Katja Hose; Ralf Schenkel; Michael Schmidt,Abstract Motivated by the ongoing success of Linked Data and the growing amount ofsemantic data sources available on the Web; new challenges to query processing areemerging. Especially in distributed settings that require joining data provided by multiplesources; sophisticated optimization techniques are necessary for efficient query processing.We propose novel join processing and grouping techniques to minimize the number ofremote requests; and develop an effective solution for source selection in the absence ofpreprocessed metadata. We present FedX; a practical framework that enables efficientSPARQL query processing on heterogeneous; virtually integrated Linked Data sources. Inexperiments; we demonstrate the practicability and efficiency of our framework on a set ofreal-world queries and data sources from the Linked Open Data cloud.

Efficient top-k querying over social-tagging networks,Ralf Schenkel; Tom Crecelius; Mouna Kacimi; Sebastian Michel; Thomas Neumann; Josiane X Parreira; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract Online communities have become popular for publishing and searching content; aswell as for finding and connecting to other users. User-generated content includes; forexample; personal blogs; bookmarks; and digital photos. These items can be annotated andrated by different users; and these social tags and derived user-specific scores can beleveraged for searching relevant content and discovering subjectively interesting items.Moreover; the relationships among users can also be taken into consideration for rankingsearch results; the intuition being that you trust the recommendations of your close friendsmore than those of your casual acquaintances. Queries for tag or keyword combinations thatcompute and rank the top-k results thus face a large variety of options that complicate thequery processing and pose efficiency challenges. This paper addresses these issues by …,Proceedings of the 31st annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2008,180
An efficient and versatile query engine for TopX search,Martin Theobald; Ralf Schenkel; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract This paper presents a novel engine; coined TopX; for efficient ranked retrieval ofXML documents over semistructured but nonschematic data collections. The algorithmfollows the paradigm of threshold algorithms for top-k query processing with a focus oninexpensive sequential accesses to index lists and only a few judiciously scheduled randomaccesses. The difficulties in applying the existing top-k algorithms to XML data lie in 1) theneed to consider scores for XML elements while aggregating them at the document level; 2)the combination of vague content conditions with XML path conditions; 3) the need to relaxquery conditions if too few results satisfy all conditions; and 4) the selectivity estimation forboth content and structure conditions and their impact on evaluation strategies. TopXaddresses these issues by precomputing score and path information in an appropriately …,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,174
HOPI: An efficient connection index for complex XML document collections,Ralf Schenkel; Anja Theobald; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract In this paper we present HOPI; a new connection index for XML documents basedon the concept of the 2–hop cover of a directed graph introduced by Cohen et al. In contrastto most of the prior work on XML indexing we consider not only paths with child or parentrelationships between the nodes; but also provide space–and time–efficient reachabilitytests along the ancestor; descendant; and link axes to support path expressions withwildcards in our XXL search engine. We improve the theoretical concept of a 2–hop cover bydeveloping scalable methods for index creation on very large XML data collections with longpaths and extensive cross–linkage. Our experiments show substantial savings in the queryperformance of the HOPI index over previously proposed index structures in combinationwith low space requirements.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2004,168
Io-top-k: Index-access optimized top-k query processing,Holger Bast; Debapriyo Majumdar; Ralf Schenkel; Martin Theobald; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract Top-k query processing is an important building block for ranked retrieval; withapplications ranging from text and data integration to distributed aggregation of network logsand sensor data. Top-k queries operate on index lists for a query's elementary conditionsand aggregate scores for result candidates. One of the best implementation methods in thissetting is the family of threshold algorithms; which aim to terminate the index scans as earlyas possible based on lower and upper bounds for the final scores of result candidates. Thisprocedure performs sequential disk accesses for sorted index scans; but also has the optionof performing random accesses to resolve score uncertainty. This entails scheduling for thetwo kinds of accesses: 1) the prioritization of different index lists in the sequential accesses;and 2) the decision on when to perform random accesses and for which candidates.

The SphereSearch engine for unified ranked retrieval of heterogeneous XML and web documents,Jens Graupmann; Ralf Schenkel; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract This paper presents the novel SphereSearch Engine that provides unified rankedretrieval on heterogeneous XML and Web data. Its search capabilities include vaguestructure conditions; text content conditions; and relevance ranking based on IR statisticsand statistically quantified ontological relationships. Web pages in HTML or PDF areautomatically converted into XML format; with the option of generating semantic tags bymeans of linguistic annotation tools. For Web data the XML-oriented query engine isleveraged to provide very rich search options that cannot be expressed in traditional Websearch engines: concept-aware and link-aware querying that takes into account the implicitstructure and context of Web pages. The benefits of the SphereSearch engine aredemonstrated by experiments with a large and richly tagged but non-schematic open …,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,126

YAWN: A Semantically Annotated Wikipedia XML Corpus.,Ralf Schenkel; Fabian M Suchanek; Gjergji Kasneci,Abstract: The paper presents YAWN; a system to convert the well-known and widely usedWikipedia collection into an XML corpus with semantically rich; self-explaining tags. Weintroduce algorithms to annotate pages and links with concepts from the WordNet thesaurus.This annotation process exploits categorical information in Wikipedia; which is a high-quality; manually assigned source of information; extracts additional information from lists;and utilizes the invocations of templates with named parameters. We give examples howsuch annotations can be exploited for high-precision queries.,BTW,2007,116
TopX: efficient and versatile top-k query processing for semistructured data,Martin Theobald; Holger Bast; Debapriyo Majumdar; Ralf Schenkel; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract Recent IR extensions to XML query languages such as Xpath 1.0 Full-Text or theNEXI query language of the INEX benchmark series reflect the emerging interest in IR-styleranked retrieval over semistructured data. TopX is a top-k retrieval engine for text andsemistructured data. It terminates query execution as soon as it can safely determine the ktop-ranked result elements according to a monotonic score aggregation function withrespect to a multidimensional query. It efficiently supports vague search on both content-andstructure-oriented query conditions for dynamic query relaxation with controllable influenceon the result ranking. The main contributions of this paper unfold into four main points:(1)fully implemented models and algorithms for ranked XML retrieval with XPath Full-Textfunctionality;(2) efficient and effective top-k query processing for semistructured data;(3) …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2008,109
Exploiting social relations for query expansion and result ranking,Matthias Bender; Tom Crecelius; Mouna Kacimi; Sebastian Michel; Thomas Neumann; Josiane Xavier Parreira; Ralf Schenkel; Gerhard Weikum,Online communities have recently become a popular tool for publishing and searchingcontent; as well as for finding and connecting to other users that share common interests.The content is typically user-generated and includes; for example; personal blogs;bookmarks; and digital photos. A particularly intriguing type of content is user-generatedannotations (tags) for content items; as these concise string descriptions allow forreasonings about the interests of the user who created the content; but also about the userwho generated the annotations. This paper presents a framework to cast the different entitiesof such networks into a unified graph model representing the mutual relationships of users;content; and tags. It derives scoring functions for each of the entities and relations. We haveperformed an experimental evaluation on two real-world datasets (crawled from deli. cio …,Data engineering workshop; 2008.

Rankreduce-processing k-nearest neighbor queries on top of mapreduce,Aleksandar Stupar; Sebastian Michel; Ralf Schenkel,ABSTRACT We consider the problem of processing K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) queries overlarge datasets where the index is jointly maintained by a set of machines in a computingcluster. The proposed RankReduce approach uses locality sensitive hashing (LSH) togetherwith a MapReduce implementation; which by design is a perfect match as the hashingprinciple of LSH can be smoothly integrated in the mapping phase of MapReduce. The LSHalgorithm assigns similar objects to the same fragments in the distributed file system whichenables a effective selection of potential candidate neighbors which get then reduced to theset of K-Nearest Neighbors. We address problems arising due to the different characteristicsof MapReduce and LSH to achieve an efficient search process on the one hand and highLSH accuracy on the other hand. We discuss several pitfalls and detailed descriptions on …,Proceedings of the 8th Workshop on Large-Scale Distributed Systems for Information Retrieval,2010,92
Language-model-based ranking for queries on RDF-graphs,Shady Elbassuoni; Maya Ramanath; Ralf Schenkel; Marcin Sydow; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract The success of knowledge-sharing communities like Wikipedia and the advances inautomatic information extraction from textual and Web sources have made it possible tobuild large" knowledge repositories" such as DBpedia; Freebase; and YAGO. Thesecollections can be viewed as graphs of entities and relationships (ER graphs) and can berepresented as a set of subject-property-object (SPO) triples in the Semantic-Web datamodel RDF. Queries can be expressed in the W3C-endorsed SPARQL language or bysimilarly designed graph-pattern search. However; exact-match query semantics often fallshort of satisfying the users' needs by returning too many or too few results. Therefore; IR-style ranking models are crucially needed. In this paper; we propose a language-model-based approach to ranking the results of exact; relaxed and keyword-augmented graph …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,86
Exploiting Structure; Annotation; and Ontological Knowledge for Automatic Classification of XML Data.,Martin Theobald; Ralf Schenkel; Gerhard Weikum,ABSTRACT This paper investigates how to automatically classify schemaless XML data intoa user-defined topic directory. The main focus is on constructing appropriate feature spaceson which a classifier operates. In addition to the usual text-based term frequency vectors; westudy XML twigs and tag paths as extended features that can be combined with text termoccurrences in XML elements. Moreover; we show how to leverage ontological backgroundinformation; more specifically; the WordNet thesaurus; for the construction of moreexpressive feature spaces. For efficiency our implementation computes featuresincrementally and caches ontology entries. Our experiments demonstrate the improvedaccuracy of automatic classification based on the enhanced feature spaces.,WebDB,2003,86
Efficient and self-tuning incremental query expansion for top-k query processing,Martin Theobald; Ralf Schenkel; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract We present a novel approach for efficient and self-tuning query expansion that isembedded into a top-k query processor with candidate pruning. Traditional query expansionmethods select expansion terms whose thematic similarity to the original query terms isabove some specified threshold; thus generating a disjunctive query with much higherdimensionality. This poses three major problems: 1) the need for hand-tuning the expansionthreshold; 2) the potential topic dilution with overly aggressive expansion; and 3) thedrastically increased execution cost of a high-dimensional query. The method developed inthis paper addresses all three problems by dynamically and incrementally merging theinverted lists for the potential expansion terms with the lists for the original query terms. Apriority queue is used for maintaining result candidates; the pruning of candidates is …,Proceedings of the 28th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2005,82
Efficient text proximity search,Ralf Schenkel; Andreas Broschart; Seungwon Hwang; Martin Theobald; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract In addition to purely occurrence-based relevance models; term proximity has beenfrequently used to enhance retrieval quality of keyword-oriented retrieval systems. Whilethere have been approaches on effective scoring functions that incorporate proximity; therehas not been much work on algorithms or access methods for their efficient evaluation. Thispaper presents an efficient evaluation framework including a proximity scoring functionintegrated within a top-k query engine for text retrieval. We propose precomputed andmaterialized index structures that boost performance. The increased retrieval effectivenessand efficiency of our framework are demonstrated through extensive experiments on a verylarge text benchmark collection. In combination with static index pruning for the proximitylists; our algorithm achieves an improvement of two orders of magnitude compared to a …,International Symposium on String Processing and Information Retrieval,2007,74
FedX: a federation layer for distributed query processing on linked open data,Andreas Schwarte; Peter Haase; Katja Hose; Ralf Schenkel; Michael Schmidt,Abstract Driven by the success of the Linked Open Data initiative today's Semantic Web isbest characterized as a Web of interlinked datasets. Hand in hand with this structure newchallenges to query processing are arising. Especially queries for which more than one datasource can contribute results require advanced optimization and evaluation approaches; themajor challenge lying in the nature of distribution: Heterogenous data sources have to beintegrated into a federation to globally appear as a single repository. On the query level;though; techniques have to be developed to meet the requirements of efficient querycomputation in the distributed setting. We present FedX; a project which extends theSesame Framework with a federation layer that enables efficient query processing ondistributed Linked Open Data sources.

Overview of the INEX 2009 ad hoc track,Shlomo Geva; Jaap Kamps; Miro Lethonen; Ralf Schenkel; James A Thom; Andrew Trotman,Abstract This paper gives an overview of the INEX 2009 Ad Hoc Track. The main goals of theAd Hoc Track were three-fold. The first goal was to investigate the impact of the collectionscale and markup; by using a new collection that is again based on a the Wikipedia but isover 4 times larger; with longer articles and additional semantic annotations. For this reasonthe Ad Hoc track tasks stayed unchanged; and the Thorough Task of INEX 2002–2006returns. The second goal was to study the impact of more verbose queries on retrievaleffectiveness; by using the available markup as structural constraints—now using both theWikipedia's layout-based markup; as well as the enriched semantic markup—and by the useof phrases. The third goal was to compare different result granularities by allowing systemsto retrieve XML elements; ranges of XML elements; or arbitrary passages of text.

Searching RDF Graphs with SPARQL and Keywords.,Shady Elbassuoni; Maya Ramanath; Ralf Schenkel; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract The proliferation of knowledge-sharing communities like Wikipedia and theadvances in automated information extraction from Web pages enable the construction oflarge knowledge bases with facts about entities and their relationships. The facts can berepresented in the RDF data model; as so-called subject-property-object triples; and canthus be queried by structured query languages like SPARQL. In principle; this allows precisequerying in the database spirit. However; RDF data may be highly diverse and queries mayreturn way too many results; so that ranking by informativeness measures is crucial to avoidoverwhelming users. Moreover; as facts are extracted from textual contexts or havecommunity-provided annotations; it can be beneficial to consider also,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2010,59
Social Wisdom for Search and Recommendation.,Ralf Schenkel; Tom Crecelius; Mouna Kacimi; Thomas Neumann; Josiane Xavier Parreira; Marc Spaniol; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract Social-tagging communities offer great potential for smart recommendation and“socially enhanced” searchresult ranking. Beyond traditional forms of collaborativerecommendation that are based on the item-user matrix of the entire community; a specificopportunity of social communities is to reflect the different degrees of friendships and mutualtrust; in addition to the behavioral similarities among users. This paper presents a frameworkfor harnessing such social relations for search and recommendation. The framework isimplemented in the SENSE prototype system; and its usefulness is demonstrated inexperiments with an excerpt of the librarything community data.,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2008,49
Partout: a distributed engine for efficient RDF processing,Luis Galárraga; Katja Hose; Ralf Schenkel,Abstract The increasing interest in Semantic Web technologies has led not only to a rapidgrowth of semantic data on the Web but also to an increasing number of backendapplications relying on efficient query processing. Confronted with such a trend; existingcentralized state-of-the-art systems for storing RDF and processing SPARQL queries are nolonger sufficient. In this paper; we introduce Partout; a distributed engine for fast RDFprocessing in a cluster of machines. We propose an effective approach for fragmenting RDFdata sets based on a query log and allocating the fragments to hosts in a cluster ofmachines. Furthermore; Partout's query optimizer produces efficient query execution plansfor ad-hoc SPARQL queries.,Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on World Wide Web,2014,48
Structural feedback for keyword-based XML retrieval,Ralf Schenkel; Martin Theobald,Abstract Keyword-based queries are an important means to retrieve information from XMLcollections with unknown or complex schemas. Relevance Feedback integrates relevanceinformation provided by a user to enhance retrieval quality. For keyword-based XMLqueries; feedback engines usually generate an expanded keyword query from the content ofelements marked as relevant or nonrelevant. This approach that is inspired by text-based IRcompletely ignores the semistructured nature of XML. This paper makes the important stepfrom pure content-based to structural feedback. It presents a framework that expands akeyword query into a full-fledged content-and-structure query. Extensive experiments withthe established INEX benchmark and our TopX search engine show the feasibility of ourapproach.,European Conference on Information Retrieval,2006,48
WARP: Workload-aware replication and partitioning for RDF,Katja Hose; Ralf Schenkel,With the increasing popularity of the Semantic Web; more and more data becomes availablein RDF with SPARQL as a query language. Data sets; however; can become too big to bemanaged and queried on a single server in a scalable way. Existing distributed RDF storesapproach this problem using data partitioning; aiming at limiting the communication betweenservers and exploiting parallelism. This paper proposes a distributed SPARQL engine thatcombines a graph partitioning technique with workload-aware replication of triples acrosspartitions; enabling efficient query execution even for complex queries from the workload.Furthermore; it discusses query optimization techniques for producing efficient executionplans for ad-hoc queries not contained in the workload.,Data Engineering Workshops (ICDEW); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,47
Overview of the INEX 2010 ad hoc track,Paavo Arvola; Shlomo Geva; Jaap Kamps; Ralf Schenkel; Andrew Trotman; Johanna Vainio,Abstract This paper gives an overview of the INEX 2010 Ad Hoc Track. The main goals of theAd Hoc Track were three-fold. The first goal was to study focused retrieval under resourcerestricted conditions such as a small screen mobile device or a document summary on a hit-list. This leads to variants of the focused retrieval tasks that address the impact of resultlength/reading effort; thinking of focused retrieval as a form of “snippet” retrieval. The secondgoal was to extend the ad hoc retrieval test collection on the INEX 2009 Wikipedia Collectionwith additional topics and judgments. For this reason the Ad Hoc track topics andassessments stayed unchanged. The third goal was to examine the trade-off betweeneffectiveness and efficiency by continuing the Efficiency Track as a task in the Ad Hoc Track.The INEX 2010 Ad Hoc Track featured four tasks: the Relevant in Context Task; the …,International Workshop of the Initiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval,2010,47
Semantic similarity search on semistructured data with the XXL search engine,Ralf Schenkel; Anja Theobald; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract Query languages for XML such as XPath or XQuery support Boolean retrieval: aquery result is a (possibly restructured) subset of XML elements or entire documents thatsatisfy the search conditions of the query. This search paradigm works for highly schematicXML data collections such as electronic catalogs. However; for searching information inopen environments such as the Web or intranets of large corporations; ranked retrieval ismore appropriate: a query result is a ranked list of XML elements in descending order of(estimated) relevance. Web search engines; which are based on the ranked retrievalparadigm; do; however; not consider the additional information and rich annotationsprovided by the structure of XML documents and their element names.

Federated transaction management with snapshot isolation,Ralf Schenkel; Gerhard Weikum; Norbert Weißenberg; Xuequn Wu,Abstract Federated transaction management (also known as multidatabase transactionmanagement in the literature) is needed to ensure the consistency of data that is distributedacross multiple; largely autonomous; and possibly heterogeneous component databasesand accessed by both global and local transactions. While the global atomicity of suchtransactions can be enforced by using a standardized commit protocol like XA or its CORBAcounterpart OTS; global serializability is not self-guaranteed as the underlying componentsystems may use a variety of potentially incompatible local concurrency control protocols.The problem of how to achieve global serializability; by either constraining the componentsystems or implementing additional global protocols at the federation level; has beenintensively studied in the literature; but did not have much impact on the practical side.

Feedback-driven structural query expansion for ranked retrieval of XML data,Ralf Schenkel; Martin Theobald,Abstract Relevance Feedback is an important way to enhance retrieval quality by integratingrelevance information provided by a user. In XML retrieval; feedback engines usuallygenerate an expanded query from the content of elements marked as relevant ornonrelevant. This approach that is inspired by text-based IR completely ignores thesemistructured nature of XML. This paper makes the important step from content-based tostructural feedback. It presents an integrated solution for expanding keyword queries withnew content; path; and document constraints. An extensible framework evaluates suchquery conditions with existing keyword-based XML search engines while allowing to easilyintegrate new dimensions of feedback. Extensive experiments with the established INEXbenchmark show the feasibility of our approach.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,43

The notion of diversity in graphical entity summarisation on semantic knowledge graphs,Marcin Sydow; Mariusz Pikuła; Ralf Schenkel,Abstract Given an entity represented by a single node q in semantic knowledge graph D; theGraphical Entity Summarisation problem (GES) consists in selecting out of D a very smallsurrounding graph S that constitutes a generic summary of the information concerning theentity q with given limit on size of S. This article concerns the role of diversity in this quitenovel problem. It gives an overview of the diversity concept in information retrieval; andproposes how to adapt it to GES. A measure of diversity for GES; called ALC; is defined andtwo algorithms presented; baseline; diversity-oblivious PRECIS and diversity-awareDIVERSUM.

Best-effort top-k query processing under budgetary constraints,Michal Shmueli-Scheuer; Chen Li; Yosi Mass; Haggai Roitman; Ralf Schenkel; Gerhard Weikum,We consider a novel problem of top-k query processing under budget constraints. Weprovide both a framework and a set of algorithms to address this problem. Existingalgorithms for top-k processing are budget-oblivious; ie; they do not take budget constraintsinto account when making scheduling decisions; but focus on the performance to computethe final top-k results. Under budget constraints; these algorithms therefore often returnresults that are a lot worse than the results that can be achieved with a clever; budget-awarescheduling algorithm. This paper introduces novel algorithms for budget-aware top-kprocessing that produce results that have a significantly higher quality than those of state-of-the-art budget-oblivious solutions.,Data Engineering; 2009.

Index maintenance for time-travel text search,Avishek Anand; Srikanta Bedathur; Klaus Berberich; Ralf Schenkel,Abstract Time-travel text search enriches standard text search by temporal predicates; sothat users of web archives can easily retrieve document versions that are consideredrelevant to a given keyword query and existed during a given time interval. Different indexstructures have been proposed to efficiently support time-travel text search. None of them;however; can easily be updated as the Web evolves and new document versions are addedto the web archive. In this work; we describe a novel index structure that efficiently supportstime-travel text search and can be maintained incrementally as new document versions areadded to the web archive. Our solution uses a sharded index organization; bounds thenumber of spuriously read index entries per shard; and can be maintained using small in-memory buffers and append-only operations.

Towards benefit-based RDF source selection for SPARQL queries,Katja Hose; Ralf Schenkel,Abstract The Linked Data cloud consists of a great variety of data provided by an increasingnumber of sources. Selecting relevant sources is therefore a core ingredient of efficientquery processing. So far; this is either done with additional indexes or by iterativelyperforming lookups for relevant URIs. None of the existing methods takes additional aspectsinto account such as the degree of overlap between the sources; resulting in unnecessaryrequests. In this paper; we propose a sketch-based query routing strategy that takes sourceoverlap into account. The proposed strategy uses sketches and can be tuned towards eitherretrieving as many results as possible for a given budget or minimizing the number ofrequests necessary to retrieve all or a certain fraction of the results. Our experiments showsignificant improvements over state-of-the-art but overlap-ignorant methods for source …,Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Semantic Web Information Management,2012,23
Temporal index sharding for space-time efficiency in archive search,Avishek Anand; Srikanta Bedathur; Klaus Berberich; Ralf Schenkel,Abstract Time-travel queries that couple temporal constraints with keyword queries areuseful in searching large-scale archives of time-evolving content such as the web archivesor wikis. Typical approaches for efficient evaluation of these queries involve slicing either theentire collection [20] or individual index lists [10] along the time-axis. Both these methods arenot satisfactory since they sacrifice compactness of index for processing efficiency makingthem either too big or; otherwise; too slow. We present a novel index organization schemethat shards each index list with almost zero increase in index size but still minimizes the costof reading index entries during query processing. Based on the optimal sharding thusbtained; we develop a practically efficient sharding that takes into account the different costsof random and sequential accesses. Our algorithm merges shards from the optimal …,Proceedings of the 34th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in Information Retrieval,2011,23
Distributed top-k aggregation queries at large,Thomas Neumann; Matthias Bender; Sebastian Michel; Ralf Schenkel; Peter Triantafillou; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract Top-k query processing is a fundamental building block for efficient ranking in alarge number of applications. Efficiency is a central issue; especially for distributed settings;when the data is spread across different nodes in a network. This paper introduces noveloptimization methods for top-k aggregation queries in such distributed environments. Theoptimizations can be applied to all algorithms that fall into the frameworks of the prior TPUTand KLEE methods. The optimizations address three degrees of freedom: 1) hierarchicallygrouping input lists into top-k operator trees and optimizing the tree structure; 2) computingdata-adaptive scan depths for different input sources; and 3) data-adaptive sampling of asmall subset of input sources in scenarios with hundreds or thousands of query-relevantnetwork nodes. All optimizations are based on a statistical cost model that utilizes local …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2009,23
Efficient temporal keyword search over versioned text,Avishek Anand; Srikanta Bedathur; Klaus Berberich; Ralf Schenkel,Abstract Modern text analytics applications operate on large volumes of temporal text datasuch as Web archives; newspaper archives; blogs; wikis; and micro-blogs. In these settings;searching and mining needs to use constraints on the time dimension in addition to keywordconstraints. A natural approach to address such queries is using an inverted index whoseentries are enriched with valid-time intervals. It has been shown that these indexes have tobe partitioned along time in order to achieve efficiency. However; when the temporalpredicate corresponds to a long time range; requiring the processing of multiple partitions;naive query processing incurs high cost of reading of redundant entries across partitions.We present a framework for efficient approximate processing of keyword queries over atemporally partitioned inverted index which minimizes this overhead; thus speeding up …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,22
GeoSphereSearch: Context-Aware Geographic Web Search.,Jens Graupmann; Ralf Schenkel,ABSTRACT This paper presents the GeoSphereSearch engine for contextaware geographicqueries on the Web. It facilitates the formulation of geographic queries and the visualpresentation of discrete or aggregated query results in an intuitive manner. In contrast toother approaches it does not assign geographic footprints to documents; but considerscontext-aware geographic information on the fly; allowing a fine-grained query evaluation onthe level of document fragments; not complete documents.,GIR,2006,20
Towards a statistically semantic web,Gerhard Weikum; Jens Graupmann; Ralf Schenkel; Martin Theobald,Abstract The envisioned Semantic Web aims to provide richly annotated and explicitlystructured Web pages in XML; RDF; or description logics; based upon underlying ontologiesand thesauri. Ideally; this should enable a wealth of query processing and semanticreasoning capabilities using XQuery and logical inference engines. However; we believethat the diversity and uncertainty of terminologies and schema-like annotations will makeprecise querying on a Web scale extremely elusive if not hopeless; and the same argumentholds for large-scale dynamic federations of Deep Web sources. Therefore; ontology-basedreasoning and querying needs to be enhanced by statistical means; leading to relevance-ranked lists as query results. This paper presents steps towards such a “statisticallysemantic” Web and outlines technical challenges. We discuss how statistically quantified …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2004,19
Ontology-enabled XML search,Ralf Schenkel; Anja Theobald; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract XML is rapidly evolving towards the standard for data integration and exchangeover the Internet and within intranets; covering the complete spectrum from largelyunstructured; ad hoc documents to highly structured; schematic data. However; establishedXML query languages like XML-QL [96] or XQuery [34] cannot cope with the rapid growth ofinformation in open environments such as the Web or intranets of large corporations; as theyare bound to boolean retrieval and do not provide any relevance ranking for the (typicallynumerous) results. Recent approaches such as XIRQL [128] or our own system XXL [295;296] that are driven by techniques from information retrieval overcome the latter problem byconsidering the relevance of each potential hit for the query and returning the results in aranked order; using similarity measures like the cosine measure. But they are still tied to …,*,2003,19

EverLast: a distributed architecture for preserving the web,Avishek Anand; Srikanta Bedathur; Klaus Berberich; Ralf Schenkel; Christos Tryfonopoulos,Abstract The World Wide Web has become a key source of knowledge pertaining to almostevery walk of life. Unfortunately; much of data on the Web is highly ephemeral in nature; withmore than 50-80% of content estimated to be changing within a short time. Continuing thepioneering efforts of many national (digital) libraries; organizations such as the InternationalInternet Preservation Consortium (IIPC); the Internet Archive (IA) and the European Archive(EA) have been tirelessly working towards preserving the ever changing Web. However;while these web archiving efforts have paid significant attention towards long termpreservation of Web data; they have paid little attention to developing an global-scaleinfrastructure for collecting; archiving; and performing historical analyzes on the collecteddata.

Query refinement by relevance feedback in an XML retrieval system,Hanglin Pan; Anja Theobald; Ralf Schenkel,Abstract In recent years; ranked retrieval systems for heterogeneous XML data with bothstructural search conditions and keyword conditions have been developed for digitallibraries; federations of scientific data repositories; and hopefully portions of the ultimateWeb. These systems; such as XXL [2]; are based on pre-defined similarity measures foratomic conditions (using index structures on contents; paths and ontological relationships)and then use rank aggregation techniques to produce ranked result lists. An ontology canplay a positive role for term expansion [2]; by improving the average precision and recall inthe INEX 2003 benchmark [3]. Due to the users' lack of information on the structure andterminology of the underlying diverse data sources; and the complexity of the (powerful)query language; users can often not avoid posing overly broad or overly narrow initial …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2004,17

Automatic query refinement using mined semantic relations,Jens Graupmann; Jun Cai; Ralf Schenkel,With the Web of today being unstructured and semantically heterogeneous; keyword-basedqueries are likely to miss important results. Therefore; refining and expanding queries playsan important role today. This paper presents a novel approach for query expansion thatapplies dependency rules mined from a large Web crawl; combining several existingtechniques for data extraction and mining. Additionally; the rules help binding keywordqueries to the input fields of forms on Web portals; opening up the tremendous resources ofthe hidden Web.

High-performance processing of text queries with tunable pruned term and term pair indexes,Andreas Broschart; Ralf Schenkel,Abstract Term proximity scoring is an established means in information retrieval forimproving result quality of full-text queries. Integrating such proximity scores into efficientquery processing; however; has not been equally well studied. Existing methods make useof precomputed lists of documents where tuples of terms; usually pairs; occur together;usually incurring a huge index size compared to term-only indexes. This article introduces ajoint framework for trading off index size and result quality; and provides optimizationtechniques for tuning precomputed indexes towards either maximal result quality or maximalquery processing performance under controlled result quality; given an upper bound for theindex size. The framework allows to selectively materialize lists for pairs based on a querylog to further reduce index size.

ROXXI: Reviving witness dOcuments to eXplore eXtracted Information,Shady Elbassuoni; Katja Hose; Steffen Metzger; Ralf Schenkel,Abstract In recent years; there has been considerable research on information extractionand constructing RDF knowledge bases. In general; the goal is to extract all relevantinformation from a corpus of documents; store it into an ontology; and answer future queriesbased only on the created knowledge base. Thus; the original documents becomedispensable. On the one hand; an ontology is a convenient and non-redundant structuredsource of information; based on which specific queries can be answered efficiently. On theother hand; many users doubt the correctness of facts and ontology subgraphs presented tothem as query results without proof. Instead; users often wish to verify the obtained facts orsubgraphs by reading about them in context; ie; in a document relating the facts andproviding background information.

S3K: seeking statement-supporting top-K witnesses,Steffen Metzger; Shady Elbassuoni; Katja Hose; Ralf Schenkel,Abstract Traditional information retrieval techniques based on keyword search help toidentify a ranked set of relevant documents; which often contains many documents in the topranks that do not meet the user's intention. By considering the semantics of the keywordsand their relationships; both precision and recall can be improved. Using an ontology andmapping keywords to entities/concepts and identifying the relationship between them thatthe user is interested in; allows for retrieving documents that actually meet the user'sintention. In this paper; we present a framework that enables semantic-aware documentretrieval. User queries are mapped to semantic statements based on entities and theirrelationships.

Temporal knowledge for timely intelligence,Gerhard Weikum; Srikanta Bedathur; Ralf Schenkel,Abstract Knowledge bases about entities and their relationships are a great asset forbusiness intelligence. Major advances in information extraction and the proliferation ofknowledge-sharing communities like Wikipedia have enabled ways for the largelyautomated construction of rich knowledge bases. Such knowledge about entity-orientedfacts can greatly improve the output quality and possibly also efficiency of processingbusiness-relevant documents and event logs. This holds for information within the enterpriseas well as in Web communities such as blogs. However; no knowledge base will ever befully complete and real-world knowledge is continuously changing: new facts supersede oldfacts; knowledge grows in various dimensions; and completely new classes; relation types;or knowledge structures will arise.

XXL@ INEX 2003,Ralf Schenkel; Anja Theobald; Gerhard Weikum,ABSTRACT Information retrieval on XML combines retrieval on content data (element andattribute values) with retrieval on structural data (element and attribute names). Standardquery languages for XML such as XPath or XQuery support Boolean retrieval: a query resultis a (possibly restructured) subset of XML elements or entire documents that satisfy thesearch conditions of the query. Such search conditions consist of regular path expressionsincluding wildcards for paths of arbitrary length and boolean content conditions. Wedeveloped a flexible XML search language called XXL for probabilistic ranked retrieval onXML data. XXL offers a special operator'∼'for specifying semantic similarity searchconditions on element names as well as element values.

Pay-as-you-go maintenance of precomputed nearest neighbors in large graphs,Tom Crecelius; Ralf Schenkel,Abstract An important building block of many graph applications such as searching in socialnetworks; keyword search in graphs; and retrieval of linked documents is retrieving thetransitive neighbors of a node in ascending order of their distances. Since large graphscannot be kept in memory and graph traversals at query time would be prohibitivelyexpensive; the list of neighbors for each node is usually precomputed and stored in acompact form. While the problem of precomputing all-pairs shortest distances has been wellstudied for decades; efficiently maintaining this information when the graph changes is notas well understood. This paper presents an algorithm for maintaining nearest neighbor listsin weighted graphs under node insertions and decreasing edge weights.

Optimizing distributed top-k queries,Thomas Neumann; Matthias Bender; Sebastian Michel; Ralf Schenkel; Peter Triantafillou; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract Top-k query processing is a fundamental building block for efficient ranking in alarge number of applications. Efficiency is a central issue; especially for distributed settings;when the data is spread across different nodes in a network. This paper introduces noveloptimization methods for top-k aggregation queries in such distributed environments thatcan be applied to all algorithms that fall into the frameworks of the prior TPUT and KLEEmethods. The optimizations address 1) hierarchically grouping input lists into top-k operatortrees and optimizing the tree structure; and 2) computing data-adaptive scan depths fordifferent input sources.

In XML retrieval; existing feedback enginesusually generate an expanded keyword query from the content of el- ements marked as relevantor nonrelevant.

TopX: efficient and versatile top-k query processing for text; structured; and semistructured data,Martin Theobald,TopX is a top-k retrieval engine for text and XML data. Unlike Boolean engines; it stopsquery processing as soon as it can safely determine the k top-ranked result objectsaccording to a monotonous score aggregation function with respect to a multidimensionalquery. The main contributions of the thesis unfold into four main points; confirmed byprevious publications at international conferences or workshops:• Top-k query processingwith probabilistic guarantees.• Index-access optimized top-k query processing.• Dynamicand self-tuning; incremental query expansion for top-k query processing.• Efficient supportfor ranked XML retrieval and full-text search. Our experiments demonstrate the viability andimproved efficiency of our approach compared to existing related work for a broad variety ofretrieval scenarios.,*,2006,6
Classification and focused crawling for semistructured data,Martin Theobald; Ralf Schenkel; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract Despite the great advances in XML data management and querying; the currentlyprevalent XPath-or XQuery-centric approaches face severe limitations when applied to XMLdocuments in large intranets; digital libraries; federations of scientific data repositories; andultimately the Web. In such environments; data has much more diverse structure andannotations than in a business-data setting and there is virtually no hope for a commonschema or DTD that all the data complies with. Without a schema; however; databasestylequerying would often produce either empty result sets; namely; when queries are overlyspecific; or way too many results; namely; when search predicates are overly broad; thelatter being the result of the user not knowing enough about the structure and annotations ofthe data.,*,2003,6

Temporal shingling for version identification in web archives,Ralf Schenkel,Abstract Building and preserving archives of the evolving Web has been an importantproblem in research. Given the huge volume of content that is added or updated daily;identifying the right versions of pages to store in the archive is an important building block ofany large-scale archival system. This paper presents temporal shingling; an extension of thewell-established shingling technique for measuring how similar two snapshots of a pageare. This novel method considers the lifespan of shingles to differentiate between importantupdates that should be archived and transient changes that may be ignored. Extensiveexperiments demonstrate the tradeoff between archive size and version coverage; and showthat the novel method yields better archive coverage at smaller sizes than existingtechniques.,European Conference on Information Retrieval,2010,5
Overview of the INEX 2009 efficiency track,Ralf Schenkel; Martin Theobald,Abstract This paper presents an overview of the Efficiency Track that was run for the secondtime in 2009. This track is intended to provide a common forum for the evaluation of both theeffectiveness and efficiency of XML ranked retrieval approaches on real data and realqueries. The Efficiency Track significantly extends the Ad-Hoc Track by systematicallyinvestigating different types of queries and retrieval scenarios; such as classic ad-hocsearch; high-dimensional query expansion settings; and queries with a deeply nestedstructure (with all topics being available in both the NEXI-style CO and CAS formulations; aswell as in their XPath 2.0 Full-Text counterparts). The track received 68 runs submitted by 4participating groups using 5 different systems.

Evaluating the potential of explicit phrases for retrieval quality,Andreas Broschart; Klaus Berberich; Ralf Schenkel,Abstract This paper evaluates the potential impact of explicit phrases on retrieval qualitythrough a case study with the TREC Terabyte benchmark. It compares the performance ofuser-and system-identified phrases with a standard score and a proximity-aware score; andshows that an optimal choice of phrases; including term permutations; can significantlyimprove query performance.,European Conference on Information Retrieval,2010,4
Index tuning for efficient proximity-enhanced query processing,Andreas Broschart; Ralf Schenkel,Abstract Scoring models that make use of proximity information usually improve resultquality in text retrieval. Considering that index structures carrying proximity information cangrow huge in size if they are not pruned; it is helpful to tune indexes towards spacerequirements and retrieval quality. This paper elaborates on our approach used for INEX2009 to tune index structures for different choices of result size k. Our best tuned indexstructures provide the best CPU times for type A queries among the Efficiency Trackparticipants; still providing at least BM25 retrieval quality. Due to the number of query terms;Type B queries cannot be processed equally performant. To allow for comparison as toretrieval quality with non-pruned index structures; we also depict our results from the AdhocTrack.,International Workshop of the Initiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval,2009,4

The light-weight semantic web: Integrating information extraction and information retrieval for heterogeneous environments,Jens Graupmann; Ralf Schenkel,ABSTRACT Today's Web; large intranets and even the documents collected by a single userare enormous sources of distributed; heterogeneous information that cannot be easilymastered. Syntactical and semantical differences as well as missing semantic annotationsmake effective query evaluation on such corpora a hard task. The Semantic Web aims atproviding a standard for semantic annotations; but has not yet made large progress in thereal world. This paper presents a light-weight version of the Semantic Web. We advocate theuse of Information Extraction tools to automatically detect and annotate important classes ofinformation that are frequently used in queries; like locations and dates. We propose a querylanguage that can exploit the extra annotations and allows novel range and join conditions.,ACM SIGIR 2005 Workshop on Heterogeneous and Distributed Information Retrieval (HDIR 2005),2005,4

MCM-36 materials pillared with (mixed) oxides such as SiO 2; Al 2O 3; MgO-Al 2 O 3; and MgO-Al 2 O 3-SiO 2; exhibit widely varying acid-base properties.Methanol is associatively adsorbed on Brønsted acid sites in the zeolitic micropores andassociatively and dissociatively on acid and base sites in the mesopores. Lewis acid/basesites are responsible for dissociative adsorption. Stable formates were only formed uponheating MgO-Al 2 O 3-MCM-36 saturated with methanol.,*,2004,4
Ranking under tight budgets,Christian Pölitz; Ralf Schenkel,This paper introduces a budget-aware learning to rank approach that limits the cost forevaluating a ranking model; with a focus on very tight budgets that do not allow to fullyevaluate at least for one time all documents for each term. In contrast to existing work onbudget-aware learning to rank; our model allows to only partially evaluate parts of theranking model for the most promising documents. In contrast to existing work on top-kretrieval; we generate an execution plan before the actual query processing starts;eliminating the need for expensive in-memory accumulator management. We consider aunified cost model that integrates loading and processing cost. An extensive evaluation witha standard benchmark collection shows that our method outperforms other budget-awaremethods under tight budgets in terms of result quality.,Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA); 2012 23rd International Workshop on,2012,3
Colledge: a vision of collaborative knowledge networks,Steffen Metzger; Katja Hose; Ralf Schenkel,Abstract More and more semantic information has become available as RDF data recently;with the linked open data cloud as a prominent example. However; participating in theSemantic Web is cumbersome. Typically several steps are involved in using semanticknowledge. Information is first acquired; eg by information extraction; crowd sourcing orhuman experts. Then ontologies are published and distributed. Users may apply reasoningand otherwise modify their local ontology instances. However; currently these steps aretreated separately and although each involves human effort; nearly no synergy effect is usedand it is also mostly a one way process; eg user feedback hardly flows back into the mainontology version. Similarly; user cooperation is low. While there are approaches alleviatingsome of these limitations; eg extracting information at query time; personalizing queries …,Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Semantic Search over the Web,2012,3
Robust ranking models using noisy feedback,Christian Pölitz; Ralf Schenkel,Abstract. Direct feedback of users of search engines by click information is naturally noisy.Ranking models that integrate such feedback in their training process must cope with thisnoise. In worst case such noise can lead to large variance among the results for differentqueries in the resulting rankings. We propose to integrate model averaging like bagging andrandom forest methods to reduce the variance in the ranking models. We perform anexperimental study on different noise levels using a state of the art ranking model.,Workshop” Information Retrieval Over Query Sessions”(SIR 2012) at ECIR 2012,2012,3
Advances Towards Semantic Plagiarism Detection.,Hassan Issa; Katja Hose; Steffen Metzger; Ralf Schenkel,Abstract Recent events have again shown that plagiarism detection is an important problemin today's society. The flood of documents; however; makes detection more and more difficultso that the application of computer-based methods is a natural consequence. Theapplication of text comparison techniques; however; eventually leads to'intelligent'plagiarism; where sentences are slightly rephrased or synonyms are used. Tohelp detecting such plagiarism; we propose to use semantic similarity between documentsbased on information extracting techniques. This notion is also useful for other applicationssuch as finding similar news articles and research papers.,LWA,2011,3
of Proceedings: Advances in Database Technology-EDBT 2006: 10th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,Ralf Schenkel; Martin Theobald,Abstract/Description: Relevance Feedback is an important way to enhance retrieval qualityby integrating relevance information provided by a user. In XML retrieval; feedback enginesusually generate an expanded query from the content of elements marked as relevant ornonrelevant. This approach that is inspired by text-based IR completely ignores thesemistructured nature of XML. This paper makes the important step from content-based tostructural feedback. It presents an integrated solution for expanding keyword queries withnew content; path; and document constraints. An extensible framework evaluates suchquery conditions with existing keyword-based XML search engines while allowing to easilyintegrate new dimensions of feedback. Extensive experiments with the established INEXbenchmark show the feasibility of our approach.,*,2006,3
An information system for material microstructures,Kathrin Roberts; Frank Mucklich; Ralf Schenkel; Gerhard Weikum,This work presents an information system that supports a materialographic laboratory inclass material samples based on microstructure images. The system uses database andWeb technologies to manage its information and make it accessible to Internet users. Its coreis a class based on support vector machines; that provides an automatic diagnosis of thematerial class of a given sample. The classifier uses texture features from an underlyingimage analysis; the so-called Haralick parameters; and stereologic features such as fractaldimension; Euler parameter; etc. In addition to the class the system provides a sensitivityanalysis that allows the user to understand which features are most influential for certainclass decisions. The system is fully operational and can be used on the Web.,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2004. Proceedings. 16th International Conference on,2004,3

Taming the Tiger: How to Cope with Real Database Products in Transactional Federations for Internet Applications.,Ralf Schenkel; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract Data consistency in transactional federations is a key requirement of advanced E-service applications on the Internet; such as electronic auctions or real-estate purchase.Federated concurrency control needs to be aware of the fact that virtually all commercialdatabase products support sub-serializability isolation levels; such as Snapshot Isolation;and that applications make indeed use of such local options. This paper discusses theproblems that arise with regard to global serializability in such a setting; and proposessolutions. Protocols are developed that can guarantee global serializability over componentsystems that provide only weaker isolation levels. A full-fledged implementation is presentedthat makes use of OrbixOTS and runs on top of Oracle8i and O2 databases. Performancemeasurements with this prototype indicate the practical viability of the developed methods.,GI-Workshop Internet-Datenbanken,2000,3
LUKe and MIKe: learning from user knowledge and managing interactive knowledge extraction,Steffen Metzger; Michael Stoll; Katja Hose; Ralf Schenkel,Abstract Semantic recognition and annotation of unqiue enities and their relations is a key inunderstanding the essence contained in large text corpora. It typically requires acombination of efficient automatic methods and manual verification. Usually; both parts areseen as consecutive steps. In this demo we present MIKE; a user interface enabling theintegration of user feedback into an iterative extraction process. We show how an extractionsystem can directly learn from such integrated user supervision. In general; this setup allowsfor stepwise training of the extraction system to a particular domain; while using userfeedback early in the iterative extraction process improves extraction quality and reduces theoverall human effort needed.,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,2

Real-time text queries with tunable term pair indexes,Andreas Broschart; Ralf Schenkel,Zusammenfassung Term proximity scoring is an established means in information retrievalfor improving result quality of full-text queries. Integrating such proximity scores into efficientquery processing; however; has not been equally well studied. Existing methods make useof precomputed lists of documents where tuples of terms; usually pairs; occur together;usually incurring a huge index size compared to term-only indexes. This paper introduces ajoint framework for trading off index size and result quality; and provides optimizationtechniques for tuning precomputed indexes towards either maximal result quality or maximalquery processing performance; given an upper bound for the index size. The frameworkallows to selectively materialize lists for pairs based on a query log to further reduce indexsize. Extensive experiments with two large text collections demonstrate runtime …,*,2010,2

While some data collection organizations; like the census; arelegally required not to breach the privacy of the individuals; other data collectionorganizations may not be trusted to uphold privacy. Hence; if U denotes the original datacontaining sensitive information about a set of individuals; then an untrusted data collectoror researcher should only have access to an anonymized version of the data; U*; that doesnot disclose the sensitive information about the individuals. A randomized anonymizationalgorithm R is said to be a privacy preserving randomization method if for every table T; andfor every output T*= R (T); the privacy of all the sensitive information of each individual in …,*,2009,1
Effiziente Textsuche mit Positionsinformation.,Andreas Broschart; Ralf Schenkel,Zusammenfassung Top-k-Aggregationsverfahren zur effizienten Bestimmung der bestenErgebnisse einer Anfrage sind ein wichtiger Baustein moderner Anfrageverarbeitung.

QBEES: query-by-example entity search in semantic knowledge graphs based on maximal aspects; diversity-awareness and relaxation,Steffen Metzger; Ralf Schenkel; Marcin Sydow,Abstract Structured knowledge bases are an increasingly important way for storing andretrieving information. Within such knowledge bases; an important search task is findingsimilar entities based on one or more example entities. We present QBEES; a novelframework for defining entity similarity based on structural features; so-called aspects andmaximal aspects of the entities; that naturally model potential interest profiles of a usersubmitting an ambiguous query. Our approach based on maximal aspects provides naturaldiversity awareness and includes query-dependent and query-independent entity rankingcomponents. We present evaluation results with a number of existing entity list completionbenchmarks; comparing to several state-of-the-art baselines.,Journal of Intelligent Information Systems,2017,*

Semistructured Data Search Evaluation,Ralf Schenkel,Abstract Semistructured data is of increasing importance in many application domains; butone of its core use cases is representing documents. Consequently; effectively retrievinginformation from semistructured documents is an important problem that has seen work fromboth the information retrieval (IR) and databases (DB) communities. Comparing the largenumber of retrieval models and systems is a non-trivial task for which establishedbenchmark initiatives such as TREC with their focus on unstructured documents are notappropriate. This chapter gives an overview of semistructured data in general and the INEXinitiative for the evaluation of XML retrieval; focusing on the most prominent Adhoc SearchTrack.,*,2014,*

Hand in hand with thisstructure new challenges to query processing are arising. Especially queries for which morethan one data source can contribute results require advanced optimization and evaluationapproaches; the major challenge lying in the nature of distribution: Heterogenous datasources have to be integrated into a federation to globally appear as a single repository. Onthe query level; though; techniques have to be developed to meet the requirements ofefficient query computation in the distributed setting.

Semantic Knowledge Bases from Web Sources,Fabian Suchanek; Martin Theobald; Gerhard Weikum; Hady Lauw; Ralf Schenkel,The Web bears the potential of being the world's greatest encyclopedic source; but we arefar from fully ex-ploiting this potential. Valuable scientific and cultural content is interspersedwith a huge amount of noisy; low-quality; unstructured text and media. The proliferation ofknowledge-sharing communities like Wikipedia and the advances in automated informationextraction from Web pages give rise to an unprecedented opportunity: Can wesystematically harvest facts from the Web and compile them into a comprehensive machine-readable knowledge base? Such a knowledge base would contain not only the world'sentities; but also their semantic properties; and their relationships with each other.

Sharing Knowledge between Independent Grid Communities,Katja Hose; Steffen Metzger; Ralf Schenkel,Abstract: In recent years; grid-based approaches for processing scientific data becamepopular in various fields of research. A multitude of communities has emerged that all benefitfrom the processing and storage power the grid offers to them. So far there has not yet beenmuch collaboration between these independent communities. But applying semantictechnologies to create knowledge bases; sharing this knowledge; and providing access todata maintained by a community; allows to exploit a synergy effect that all communities canbenefit from. In this paper; we propose a framework that applies information extraction togenerate abstract knowledge from source documents to be shared among participatingcommunities. The framework also enables users to search for documents based onkeywords or metadata as well as to search for extracted knowledge.

Locking Granularity and Lock Types,Ralf Schenkel,A language model assigns a probability to a piece of unseen text; based on some trainingdata. For example; a language model based on a big English newspaper archive isexpected to assign a higher probability to ''a bit of text''than to ''aw pit tov tags;''because thewords in the former phrase (or word pairs or word triples if so-called N-Gram Models areused) occur more frequently in the data than the words in the latter phrase. For informationretrieval; typical usage is to build a language model for each document. At search time; thetop ranked document is the one whose language model assigns the highest probability tothe query.,*,2009,*
Integrated DB&IR Semi-Structured Text Retrieval,Ralf Schenkel; Martin Theobald,An example of index oriented towards human navigation is the web directory. In such anindex; links to sites are organized into hierarchical categories; according to the sites'contents. In web directories; normally the tasks of collecting and categorizing pages arecarried out under supervision of human editors. An example of index not oriented to humansis a hidden list of metadata. Metadata are data about data. As a mean of assisting a searchengine to locate content or an information entity; they can be used to describe that content orentity. While not visible to humans; this information can provide contextual clues to automaticalgorithms used by search engines.,*,2009,*

Incremental Relevance Feedback for TopX,Osama Sammodi,Abstract TopX is a highly efficient and effective search engine for ranked retrieval of XMLand plain text data. However; for some difficult queries; the results provided by TopX are notyet completely satisfying. Towards the solution of this problem; an extensible framework hasbeen proposed that incorporates feedback from the user to generate a better; expandedquery. In this thesis; we integrate the feedback framework with the TopX search engine. Weextend the existing browser-based interface of TopX to support explicit relevance feedback;reevaluate the query when new feedback is available. We also modify the existing TopXsearch engine to support incremental expansion of queries; ie; if a query that is alreadyevaluated is expanded (based on feedback); the evaluation of the expanded query shouldreuse the partial results from the evaluation of the original query.,*,2008,*

Efficiency is a central issue; especially fordistributed settings; when the data is spread across different nodes in a network. This paperintroduces novel optimization methods for top-k aggregation queries in such distributedenvironments that can be applied to all algorithms that fall into the frameworks of the priorTPUT and KLEE methods. The optimizations address 1) hierarchically grouping input listsinto top-k operator trees and optimizing the tree structure; and 2) computing data-adaptivescan depths for different input sources.

Efficient XML Query Processing and Full-Text Search,Mohammed AbuJarour,Abstract XML query processing is an essential building block in ranked XML informationretrieval. To rank documents according to a user's query; we need to maintain pre-computedinverted index lists about the data set we consider. The way we handle these lists is the keyto evaluate XML queries efficiently. In this work; we introduce a new approach to arrangesuch index lists about XML documents in a compact form by removing redundant piecesfrom the index as much as possible. Our approach optimizes IO throughput and henceoptimizes the overall throughput. The main focus of our work is to optimize storagerequirements for this kind of ranked retrieval.,*,2007,*

of Proceedings: Advances in Information Retrieval; 28th European Conference on IR Research; ECIR 2006,Ralf Schenkel; Martin Theobald,Abstract/Description: Keyword-based queries are an important means to retrieve informationfrom XML collections with unknown or complex schemas. Relevance Feedback integratesrelevance information provided by a user to enhance retrieval quality. For keyword-basedXML queries; feedback engines usually generate an expanded keyword query from thecontent of elements marked as relevant or nonrelevant. This approach that is inspired by text-based IR completely ignores the semistructured nature of XML. This paper makes theimportant step from pure content-based to structural feedback. It presents a framework thatexpands a keyword query into a full-fledged content-and-structure query. Extensiveexperiments with the established INEX benchmark and our TopX search engine show thefeasibility of our approach.,*,2006,*

Ideally; this should enable a wealth of query processing andsemantic reasoning capabilities using XQuery and logical inference engines. However; webelieve that the diversity and uncertainty of terminologies and schema-like annotations willmake precise querying on a Web scale extremely elusive if not hopeless; and the sameargument holds for large-scale dynamic federations of Deep Web sources. Therefore;ontology-based reasoning and querying needs to be enhanced by statistical means; leadingto relevanceranked lists as query results.

The best knowngeneral-purpose algo-rithm for evaluating top-k queries is Fagin's threshold algorithm (TA).Since the user's goal behind top-k queries is to identify one or a few relevant and novel dataitems; it is intriguing to use approximative variants of TA to reduce run-time costs. This paperintroduces a family of approximative top-k algorithms based on probabilistic arguments.When scanning index lists of the underlying multidimensional data space in descendingorder of local scores; various forms of convolution and derived bounds are employed topredict when it is safe; with high probability; to drop candidate items and to prune the indexscans.

Transaktionen in föderierten Datenbanksystemen unter eingeschränkten Isolation Levels,Ralf Schenkel,Atomarität und Isolation von Transaktionen sind Schlüsseleigenschaften fortgeschrittenerAnwendungen in föderierten Systemen; die aus verteilten; heterogenen Komponentenbestehen. Während Atomarität von praktisch allen realen Systemen durch das Zweiphasen-Commitprotokoll gewährleistet wird; unterstützt kein System eine explizite föderierteConcurrency Control. In der Literatur wurden zwar zahlreiche Lösungsansätzevorgeschlagen; doch sie haben wenig Einfluss auf Produkte genommen; weil sie dieweitverbreiteten Isolation Levels nicht berücksichtigen; die ApplikationenOptimierungsmöglichkeiten auf Kosten einer eingeschränkten Kontrolle über die Konsistenzder Daten erlauben.

of Proceedings: 5th IFCIS International Conference on Cooperative Information Systems (CoopIS 2000),Ralf Schenkel; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract/Description: This paper reconsiders the problem of transactional federations; morespecifically the concurrency control issue; with particular consideration of componentsystems that provide only snapshot isolation; which is the default setting in Oracle andwidely used in practice. The paper derives criteria and practical protocols for guaranteeingglobal serializability at the federation level. The paper generalizes the well-known ticketmethod and develops novel federation-level graph testing methods to incorporate sub-serializability component systems like Oracle. These contributions are embedded in apractical project that built a CORBA-based federated database architecture suitable formodern Internet-or Intranet-based applications such as electronic commerce.

of Proceedings: GI-Workshop" Internet-Datenbanken",Ralf Schenkel; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract/Description: Data consistency in transactional federations is a key requirement ofadvanced E-service applications on the Internet; such as electronic auctions or real-estatepurchase. Federated concurrency control needs to be aware of the fact that virtually allcommercial database products support sub-serializability isolation levels; such as SnapshotIsolation; and that applications make indeed use of such local options. This paper discussesthe problems that arise with regard to global serializability in such a setting; and proposessolutions. Protocols are developed that can guarantee global serializability over componentsystems that provide only weaker isolation levels. A full-fledged implementation is presentedthat makes use of OrbixOTS and runs on top of Oracle8i and O2 databases. Performancemeasurements with this prototype indicate the practical viability of the developed methods.,*,2000,*

Authors’ Addresses Avishek Anand Max-Planck-Institut für Informatik 66123 Saarbrücken Germany,Srikanta Bedathur; Klaus Berberich; Ralf Schenkel,Abstract Time-travel queries that couple temporal constraints with keyword queries areuseful in searching large-scale archives of time-evolving content such as the web archivesor wikis. Typical approaches for efficient evaluation of these queries involve slicing either theentire collection [100] or individual index lists [32] along the time-axis. Both these methodsare not satisfactory since they sacrifice compactness of index for processing efficiencymaking them either too big or; otherwise; too slow. We present a novel index organizationscheme that shards each index list with almost zero increase in index size but still minimizesthe cost of reading index entries during query processing. Based on the optimal shardingthus obtained; we develop a practically efficient sharding that takes into account the differentcosts of random and sequential accesses. Our algorithm merges shards from the optimal …,*,*,*
