Behavioral disinhibition and nascent venturing: Relevance and initial effects on potential resource providers,Daniel Lerner,Abstract While relatively weak inhibition is often associated with unproductive behavior andpathologies; it may favor acting on entrepreneurial opportunities. Ultimately exploitingopportunities; however; goes well beyond individual action; requiring organizing/others. Thisraises the question of how others perceive and respond to disinhibition in an entrepreneurialagent. Triangulating from psychology and entrepreneurship literatures; behavioraldisinhibition in an entrepreneur is hypothesized to have ambivalent; overall negative effectson potential resource providers. A randomized experiment tested the hypotheses. Resultswere significant; with moderate to large effect sizes. The findings suggest that behavioralproclivities facilitating individual entrepreneurial action may paradoxically undermineorganizing. The work contributes to an emergent literature on ostensibly dark-side …,Journal of Business Venturing,2016,21
The dark triad and nascent entrepreneurship: An examination of unproductive versus productive entrepreneurial motives,Keith M Hmieleski; Daniel A Lerner,Abstract This study examined relationships of the dark triad personality characteristics (ie;narcissism; psychopathy; and Machiavellianism) with entrepreneurial intentions andmotives. Results from samples of business undergraduates (N= 508) and MBA students (N=234) found narcissism to be positively related to entrepreneurial intentions. In addition;results from subgroups of business undergraduates and MBA students high inentrepreneurial intentions (ie; early-stage nascent entrepreneurs) indicated differences inmotives for engaging in the startup process. Specifically; we found all facets of the dark triadto be positively associated with unproductive entrepreneurial motives; and observeddifferential associations of the dark triad characteristics with productive entrepreneurialmotives.,Journal of Small Business Management,2016,14
Action! Moving beyond the intendedly-rational logics of entrepreneurship,Daniel A Lerner; Richard A Hunt; Dimo Dimov,Abstract Entrepreneurial action is central to entrepreneurship theory; and is broadly seen toarise as a consequence of intendedly rational logics (whether causal or effectual); reflectingreasoned judgment. But; is this always the case? While entrepreneurial action may often bethe result of a judgmental decision (between alternative courses of action/inaction); thepresumption that reasoned judgment encompasses all the motives; modes and mechanismsleading to entrepreneurial outcomes seems dubious. Building on an emerging literature thatseeks to address the boundaries of reasoned entrepreneurial action; we develop the notionthat non-deliberative impulse-driven behavioral logics can also be the basis for businessventuring. Our framework offers a complementary perspective to the intendedly-rational;deliberate logics perspective; opening novel pathways for future research and theory …,Journal of Business Venturing,2018,4
Critical factors for transforming creativity into sustainability,Wojciech Przychodzen; Justyna Przychodzen; Daniel A Lerner,Abstract Although creativity and sustainability have received considerable attention in theliterature; there is limited research considering both–particularly in relation to co-existingorganizational factors which facilitate the transformation of creativity into sustainableproducts. This paper explores this gap through an analysis of six case studies of commercialorganizations presenting both successful and unsuccessful implementation of sustainableproducts/services; across types of firms and industries. The research framework focuses onthree general facets: 1) leadership; 2) boundaries; where different aspects of internal andexternal firm's activities enable a diversity of opinions and stakeholder engagement; and 3)economic alignment/instrumentality; in which the goal of wealth creation is present andsupported by a firm's capabilities. The main finding of the paper is that appropriate …,Journal of Cleaner Production,2016,2
Dueling Banjos: Harmony and Discord between ADHD and Entrepreneurship,Daniel Lerner; Richard Hunt; Ingrid Verheul,Abstract The past half century has witnessed a steady and diverse flow of scholarly researchto understand the role individual differences play in determining entrepreneurial pursuitsand new venture outcomes. Recently; the search for micro-level drivers has led scholars toinvestigate the role of dispositions and conditions that have been traditionally pathologized;such as Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The potential influence of ADHDlooms large in the field of entrepreneurship as a spate of recent studies suggests a positiverelationship with creativity; entrepreneurial orientation and new venture initiation. Whileoffering significant progress in de-stigmatizing aberrant conditions; extant scholarship hasleft unanswered questions regarding ADHD's influence on formation; development; andoutcomes of new ventures. Accepting that ADHD should be neither stigmatized nor …,The Academy of Management Perspectives,2018,1
