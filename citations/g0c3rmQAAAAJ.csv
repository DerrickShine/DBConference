An online cost sensitive decision-making method in crowdsourcing systems,Jinyang Gao; Xuan Liu; Beng Chin Ooi; Haixun Wang; Gang Chen,Abstract Crowdsourcing has created a variety of opportunities for many challengingproblems by leveraging human intelligence. For example; applications such as imagetagging; natural language processing; and semantic-based information retrieval can exploitcrowd-based human computation to supplement existing computational algorithms.Naturally; human workers in crowdsourcing solve problems based on their knowledge;experience; and perception. It is therefore not clear which problems can be better solved bycrowdsourcing than solving solely using traditional machine-based methods. Therefore; acost sensitive quantitative analysis method is needed. In this paper; we design andimplement a cost sensitive method for crowdsourcing. We online estimate the profit of thecrowdsourcing job so that those questions with no future profit from crowdsourcing can be …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,47
SINGA: A distributed deep learning platform,Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Sheng Wang; Wei Wang; Qingchao Cai; Gang Chen; Jinyang Gao; Zhaojing Luo; Anthony KH Tung; Yuan Wang; Zhongle Xie; Meihui Zhang; Kaiping Zheng,Abstract Deep learning has shown outstanding performance in various machine learningtasks. However; the deep complex model structure and massive training data make itexpensive to train. In this paper; we present a distributed deep learning system; calledSINGA; for training big models over large datasets. An intuitive programming model basedon the layer abstraction is provided; which supports a variety of popular deep learningmodels. SINGA architecture supports both synchronous and asynchronous trainingframeworks. Hybrid training frameworks can also be customized to achieve good scalability.SINGA provides different neural net partitioning schemes for training large models.

DSH: data sensitive hashing for high-dimensional k-nnsearch,Jinyang Gao; Hosagrahar Visvesvaraya Jagadish; Wei Lu; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract The need to locate the k-nearest data points with respect to a given query point in amulti-and high-dimensional space is common in many applications. Therefore; it is essentialto provide efficient support for such a search. Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) has beenwidely accepted as an effective hash method for high-dimensional similarity search.However; data sets are typically not distributed uniformly over the space; and as a result; thebuckets of LSH are unbalanced; causing the performance of LSH to degrade. In this paper;we propose a new and efficient method called Data Sensitive Hashing (DSH) to address thisdrawback. DSH improves the hashing functions and hashing family; and is orthogonal tomost of the recent state-of-the-art approaches which mainly focus on indexing and queryingstrategies. DSH leverages data distributions and is capable of directly preserving the …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,31
SINGA: Putting deep learning in the hands of multimedia users,Wei Wang; Gang Chen; Anh Tien Tuan Dinh; Jinyang Gao; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Sheng Wang,Abstract Recently; deep learning techniques have enjoyed success in various multimediaapplications; such as image classification and multi-modal data analysis. Two key factorsbehind deep learning's remarkable achievement are the immense computing power and theavailability of massive training datasets; which enable us to train large models to capturecomplex regularities of the data. There are two challenges to overcome before deeplearning can be widely adopted in multimedia and other applications. One is usability;namely the implementation of different models and training algorithms must be done by non-experts without much effort. The other is scalability; that is the deep learning system must beable to provision for a huge demand of computing resources for training large models withmassive datasets. To address these two challenges; in this paper; we design a distributed …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM international conference on Multimedia,2015,22

Learning user preferences by adaptive pairwise comparison,Li Qian; Jinyang Gao; HV Jagadish,Abstract Users make choices among multi-attribute objects in a data set in a variety ofdomains including used car purchase; job search and hotel room booking. Individual userssometimes have strong preferences between objects; but these preferences may not beuniversally shared by all users. If we can cast these preferences as derived from aquantitative user-specific preference function; then we can predict user preferences bylearning their preference function; even though the preference function itself is not directlyobservable; and may be hard to express. In this paper we study the problem of preferencelearning with pairwise comparisons on a set of entities with multiple attributes. We formalizethe problem into two subproblems; namely preference estimation and comparison selection.We propose an innovative approach to estimate the preference; and introduce a binary …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,7
Selective hashing: Closing the gap between radius search and k-nn search,Jinyang Gao; HV Jagadish; Beng Chin Ooi; Sheng Wang,Abstract Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and its variants; are generally believed to be themost effective radius search methods in high-dimensional spaces. However; manyapplications involve finding the k nearest neighbors (k-NN); where the k-NN distances ofdifferent query points may differ greatly and the performance of LSH suffers. We propose anovel indexing scheme called Selective Hashing; where a disjoint set of indices are builtwith different granularities and each point is only stored in the most effective index.Theoretically; we show that k-NN search using selective hashing can achieve the samerecall as a fixed radius LSH search; using a radius equal to the distance of the c 1 k thnearest neighbor; with at most c 2 times overhead; where c 1 and c 2 are small constants.Selective hashing is also easy to build and update; and outperforms all the state-of-the-art …,Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2015,6
Active Sampler: Light-weight Accelerator for Complex Data Analytics at Scale,Jinyang Gao; HV Jagadish; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract: Recent years have witnessed amazing outcomes from" Big Models" trained by" BigData". Most popular algorithms for model training are iterative. Due to the surging volumes ofdata; we can usually afford to process only a fraction of the training data in each iteration.Typically; the data are either uniformly sampled or sequentially accessed. In this paper; westudy how the data access pattern can affect model training. We propose an Active Sampleralgorithm; where training data with more" learning value" to the model are sampled morefrequently. The goal is to focus training effort on valuable instances near the classificationboundaries; rather than evident cases; noisy data or outliers. We show the correctness andoptimality of Active Sampler in theory; and then develop a light-weight vectorizedimplementation. Active Sampler is orthogonal to most approaches optimizing the …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03880,2015,3
Resolving the bias in electronic medical records,Kaiping Zheng; Jinyang Gao; Kee Yuan Ngiam; Beng Chin Ooi; Wei Luen James Yip,Abstract Electronic Medical Records (EMR) are the most fundamental resources used inhealthcare data analytics. Since people visit hospital more frequently when they feel sickand doctors prescribe lab examinations when they feel necessary; we argue that there couldbe a strong bias in EMR observations compared with the hidden conditions of patients.Directly using such EMR for analytical tasks without considering the bias may lead tomisinterpretation. To this end; we propose a general method to resolve the bias bytransforming EMR to regular patient hidden condition series using a Hidden Markov Model(HMM) variant. Compared with the biased EMR series with irregular time stamps; theunbiased regular time series is much easier to be processed by most analytical models andyields better results. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our bias resolving …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2017,1
