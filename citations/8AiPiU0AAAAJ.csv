An intelligent query interface based on ontology navigation,Enrico Franconi; Paolo Guagliardo; Marco Trevisan,ABSTRACT In this paper we present a formal framework and an experimental softwaresupporting the user in the task of formulating a precise query–which best captures theirinformation needs–even in the case of complete ignorance of the vocabulary of theunderlying information system holding the data. Our intelligent interface is driven by meansof appropriate automated reasoning techniques over an ontology describing the domain ofthe data in the information system. We will define what a query is and how it is internallyrepresented; which operations are available to the user in order to modify the query and howcontextual feedback is provided about it presenting only relevant pieces of information.

Theoretical foundations of an ontology-based visual tool for query formulation support,Paolo Guagliardo,Abstract Recent research showed that adopting formal ontologies as a means for accessingheterogeneous data sources has many benefits; in that not only does it provide a uniformand flexible approach to integrating and describing such sources; but it can also support thefinal user in querying them; thus improving the usability of the integrated system. The QueryTool is an experimental software supporting the user in the task of formulating a precisequery–which best captures their information needs–even in the case of complete ignoranceof the vocabulary of the underlying information system holding the data.

Making SQL Queries Correct on Incomplete Databases: A Feasibility Study,Paolo Guagliardo; Leonid Libkin,Abstract Multiple issues with SQL's handling of nulls have been well documented. Havingefficiency as its key goal; evaluation of SQL queries disregards the standard notion ofcorrectness on incomplete databases-certain answers-due to its high complexity. As a result;it may produce answers that are just plain wrong. It was recently shown that SQL evaluationcan be modified; at least for first-order queries; to return only correct answers. But whilethese modifications came with good theoretical complexity bounds; they have not beentested in practice. The goals of this proof-of-concept paper are to understand whether wronganswers can be produced by SQL queries in real-world scenarios; and whether proposedtechniques for avoiding them can be made practically feasible. We use the TPC-Hbenchmark; and show that for some typical queries involving negation; wrong answers …,PODS '16: Proceedings of the 35th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems,2016,11

The view update problem revisited,Enrico Franconi; Paolo Guagliardo,Abstract: In this paper; we revisit the view update problem in a relational setting and proposea framework based on the notion of determinacy under constraints. Within such a framework;we characterise when a view mapping is invertible; establishing that this is the caseprecisely when each database symbol has an exact rewriting in terms of the view symbolsunder the given constraints; and we provide a general effective criterion to understandwhether the changes introduced by a view update can be propagated to the underlyingdatabase relations in a unique and unambiguous way. Afterwards; we show howdeterminacy under constraints can be checked; and rewritings effectively found; in threedifferent relevant scenarios in the absence of view constraints. First; we settle the long-standing open issue of how to solve the view update problem in a multi-relational …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1211.3016,2012,8

A natural language ontology-driven query interface,Enrico Franconi; Paolo Guagliardo; Sergio Tessaris; Marco Trevisan,Recent research showed that adopting formal ontologies as a means for accessingheterogeneous data sources has many benefits; in that not only does it provide a uniformand flexible approach to integrating and describing such sources; but it can also support thefinal user in querying them; thus improving the usability of the integrated system. Weintroduce a framework that enables access to heterogeneous data sources by means of aconceptual schema and supports the users in the task of formulating a precise query over it.In describing a specific domain; the ontology defines a vocabulary which is often richer thanthe logical schema of the underlying data and usually closer to the user's own vocabulary.The ontology can thus be effectively exploited by the user in order to formulate a query thatbest captures their information need.

Lossless horizontal decomposition with domain constraints on interpreted attributes,Ingo Feinerer; Enrico Franconi; Paolo Guagliardo,Abstract Horizontal decomposition is the process of splitting a relation into sub-relations;called fragments; each containing a subset of the rows of the original relation. In this paper;we consider horizontal decomposition in a setting where some of the attributes in thedatabase schema are interpreted over a specific domain; on which a set of specialpredicates and functions is defined. We study the losslessness of horizontal decomposition;that is; whether the original relation can be reconstructed from the fragments by union; in thepresence of integrity constraints on the database schema. We introduce the new class ofconditional domain constraints (CDCs); restricting the values the interpreted attributes maytake whenever a certain condition holds on the non-interpreted ones; and investigatelossless horizontal decomposition under CDCs in isolation; as well as in combination with …,British National Conference on Databases,2013,4

A Formal Semantics of SQL Queries; Its Validation; and Applications,Paolo Guagliardo; Leonid Libkin,Abstract While formal semantics of theoretical languages underlying SQL have beenprovided in the past; they all made simplifying assumptions ranging from changes in thesyntax to omitting bag semantics and nulls. This situation is reminiscent of what happens inthe field of programming languages; where semantics of formal calculi underlying the mainfeatures of languages are abundant; but formal semantics of real languages that people useare few and far between. We consider the basic class of SQL queries---essentially SELECT-FROM-WHERE queries with subqueries; set/bag operations; and nulls---and define a formalsemantics for it; without any departures from the real language. This fragment alreadyrequires decisions related to the data model and handling variable names that are normallydisregarded by simplified semantics. To justify our choice of the semantics; we validate it …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,3
Query Processing in Data Integration,Paolo Guagliardo; Piotr Wieczorek,Abstract In this chapter we illustrate the main techniques for processing queries in dataintegration. The first part of the chapter focuses on the problem of query answering in therelational setting; and describes approaches based on variants of the chase; along with howto deal with integrity constraints and access patterns. The second part of the chapterinvestigates query processing in the context of semistructured data; which is best describedby graph-based data models; where the expressiveness of query languages not common intraditional database systems allows to point out the subtle differences between queryanswering and query rewriting. The chapter is closed by a very brief discussion of queryprocessing in data integration with XML and ontologies.,*,2013,3
Approximations and Refinements of Certain Answers via Many-Valued Logics.,Marco Console; Paolo Guagliardo; Leonid Libkin,Abstract Computing certain answers is the preferred way of answering queries in scenariosinvolving incomplete data. This; however; is computationally expensive; so practical systemsuse efficient techniques based on a particular three-valued logic; even though this oftenleads to incorrect results. Our goal is to provide a general manyvalued framework forcorrectly approximating certain answers. We do so by defining the semantics of manyvaluedanswers and queries; following the principle that additional knowledge about the input musttranslate into additional knowledge about the output. This framework lets us compare queryoutputs and evaluation procedures in terms of their informativeness. For each manyvaluedlogic with a knowledge ordering on its truth values; one can build a syntactic evaluationprocedure for all first-order queries; that correctly approximates certain answers; …,KR,2016,2
Lossless selection views under conditional domain constraints,Ingo Feinerer; Enrico Franconi; Paolo Guagliardo,A set of views defined by selection queries splits a database relation into sub-relations; eachcontaining a subset of the original rows. This decomposition into horizontal fragments islossless when the initial relation can be reconstructed from the fragments by union. In thispaper; we consider horizontal decomposition in a setting where some of the attributes in thedatabase schema are interpreted over a specific domain; on which a set of specialpredicates and functions is defined. We study losslessness in the presence of integrityconstraints on the database schema. We consider the class of conditional domainconstraints (CDCs); which restrict the values that the interpreted attributes may takewhenever a certain condition holds on the non-interpreted ones; and investigate losslesshorizontal decomposition under CDCs in isolation; as well as in combination with …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,2
On querying incomplete information in databases under bag semantics,Marco Console; Paolo Guagliardo; Leonid Libkin,Abstract Querying incomplete data is an important task both in data management; and inmany AI applications that use query rewriting to take advantage of relational databasetechnology. Usually one looks for answers that are certain; ie; true in every possible worldrepresented by an incomplete database. For positive queries–expressed either in positiverelational algebra or as unions of conjunctive queries–finding such answers can be doneefficiently when databases and query answers are sets. Real-life databases however usebag; rather than set; semantics. For bags; instead of saying that a tuple is certainly in theanswer; we have more detailed information: namely; the range of the numbers ofoccurrences of the tuple in query answers. We show that the behavior of positive queries isdifferent under bag semantics: finding the minimum number of occurrences can still be …,Proceedings of the 26th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2017,1
On the Codd semantics of SQL nulls,Paolo Guagliardo; Leonid Libkin,Abstract. Theoretical models used in database research often have subtle differences withthose occurring in practice. One particular mismatch that is usually neglected concerns theuse of marked nulls to represent missing values in theoretical models of incompleteness;while in an SQL database these are all denoted by the same syntactic NULL object. It iscommonly argued that results obtained in the model with marked nulls carry over to SQL;because SQL nulls can be interpreted as Codd nulls; which are simply marked nulls that donot repeat. This argument; however; does not take into account that even simple queriesmay produce answers where distinct occurrences of NULL do in fact denote the sameunknown value. For such queries; interpreting SQL nulls as Codd nulls would incorrectlychange the semantics of query answers. To use results about Codd nulls for real-life SQL …,*,2017,1

Weconsider a setting where some of the attributes in the schema are interpreted over somespecific domain (eg; the reals or the integers) whose data values can be compared beyondequality; by means of special predicates (eg; smaller/greater than) and functions (eg;addition and subtraction).

Quelo at the IESD challenge 2012,Enrico Franconi; Paolo Guagliardo; Sergio Tessaris,Abstract. Quelo is a tool aimed at the exploration and querying of semantic data by means ofan intelligent visual interface based on natural language. The tool is not tied to any specificapplication domain or class of users; and no advance knowledge of the ontology and itsvocabulary is indeed required in order to use it; which makes Quelo a general-purpose toolsuitable for a wide range of users; whether they are domain experts (eg; ontology engineers)or not. Knowledge of the ontology is gradually acquired by using the tool itself; through aniterative process of information discovery. Users are guided step by step in constructing aquery over the ontology that best captures their information need; and they are supported inthis task by Quelo's intelligent interface that provides constant contextual feedback andvisual assistance. By using automated reasoning techniques; Quelo filters out …,International Workshop on Intelligent Exploration of Semantic Data (IESD’2012),2012,1

A constructive approach to translatability of view updates,Enrico Franconi; Paolo Guagliardo,Abstract In this article; we revisit the view update framework by Bancilhon and Spyratos in asetting with constraints expressed in first-order logic. We explicitly consider constraints onboth the database and the view schemas; along with inter-schema constraints that implicitlydefine the view mappings. Using the notion of logical definability we give a constructivecharacterisation of views; their inverses and complements; and provide an effective methodfor checking whether an arbitrary first-order expressible view update can be (uniquely)translated under the constant complement principle.,*,*,*
