Vide: A vision-based approach for deep web data extraction,Wei Liu; Xiaofeng Meng; Weiyi Meng,Deep Web contents are accessed by queries submitted to Web databases and the returneddata records are enwrapped in dynamically generated Web pages (they will be called deepWeb pages in this paper). Extracting structured data from deep Web pages is a challengingproblem due to the underlying intricate structures of such pages. Until now; a large numberof techniques have been proposed to address this problem; but all of them have inherentlimitations because they are Web-page-programming-language-dependent. As the populartwo-dimensional media; the contents on Web pages are always displayed regularly for usersto browse. This motivates us to seek a different way for deep Web data extraction toovercome the limitations of previous works by utilizing some interesting common visualfeatures on the deep Web pages. In this paper; a novel vision-based approach that is …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2010,310
Integrity auditing of outsourced data,Min Xie; Haixun Wang; Jian Yin; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract An increasing number of enterprises outsource their IT services to third parties whocan offer these services for a much lower cost due to economy of scale. Quality of service isa major concern in outsourcing. In particular; query integrity; which means that query resultsreturned by the service provider are both correct and complete; must be assured. Previouswork requires clients to manage data locally to audit the results sent back by the server; ordatabase engine to be modified for generating authenticated results. In this paper; weintroduce a novel integrity audit mechanism that eliminating these costly requirements. Inour approach; we insert a small amount of records into an outsourced database so that theintegrity of the system can be effectively audited by analyzing the inserted records in thequery results. We study both randomized and deterministic approaches for generating the …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,240
Protecting location privacy against location-dependent attacks in mobile services,Xiao Pan; Jianliang Xu; Xiaofeng Meng,Privacy protection has recently received considerable attention in location-based services. Alarge number of location cloaking algorithms have been proposed for protecting the locationprivacy of mobile users. In this paper; we consider the scenario where different location-based query requests are continuously issued by mobile users while they are moving. Weshow that most of the existing k-anonymity location cloaking algorithms are concerned withsnapshot user locations only and cannot effectively prevent location-dependent attackswhen users' locations are continuously updated. Therefore; adopting both the location k-anonymity and cloaking granularity as privacy metrics; we propose a new incremental clique-based cloaking algorithm; called ICliqueCloak; to defend against location-dependentattacks. The main idea is to incrementally maintain maximal cliques needed for location …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,161
On the sequencing of tree structures for XML indexing,Haixun Wang; Xiaofeng Meng,Sequence-based XML indexing aims at avoiding expensive join operations in queryprocessing. It transforms structured XML data into sequences so that a structured query canbe answered holistically through subsequence matching. In this paper; we address theproblem of query equivalence with respect to this transformation; and we introduce aperformance-oriented principle for sequencing tree structures. With query equivalence; XMLqueries can be performed through subsequence matching without join operations; post-processing; or other special handling for problems such as false alarms. We identify a classof sequencing methods for this purpose; and we present a novel subsequence matchingalgorithm that observe query equivalence. Still; query equivalence is just a prerequisite forsequence-based XML indexing. Our goal is to find the best sequencing strategy with …,Data Engineering; 2005. ICDE 2005.

A Survey of Deep Web Data Integration [J],Wei LIU; Xiao-Feng MENG; Wei-Yi MENG,Abstract As the rapid development of World Wide Web; there is tremendous information"hiddened" in Deep Web; and its capacity is increasing rapidly. The information can only beaccessed by the query interfaces provided by Web database. The data in Deep Web areobtained in the form of dynamic Web pages when users send a query. Due to the poorstructure of Web pages and the instability and large scale of Deep Web; it is a verychallenging task to integrate the abundant information automatically and use it effectively.Until now; Deep Web data integration has still been a rising research field; and there are anumber of challenging issues in it.

An efficient multi-dimensional index for cloud data management,Xiangyu Zhang; Jing Ai; Zhongyuan Wang; Jiaheng Lu; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract Recently; the cloud computing platform is getting more and more attentions as anew trend of data management. Currently there are several cloud computing products thatcan provide various services. However; currently the cloud platforms only support simplekeyword-based queries and can't answer complex queries efficiently due to lack of efficientindex techniques. In this paper we propose an efficient approach to build multi-dimensionalindex for Cloud computing system. We use the combination of R-tree and KD-tree toorganize data records and offer fast query processing and efficient index maintenance. Ourapproach can process typical multi-dimensional queries including point queries and rangequeries efficiently. Besides; frequent change of data on big amount of machines makes theindex maintenance a challenging problem; and to cope with this problem we proposed a …,Proceedings of the first international workshop on Cloud data management,2009,104

Vision-based web data records extraction,Wei Liu; Xiaofeng Meng; Weiyi Meng,ABSTRACT This paper studies the problem of extracting data records on the responsepages returned from web databases or search engines. Existing solutions to this problemare based primarily on analyzing the HTML DOM trees and tags of the response pages.While these solutions can achieve good results; they are too heavily dependent on thespecifics of HTML and they may have to be changed should the response pages are writtenin a totally different markup language. In this paper; we propose a novel and languageindependent technique to solve the data extraction problem. Our proposed solution performsthe extraction using only the visual information of the response pages when they arerendered on web browsers. We analyze several types of visual features in this paper. Wealso propose a new measure revision to evaluate the extraction performance. This …,Proc. 9th international workshop on the web and databases,2006,101
Wind power forecasts using Gaussian processes and numerical weather prediction,Niya Chen; Zheng Qian; Ian T Nabney; Xiaofeng Meng,Since wind at the earth's surface has an intrinsically complex and stochastic nature; accuratewind power forecasts are necessary for the safe and economic use of wind energy. In thispaper; we investigated a combination of numeric and probabilistic models: a Gaussianprocess (GP) combined with a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model was applied towind-power forecasting up to one day ahead. First; the wind-speed data from NWP wascorrected by a GP; then; as there is always a defined limit on power generated in a windturbine due to the turbine controlling strategy; wind power forecasts were realized bymodeling the relationship between the corrected wind speed and power output using acensored GP. To validate the proposed approach; three real-world datasets were used formodel training and testing. The empirical results were compared with several classical …,IEEE Transactions on Power Systems,2014,97

Schema-guided wrapper maintenance for web-data extraction,Xiaofeng Meng; Dongdong Hu; Chen Li,Abstract Extracting data from Web pages using wrappers is a fundamental problem arisingin a large variety of applications of vast practical interests. There are two main issuesrelevant to Web-data extraction; namely wrapper generation and wrapper maintenance. Inthis paper; we propose a novel schema-guided approach to the problem of automaticwrapper maintenance. It is based on the observation that despite various page changes;many important features of the pages are preserved; such as syntactic patterns; annotations;and hyperlinks of the extracted data items. Our approach uses these preserved features toidentify the locations of the desired values in the changed pages; and repair wrapperscorrespondingly by inducing semantic blocks from the HTML tree. Our intensive experimentson real Web sites show that the proposed approach can effectively maintain wrappers to …,Proceedings of the 5th ACM international workshop on Web information and data management,2003,88
Distortion-based anonymity for continuous queries in location-based mobile services,Xiao Pan; Xiaofeng Meng; Jianliang Xu,Abstract Privacy preservation has recently received considerable attention for location-based mobile services. Various location cloaking approaches have been proposed toprotect the location privacy of mobile users. However; existing cloaking approaches are ill-suited for continuous queries. In view of the privacy disclosure and poor QoS (Quality ofService) under continuous query anonymization; in this paper; we propose a δ p-privacymodel and a δ q-distortion model to balance the tradeoff between user privacy and QoS.Furthermore; two incremental utility-based cloaking algorithms---bottom-up cloaking andhybrid cloaking; are proposed to anonymize continuous queries.

Providing freshness guarantees for outsourced databases,Min Xie; Haixun Wang; Jian Yin; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract Database outsourcing becomes increasingly attractive as advances in networktechnologies eliminate the perceived performance difference between in-house databasesand out-sourced databases; and price advantages of third-party data-base service providerscontinue to increase due to economy of scale. However; the potentially explosive growth ofdatabase outsourcing is hampered by security concerns; namely data privacy and queryintegrity of outsourced databases. While privacy issues of outsourced databases have beenextensively studied; query integrity for outsourced databases has just started to drawattention from the database community. Currently; there still does not exist a solution thatcan provide complete integrity. In particular; previous studies have not examined themechanisms for providing freshness guarantees; that is; the assurance that queries are …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,61

You can walk alone: trajectory privacy-preserving through significant stays protection,Zheng Huo; Xiaofeng Meng; Haibo Hu; Yi Huang,Abstract Publication of moving objects' everyday life trajectories may cause serious personalprivacy leakage. Existing trajectory privacy-preserving methods try to anonymize k wholetrajectories together; which may result in complicated algorithms and extra information loss.We observe that; background information are more relevant to where the moving objectsreally visit rather than where they just pass by. In this paper; we propose an approach calledY ou C an W alk A lone (YCWA) to protect trajectory privacy through generalization of staypoints on trajectories. By protecting stay points; sensitive information is protected; while theprobability of whole trajectories' exposure is reduced. Moreover; the information loss causedby the privacy-preserving process is reduced.

Dynamically updating XML data: numbering scheme revisited,Jeffrey Xu Yu; Daofeng Luo; Xiaofeng Meng; Hongjun Lu,Abstract Almost all existing approaches use certain numbering scheme to encode XMLelements to facilitate query processing when XML data is stored in databases. For example;under the most popular region-based numbering scheme; the starting and ending positionsof an element in a document are used as the code to identify the element so that theancestor/descendant relationship between two elements can be determined by merelyexamining their codes. While such numbering scheme can greatly improve queryperformance; renumbering large amount of elements caused by updates becomes aperformance bottleneck if XML documents are frequently updated. Unfortunately; nosatisfactory work has been reported for efficient update of XML data. In this paper; we firstformalize the XML data update problem by defining the basic operators to support most …,World Wide Web,2005,51
DSTTMOD: A future trajectory based moving objects database,Xiaofeng Meng; Zhiming Ding,Abstract In this paper; a new moving objects database model–Discrete Spatio-TemporalTrajectory Based Moving Objects Database (DSTTMOD) model; is put forward. Trajectoriesare used to represent dynamic attributes of moving objects; including the past; current; andfuture location information. Moving objects can submit moving plans of different lengthaccording to their moving patterns. Moreover; they can divide the whole moving plan intomultiple sections; and submit each section only when it is about to be used. Different movingobjects can set up different threshold to trigger location updates. When a location updateoccurs to a moving object; not only its future trajectory is updated; but also the correspondingindex records are adjusted. The model can support three kinds of queries (point queries;range queries; and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) queries) for location information in not only …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2003,49

Quality aware privacy protection for location-based services,Zhen Xiao; Xiaofeng Meng; Jianliang Xu,Abstract Protection of users' privacy has been a central issue for location-based services(LBSs). In this paper; we classify two kinds of privacy protection requirements in LBS:location anonymity and identifier anonymity. While the location cloaking technique under thek-anonymity model can provide a good protection of users' privacy; it reduces the resolutionof location information and; hence; may degrade the quality of service (QoS). To strike abalance between the location privacy and QoS; we present a quality-aware anonymitymodel for protecting location privacy while meeting user specified QoS requirements. In themodel; a mobile user can specify the minimum anonymity level requirement upon locationprivacy as well as the maximum cloaking latency and the maximum cloaking region sizerequirements upon QoS. In accordance with the model; we develop an efficient directed …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,46

Update-efficient indexing of moving objects in road networks,Jidong Chen; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract Recent advances in wireless sensor networks and positioning technologies haveboosted new applications that manage moving objects. In such applications; a dynamicindex is often built to expedite evaluation of spatial queries. However; the development ofefficient indexes is a challenge due to frequent object movement. In this paper; we proposea new update-efficient index method for moving objects in road networks. We introduce adynamic data structure; called adaptive unit; to group neighboring objects with similarmovement patterns. To reduce updates; an adaptive unit captures the movement bounds ofthe objects based on a prediction method; which considers road-network constraints and thestochastic traffic behavior. A spatial index (eg; R-tree) for the road network is then built overthe adaptive unit structures. Simulation experiments; carried on two different datasets …,Geoinformatica,2009,43
p-sensitivity: A semantic privacy-protection model for location-based services,Zhen Xiao; Jianliang Xu; Xiaofeng Meng,Several methods have been proposed to support location-based services without revealingmobile users' privacy information. There are two types of privacy concerns in location-basedservices: location privacy and query privacy. Existing work; based on location k-anonymity;mainly focused on location privacy and are insufficient to protect query privacy. In particular;due to lack of semantics; location k-anonymity suffers from query homogeneity attack. In thispaper; we introduce p-sensitivity; a novel privacy-protection model that considers querydiversity and semantic information in anonymizing user locations. We propose a PE-Tree forimplementing the p-sensitivity model. Search algorithms and heuristics are developed toefficiently find the optimal p-sensitivity anonymization in the tree.

-OrientStore: A Schema Based Native XML Storage System,Xiaofeng Meng; Daofeng Luo; Mong Li Lee; Jing An,This chapter discusses a schema based native XML storage system. The increasing numberof XML repositories has provided the impetus to design and develop systems that can storeand query XML data efficiently. Research to improve system performance has been largelyconcentrated on indexing paths and optimizing XML queries. The storage configuration ofXML data on disk also has an impact on the efficiency of an XML data management system.Existing XML storage strategies can be classified into two categories: native XML storageand non-native XML storage. The main distinction between them is their data model. Theformer is based on the XML Data Models such as document object model (DOM); and objectexchange model (OEM); while the latter is based on the traditional relational data model; orobject-oriented data model.

We conducted a series ofexperiments to evaluate the usability; correctness and efficiency of SG-WRAP. The usabilitytests selected a number of users to use the system. The results indicated that; with minimalintroduction of the system; DTD definition and structure of HTML pages; even naive userscould quickly generate wrappers without much difficulty. For correctness; we adapted theprecision and recall metrics in information retrieval to data extraction. The results show that;with the refining process; the system can generate wrappers with very high accuracy.

A sequential indexing scheme for flash-based embedded systems,Shaoyi Yin; Philippe Pucheral; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract NAND Flash has become the most popular stable storage medium for embeddedsystems. As on-board storage capacity increases; the need for efficient indexing techniquesarises. Such techniques are very challenging to design due to a combination of NAND Flashconstraints (for example the block-erase-before-page-rewrite constraint and limited numberof erase cycles) and embedded system constraints (for example tiny RAM and resourceconsumption predictability). Previous work adapted traditional indexing methods to copewith Flash constraints by deferring index updates using a log and batching them to decreasethe number of rewrite operations in Flash memory. However; these methods were notdesigned with embedded system constraints in mind and do not address them. In this paper;we propose a new alternative for indexing Flash-resident data that specifically addresses …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,37

The Dewey labeling scheme is commonly used tolabel an XML document to facilitate XML query processing by recording information on thepath of an element. In order to improve the efficiency of XML tree pattern matching; weintroduce a novel labeling scheme; called extended Dewey; which effectively extends theexisting Dewey labeling scheme to combine the types and identifiers of elements in a label;and to avoid the scan of labels for internal query nodes to accelerate query processing (inI/O cost). Based on extended Dewey; we propose a series of holistic XML tree patternmatching algorithms. We first present TJFast to answer an XML twig pattern query.

Safe side effects commitment for OS-level virtualization,Zhiyong Shan; Xin Wang; Tzi-cker Chiueh; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract A common application of virtual machines (VM) is to use and then throw away;basically treating a VM like a completely isolated and disposable entity. The disadvantage ofthis approach is that if there is no malicious activity; the user has to re-do all of the work inher actual workspace since there is no easy way to commit (ie; merge) only the benignupdates within the VM back to the host environment. In this work; we develop a VMcommitment system called Secom to automatically eliminate malicious state changes whenmerging the contents of an OS-level VM to the host. Secom consists of three steps: groupingstate changes into clusters; distinguishing between benign and malicious clusters; andcommitting benign clusters. Secom has three novel features.

This paper considersthe problem of publishing histograms under differential privacy; one of the strongest privacymodels. Existing differentially private histogram publication schemes have shown thatclustering (or grouping) is a promising idea to improve the accuracy of sanitized histograms.However; none of them fully exploits the benefit of clustering. In this paper; we introduce anew clustering framework. It features a sophisticated evaluation of the trade-off between theapproximation error due to clustering and the Laplace error due to Laplace noise injected;which is normally overlooked in prior work.

It obtains a random sample on a certain attribute by analyzing theattribute correlations among all the textual attributes in the query interface. The size of a Webdatabase can be estimated by submitting probing queries which are generated by top-kfrequent words to the query interface of a Web database.

You can stop early with COLA: online processing of aggregate queries in the cloud,Yingjie Shi; Xiaofeng Meng; Fusheng Wang; Yantao Gan,Abstract Cloud-based data management systems are emerging as scalable; fault-tolerant;and efficient solutions to manage large volumes of data with cost effective infrastructures;and more and more data analysis applications are migrated to the cloud. As an attractivesolution to provide a quick sketch of massive data before a long wait of the final accuratequery result; online processing of aggregate queries in the cloud is of paramountimportance. This problem is challenging to solve because of the large block based dataorganization and distributed processing mode in the cloud. In this paper; we present COLA;a system for Cloud Online Aggregation to provide progressive approximate answers for bothsingle tables and joined multiple tables. We develop an online query processing algorithmfor MapReduce to support incremental and continuous computing of aggregations on …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,23
A new dynamic hash index for flash-based storage,Xiang Li; Zhou Da; Xiaofeng Meng,Compared with traditional magnetic disks; Flash memory has many advantages and hasbeen used as external storage media for a wide spectrum of electronic devices (such asPDA; MP3; Digital Camera and Mobile Phone) in recent years. As the capacity increasesand price drops; it looks like a perfect alternative for magnetic disks. However; due tohardware limitations of flash memory; techniques including storage subsystem and indexingoriginally designed for magnetic disks can not run smoothly in a flash memory without anymodification. In this paper we explore problems of indexing flash-resided data and present anew dynamical hash index for flash memory in two schemas. The analysis and experimentalresults validate the efficiency of our design.,Web-Age Information Management; 2008. WAIM'08. The Ninth International Conference on,2008,23
Clustering objects in a road network.,Ji-Dong Chen; Xiao-Feng Meng; Cai-Feng Lai,Most spatial clustering algorithms deal with the objects in Euclidean space. In many realapplications; however; the accessibility of spatial objects is constrained by spatial networks(eg road network). It is therefore more realistic to work on clustering objects in a roadnetwork. The distance metric in such setting is redefined by the network distance; which hasto be computed by the expensive shortest path distance over the network. The existingmethods are not applicable to such cases. Therefore; by exploiting unique features of roadnetworks; two new clustering algorithms are presented; which use the information of nodesand edges in the network to prune the search space and avoid some unnecessary distancecomputations. The experimental results indicate that the algorithms achieve high efficiencyfor clustering objects in real road network.,Ruan Jian Xue Bao(Journal of Software),2007,23

Data extraction from the web based on pre-defined schema,Xiaofeng Meng; Hongjun Lu; Haiyan Gang; Mingzhe Gu,Abstract With the development of the Internet; the World Wide Web has become aninvaluable information source for most organizations. However; most documents availablefrom the Web are in HTML form which is originally designed for document formatting withlittle consideration of its contents. Effectively extracting data from such documents remains anontrivial task. In this paper; we present a schema-guided approach to extracting data fromHTML pages. Under the approach; the user defines a schema specifying what to beextracted and provides sample mappings between the schema and the HTML page. Thesystem will induce the mapping rules and generate a wrapper that takes the HTML page asinput and produces the required data in the form of XML conforming to the user-definedschema. A prototype system implementing the approach has been developed. The …,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2002,23
Efficient query processing for XML keyword queries based on the IDList index,Junfeng Zhou; Zhifeng Bao; Wei Wang; Jinjia Zhao; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract Keyword search over XML data has attracted a lot of research efforts in the lastdecade; where one of the fundamental research problems is how to efficiently answer agiven keyword query wrt a certain query semantics. We found that the key factor resulting inthe inefficiency for existing methods is that they all heavily suffer from the common-ancestor-repetition problem. In this paper; we propose a novel form of inverted list; namely the IDList;the IDList for keyword k consists of ordered nodes that directly or indirectly contain k. Wethen show that finding keyword query results based on the smallest lowest commonancestor and exclusive lowest common ancestor semantics can be reduced to ordered setintersection problem; which has been heavily optimized due to its application in areas suchas information retrieval and database systems. We propose several algorithms that …,The VLDB Journal,2014,22
Facilitating inter-application interactions for OS-level virtualization,Zhiyong Shan; Xin Wang; Tzi-cker Chiueh; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract OS-level virtualization generates a minimal start-up and run-time overhead on thehost OS and thus suits applications that require both good isolation and high efficiency.However; multiple-member applications required for forming a system may need tooccasionally communicate across this isolation barrier to cooperate with each other whilethey are separated in different VMs to isolate intrusion or fault. Such application scenariosare often critical to enterprise-class servers; HPC clusters and intrusion/fault-tolerantsystems; etc. We make the first effort to support the inter-application interactions in an OS-level virtualization system without causing a significant compromise on VM isolation. Weidentify all interactive operations that impact inter-application interactions; including inter-process communications; application invocations; resource name transfers and …,ACM SIGPLAN Notices,2012,22
Query Understanding through Knowledge-Based Conceptualization.,Zhongyuan Wang; Kejun Zhao; Haixun Wang; Xiaofeng Meng; Ji-Rong Wen,Abstract The goal of query conceptualization is to map instances in a query to conceptsdefined in a certain ontology or knowledge base. Queries usually do not observe the syntaxof a written language; nor do they contain enough signals for statistical inference. However;the available context; ie; the verbs related to the instances; the adjectives and attributes ofthe instances; do provide valuable clues to understand instances. In this paper; we first minea variety of relations among terms from a large web corpus and map them to relatedconcepts using a probabilistic knowledge base. Then; for a given query; we conceptualizeterms in the query using a random walk based iterative algorithm. Finally; we examine ourmethod on real data and compare it to representative previous methods.

Short-Term Wind Power Forecasting Using Gaussian Processes.,Niya Chen; Zheng Qian; Ian T Nabney; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract Since wind has an intrinsically complex and stochastic nature; accurate wind powerforecasts are necessary for the safety and economics of wind energy utilization. In thispaper; we investigate a combination of numeric and probabilistic models: one-day-aheadwind power forecasts were made with Gaussian Processes (GPs) applied to the outputs of aNumerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model. Firstly the wind speed data from NWP wascorrected by a GP. Then; as there is always a defined limit on power generated in a windturbine due the turbine controlling strategy; a Censored GP was used to model therelationship between the corrected wind speed and power output. To validate the proposedapproach; two real world datasets were used for model construction and testing. Thesimulation results were compared with the persistence method and Artificial Neural …,IJCAI,2013,21
ESQP: an efficient SQL query processing for cloud data management,Jing Zhao; Xiangmei Hu; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract Recently; the cloud computing platform is getting more and more attentions as anew trend of data management. Currently there are several cloud computing products thatcan provide various services. However; most cloud platforms are not designed for structureddata management. So they rarely support SQL queries directly. Even though some platformssupport SQL queries; their bottoms are traditional relational database; therefore; the cost forexecuting a subquery in RDBS may influence the overall query performance. How toimprove query efficiency in cloud data management system; especially query on structureddata has become a more and more important problem.

Stability investigation of a decagonal Al—Cu—Co quasicrystal,Y He; H Chen; XF Meng; SJ Poon; GJ Shiflet,Abstract The stability of the decagonal phase of Al65Cu15; Co20 (d phase) has beenstudied through thermal annealing; electron beam irradiation and recovery experimentsusing X-ray and electron diffraction techniques. Long-term annealing of as-cast and melt-spun samples over the temperature 940 to 550° C did not show a decagonal-to-crystallinephase transformation. Upon electron-beam irradiation; the d phase transformed to a fccphase with a= 351 Å; and the d phase was recovered by heating the fcc phase to 600° C. Asimple cubic (sc) phase with a= 2.87 Å was found in thin-film samples slightly off the d phasecomposition; and it transformed partially to the d phase at 600° C. At high temperature (∼900° C); the d and sc coexist in the off-composition thin-film and melt-spun samples.Implications of our results on the stability of decagonal Al—Cu—Co are discussed.,Philosophical Magazine Letters,1991,20
ACR: an adaptive cost-aware buffer replacement algorithm for flash storage devices,Xian Tang; Xiaofeng Meng,Flash disks are being widely used as an important alternative to conventional magneticdisks; although accessed through the same interface by applications; their distinguishedfeature; ie; different read and write cost in the aspects of time; makes it necessary toreconsider the design of existing replacement algorithms to leverage their performancepotential. Different from existing flash-aware buffer replacement policies that focus on theasymmetry of read and write operations; we address the “discrepancy” of the asymmetry fordifferent flash disks; which is the fact that exists for a long time; while has drawn littleattention by researchers since most existing flash-aware buffer replacement polices aresomewhat based on the assumption that the cost of read operation is neglectable comparedwith that of write operation. In fact; this is not true for current flash disks on the market. We …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2010 Eleventh International Conference on,2010,19
Supporting context-based query in personal DataSpace,Yukun Li; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract Many users need to refer to content in existing files (pictures; tables; emails; webpages and etc.) when they write documents (programs; presentations; proposals and etc.);and often need to revisit these referenced files for review; revision or reconfirmation.Therefore it is meaningful to discover an approach to help users revisit these referenceseffectively. Traditional approaches (file explorer; desktop search; and etc.) fail to work in thiscase. In this paper; we propose an efficient solution for this problem. We firstly define a newpersonal data relationship: Context-based Reference (CR); which is generated by userbehaviors. We also propose efficient methods to identify CR relationship and present a newtype of query based on it: Context-based Query (C-Query); which helps users efficientlyrevisit personal documents based on CR relationship.

Overview of a chinese natural language interface to databases: Nchiql,Xiaofeng Meng; Shan Wang; Kam Fai Wong,Numerous natural language interface to databases (NLIDBs) which were developed in themid-1980s demonstrated impressive characteristics in certain application areas. But NLIDBsdid not gain the expected commercial acceptance. We argue that this was due to two majorreasons; ie; limited portability and poor usability. This paper describes the design andimplementation of NChiql; a Chinese natural language interface to databases. We define theSemantic Conceptual Model (SCM) for the domain specific knowledge representations andextraction strategies. SCM depicts database semantics and is used to formulate naturallanguage queries. Further; we present a novel method to process the Chinese naturallanguage queries.

RecipeCrawler: collecting recipe data from www incrementally,Yu Li; Xiaofeng Meng; Liping Wang; Qing Li,Abstract WWW has posed itself as the largest data repository ever available in the history ofhumankind. Utilizing the Internet as a data source seems to be natural and many effortshave been made. In this paper we focus on establishing a robust system to collect structuredrecipe data from the Web incrementally; which; as we believe; is a critical step towardspractical; continuous; reliable web data extraction systems and therefore utilizing WWW asdata sources for various database applications. The reasons for advocating such anincremental approach are two-fold:(1) it is impractical to crawl all the recipe pages fromrelevant web sites as the Web is highly dynamic;(2) it is almost impossible to induce ageneral wrapper for future extraction from the initial batch of recipe web pages. In this paper;we describe such a system called RecipeCrawler which targets at incrementally …,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2006,18
Differentially private set-valued data release against incremental updates,Xiaojian Zhang; Xiaofeng Meng; Rui Chen,Abstract Publication of the private set-valued data will provide enormous opportunities forcounting queries and various data mining tasks. Compared to those previous methodsbased on partition-based privacy models (eg; k-anonymity); differential privacy providesstrong privacy guarantees against adversaries with arbitrary background knowledge.However; the existing solutions based on differential privacy for data publication arecurrently limited to static datasets; and do not adequately address today's demand for up-to-date information. In this paper; we address the problem of differentially private set-valueddata release on an incremental scenario in which the data need to be transformed are notstatic. Motivated by this; we propose an efficient algorithm; called IncTDPart; to incrementallygenerate a series of differentially private releases. The proposed algorithm is based on …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2013,17

Efficient index update for moving objects with future trajectories,Rui Ding; Xiaofeng Meng; Yun Bai,Recently; more research has been conducted on moving object databases (MOD). Typically;there are three kinds of data for dynamic attributes in MOD; ie; historical; current and future.Although many index structures have been developed for the former two types of data; thereis not much work to deal with the future data. In particular; the problem of index update hasnot been addressed with efficient methods. This paper proposes a novel spatio-temporalindex based on PMR quadtree; which is called Future Trajectory Quadtree (FT-Quadtree).FT-Quadtree adopts a trajectory segment shared structure and depicts an efficient updatealgorithm. The performance studies have shown that FT-Quadtree has superiority to thetraditional one in index maintenance.,Database Systems for Advanced Applications; 2003.(DASFAA 2003). Proceedings.

An experimental study on huff-n-puff gas injection to enhance condensate recovery in shale gas reservoirs,Xingbang Meng; Yang Yu; James J Sheng,Abstract Due to the low gas price; production of liquid oil has attained more attention.Producers are seeking to maximize liquid oil production from gas-condensate reservoirs.However; once a shale gas-condensate reservoir is produced; by reservoir depletion; thepressure near the well will decrease below the dew point pressure because of its ultra-lowpermeability. Then liquid condensate forms. The liquid condensate accumulates near awellbore forming condensate banking; thus gas productivity is decreased. And the low-saturation condensate in the formation could remain unproduced.,*,2015,16
Progression of solitary and multifocal papillary thyroid carcinoma-a retrospective study of 368 patients.,XQ Zheng; C Wang; M Xu; Y Yu; XW Yun; YS Jia; SF Wei; XB Ren; M Gao,BACKGROUND: Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) represents one of the most frequentendocrine malignancies. Several factors have been found to be involved in determining theoutcome of treatment for patients with PTC. Large tumor size; diagnosis at an early age;extra-thyroidal invasion; aggressive histological variants; and distant metastases are themost important determinants of a poor outcome. BRAF (V600E) mutation has been found tobe a major genetic alteration in PTC. This study aimed to evaluate progression in patientswith multifocal and solitary PTC. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study to analyze368 patients with PTC who underwent surgery; including 282 patients with solitary PTC and86 patients with multifocal PTC.

Updating of extended preorder numbering scheme on XML.,Dao-Feng Luo; Xiao-Feng Meng; Yu Jiang,Most of the XML query processing strategies are based on some numbering schemes.Nodes on the XML tree will be assigned a unique code by the numbering scheme; andancestor-descendant relationship could be directly told through the codes. The most famousnumbering scheme is Region Based Numbering Scheme. However; XML data will beupdated. Once the data is updated; the region code should be adjusted to keep the indexingand query processing techniques working. Unfortunately; few studies have been reported onthe issue of the numbering scheme. This paper focuses on this issue; proposing a series ofspace preserving and updating algorithms. Extensive experiments are conducted to test theeffectiveness of the algorithms.,Ruan Jian Xue Bao(J. Softw.),2005,16
XSeq: an indexing infrastructure for tree pattern queries,Xiaofeng Meng; Yu Jiang; Yan Chen; Haixun Wang,Abstract Given a tree-pattern query; most XML indexing approaches decompose it intomultiple sub-queries; and then join their results to provide the answer to the original query.Join operations have been identified as the most time-consuming component in XML queryprocessing. XSeq is a powerful XML indexing infrastructure which makes tree patterns a firstclass citizen in XML query processing. Unlike most indexing methods that directlymanipulate tree structures; XSeq builds its indexing infrastructure on a much simpler datamodel: sequences. That is; we represent both XML data and XML queries by structure-encoded sequences. We have shown that this new data representation preserves queryequivalence; and more importantly; through subsequence matching; structured queries canbe answered directly without resorting to expensive join operations. Moreover; the XSeq …,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2004,16
OrientXA: an effective XQuery algebra,MENG Xiao-feng; Luo Dao-feng; Jiang Yu; Wang Yu,Abstract: XQuery is the recommended standard for XML Query. XQuery processingstrategies can be classified into two categories: core syntax based strategy (node-oriented)and algebra based strategy (set-oriented). Neither of them can handle XQuery well. Thesyntax based strategy is inefficient and hard to optimize; while the current algebra basedstrategies can not satisfy the flexible programming characteristics of XQuery. Aftersummarizing the current stage and unsolved problems of former algebra based works; aneffective XQuery algebra system; OrientXA; is proposed in this paper; ideas from bothstrategies are embodied in it.

Efficient algorithms for approximate member extraction using signature-based inverted lists,Jiaheng Lu; Jialong Han; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract We study the problem of approximate membership extraction (AME); ie; how toefficiently extract substrings in a text document that approximately match some strings in agiven dictionary. This problem is important in a variety of applications such as named entityrecognition and data cleaning. We solve this problem in two steps. In the first step; for eachsubstring in the text; we filter away the strings in the dictionary that are very different from thesubstring. In the second step; each candidate string is verified to decide whether thesubstring should be extracted. We develop an incremental algorithm using signature-basedinverted lists to minimize the duplicate list-scan operations of overlapping windows in thetext.

As a result; the various replica control protocols that exist today in traditionaldistributed and multidatabase environments are no longer suitable. To solve this problem; anew mobile database replication scheme; the Transaction-Level Result-Set Propagation(TLRSP) model; is put forward in this paper.

Inorder to compare the performance of the TLRSP model with that of other mobile replicationschemes; we have developed a detailed simulation model. Experimental results show thatthe TLRSP model provides an efficient support for replicated mobile database systems byreducing reprocessing overhead and maintaining database consistency.,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2002,15

In this paper; we propose a noveltechnique to the problem of differentiating roles of data items from Web pages; which is oneof the key problems in our automatic extraction approach. The problem is resolved at variouslevels: semantic blocks; sections and data items; and several approaches are proposed toeffectively identify the mapping between data items having the same role. Intensiveexperiments on real web sites show that the proposed technique can effectively helpextracting desired data with high accuracies in most of the cases.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2005,13
A novel conflict detection and resolution strategy based on TLRSP in replicated mobile database systems,Zhiming Ding; Xiaofeng Meng; Shan Wang,Replication is one of the key technologies in promoting the performance of mobile databasesystems. In this paper; a novel mobile database replication scheme; the transaction-levelresult-set propagation (TLRSP) model; is put forward. A conflict detection and resolutionstrategy based on TLRSP is discussed in detail and its implementation algorithm isproposed. In the TLRSP model; mobile users are allowed to access local replicas of thedatabase and to submit local transactions when the system is disconnected. The locallycommitted transactions are sent to a fixed database server for conflict reconciliation andresult-set incorporation when the system is reconnected. The TLRSP model uses theincremental refreshing method to synchronize database replicas and to maintain theconsistency of the replicated mobile database system.,Database Systems for Advanced Applications; 2001.

Efficient processing of spatial keyword queries on HBase,Yu Zhang; You-Zhong Ma; Xiao-Feng Meng,With the development of mobile positioning and the popularity of mobile phones; spatio-textual objects in the Internet increases rapidly. Thus; how to process the spatial keywordquery under the massive sptaio-textual objects that are still increasing efficiently becomes abig problem for the spatial keyword query applications. Most of the existing approachesused hybrid indexes; which always combined the R-tree with the inverted files together; toanswer the spatial keyword queries. However; when confronted with the massive andincreasing spatio-textual objects; these approaches couldn't support the efficiency andscalability of spatial keyword query well. In this paper; we propose a novel HBase-basedindex structure for spatio-textual objects; named SK-HBase. SK-HBase uses HBase for datastorage and indexes the textual and spatial information of objects at the same time …,Journal of Chinese Computer Systems,2012,12
Exploring Personal corespace for dataspace management,Yukun Li; Xiaofeng Meng,With rapid increment of personal data amount; how to efficiently search Personal DataSpace(PDS) becomes an interesting and promising research topic. Popular methods include folderexplorer; desktop search tools; and etc. Because these methods ignore user features; theyfail to work well in some cases. For example; sometimes users expect to relocate a personaldocument based on some fuzzy memory clues; such as its type; access time; and so on.These queries can't be supported well by current personal data management tools. The aimof this paper is to discover effective methods to help users search Personal DataSpace. Wetake Semantic Link Network (SLN) to describe PDS; and divide the semantic links of PDSinto two classes: Objective Semantic Link (OSL) and Memory-based Semantic Link (MSL).Base on MSL; we propose a concept\emph {Personal CoreSpace (PCS)}; which is a …,Semantics; Knowledge and Grid; 2009.

Image Edge Detection Based on Contourlet Modulus Maxima [J],Yue-ting ZHANG; Xiao-feng MENG; Zhong-ke YIN; Jian-ying WANG,Available image edge detection schemes based on the spacial domain or wavelet transformdomain can capture only limited directional edges in images. A new edge detection schemeis proposed via searching modulus maxima in the contourlet subbands. The contourletexpansion satisfies the parabolic scaling by adjusting the number of directions at each scaleappropriately. With sufficient directional vanishing moments; Contourlets achieve the optimalapproximation rate for smooth contours and geometric structures in images. The input imageis expanded by the nonsubsampled contourlet transform; and every coefficient in thesubbands is thresholded by comparing against the adaptive thresholds. Based on thedirections of each directional subband and its gradient; modulus maxima of the transformcoefficients are obtained by comparing the modulus amplitudes of the samples and the …,Journal of the China Railway Society,2008,12
An OS security protection model for defeating attacks from network,Zhiyong Shan; Qiuyue Wang; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract Security threats to operating systems today largely come from network. Traditionaldiscretionary access control mechanism alone can hardly defeat them. Although traditionalmandatory access control models can effectively protect the security of OS; they haveproblems of application incompatibility and administration complexity. In this paper; wepropose a new model; Suspicious-Taint-Based Access Control (STBAC) model; fordefeating network attacks while maintaining good compatibility; simplicity and systemperformance. STBAC regards processes using Non-Trustable-Communications as startingpoints of suspicious taint; traces activities of the suspiciously tainted processes by taint rules;and forbids the suspiciously tainted processes to illegally access vital resources byprotection rules.

EasyQuerier: a keyword based interface for web database integration system,Xian Li; Weiyi Meng; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract Recently a lot of work on integrating the search interfaces of multiple Webdatabases of the same domain into an integrated interface has been reported. Suchintegrated interfaces enable users to search multiple Web databases using one query.However; there are two potential problems when using these integrated interfaces inpractice. First; if the number of domains is large; it may be difficult for users to find the correctdomain. Second; the integrated interfaces can become too complicated for ordinary users touse. In this paper; we propose a system called EasyQuerier to tackle these problems.EasyQuerier allows the users to submit keyword-based queries to access the Webdatabases by first mapping a keyword-based user query to a suitable domain and thentranslating the user query to a well-formatted query on the integrated interface of the …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,12
A supervised visual wrapper generator for web-data extraction,Xiaofeng Meng; Haiyan Wang; Dongdong Hu; Chen Li,Extracting data from Web pages using wrappers is a fundamental problem arising in a largevariety of applications of vast practical interest. In this paper; we propose a novel schema-guided approach to wrapper generation. We provide a user-friendly interface that allowsusers to define the schema of the data to be extracted; and specifies mappings from a HTMLpage to the target schema. Based on the mappings; the system can automatically generatean extraction rule to extract data from the page. Our approach to wrapper generation cansignificantly reduce the work of human beings in this process. And the user never has todeal with the internal extraction rule; or even familiarity with the details of HTML.,Computer Software and Applications Conference; 2003. COMPSAC 2003.

Preserving location privacy without exact locations in mobile services,Xiao Pan; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract Privacy preservation has recently received considerable attention in location-basedservices (LBSs). A large number of location cloaking algorithms have been proposed forprotecting the location privacy of mobile users. However; most existing cloaking approachesassume that mobile users are trusted. And exact locations are required to protect locationprivacy; which is exactly the information mobile users want to hide. In this paper; we proposeap-anti-conspiration privacy model to anonymize over semi-honest users. Furthermore; twok* NNG-based cloaking algorithms; vk* NNCA and ek* NNCA; are proposed to protectlocation privacy without exact locations. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposedalgorithms are validated by a series of carefully designed experiments.

A new type of fast dew point sensor using quartz crystal without frequency measurement,Jing Nie; Jia Liu; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract Aiming at solving the problem of atmospheric humidity measurement; a new dewpoint sensor using quartz crystal without frequency measurement has been developed. Thesensor is composed of the Peltier module and the quartz crystal. When active condensationbegins to occur in the quartz crystal surface; the electrical characteristics of the quartz crystalwill change. Consequently; the oscillation characteristics of the resonant circuit containingthe quartz crystal will also change. Hence; the oscillation characteristics change can beused to identify the time of condensation. The cessation of oscillation was measured; dueprimarily to signal attenuation caused by dew formation. This method uses the sensitiveproperties of quartz crystal but with no frequency measurement and also exploit the stabilityof the circuit.

However; database query processing engines are designed based on thefundamental characteristics of HDDs; so they may not benefit immediately from SSDs.Previous researches on optimizing database query processing on SSDs have mainlyfocused on leveraging the high random data access performance of SSDs and avoidingslow random writes whenever possible. However; they fail to exploit the rich internalparallelism of SSDs. In this paper; we focus on exploiting rich internal parallelism of SSDs tooptimize scan and join operators. Firstly; we detect internal parallelism of SSDs seemed …,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2013,7

Co-spatial searcher: Efficient tag-based collaborative spatial search on geo-social network,Jinzeng Zhang; Xiaofeng Meng; Xuan Zhou; Dongqi Liu,Abstract The proliferation of geo-social network; such as Foursquare and Facebook Places;enables users to generate location information and its corresponding descriptive tags. Usinggeo-social networks; users with similar interests can plan for social activities collaboratively.This paper proposes a novel type of query; called Tag-based top-k Collaborative Spatial(TkCoS) query; for users to make outdoor plans collaboratively. This type of queries aim toretrieve groups of geographic objects that can satisfy a group of users' requirementsexpressed in tags; while ensuring that the objects be within the minimum spatial distancefrom the users. To answer TkCoS queries efficiently; we introduce a hybrid index structurecalled Spatial-Tag R-tree (STR-tree); which is an extension of the R-tree. Based on STR-tree; we propose a query processing algorithm that utilizes both spatial and tag similarity …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2012,7

MRCoM: a cost model for range query translation in Deep Web data integration,Fangjiao Jiang; Linlin Jia; Weiyi Meng; Xiaofeng Meng,Due to the autonomy of web databases; a major challenge for query translation in a DeepWeb Data Integration System is the lack of cost models at the global level. In this paper; wepropose a Multiple-regression Cost Model (MrCoM) based on statistical analysis for globalrange queries that involve numeric range attributes. Using the MrCoM; the query translationstrategy for new global range queries can be inferred. We also propose a Pre-processing-based Stepwise Algorithm (PSA) for selecting significant independent variables into theMrCoM. Experimental results demonstrate that the fitness of the MrCoM is good and theaccuracy of the query strategy selection is high.,Semantics; Knowledge and Grid; 2008. SKG'08.

Error Analysis and Modeling in Calibration of Accelerometers’ Nonlinear Terms’ Coefficients [J],Ren-xiao QIAO; Xiao-feng MENG; Hong JI,The error sources of linear accelerometers' calibration were analyzed by precisioncentrifuge testing. The systematic error propagation model of calibration for each coefficientof the property equation of the accelerometers was built. By this model; it could bequantificationally analyzed how each systematic error source influenced the calibrationresult of the equation coefficients. It is demonstrated that constant systematic errors of theacceleration values of the precision centrifuge outputs will not affect the coefficient of thethird-order term; while the linear varying errors of the acceleration values will not affect thecoefficient of the zero-order term; which represents the zero-g offset. The result of thetheoretical analysis was verified by simulation.,Journal of System Simulation,2008,6
Tracking network-constrained moving objects with group updates,Jidong Chen; Xiaofeng Meng; Benzhao Li; Caifeng Lai,Abstract Advances in wireless sensors and position technologies such as GPS enablelocation-based services that rely on the tracking of continuously changing positions ofmoving objects. The key issue in tracking techniques is how to minimize the number ofupdates; while providing accurate locations for query results. In this paper; for trackingnetwork-constrained moving objects; we first propose a simulation-based prediction modelwith more accurate location prediction for objects movements in a traffic road network; whichlowers the update frequency and assures the location precision. Then; according to theirpredicted future functions; objects are grouped and only the central object in each groupreports its location to the server.

Formation and Evolution of the Chemo Ancient Upliftand Its Influence on Reservoir Formation in the Central Area; the Junggar Basin,Zhu Yun-hui; Meng Xian-long,The Chemo ancient uplift is a large-scale uplift stretching across the Junggar basin formedduring the Yanshan period. With seismic cross-section" level flatten" method; we divide theChemo ancient uplift into 4 evolution stages: the initial forming stage (J1); the intensedevelopment stage (J1+ 3); the concealing and burring stage (KE); and the lift incline andextinction stage (NQ). On this foundation we analyze the Chemo ancient uplift's influence onreservoir formation of the central area of Junggar basin. The Chemo ancient uplift's growthand evolution have created unique background for oil-gas transmission and accumulationand unique trap condition; which dominate the central area's characteristics of multi-stagetectonic evolution and multi-stage reservoir formation.,West China Petroleum Geosciences,2005,6

NbN edge junction fabrication: edge profile control by reactive ion etching,XF Meng; RS Amos; AW Lichtenberger; RJ Mattauch; MJ Feldman,In order to fabricate NbN edge junctions with low parasitic capacitance; an insulator with lowdielectric constant; such as SiO/sub 2/; must isolate the base and counterelectrode excepton the edge. Reactive ion etching was used to cut an edge in SiO/sub 2//NbN bilayer films.For this process it is necessary that SiO/sub 2/be etched more rapidly than NbN to form asuitably sloped edged profile. The authors investigated the influence of etching gascomposition and other parameters on etching rates and edge profiles; using CF/sub 4/;CF/sub 4//O/sub 2/; CF/sub 4//CH/sub 4/; CF/sub 4//CHF/sub 3/; and CHF/sub 3/.

Set similarity join on massive probabilistic data using MapReduce,Youzhong Ma; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract In this paper; we focus on set similarity join on massive probabilistic data usingMapReduce; there is no effective approach that can process this problem efficiently.MapReduce is a popular paradigm that can process large volume data more efficiently; inthis paper; we proposed two approaches using MapReduce to deal with this task: HadoopJoin by Map Side Pruning and Hadoop Join by Reduce Side Pruning. Hadoop Join by MapSide Pruning uses the sum of the existence probability to filter out the probabilistic setsdirectly at the Map task side which have no any chance to be similar with any otherprobabilistic set. Hadoop Join by Reduce Side Pruning uses probability sum based pruningprinciple and probability upper bound based pruning principle to reduce the candidate pairsat Reduce task side; it can save the comparison cost.

Moreand more companies start to migrate their data into cloud data management systems. Joinquery becomes a challenging research problem in cloud. To finish a join query in the cloud;data among different nodes need to be transferred. The arrangement of data transmissionand local data processing is known as a distribution strategy for a query. The transmissioncost (network workload between servers and the transmission time delay) will be very high ifthe strategy is not properly chosen. Existing cloud systems either do not support join queryor just use MapReduce to support some simple join queries. The problem of usingredundant data for join query optimization in cloud environment is studied in this paper.

Out-of-order durable event processing in integrated wireless networks,Chunjie Zhou; Xiaofeng Meng; Yueguo Chen,Abstract Many events in real world applications are long-lasting events which have certaindurations. The temporal relationships among those durable events are often complex.Processing such complex events has become increasingly important in applications ofwireless networks. An important issue of complex event processing is to extract patterns fromevent streams to support decision making in real-time. However; network latencies andmachine failures in wireless networks may cause events to be out-of-order. In this work; weanalyze the preliminaries of event temporal semantics. A tree-plan model of out-of-orderdurable events is proposed. A hybrid solution is correspondingly introduced.

Preference-based top-k spatial keyword queries,Jinzeng Zhang; Dongqi Liu; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract With proliferation of geo-positioning and geo-tagging; spatial keyword query hasbeen an attractive and challenging topic that blooms various interesting applications inspatial databases. However; spatial keyword queries in those fields do not always satisfyusers requirements. One reason for those queries contain fuzzy linguistic labels that oftenembody users preference; eg; finding hotels near Zhongguancun with moderate price. In thispaper; we define Preference-based Top-k Spatial Keyword (PTkSK) query for coping withfuzzy labels. Existing works only consider on spatial locations; textual descriptions andoverlook users preference. In order to answer (PTkSK) queries efficiently; we propose ahybrid index structure called AIR-tree (Attribute-Inverted file R-tree); which combineslocation proximity with preference similarity and textual relevance.

The calculation and comparison of theapproximate entropy on voltage signal under different welding parameters; such as weldingspeeds; wire feed speeds; duty cycle and so on; shows that the approximate entropy ofvoltage can reflect the stability of the process of aluminum alloy pulsed MIG welding. Theresults show that the smaller the average value of approximate entropy; the more stable thewelding process will be.

Duplicate identification in deep web data integration,Wei Liu; Xiaofeng Meng; Jianwu Yang; Jianguo Xiao,Abstract Duplicate identification is a critical step in deep web data integration; and generally;this task has to be performed over multiple web databases. However; a customized matcherfor two web databases often does not work well for other two ones due to variouspresentations and different schemas. It is not practical to build and maintain C^2_n matchersfor n web databases. In this paper; we target at building one universal matcher over multipleweb databases in one domain. According to our observation; the similarity on an attribute isdependent of those of some other attributes; which is ignored by existing approaches.Inspired by this; we propose a comprehensive solution for duplicate identification problemover multiple web databases.

Selectivity estimation for exclusive query translation in deep web data integration,Fangjiao Jiang; Weiyi Meng; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract In Deep Web data integration; some Web database interfaces express exclusivepredicates of the form Q e= P i (P i∈ P 1; P 2;...; P m); which permits only one predicate to beselected at a time. Accurately and efficiently estimating the selectivity of each Q e is of criticalimportance to optimal query translation. In this paper; we mainly focus on the selectivityestimation on infinite-value attribute which is more difficult than that on key attribute andcategorical attribute. Firstly; we compute the attribute correlation and retrieve approximaterandom attribute-level samples through submitting queries on the least correlative attributeto the actual Web database. Then we estimate Zipf equation based on the word rank of thesample and the actual selectivity of several words from the actual Web database. Finally; theselectivity of any word on the infinite-value attribute can be derived by the Zipf equation …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2009,5

On view transformation support for a native XML DBMS,Daofeng Luo; Ting Chen; Tok Wang Ling; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract XML is becoming the standard data exchange format. View transformation of XMLdata is important and frequent operation in XML data integration and publishing. In schema-based view transformation; users define view schema over sources to obtain view results.This declarative approach alleviates user from writing complex scripts to perform viewtransformation. Current available schema formats are unable to express views with complexsemantic constraints. In this paper; we introduce a semantically expressive XML data model:Object-Relationship-Attribute model for Semi-Structured data (ORA-SS); which allows usersto define view schemas with rich semantic meanings. Combine with ORA-SS; we use anative XML DBMS: OrientStore to perform accurate and efficient view transformation.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2004,5

Distribution of the Vrn-D1b allele associated with facultative growth habit in Chinese wheat accessions,Xian-rui Guo; Yuan-yuan Wang; Ling-zhi Meng; Hong-wei Liu; Li Yang; Yang Zhou; Hong-jun Zhang,Abstract Vernalization requirement in wheat is determined by allelic variation mainly at threeloci; Vrn-A1; Vrn-B1 and Vrn-D1. Up to 2011 only two alleles at the Vrn-D1 locus wereknown. The dominant allele; now designated as Vrn-D1a; confers spring growth habit; andthe other; recessive allele; vrn-D1; is associated with the winter growth habit. Recently; wefound an additional dominant allele; Vrn-D1b; associated with the facultative growth habit.As facultative wheat cultivars play an important role in wheat production we screened 689accessions from all over China; with a specific aim of determining the frequency anddistribution of Vrn-D1b. The results showed that Vrn-D1a; Vrn-D1b and vrn-D1 were presentin 27.3; 20.6 and 52.1% of all accessions; respectively.

Using encyclopedic knowledge to understand queries,Kejun Zhao; Xiaofeng Meng; Hehan Li; Zhongyuan Wang,Abstract Query understanding is a challenging but beneficial task. In this paper; we proposea context-aware method to use the encyclopedic knowledge to aid in query understanding.Given a query; we first use a dictionary constructed from the encyclopedic knowledge basesto detect the possible entities and their associated categories. Then; we use a topic basedethod to derive semantic information from the query. By comparing the topical similaritybetween various candidate phrases; we get the most likely entities and their relatedcategories. Experimental results show that our method has achieved a great improvementover previous approaches and the efficiency is acceptable for online search.,Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Novel Web Search Interfaces and Systems,2015,4
Testing vibration rectification error with vibrafuge,W Guan; XF Meng; XM Dong,Abstract Investigation of this paper is a preliminary to the calibration of vibration rectificationerror (VRE) with multiple inputs. Considering the accelerometers stimulated by vibration andintended input; present testing methods for VRE cannot evaluate the exact influence ofvibration. For measuring VRE caused by concurrent constant and vibratory accelerations; amulti-component mechanical system called vibrafuge was introduced. At first; combinedaccelerations produced by the vibrafuge was deduced by homogeneous coordinatetransformation. Validation of testing VRE with vibrafuge is done by the equation of thecombined accelerations. Then a general expression of the VRE caused by the combinedaccelerations was derived from a model of the accelerometer under test. Based on the VREmodel; linear relation between the constant acceleration and VRE was testified by …,Mapan,2014,4
Research on the Efficiency Improvement of Design for Testability Using Test Point Allocation,Guohua Wang; Qiang Li; Xiaomei Chen; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract Traditional design for testability (DFT) is arduous and time-consuming because ofthe iterative process of testability assessment and design modification. To improve the DFTefficiency; a DFT process based on test point allocation is proposed. In this process; the setof optimal test points will be automatically allocated according to the signal reachabilityunder the constraints of testability criteria. Thus; the iterative DFT process will be completedby computer and the test engineers will be released to concentrate on the system designrather than the repetitive modification process. To perform test point allocation; thedependency matrix of signal to potential test point (SP-matrix) is defined based on multi-signal flow graph. Then; genetic algorithm (GA) is adopted to search for the optimal test pointallocation solution based on the SP-matrix. At last; experiment is carried out to evaluate …,Journal of Electronic Testing,2014,4
Heart motion prediction in robotic-assisted beating heart surgery: A nonlinear fast adaptive approach,Fan Liang; Yang Yu; Haizhong Wang; Xiaofeng Meng,Off-pump Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery outperforms traditional on-pumpsurgery because the assisted robotic tools can alleviate the relative motion between thebeating heart and robotic tools. Therefore; it is possible for the surgeon to operate on thebeating heart and thus lessens post surgery complications for the patients. Due to the highlyirregular and non-stationary nature of heart motion; it is critical that the beating heart motionis predicted in the model-based track control procedures. It is technically preferable to modelheart motion in a nonlinear way because the characteristic analysis of 3D heart motion datathrough Bi-spectral analysis and Fourier methods demonstrates the involved nonlinearity ofheart motion. We propose an adaptive nonlinear heart motion model based on the VolterraSeries in this paper. We also design a fast lattice structure to achieve computational …,International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems,2013,4
An efficient approach for continuous density queries,Jie Wen; Xiaofeng Meng; Xing Hao; Jianliang Xu,Abstract In location-based services; a density query returns the regions with highconcentrations of moving objects (MOs). The use of density queries can help users identifycrowded regions so as to avoid congestion. Most of the existing methods try very hard toimprove the accuracy of query results; but ignore query efficiency. However; response timeis also an important concern in query processing and may have an impact on userexperience. In order to address this issue; we present a new definition of continuous densityqueries. Our approach for processing continuous density queries is based on the new notionof a safe interval; using which the states of both dense and sparse regions are dynamicallymaintained. Two indexing structures are also used to index candidate regions foraccelerating query processing and improving the quality of results. The efficiency and …,Frontiers of Computer Science,2012,4

Model-following control of assisted robotics in CABG surgery,Fan Liang; Xiao-Feng Meng; Deng-Feng Dong,In the Off Pump Canary Artery Bypass Graphed (CABG) surgery; a robot is usually used todynamically track the Point of Interest (POI) on the beating heart. To achieve better trackingperformance and cancel the relative motion of the heart and the assisted robotics; anadaptive Auto-regessive (AR) linear model of heart motion was built to convert thecomplicated heart motion tracking problem to a dynamic model following problem. TheKalman filter was used to estimate the motion state of the assisted system and the linearquadratic optimal tracking theory was used to implement the model-following method. Theresults show that the model-following method which provides estimated future referenceenables the robot to improve the relative motion cancellation ability by 30% and decreasethe tracking error by 0.25 mm.

Then several interesting scenes (eg; o 1; o2; o 3; o 4; o 5; o 6) with larger weights (eg; w 1; w 2; w 3; w 4; w 5; w 6) will be chosen. Thegoal of our work is to provide the traveler with the optimal STS; which passes through asmany chosen scenes as possible with the maximum weight and the minimum distancewithin his travel time (eg; one day).

Cost-based buffer management algorithm for flash database systems,Tang Xian; Meng Xiao-feng; Liang Zhi-chao; Lu Ze-ping,Abstract: Different from existing flash-aware buffer replacement policies that focus on theasymmetry of read and write operations; this paper addresses the “discrepancy” of theasymmetry for different flash disks which has existed for a long time. The study proposes anadaptive replacement policy (CBLRU); which assigns to each page a weighted value thatcombines the IO cost and the influence of pages staying in the buffer. When selecting avictim page; the one with the minimum weighted value will be selected as the victim page;thus; one can avoid the problem of occupying the valid buffer space by dirty pages that arenot used for a long time. Moreover; as the cost of read and write operations will be adjustedaccording to different flash disks; CBLRU can wisely tune itself and adapt to different kinds offlash disks. Finally; a theorem is proposed addressing the stability of the relationship …,*,2011,4
Sub-Join: A Query Optimization Algorithm for Flash-based Database,Liang Zhi-chao; Zhou Da; Meng Xiao-feng,Abstract: Compared with Hard Drive Disk (HDD); SSD has a lot of advantages; such as highrandom read performance; low power consumption and lightweight form. Therefore it isenvisioned to be next generation data storage instead of HDD. However; the enhancementof query performance for flash-based database is not the same as the IO ratio of SSD toHDD. The reason is existing databases which are designed for HDD can not take fulladvantage of high IO performance of SSD. In this paper; a new join algorithm; Sub-Join; isproposed. Sub-Join first projects the column of join and primary key as Sub-Table; and thenexecutes join operations on Sub-Tables. Finally results are gotten from original tableaccording to the result of join on Sub-Tables.

Efficient processing of partially specified twig pattern queries,JunFeng Zhou; XiaoFeng Meng; TokWang Ling,Abstract As huge volumes of data are organized or exported in tree-structured form; it isquite necessary to extract useful information from these data collections using effective andefficient query processing methods. A natural way of retrieving desired information from XMLdocuments is using twig pattern (TP); which is; actually; the core component of existing XMLquery languages. Twig pattern possesses the inherent feature that query nodes on the samepath have concrete precedence relationships. It is this feature that makes it infeasible inmany actual scenarios. This has driven the requirement of relaxing the completespecification of a twig pattern to express more flexible semantic constraints in a single queryexpression. In this paper; we focus on query evaluation of partially specified twig pattern(PSTP) queries; through which we can reap the most flexibility of specifying partial …,Science in China Series F: Information Sciences,2009,4

Parallel similarity joins on massive high‐dimensional data using MapReduce,Youzhong Ma; Xiaofeng Meng; Shaoya Wang,SUMMARY In this paper; we focus on high-dimensional similarity join (HDSJ) usingMapReduce paradigm. As the volume of the data and the number of the dimensionsincrease; the computation cost of HDSJ will increase exponentially. There is no existingeffective approach that can process HDSJ efficiently; so we propose a novel method calledsymbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based HDSJ to deal with the problem. SAX is theabbreviation of symbolic aggregate approximation that is a dimensionality reductiontechnique and widely used in time series processing; we use SAX to represent the high-dimensional vectors in this paper and reorganize these vectors into groups based on theirSAX representations. For the very high-dimensional vectors; we also propose an improvedSAX-based HDSJ approach. Finally; we implement SAX-based HDSJ and improved SAX …,Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience,2016,3

Location Privacy Preserving without Exact Locations in Mobile Services,Xiao PAN; Xiaofeng MENG,Abstract Privacy preservation has recently received considerable attention in location-basedservices. A large number of location cloaking algorithms have been proposed for protectingthe location privacy of mobile users. However; most of existing cloaking approaches assumethat mobile users are trusted. And exact locations are required to protect location privacy;which are just the information mobile users want to hide. In this paper; we propose a p-anti-conspiring privacy model to anonymize over semi-honest users. Furthermore; two k∗ NNG-based cloaking algorithms; vk∗ NNCA and ek∗ NNCA; are proposed to protect the locationprivacy without exact locations. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithmsare validated by a series of carefully designed experiments. The experimental results showthat the price paid for location privacy protection without exact locations is small.,Frontiers of Computer Science,2013,3

Thisproblem is challenging to solve for two reasons: i) cloud is typically a large-scaleheterogeneous environment; which requires progress estimation to tailor to non-uniformhardware characteristics; and ii) cloud is often built with cheap and commodity hardware thatis prone to fail; so our estimation should be able to dynamically adjust. These twochallenges were largely unaddressed in previous work. In this paper; we propose PEQC; aProgress Estimator of Queries composed of MapReduce jobs in the Cloud.

However; most of existingworks address this issue only between two data sources; which are not practical to deepWeb data integration systems. That is; one duplicate entity matcher trained over two specificWeb databases cannot be applied to other Web databases. In addition; the cost of preparingthe training set for n Web databases is C_n^ 2 times higher than that for two Web databases.In this paper; we propose a holistic solution to address the new challenges posed by deepWeb; whose goal is to build one duplicate entity matcher over multiple Web databases …,Semantics Knowledge and Grid (SKG); 2010 Sixth International Conference on,2010,3
Fclock: an adaptive buffer replacement algorithm for SSD,Xian Tang; Xiao-Feng Meng,Abstract Different from existing flash-aware buffer replacement policies that focus on theasymmetry of read and write operations; the authors address the “discrepancy” of theasymmetry for different flash disks; which is the fact that exists for a long time; while hasdrawn little attention by researchers since most existing flash-aware buffer replacementpolices are somewhat based on the assumption that the cost of read operation isneglectable compared with that of write operation. This paper proposes an adaptivereplacement policy (FClock) which has two ring-shaped data structures; ie CC (their contentremain unchanged) and DC (their content is modified); to manage clean pages and dirtypages in the buffer; respectively. When selecting a victim page; FClock uses cost-basedheuristics to fairly make trade off between clean pages and dirty pages; and hence; can …,Jisuanji Xuebao(Chinese Journal of Computers),2010,3

HV-Recovery: A High Efficient Recovery Technique for Flash-Based Database [J],LU Ze-Ping MENG Xiao-Feng; ZHOU Da,Flash memory; as a new kind of data storage media; has a lot of attractive characteristicswhen compared with Hard Drive Disk (HDD) such as fast access speed; shock resistance;power saving; lighter form and low noise. Therefore flash memory is considered as the mainstorage device instead of disk in the next generation. However; traditional disk-baseddatabase can't take full advantage of high I/O performance of flash memory if we transfer it toflash memory without modification. The main reason is flash memory embraces differentaccess characteristics with HDD. As for recovery; the situation becomes more seriousbecause the out-of-place update model and erase-before-rewrite of flash memory lead tohigh cost of large quantity of minor random writes during the course of recovery.

Dew point measurement using dual quartz crystal resonator sensor,Jing Nie; Jia Liu; Ning Li; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract In order to solve the problem that the quartz crystal resonator (QCR) dew pointsensor in the measurement process cannot effectively eliminate the effect of temperature onthe frequency; a new sensor based on the dual quartz crystal resonator (D-QCR) has beendeveloped. The sensor combined Peltier module with two QCRs and the two QCRs werecooled by the same Peltier. One of these two QCRs only provides a reference frequencywithout gas contact and the other QCR is used for measuring dew point with gas contact.The frequency difference was calculated between the frequency difference of two QCRs atthe initial state and the frequency difference of two QCR when condensation occurs. Theobserved value was used as the calibration value of dew point recognition.

Dew point fast measurement in organic vapor mixtures using quartz resonant sensor,Jing Nie; Jia Liu; Xiaofeng Meng,A fast dew point sensor has been developed for organic vapor mixtures by using the quartzcrystal with sensitive circuits. The sensor consists of the quartz crystal and a cooler device.Proactive approach is taken to produce condensation on the surface of the quartz crystal;and it will lead to a change in electrical features of the quartz crystal. The cessation ofoscillation was measured because this phenomenon is caused by dew condensation. Sucha phenomenon can be used to detect the dew point. This method exploits the high sensitivityof the quartz crystal but without frequency measurement and also retains the stability of theresonant circuit. It is strongly anti-interfered. Its performance was evaluated with acetone–methanol mixtures under different pressures.

Orientstream: A framework for dynamic resource allocation in distributed data stream management systems,Chunkai Wang; Xiaofeng Meng; Qi Guo; Zujian Weng; Chen Yang,Abstract Distributed data stream management systems (DDSMS) are usually composed ofupper layer relational query systems (RQS) and lower layer stream processing systems(SPS). When users submit new queries to RQS; a query planner needs to be converted intoa directed acyclic graph (DAG) consisting of tasks which are running on SPS. Based ondifferent query requests and data stream properties; SPS need to configure differentdeployments strategies. However; how to dynamically predict deployment configurations ofSPS to ensure the processing throughput and low resource usage is a great challenge.

Bichromatic reverse nearest neighbor query without information leakage,Lu Wang; Xiaofeng Meng; Haibo Hu; Jianliang Xu,Abstract Bichromatic Reverse Nearest Neighbor (BRNN) Query is an important query type inlocation-based services (LBS) and has many real life applications; such as site selectionand resource allocation. However; such query requires the client to disclose sensitivelocation information to the LBS. The only existing method for privacy-preserving BRNNquery adopts the cloaking-region paradigm; which blurs the location into a spatial region.However; the LBS can still deduce some information (albeit not exact) about the location. Inthis paper; we aim at strong privacy wherein the LBS learns nothing about the querylocation. To this end; we employ private information retrieval (PIR) technique; whichaccesses data pages anonymously from a database. Based on PIR; we propose a securequery processing framework together with various indexing and optimization techniques …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2015,2

A quadratic nonlinear prediction-based heart motion model following control algorithm in robotic-assisted beating heart surgery,Fan Liang; Xiaofeng Meng,Off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery outperforms the traditional on-pump surgerybecause the assisted robotic tools can cancel the relative motion between the beating heartand the robotic tools; which reduces post-surgery complications for patients. The challengefor the robot assisted tool when tracking the beating heart is the abrupt change caused bythe nonlinear nature of heart motion and high precision surgery requirements. Acharacteristic analysis of 3D heart motion data through bi-spectral analysis demonstrates thequadratic nonlinearity in heart motion. Therefore; it is necessary to introduce nonlinear heartmotion prediction into the motion tracking control procedures. In this paper; the heart motiontracking problem is transformed into a heart motion model following problem by includingthe adaptive heart motion model into the controller.

For this case; a flow rate measurement method based on dynamic equilibriumprinciple was proposed and a novel flow metering device was designed. In low pressureand wide temperature; the flow rate through a control valve is determined by four factors:upstream pressure of valve; downstream pressure of valve; temperature and valve opening.With the data samples obtained from the metering system; the expression of the relationshipbetween the flow rate and the four factors was established based on BP neural networkmethod.

In these circumstances;researchers are interested in querying the large graph like that: Given a large graph G; anda query Q; we report all the matches of Q in G. Since subgraph isomorphism checking isproved to be NP-Complete [1]; it is infeasible to scan the whole large graph for answers;especially when the query's size is also large. Hence; the” filter-verification” approach iswidely adopted.

RecipeCrawler: Collecting Recipe Data from WWW Incrementally,Xiaofeng Meng; Yu Li; Qing Li,Abstract WWW has posed itself as the largest data repository ever available in the history ofhumankind; which also is highly dynamic as there are web pages created and/or deleted ona daily basis. Utilizing the Internet as a data source seems to be natural and many effortshave been made according to the literatures. In this paper we focus on establishing a robustsystem to collect structured recipe data from the Web incrementally; which; as we believe; isa critical step towards practical; continuous; reliable web data extraction systems andtherefore utilizing WWW as data sources for various database applications. The reasons foradvocating such an incremental approach are that:(1) it is unpractical to crawl all the recipepages from relevant web sites as the Web is highly dynamic;(2) it is almost impossible toinduce a general wrapper for future extraction from the initial batch of recipe web pages …,Lecture Notes in Computer Science; Springer Berlin; Heidlberg; Germany,2006,2
An implementation of instrument interchangeability based on an open architecture [J],Guo-hua WANG; Xiao-feng MENG; Rui-xian ZHAO,Among the Instrument Interchangeability solutions; IVI architecture is the most popularity.However; we find that; in practice; the numbered IVI class specifications limit its usage; and itis not suitable for non-standard instrument. Consequently; on studying on the IVIarchitecture; we propose a new open architecture to implement instrumentinterchangeability. In this open architecture; the user can define signal-based instrumentdrivers; and interchangeability or new instrument driver can be implemented by configuringthe database. Finally; we verify this architecture on a VXI-based ATE and a portableautomatic test device. Result shows that this architecture is practicable.,China Meas Urement,2006,2

Estimating the selectivity of XML path expression with predicates by histograms,Yu Wang; Haixun Wang; Xiaofeng Meng; Shan Wang,Abstract Selectivity estimation of path expressions in querying XML data plays an importantrole in query optimization. A path expression may contain multiple branches with predicates;each of which having its impact on the selectivity of the entire query. In this paper; wepropose a novel method based on 2-dimensional value histograms to estimate theselectivity of path expressions embedded with predicates. The value histograms capture thecorrelation between the structures and the values in the XML data. We define a set ofoperations on the value histograms as well as on the traditional histograms that capturenodes positional distribution. We then construct a cost tree based on such operations. Theselectivity of any node (or branch) in a path expression can be estimated by executing thecost tree.

The processing and improvement of multi-statement queries in Chiql,Xiaofeng Meng; Kam-Fai Wong; Suen Man Yip; Vincent Lum; Shan Wang,Abstract Chiql is a novel Chinese relational database query language for Chinese users. Itsupports procedural query style in which users can specify a complex database request inmultiple simple statements. This facility renders Chiql simple-to-use and easy-to-remember.However; direct executation of multi-statement Chiql queries (ie statement by statement) isoften inefficient as potential index-based operations (eg join) are by-passed. Furthermore; itoften incurs additional database operations; such as scan and projection. To improve thissituation; the SMA (Statement Merging Algorithm) is proposed. The goal of SMA is to mergeas many dependent statements within a Chiql query as possible to form a more efficientChiql query. The ability in achieving improved efficiency without sacrificing the simplicity ofthe language is the major advantage of this algorithm.,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,1998,2

Research on the frequency stability of a bonded QCM for dew point measurement,Ningning Lin; Jing Nie; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract A bonded structure of quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) based on finite elementmethod to measure dew point is proposed. Adhesive joints of QCM have dominating impactson QCM's stability in a constant environment which is one of crucial problems in designingdew point sensors. Our main purpose is to seek an optimum bonding plan for keeping thefrequency stability of dew point sensor. Considering that the QCM mass sensitivitydistribution along the surface of the bonded QCM follows a Gaussian-type function; we useR-square as a standard to compare the frequency stability of the structure by changingmaterial and dimension parameters of adhesive joints with the help of APDL language inANSYS 15.0.

Analysis of changes in energy consumption and demand trend in China's agricultural production.,LiZhi Zhu; Jing Liu; Ran Xu; Meng Xiang,Abstract: China's energy consumption for agricultural production has relied on petroleumand coal with relatively low input from power and other types of energy for a long time.Projections indicate that as China's existing development trend leads to substantial growthof energy demand for agricultural production; such a long term irrational energyconsumption pattern would unlikely be able to meet the needs of the country's developingagricultural sector. As such; it is recommended that China's agricultural sector should followthe national energy development strategy guideline by gradually increasing the use of windpower; solar energy; biomass and other new energy sources while advancing technologicalinnovations on traditional energy sources.

HV-recovery: A high efficient recovery technique for flash-based database,Ze-Ping Lu; Xiao-Feng Meng; Da Zhou,Abstract Flash memory; as a new kind of data storage media; has a lot of attractivecharacteristics when compared with Hard Drive Disk (HDD) such as fast access speed;shock resistance; power saving; lighter form and low noise. Therefore flash memory isconsidered as the main storage device instead of disk in the next generation. However;traditional disk-based database can't take full advantage of high I/O performance of flashmemory if we transfer it to flash memory without modification. The main reason is flashmemory embraces different access characteristics with HDD. As for recovery; the situationbecomes more serious because the out-of-place update model and erase-before-rewrite offlash memory lead to high cost of large quantity of minor random writes during the course ofrecovery.

IO 3: interval-based out-of-order event processing in pervasive computing,Chunjie Zhou; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract In pervasive computing environments; complex event processing has becomeincreasingly important in modern applications. A key aspect of complex event processing isto extract patterns from event streams to make informed decisions in real-time. However;network latencies and machine failures may cause events to arrive out-of-order. In addition;existing literatures assume that events do not have any duration; but events in many realworld application have durations; and the relationships among these events are oftencomplex. In this work; we first analyze the preliminaries of time semantics and propose amodel of it. A hybrid solution including time-interval to solve out-of-order events is alsointroduced; which can switch from one level of output correctness to another based on realtime. The experimental study demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,1
Analysis and Modeling of Environmental Force Impact on Centrifuge Output Property and Compensation [J],Renxiao QIAO; Xiaofeng MENG; Dongbing DAI; Jiao LI,Precise centrifuge is the key equipment for high-precision test and calibration of inertialcomponents such as accelerometers. Its major specifications are the range and precision ofthe output acceleration. The study analyzed the rules how both the Coriolis acceleration byearth rotation and the gravitation of the celestial bodies influence the output acceleration ofthe centrifuge. The mathematical models were built about the influencing rules of these twotypes of acceleration both in the horizontal and the vertical directions by orthogonaldecomposition. To compensate these errors; we proposed a method of limiting the samplingperiod to a whole number of cycles of periodic rotation rate variation or of sufficient longaveraging time.,Journal of Test and Measurement Technology,2010,1

Efficient Processing of Complex Twig Pattern Matching,Jinqing Zhu; Wei Wang; Xiaofeng Meng,As a de facto standard for information representation and exchange over the internet; XMLhas been used extensively in many applications. And XML query technology has attractedmore and more attention in data management research community. Standard XML querylanguages; eg XPath and XQuery; use twig pattern as a basic unit to match relevantfragments from a given XML document. However; in most existing work; only simplecontainment relationships are involved in the twig pattern; which makes it infeasible in manycases.

Revisiting performance in big data systems: an resource decoupling approach,Chen Yang; Qi Guo; Xiaofeng Meng; Rihui Xin; Chunkai Wang,Abstract Big data systems for large-scale data processing are now in widespread use. Toimprove their performance; both academia and industry have expended a great deal of effortin the analysis of performance bottlenecks. Most big data systems; as Hadoop and Spark;allow distributed computing across clusters. As a result; the execution of systems alwaysparallelizes the use of the CPU; memory; disk and network. If a given resource has thegreatest limiting impact on performance; systems will be bottlenecked on it. For a systemdesigner; it is effective for the improvement of performance to tune the bottleneck resource.The key point for the aforementioned scenario is how to determine the bottleneck resource.The nature clue is to quantify the impact of the four major components and identify onecausing the greatest impact factor as the bottleneck resource.,Proceedings of the 2017 Symposium on Cloud Computing,2017,*

Based on Mohr-coulomb strength criterion; the equivalent strength of rock masswith single intermittent joint was deduced and an equivalent conversion formula was given.Different joint penetration rate and confining pressure level were set before the model ofequivalent rock and jointed rock mass specimen were established; and then the equivalentstrength theory was demonstrated by biaxial tests. The results show that the stress on rockbridge is greater than the stress on joint at the same time through the whole biaxial test.

Evaluating k Nearest Neighbor Query on Road Networks with no Information Leakage,Lu Wang; Ruxia Ma; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract The development of positioning technologies and pervasiveness of mobile devicesmake an upsurge of interest in location based services (LBS). The k nearest neighbor (k NN)query in road networks is an important query type in LBS and has many real lifeapplications; such as map service. However; such query requires the client to disclosesensitive location information to the LBS. The only existing method for privacy-preserving kNN query adopts the cloaking-region paradigm; which blurs the location into a spatialregion. However; the LBS can still deduce some information (albeit not exact) about thelocation. In this paper; we aim at strong privacy wherein the LBS learns nothing about thequery location. To this end; we employ private information retrivial (PIR) technique; whichaccesses data pages anonymously from a database. Based on PIR; we propose a secure …,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2015,*

Implication of Dynamic Unbalance to the Inertial Accelerometer Calibration with Vibrafuge,Xue-Ming Dong; Wei Guan; Xiao-Feng Meng,Abstract In practical navigation and guidance applications; inertial accelerometers arealways subjected to multiple accelerations at the same time. But inertial accelerometers areusually calibrated in the laboratory with either pure vibration or constant accelerationaccording to IEEE standards and ISO standards. In this case; there are inconsistentcharacteristics of sensors working in the laboratory and operational conditions because theinput accelerations are different. In order to decrease the inconsistency; calibration ofsensors with vibrafuge; a machine which can produce multicomponent inputs; is proposed.But there is a critical problem for the vibrafuge is the dynamic unbalance due to unevendistribution of mass. In order to build a high-performance vibrafuge for metrological purpose;we analyze the implication of dynamic unbalance of the vibrafuge to the output …,Procedia Engineering,2015,*

SSD-Aware Temporary Data Management Policy for Improving Query Performance,Zhiliang Guo; Jiangtao Wang; Chunling Wang; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract As data volume grows rapidly and queries become more complex; database enginehas to deal with larger amount of temporary data when performing operators such as sortand join. Generally; these temporary data are organized as small temporary files stored inHDD. Due to the poor access performance on HDD; processing time of I/O operations onthese files has a direct impact on the response time of queries. Compared to HDD; solid-state drive (SSD) offers more random IOPS and comparable sequential bandwidth. So;using SSD to replace HDD may be an ideal pattern when dealing with temporary data. Inthis paper; we find out that query processing performing improvement is unsatisfactory if westore temporary files in SSD directly. Thus; we propose a SSD aware temporary datamanagement policy called STDM. STDM takes both the I/O behaviors of temporary data …,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2014,*

Clustering Analysis of Moving Objects,Xiaofeng Meng; Zhiming Ding; Jiajie Xu,Abstract In many moving objects management applications; real-time data analysis such asclustering analysis is becoming one of the most important requirements. Most spatialclustering algorithms deal with objects in Euclidean space. In many real-life applications;however; the accessibility of spatial objects is constrained by spatial networks (eg; roadnetworks). It is therefore more realistic to work on clustering objects in a road network. Thedistance metric in such a setting is redefined by the network distance; which has to becomputed by the expensive shortest path distance over the network. The existing methodsare not applicable to such cases. Therefore; we use the information of nodes and edges inthe network to present two new static clustering algorithms that prune the search space andavoid unnecessary distance computations. In addition; we present the problem of …,*,2014,*

In a typicalmoving objects application; large numbers of geographical positions of moving objects canbe sampled by sensors or GPS following certain strategies; eg; periodically; then sent frommoving clients to the server and stored in a database. Therefore; continuously maintainingthe current locations of moving objects in databases by proper tracking strategy becomesvery important.

In the MODTN system; moving objects are modeled as moving graph points thatmove only within predefined transportation networks.

Fast quartz resonant method for high humidity measurement,Jing Nie; Xiaofeng Meng,Aiming at solving the problem of high-humidity measurement; an original humidity sensor isdescribed. It is based on the resonant sensing principle. The sensor is composed of a quartzcrystal and a Peltier module. Proactive approach is taken to produce condensation in thesurface of the quartz crystal. The electrical parameters of the quartz crystal is changed due todew condensation and then the resonant circuit stops oscillating. The time required until thecircuit stops the oscillation is the dew condensation generated time and it is considered as aparameter evaluating humidity. The results show that relative humidity is detected asfunction of the time required until the oscillation stops and a good linear relationship in therange of 60-95% RH. It proved that the sensor is highly stable; sensitive; fast recovery andlow-cost; and the response time and the dewetting time all less than 10s.,SENSORS; 2013 IEEE,2013,*

Efficient Processing of Updates in Dynamic Graph-Structured XML Data,Lizhen Fu; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract When the ID/IDREF relationship is considered; an XML document needs to bemodeled as an ordered graph more naturally than an ordered tree. Then it becomes moredifficult to process the updates of XML document. This paper studies the incrementalmaintenance of the document order and reachability relationship in Graph-structured XML.We propose an extended interval labeling scheme to label the document order andreachability relationship in XML. We identify the main reason for the inefficiency of updatesof the labels. To accelerate the processing of updates; we design a novel index; called XUI.Based on the index; we propose an efficient update method; called UOGX.

Method for Measuring Dew Point Based on Resonance,Jing NIE; Xiaofeng MENG; Rui ZHENG; Shuo WANG; Yang Lü,Aimed at the problem of atmospheric humidity measurements; the dew point measurementmethod was proposed based on the resonance and a separate set of dew point sensingdevice was designed. The quartz crystal works as a humidity sensor based on the QCMprinciple. When water condensation produced by the Peltier cooling appears on the quartzcrystal; the quartz crystal resonant frequency changes suddenly. Using this characteristic ofthe quartz crystal to distinguish the dew point; we can get the dew point temperature. Thefeasibility and accuracy of this method is verified by experiments. By comparing the actualdata with the fitted data by the experiment; error of the relative humidity is±1.37% RH. Theresult indicates that the method can test the humidity and it has the advantages of simpleoperation; high sensitivity; high reliability and low cost.,Journal of Test and Measurement Technology,2012,*

An Independent Component Analysis technique is applied to study thebehavior of single notes or chords obtained in real and simulated environments. Theseanalyses suggest that the pipe acoustic signals can be described by a mixture of nonlinearoscillations obtained by a self-sustained feedback system (ie; Andronov oscillator). Thissystem allows to obtain a realistic pipe waveform with features very similar to the soundproduced by the pipe and to propose an additive synthesis model. Moreover; suitableanalogical and integrate circuit models; able to reproduce the registered waveforms andsound; have been designed.

A novel method to extend flash memory lifetime in flash-based DBMS,Zhichao Liang; Yulei Fan; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract Over the past decades; flash memory has been widely used in hand-held devices;such as PDA; digital camera; cell phone and USB stick. Moreover; as the capacity increasesand the price drops gradually; flash memory is becoming the promising replacement of harddisk; even in the enterprise application. As a novel storage medium that is totally differentfrom magnetic disk; flash memory enjoys faster access speed; smaller size; lighter weight;less noise and better shock resistance. However; flash memory suffers from erase-before-write and limited write-erase cycles on the other side; which means the abuse of write;especially small and random write; will wear a flash block out quickly. In this paper; weanalyze the free space management in traditional DBMS and point out its disadvantagewhen used on flash device.

Moving Objects Advanced Querying,Jidong Chen; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract So far; we have introduced the basic querying for moving objects. There are stillsome advanced querying for moving objects. It is more difficult to deal with these queries. Inthis chapter; we introduce a few advanced queries; especially similar trajectory queries anddensity queries for moving objects. The goal of similar trajectory queries is to find the movingpatterns in the trajectories of moving objects; while density queries are to efficiently finddense areas with high concentration of moving objects. We will discuss how to process boththe snapshot and continuous density queries in this chapter.,*,2010,*
Moving Objects Updating,Jidong Chen; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract In moving objects applications; large numbers of locations can be sampled bysensors or GPS periodically; then sent from moving clients to the server and stored in adatabase. Therefore; continuously maintaining in a database the current locations of movingobjects by using a tracking technique becomes very important. The key issue is minimizingthe number of updates; while providing precise locations for query results. In this chapter; wewill introduce some underlying location update methods. Then; we describe two locationupdate strategies in detail; which can improve the performance. One is the proactive locationupdate strategy; which predicts the movement of moving objects to lower the updatefrequency; the other is the group location update strategy; which groups the objects tominimize the total number of objects reporting their locations.,*,2010,*
Clustering Analysis of Moving Objects,Jidong Chen; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract In many moving objects management applications; realtime data analysis such asclustering analysis is becoming one of the most important requirements. Most spatialclustering algorithms deal with objects in Euclidean space. In many real-life applications;however; the accessibility of spatial objects is constrained by spatial networks (eg; roadnetworks). It is therefore more realistic to work on clustering objects in a road network. Thedistance metric in such a setting is redefined by the network distance; which has to becomputed by the expensive shortest path distance over the network. The existing methodsare not applicable to such cases. Therefore; we use the information of nodes and edges inthe network to present two new static clustering algorithms that prune the search space andavoid unnecessary distance computations. In addition; we present the problem of …,*,2010,*
Moving Objects Modeling,Jidong Chen; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract Location modeling is the foundation for moving objects databases. Existingdatabase management systems are not well equipped to handle continuously changingdata; such as the position of moving objects. The reason for this is that in traditionaldatabases; data is assumed to be constant unless it is explicitly modified. This isunsatisfactory for MOD since locations of moving objects are continuously changing.

In this chapter; we first introduce a few of the underlyingspatial index structures including the R-tree; Grid File; and Quad-tree. Then; we propose theindexing methods for moving objects in Euclidean space and in spatial networks. Finally; wedescribe techniques that index the past; present; and anticipated future positions of movingobjects.,*,2010,*

Automatic XML Keyword Query Refinement,Zhifeng Bao; Jiaheng Lu; Tok Wang Ling; Xiaofeng Meng,Existing XML keyword search methods focus on how to find relevant and meaningful datafragments for a keyword query; assuming each keyword is intended as part of it. However;user's queries usually contain irrelevant or mismatched terms; spelling errors etc; whichcauses the search results to be either empty or meaningless. In this paper; we introduce theproblem of automatic XML keyword query refinement; where automatic means the searchengine should be able to adaptively decide whether a query Q needs to be refined duringthe processing of Q; and at the same time find a list of promising refined query candidatesand their matching results over XML data; without any user interaction or a second try. Inorder to achieve this goal; we build a primary framework which consists of two core parts:(1)we build a novel query ranking model to evaluate the quality of a refined query RQ; which …,*,2009,*

Instantaneous frequency extraction for resonant dew point sensor based on bandpass ΣΔ modulator with variable center frequency,Jing Tian; Xiaofeng Meng; Jing Nie; Ning Li; Liwei Lin,Abstract—Aiming at the fast and accurate measurement of the output frequency of quartzresonant dew point sensor; there is developed a 1-bit fourth-order bandpass (BP)sigmadelta (ΣΔ) modulator to be applied in it. The automatic design and optimization havebeen both accomplished in the noise transfer function (NTF) and the architecture of 1-bitfourthorder bandpass (BP) sigma-delta (ΣΔ) modulator. It improved the design efficiency;variability of center frequency and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) without stability problemscompared to the traditional method. The variability of the center frequency is fully applicableto the measurement of quartz crystal resonators (QCR) with different base frequencies.Compare the general 14-bit modulator and the designed BP ΣΔ modulator in the frequencyextraction; results show that the proposed method is more effective for fast frequency …,*,*,*

Report on the Second International Workshop on Flash-Based Database Systems (FlashDB 2012),Xiaofeng Meng; Bingsheng He; Wei Cao; Jianliang Xu,Nowadays; as OLTP and OLAP applications' data volume grows into “big data” scale;requirements such as high performance; low latency; high availability; and low powerconsumption etc. become more and more critical and challenging. This trend gives rise tothe advent of new types of storage media and storage devices; such as flash-based SolidState Drives and Phase Change Memory; which are competitive rivals of traditionalmagnetic disks and main memory. Being the pioneers in the storage innovation market; flash-based devices have prevailed in consumer electronics because of non-volatility; low-cost;small size; shock resistance; and low-power consumption. But features like out-placeupdates; asymmetric read/write/erasure latencies; and limited life span and capacity etc.pose challenges in directly using flash-based devices as data storage devices.

Structure and Evolution of a Slow-moving Rain-band,Xiao Meng,The three-dimensional structure and evolution of two meso-β-scale slow-moving rain-bandsare studied in detail mainly by using the data of dual Doppler-radars. The two rain-bandswere observed on Sep. 16; 1994 around Nagoya. Bands were formed and maintained in theenvironment in which strong vertical shear existed at low-level. They had the orientationfrom southeast to northwest; nearly parallel to prevailing southeasterly winds from thesurface to about 4 km; and hardly moved in the direction mormal to the band orientation.Rain-bands were mainly composed of several long-lasting convective-cloud groups whichwere maintained by the successive formation of new convective cells at the tail portion of thegroup. Most of convective-cloud groups also formed at the tail part of the rain-band. Bothconvective-cloud groups and cells moved along the orientation of the band. Most of new …,*,*,*

Efficient Processing of Complex Twig Pattern Matching,Wei Wang; Jinqing Zhu; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract—As a de facto standard for information representation and exchange over theinternet; XML has been used extensively in many applications. And XML query technologyhas attracted more and more attention in data management research community. StandardXML query languages; eg XPath and XQuery; use twig pattern as a basic unit to matchrelevant fragments from a given XML document. However; in most existing work; only simplecontainment relationships are involved in the twig pattern; which makes it infeasible in manycases. In this paper; we extend the original twig pattern to Complex Twig Pattern (CTP);which may contain ordered relationship between query nodes. We give a detailed analysisof the hard nuts that prevent us from finding an efficient solution for CTP matching; and thenpropose a novel holistic join algorithm; LBHJ; to handle the CTP efficiently and effectively …,*,*,*
Anti-Index: Against Privacy Mining via Search Engines,Xiaofeng Meng; Jing Ai; Zhongyuan Wang,ABSTRACT With the flourishing of Web 2.0; Internet has become the largest informationdepositary; which contains huge personal information of Web users. The information relatedto a specific person is usually scattered on various pages in different websites. However;today's Internet has been highly crawled and indexed by search engines. The maliciousattacker may collect a specific person's information via search engines and obtain someprivacy-sensitive information. Therefore; we observe a new type of privacy problem on theInternet: Privacy Mining via Search Engines. Our experiment shows this problem is seriousyet easily ignored; it is a potential threat to Web users. We present a privacy mining modelfor describing the process of privacy leakage via search engines. To prevent this kind ofprivacy attack; we propose a method called Anti-Index and extend robots. txt to ERobots …,*,*,*
