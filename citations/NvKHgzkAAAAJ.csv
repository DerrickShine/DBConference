CryptDB: protecting confidentiality with encrypted query processing,Raluca Ada Popa; Catherine Redfield; Nickolai Zeldovich; Hari Balakrishnan,Abstract Online applications are vulnerable to theft of sensitive information becauseadversaries can exploit software bugs to gain access to private data; and because curious ormalicious administrators may capture and leak data. CryptDB is a system that providespractical and provable confidentiality in the face of these attacks for applications backed bySQL databases. It works by executing SQL queries over encrypted data using a collection ofefficient SQL-aware encryption schemes. CryptDB can also chain encryption keys to userpasswords; so that a data item can be decrypted only by using the password of one of theusers with access to that data. As a result; a database administrator never gets access todecrypted data; and even if all servers are compromised; an adversary cannot decrypt thedata of any user who is not logged in.

Relational cloud: A database-as-a-service for the cloud,Carlo Curino; Evan PC Jones; Raluca Ada Popa; Nirmesh Malviya; Eugene Wu; Sam Madden; Hari Balakrishnan; Nickolai Zeldovich,This paper introduces a new transactional “database-as-a-service”(DBaaS) calledRelational Cloud. A DBaaS promises to move much of the operational burden ofprovisioning; configuration; scaling; performance tuning; backup; privacy; and access controlfrom the database users to the service operator; offering lower overall costs to users. EarlyDBaaS efforts include Amazon RDS and Microsoft SQL Azure; which are promising in termsof establishing the market need for such a service; but which do not address three importantchallenges: efficient multi-tenancy; elastic scalability; and database privacy. We argue thatthese three challenges must be overcome before outsourcing database software andmanagement becomes attractive to many users; and cost-effective for service providers. Thekey technical features of Relational Cloud include:(1) a workload-aware approach to multi …,*,2011,349
Reusable garbled circuits and succinct functional encryption,Shafi Goldwasser; Yael Kalai; Raluca Ada Popa; Vinod Vaikuntanathan; Nickolai Zeldovich,Abstract Garbled circuits; introduced by Yao in the mid 80s; allow computing a function f onan input x without leaking anything about f or x besides f (x). Garbled circuits foundnumerous applications; but every known construction suffers from one limitation: it offers nosecurity if used on multiple inputs x. In this paper; we construct for the first time reusablegarbled circuits. The key building block is a new succinct single-key functional encryptionscheme. Functional encryption is an ambitious primitive: given an encryption Enc (x) of avalue x; and a secret key sk_f for a function f; anyone can compute f (x) without learning anyother information about x. We construct; for the first time; a succinct functional encryptionscheme for {\em any} polynomial-time function f where succinctness means that theciphertext size does not grow with the size of the circuit for f; but only with its depth.

Enabling Security in Cloud Storage SLAs with CloudProof.,Raluca Ada Popa; Jacob R Lorch; David Molnar; Helen J Wang; Li Zhuang,Abstract Several cloud storage systems exist today; but none of them provide securityguarantees in their Service Level Agreements (SLAs). This lack of security support has beena major hurdle for the adoption of cloud services; especially for enterprises and cautiousconsumers. To fix this issue; we present CloudProof; a secure storage system specificallydesigned for the cloud. In CloudProof; customers can not only detect violations of integrity;write-serializability; and freshness; they can also prove the occurrence of these violations toa third party. This proof-based system is critical to enabling security guarantees in SLAs;wherein clients pay for a desired level of security and are assured they will receive a certaincompensation in the event of cloud misbehavior. Furthermore; since CloudProof aims toscale to the size of large enterprises; we delegate as much work as possible to the cloud …,USENIX Annual Technical Conference,2011,237
An ideal-security protocol for order-preserving encoding,Raluca Ada Popa; Frank H Li; Nickolai Zeldovich,Order-preserving encryption-an encryption scheme where the sort order of ciphertextsmatches the sort order of the corresponding plaintexts-allows databases and otherapplications to process queries involving order over encrypted data efficiently. The idealsecurity guarantee for order-preserving encryption put forth in the literature is for theciphertexts to reveal no information about the plaintexts besides order. Even though morethan a dozen schemes were proposed; all these schemes leak more information than order.This paper presents the first order-preserving scheme that achieves ideal security. Our maintechnique is mutable ciphertexts; meaning that over time; the ciphertexts for a small numberof plaintext values change; and we prove that mutable ciphertexts are needed for idealsecurity. Our resulting protocol is interactive; with a small number of interactions. We …,Security and Privacy (SP); 2013 IEEE Symposium on,2013,224
MUVI: automatically inferring multi-variable access correlations and detecting related semantic and concurrency bugs,Shan Lu; Soyeon Park; Chongfeng Hu; Xiao Ma; Weihang Jiang; Zhenmin Li; Raluca A Popa; Yuanyuan Zhou,Abstract Software defects significantly reduce system dependability. Among various types ofsoftware bugs; semantic and concurrency bugs are two of the most difficult to detect. Thispaper proposes a novel method; called MUVI; that detects an important class of semanticand concurrency bugs. MUVI automatically infers commonly existing multi-variable accesscorrelations through code analysis and then detects two types of related bugs:(1)inconsistent updates--correlated variables are not updated in a consistent way; and (2) multi-variable concurrency bugs--correlated accesses are not protected in the same atomicsections in concurrent programs. We evaluate MUVI on four large applications: Linux;Mozilla; MySQL; and PostgreSQL. MUVI automatically infers more than 6000 variableaccess correlations with high accuracy (83%).

Machine learning classification over encrypted data.,Raphael Bost; Raluca Ada Popa; Stephen Tu; Shafi Goldwasser,Abstract—Machine learning classification is used for numerous tasks nowadays; such asmedical or genomics predictions; spam detection; face recognition; and financial predictions.Due to privacy concerns; in some of these applications; it is important that the data and theclassifier remain confidential. In this work; we construct three major classification protocolsthat satisfy this privacy constraint: hyperplane decision; Naïve Bayes; and decision trees. Wealso enable these protocols to be combined with AdaBoost. At the basis of theseconstructions is a new library of building blocks; which enables constructing a wide range ofprivacy-preserving classifiers; we demonstrate how this library can be used to constructother classifiers than the three mentioned above; such as a multiplexer and a face detectionclassifier.,NDSS,2015,152
VPriv: Protecting privacy in location-based vehicular services,Raluca Ada Popa; Hari Balakrishnan; Andrew J Blumberg,Abstract A variety of location-based vehicular services are currently being woven into thenational transportation infrastructure in many countries. These include usage-or congestion-based road pricing; traffic law enforcement; traffic monitoring;“pay-as-you-go” insurance; andvehicle safety systems. Although such applications promise clear benefits; there aresignificant potential violations of the location privacy of drivers under standardimplementations (ie; GPS monitoring of cars as they drive; surveillance cameras; and tolltransponders). In this paper; we develop and evaluate VPriv; a system that can be used byseveral such applications without violating the location privacy of drivers.

How to run turing machines on encrypted data,Shafi Goldwasser; Yael Tauman Kalai; Raluca Ada Popa; Vinod Vaikuntanathan; Nickolai Zeldovich,Abstract Cryptographic schemes for computing on encrypted data promise to be afundamental building block of cryptography. The way one models such algorithms has acrucial effect on the efficiency and usefulness of the resulting cryptographic schemes. As oftoday; almost all known schemes for fully homomorphic encryption; functional encryption;and garbling schemes work by modeling algorithms as circuits rather than as Turingmachines. As a consequence of thismodeling; evaluating an algorithmover encrypted data isas slow as the worst-case running time of that algorithm; a dire fact for many tasks. Inaddition; in settings where an evaluator needs a description of the algorithm itself in some“encoded” form; the cost of computing and communicating such encoding is as large as theworst-case running time of this algorithm.

Blindbox: Deep packet inspection over encrypted traffic,Justine Sherry; Chang Lan; Raluca Ada Popa; Sylvia Ratnasamy,Abstract Many network middleboxes perform deep packet inspection (DPI); a set of usefultasks which examine packet payloads. These tasks include intrusion detection (IDS);exfiltration detection; and parental filtering. However; a long-standing issue is that oncepackets are sent over HTTPS; middleboxes can no longer accomplish their tasks becausethe payloads are encrypted. Hence; one is faced with the choice of only one of two desirableproperties: the functionality of middleboxes and the privacy of encryption. We proposeBlindBox; the first system that simultaneously provides {\em both} of these properties. Theapproach of BlindBox is to perform the deep-packet inspection {\em directly on the encryptedtraffic. BlindBox realizes this approach through a new protocol and new encryption schemes.We demonstrate that BlindBox enables applications such as IDS; exfiltration detection …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2015,109
Building Web Applications on Top of Encrypted Data Using Mylar.,Raluca Ada Popa; Emily Stark; Jonas Helfer; Steven Valdez; Nickolai Zeldovich; M Frans Kaashoek; Hari Balakrishnan,ABSTRACT Web applications rely on servers to store and process confidential information.However; anyone who gains access to the server (eg; an attacker; a curious administrator; ora government) can obtain all of the data stored there. This paper presents Mylar; a platformfor building web applications; which protects data confidentiality against attackers with fullaccess to servers. Mylar stores sensitive data encrypted on the server; and decrypts thatdata only in users' browsers. Mylar addresses three challenges in making this approachwork. First; Mylar allows the server to perform keyword search over encrypted documents;even if the documents are encrypted with different keys. Second; Mylar allows users to sharekeys and encrypted data securely in the presence of an active adversary. Finally; Mylarensures that client-side application code is authentic; even if the server is malicious …,NSDI,2014,89
Remote oblivious storage: Making oblivious RAM practical,Dan Boneh; David Mazieres; Raluca Ada Popa,Remote storage of data has become an increasingly attractive and advantageous option;especially due to cloud systems. While encryption protects the data; it does not hide theaccess pattern to the data. A natural solution is to access remote storage using an ObliviousRAM (ORAM) which provably hides all access patterns. While ORAM is asymptoticallyefficient; the best existing scheme (Pinkas and Reinman; Crypto'10) still has considerableoverhead for a practical implementation: for M stored items; it stores 4 times and sometimes6 times more items remotely; requires O (log2 M) round trips to storage server per request;and periodically blocks all data requests to shuffle all storage (which is a lengthy process). Inthis paper; we first define a related notion to ORAM; oblivious storage (OS); which capturesmore accurately and naturally the security setting of remote storage. Then; we propose a …,*,2011,88

Because these devices can be linked to the movement of individuals; thereis significant danger that the aggregate computation will violate the location privacy ofindividuals. This paper develops and evaluates PrivStats; a system for computing aggregatestatistics over location data that simultaneously achieves two properties: first; provableguarantees on location privacy even in the face of any side information about users knownto the server; and second; privacy-preserving accountability (ie; protection against abusiveclients uploading large amounts of spurious data).

CryptDB: A practical encrypted relational DBMS,Raluca Ada Popa; Nickolai Zeldovich; Hari Balakrishnan,CryptDB is a DBMS that provides provable and practical privacy in the face of acompromised database server or curious database administrators. CryptDB works byexecuting SQL queries over encrypted data. At its core are three novel ideas: an SQL-awareencryption strategy that maps SQL operations to encryption schemes; adjustable query-based encryption which allows CryptDB to adjust the encryption level of each data itembased on user queries; and onion encryption to efficiently change data encryption levels.CryptDB only empowers the server to execute queries that the users requested; andachieves maximum privacy given the mix of queries issued by the users.

The membershipservice provides every node with a consistent view of the system membership; which may beglobal or partitioned into location-based regions. Census distributes membership updateswith low overhead; propagates changes promptly; and is resilient to both crashes andByzantine failures. We believe that Census is the first system to provide a consistentmembership abstraction at very large scale; greatly simplifying the design of applicationsbuilt atop large deployments such as multi-site data centers.,*,2009,46

Embark: Securely Outsourcing Middleboxes to the Cloud.,Chang Lan; Justine Sherry; Raluca Ada Popa; Sylvia Ratnasamy; Zhi Liu,Abstract It is increasingly common for enterprises and other organizations to outsourcenetwork processing to the cloud. For example; enterprises may outsource firewalling;caching; and deep packet inspection; just as they outsource compute and storage. However;this poses a threat to enterprise confidentiality because the cloud provider gains access tothe organization's traffic. We design and build Embark; the first system that enables a cloudprovider to support middlebox outsourcing while maintaining the client's confidentiality.Embark encrypts the traffic that reaches the cloud and enables the cloud to process theencrypted traffic without decrypting it. Embark supports a wide-range of middleboxes suchas firewalls; NATs; web proxies; load balancers; and data exfiltration systems. Ourevaluation shows that Embark supports these applications with competitive performance.,NSDI,2016,32
Succinct Functional Encryption and Applications: Reusable Garbled Circuits and Beyond.,Shafi Goldwasser; Yael Tauman Kalai; Raluca A Popa; Vinod Vaikuntanathan; Nickolai Zeldovich,Abstract Functional encryption is a powerful primitive: given an encryption Enc (x) of a valuex and a secret key skf corresponding to a circuit f; it enables efficient computation of f (x)without revealing any additional information about x. Constructing functional encryptionschemes with succinct ciphertexts that guarantee security for even a single secret key (for ageneral function f) is an important open problem with far reaching applications; which thispaper addresses. Our main result is a functional encryption scheme for any general functionf of depth d; with succinct ciphertexts whose size grows with the depth d rather than the sizeof the circuit for f. We prove the security of our construction based on the intractability of thelearning with error (LWE) problem. More generally; we show how to construct a functionalencryption scheme from any public-index predicate encryption scheme and fully …,IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive,2012,31
Security service level agreements with publicly verifiable proofs of compliance,*,Techniques are described herein that are capable of providing security guarantees insecurity service level agreements (SLAB). For instance; a security SLA may specify a level ofservice to be provided to a user with respect to at least one security property (eg;confidentiality; integrity; write-serialization; read freshness; etc.). Attestations may be used toprove occurrence (or non-occurrence) of violations of security properties in a manner that isuniversally verifiable; eg; by third parties. An attestation is an indicator that is generated by auser to certify that the user makes a request (eg; get request or put request) or an indicatorthat is generated by a cloud service provider to certify that the cloud service provideraccurately fulfills a request of a user. A security SLA may specify a payment to be made to auser in response to an occurrence of a violation of a security property.,*,2011,31
Arx: A strongly encrypted database system.,Rishabh Poddar; Tobias Boelter; Raluca Ada Popa,Abstract In recent years; encrypted databases have emerged as a promising direction thatprovides data confidentiality without sacrificing functionality: queries are executed onencrypted data. However; existing practical proposals rely on a set of weak encryptionschemes that have been shown to leak sensitive data. In this paper; we propose Arx; the firstpractical and functionally rich database system that encrypts the data only with strongencryption schemes. Arx protects the database with the same level of security as regularAES-based encryption; which by itself is devoid of functionality. We show that Arx supportsreal applications such as ShareLatex and a health data cloud provider; and that itsperformance overhead is modest.,IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive,2016,26

Building practical systems that compute on encrypted data,Raluca Ada Popa,Abstract Theft of confidential data is prevalent. In most applications; confidential data isstored at servers. Thus; existing systems naturally try to prevent adversaries fromcompromising these servers. However; experience has shown that adversaries still find away to break in and steal the data. This dissertation shows how to protect data confidentialityeven when attackers get access to all the data stored on servers. We achieve this protectionthrough a new approach to building secure systems: building practical systems that computeon encrypted data; without access to the decryption key. In this setting; we designed andbuilt a database system (CryptDB); a web application platform (Mylar); and two mobilesystems; as well as developed new cryptographic schemes for them. We showed that thesesystems support a wide range of applications with low overhead. The work in this thesis …,*,2014,19

Guidelines for Using the CryptDB System Securely.,Raluca Ada Popa; Nickolai Zeldovich; Hari Balakrishnan,This report has two goals. First; we review guidelines for using the CryptDB system[PRZB11; Pop14] securely by the administrators of database applications. These guidelineswere already described in [PRZB11] and elaborated on in [Pop14]; but in light of somerecent work [NKW15] that applied these guidelines incorrectly; a short document devoted tosummarizing these guidelines may be useful. Second; we explain that the study of Naveed;Kamara; and Wright [NKW15] represents an unsafe usage of CryptDB; violating CryptDB'ssecurity guidelines. Hence; the conclusions drawn in that paper regarding CryptDB'sguarantees for medical applications are incorrect: had the guidelines been followed; none ofthe claimed attacks would have been possible.,IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive,2015,9

However;throughput optimality\emph {relies} on the network nodes or routers to code\emph{correctly}. A Byzantine node may introduce junk packets in the network (thus pollutingdownstream packets and causing the sinks to receive the wrong data) or may choose codingcoefficients in a way that significantly reduces the throughput of the network. Most prior workfocused on the problem of Byzantine nodes polluting packets. However; even if a Byzantinenode does not pollute packets; he can still affect significantly the throughput of the networkby not coding correctly. No previous work attempted to verify if a certain node\emph {codedcorrectly using random coefficients} over\emph {all} of the packets he was supposed to codeover.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1108.2080,2011,8

Moreover;applications are increasingly using third parties such as Amazon EC2 and S3 to providecomputing and storage infrastructure; with the result that users' data is stored and operatedon by third party servers. This forces end users to trust these third parties to not misuse theirdata; in addition to trusting the original application. Even if all these parties are benign; thisincreases the trusted computing base (TCB); and attackers can compromise just one ofthese services to gain illicit access to users' data.

We show that Arx supports real applications such asShareLaTeX and a health data cloud provider with a modest performance overhead.,*,2017,*
Techniques for computing on encrypted data in a practical system,Raluca Ada Popa,In this document; we survey various techniques for computing on encrypted data that mightbe useful when designing a practical security system. These tools or methods provide aninteresting spectrum over three coordinates: functionality; security; and performance.Unfortunately; none of these tools alone suffices to enable running the systems we havetoday over encrypted data. They typically fail to achieve a desired goal with respect to atleast one of these three coordinates. Nevertheless; understanding the tradeoffs these toolsprovide in functionality; security; and performance; coupled with an understanding of thetargeted system; has enabled building systems that are practical for a class of applicationsand provide a meaningful level of security. Some examples of such systems are [PRZB11;PSV+ 14; ABE+ 13; AEK+ 13; TKMZ13; TLMM13; KGM+ 14; SSSE14; TSCS13; HHCW12 …,*,2014,*
Provable and practical location privacy for vehicular and mobile systems,Raluca Ada Popa,In recent years; there has been a rapid evolution of location-based vehicular and mobileservices (eg; electronic tolling; congestion pricing; traffic statistics; insurance pricing; location-based social applications); which promise tremendous benefits to users. Unfortunately; mostsuch systems pose a serious threat to the location privacy of users because they track eachindividual's path. A question that arises naturally is how can we preserve location privacy ofusers while maintaining the benefits of such services? In this thesis; we address thisquestion by tackling two general problems that are the foundation of many of theaforementioned services. The first problem is how to enable an untrusted server to computeagreed-upon functions on a specific user's path without learning the user's path. We addressthis problem in a system called VPriv. VPriv supports a variety of applications including …,*,2010,*

The magazine archive includes every article published in Communications of the ACM for over the past 50 years.,Narasimhaiah Gorla; Yan Wah Lam,A longstanding vision in distributed systems is to build reliable systems from unreliablecomponents. An enticing formulation of this vision is Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) statemachine replication; in which a group of servers collectively act as a correct server even ifsome of the servers misbehave or malfunction in arbitrary (" Byzantine") ways. Despite thispromise; practitioners hesitate to deploy BFT systems at least partly because of theperception that BFT must impose high overheads.In this article; we present Zyzzyva; aprotocol that uses speculation to reduce the cost of BFT replication. In Zyzzyva; replicasreply to a client's request without first running an expensive three-phase commit protocol toagree on the order to process requests. Instead; they optimistically adopt the order proposedby a primary server; process the request; and reply immediately to the client. If the primary …,Communications of the ACM,2008,*
InHome: A Local Area Peer-to-peer Caching System,Mihir Kedia; Raluca Ada Popa; Irene Zhang,Abstract Demand for wide-area bandwidth is explosively increasing as the use of bandwidth-hungry applications like Bittorrent rises and websites compete to offer a richer browsingexperience. ISPs are finding it increasingly difficult to keep up with demand; making wide-area bandwidth an expensive commodity. On the other hand; the capacity of local-areabandwidth has been growing rapidly; capacity that; for the most part; remains unused. Thispaper presents InHome; a system that trades cheap local-area bandwidth for expensivewide-area bandwidth. InHome is motivated by the observation that many people inside anorganization access common data; allowing one to trade wide-area bandwidth for local areabandwidth by fetching commonly accessed data from local peers.,*,2008,*

Witness-Indistinguishability Against Quantum Adversaries,Raluca Ada Popa,Proof systems are a central concept in complexity theory and cryptography. Zero-knowledgeand witnessindistinguishability are useful security properties of proof systems. Consideringthe increased power of quantum computation; it comes as a natural question to understandwhat happens to these security properties when quantum computation becomes feasible.Zero-knowledge [GMR89] is the security property of proof systems that has received themost attention. Intuitively; a proof system is zero-knowledge if the prover does not leak anyinformation to the verifier other than the veracity of the statement to be proved. There hasbeen a significant amount of research aimed at characterizing what happens to zero-knowledge when quantum adversaries are possible (eg;[Wat09; Wat02; CK08; HKSZ08;Kob08]) and we will survey the main such results.
