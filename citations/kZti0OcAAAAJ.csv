Twittermonitor: trend detection over the twitter stream,Michael Mathioudakis; Nick Koudas,Abstract We present TwitterMonitor; a system that performs trend detection over the Twitterstream. The system identifies emerging topics (ie'trends') on Twitter in real time and providesmeaningful analytics that synthesize an accurate description of each topic. Users interactwith the system by ordering the identified trends using different criteria and submitting theirown description for each trend.,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,776
Sparsification of influence networks,Michael Mathioudakis; Francesco Bonchi; Carlos Castillo; Aristides Gionis; Antti Ukkonen,Abstract We present Spine; an efficient algorithm for finding the" backbone" of an influencenetwork. Given a social graph and a log of past propagations; we build an instance of theindependent-cascade model that describes the propagations. We aim at reducing thecomplexity of that model; while preserving most of its accuracy in describing the data. Weshow that the problem is inapproximable and we present an optimal; dynamic-programmingalgorithm; whose search space; albeit exponential; is typically much smaller than that of thebrute force; exhaustive-search approach. Seeking a practical; scalable approach tosparsification; we devise Spine; a greedy; efficient algorithm with practically littlecompromise in quality.,Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2011,134
Quantifying Controversy on Social Media,Kiran Garimella; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis; Michael Mathioudakis,Abstract Which topics spark the most heated debates on social media? Identifying thosetopics is not only interesting from a societal point of view but also allows the filtering andaggregation of social media content for disseminating news stories. In this article; weperform a systematic methodological study of controversy detection by using the content andthe network structure of social media. Unlike previous work; rather than studying controversyin a single hand-picked topic and using domain-specific knowledge; we take a generalapproach to study topics in any domain. Our approach to quantifying controversy is basedon a graph-based three-stage pipeline; which involves (i) building a conversation graphabout a topic;(ii) partitioning the conversation graph to identify potential sides of thecontroversy; and (iii) measuring the amount of controversy from characteristics of the …,ACM Transactions on Social Computing,2018,69
Efficient identification of starters and followers in social media,Michael Mathioudakis; Nick Koudas,Abstract Activity and user engagement in social media such as web logs; wikis; onlineforums or social networks has been increasing at unprecedented rates. In relation to socialbehavior in various human activities; user activity in social media indicates the existence ofindividuals that consistently drive or stimulate'discussions' in the online world. Suchindividuals are considered as' starters' of online discussions in contrast with'followers' thatprimarily engage in discussions and follow them. In this paper; we formalize notionsof'starters' and'followers' in social media. Motivated by the challenging size of the availableinformation related to online social behavior; we focus on the development of randomsampling approaches allowing us to achieve significant efficiency while identifying startersand followers. In our experimental section we utilize BlogScope; our social media …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,44
Identifying; attributing and describing spatial bursts,Michael Mathioudakis; Nilesh Bansal; Nick Koudas,Abstract User generated content that appears on weblogs; wikis and social networks hasbeen increasing at an unprecedented rate. The wealth of information produced byindividuals from different geographical locations presents a challenging task of intelligentprocessing. In this paper; we introduce a methodology to identify notable geographicallyfocused events out of this collection of user generated information. At the heart of ourproposal lie efficient algorithms that identify geographically focused information bursts;attribute them to demographic factors and identify sets of descriptive keywords. We presentthe results of a prototype evaluation of our algorithms on BlogScope; a large-scale socialmedia warehousing platform. We demonstrate the scalability and practical utility of ourproposal running on top of a multi-terabyte text collection.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,41
Early online identification of attention gathering items in social media,Michael Mathioudakis; Nick Koudas; Peter Marbach,Abstract Activity in social media such as blogs; micro-blogs; social networks; etc ismanifested via interaction that involves text; images; links and other information items.Naturally; some items attract more attention than others; expressed with large volumes oflinking; commenting or tagging activity; to name a few examples. Moreover; high attentioncan be indicative of emerging events; breaking news or generally indicate information itemsof interest to a vast set of people. The numbers associated with digital social activity areastonishing: in excess of millions of blog posts; tweets and forums updates per day; millionsof tags in photos; news articles or blogs. Being able to identify information items that gathermuch attention in such a real time information collective is a challenging task. In this paper;we consider the problem of early online identification of items that gather a lot of attention …,Proceedings of the third ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2010,39
Where Is the Soho of Rome? Measures and Algorithms for Finding Similar Neighborhoods in Cities.,Géraud Le Falher; Aristides Gionis; Michael Mathioudakis,Abstract Data generated on location-aware social media provide rich information about theplaces (shopping malls; restaurants; cafés; etc) where citizens spend their time. Thatinformation can; in turn; be used to describe city neighborhoods in terms of the activity thattakes place therein. For example; the data might reveal that citizens visit one neighborhoodmainly for shopping; while another for its dining venues. In this paper; we present amethodology to analyze such data; describe neighborhoods in terms of the activity they host;and discover similar neighborhoods across cities. Using millions of Foursquare check-insfrom cities in Europe and the US; we conduct an extensive study on features and measuresthat can be used to quantify similarity of city neighborhoods. We find that the earth-mover'sdistance outperforms other candidate measures in finding similar neighborhoods …,ICWSM,2015,25
Reducing controversy by connecting opposing views,Kiran Garimella; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis; Michael Mathioudakis,Abstract Society is often polarized by controversial issues that split the population intogroups with opposing views. When such issues emerge on social media; we often observethe creation ofecho chambers'; ie; situations where like-minded people reinforce eachother's opinion; but do not get exposed to the views of the opposing side. In this paper westudy algorithmic techniques for bridging these chambers; and thus reduce controversy.Specifically; we represent the discussion on a controversial issue with an endorsementgraph; and cast our problem as an edge-recommendation problem on this graph. The goalof the recommendation is to reduce the controversy score of the graph; which is measuredby a recently-developed metric based on random walks.

Modeling urban behavior by mining geotagged social data,Emre Çelikten; Géraud Le Falher; Michael Mathioudakis,Data generated on location-based social networks provide rich information on thewhereabouts of urban dwellers. Specifically; such data reveal who spends time where;when; and on what type of activity (eg; shopping at a mall; or dining at a restaurant). Thatinformation can; in turn; be used to describe city regions in terms of activity that takes placetherein. For example; the data might reveal that citizens visit one region mainly for shoppingin the morning; while another for dining in the evening. Furthermore; once such a descriptionis available; one can ask more elaborate questions. For example; one might ask whatfeatures distinguish one region from another-some regions might be different in terms of thetype of venues they host and others in terms of the visitors they attract. As another example;one might ask which regions are similar across cities. In this paper; we present a method …,IEEE Transactions on Big Data,2017,9
Bump hunting in the dark: Local discrepancy maximization on graphs,Aristides Gionis; Michael Mathioudakis; Antti Ukkonen,We study the problem of discrepancy maximization on graphs: given a set of nodes Q of anunderlying graph G; we aim to identify a connected subgraph of G that contains many morenodes from Q than other nodes. This variant of the discrepancy maximization problemextends the well-known notion of “bump hunting” in the Euclidean space [1]. We considerthe problem under two access models. In the unrestricted-access model; the whole graph Gis given as input; while in the local-access model we can only retrieve the neighbors of agiven node in G using a possibly slow and costly interface. We prove that the basic problemof discrepancy maximization on graphs is NP-hard; and empirically evaluate theperformance of four heuristics for solving it. For the local-access model; we consider threedifferent algorithms that aim to recover a part of G large enough to contain an optimal …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2017,9
Absorbing random-walk centrality: Theory and algorithms,Charalampos Mavroforakis; Michael Mathioudakis; Aristides Gionis,We study a new notion of graph centrality based on absorbing random walks. Given a graphG=(V; E) and a set of query nodes Q⊆ V; we aim to identify the k most central nodes in Gwith respect to Q. Specifically; we consider central nodes to be absorbing for random walksthat start at the query nodes Q. The goal is to find the set of k central nodes that minimizesthe expected length of a random walk until absorption. The proposed measure; which wecall k absorbing random-walk centrality; favors diverse sets; as it is beneficial to place the kabsorbing nodes in different parts of the graph so as to “intercept” random walks that startfrom different query nodes. Although similar problem definitions have been considered inthe literature; eg; in information-retrieval settings where the goal is to diversify web-searchresults; in this paper we study the problem formally and prove some of its properties. We …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,8

Exploring controversy in twitter,Kiran Garimella; Michael Mathioudakis; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis,Abstract Among the topics discussed on social media; some spark more heated debate thanothers. For example; experience suggests that major political events; such as a vote forhealthcare law in the US; would spark more debate be-tween opposing sides than otherevents; such as a concert of a popular music band. Exploring the topics of discussion onTwitter and understanding which ones are controver-sial is extremely useful for a variety ofpurposes; such as for journalists to understand what issues divide the public; or for socialscientists to understand how controversy is manifested in social interactions.,Proceedings of the 19th ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing Companion,2016,6
The ebb and flow of controversial debates on social media,Kiran Garimella; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis; Michael Mathioudakis,Abstract: We explore how the polarization around controversial topics evolves on Twitter-over a long period of time (2011 to 2016); and also as a response to major external eventsthat lead to increased related activity. We find that increased activity is typically associatedwith increased polarization; however; we find no consistent long-term trend in polarizationover time among the topics we study.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.05994,2017,5
Factors in recommending contrarian content on social media,Kiran Garimella; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis; Michael Mathioudakis,Abstract Polarization is a troubling phenomenon that can lead to societal divisions and hurtthe democratic process. It is therefore important to develop methods to reduce it. Wepropose an algorithmic solution to the problem of reducing polarization. The core idea is toexpose users to content that challenges their point of view; with the hope broadening theirperspective; and thus reduce their polarity. Our method takes into account several aspects ofthe problem; such as the estimated polarity of the user; the probability of accepting therecommendation; the polarity of the content; and popularity of the content beingrecommended.,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Web Science Conference,2017,3
Accessibility by public transport predicts residential real estate prices: a case study in Helsinki region,Indre Žliobaite; Michael Mathioudakis; Tuukka Lehtiniemi; Pekka Parviainen; Tomi Janhunen,Abstract This pilot study investigates how considering accessibility could help to modelprices of residential real estate more accurately. We introduce two novelties from the pricemodeling point of view (1) defining accessibility as travel time by public transport; in additionto geographic distance; and (2) considering dynamic points of interest from check-ins intosocial networks; in addition to fixed location community centers. Our case study focuses onthe Helsinki region. We model price per square meter as a linear function of apartmentcharacteristics; and characteristics of the neighborhood; including accessibility by publictransport and social activities. The resulting models show good predictive performance; ascompared to baselines not taking accessibility into account. We discover that apartmentprice relates to the geographical distance from the city center; but accessibility by public …,Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Mining Urban Data-Volume 1392,2015,3
What is the city but the people?: Exploring urban activity using social web traces,Emre Çelikten; Géraud Le Falher; Michael Mathioudakis,Abstract We demonstrate Geotopics; a system to explore geographical patterns of urbanactivity. The system collects publicly shared check-ins generated by Foursquare users; thatreveal who spends time where; when; and on what type of activity. It then employs sparseprobabilistic modeling techniques to learn associations between different regions of a cityand multi-feature descriptions of urban activity. Through a web interface; users of the systemcan select a city of interest and explore visualizations that highlight how different types ofactivity are spatially and temporally distributed in the city.,Proceedings of the 25th International Conference Companion on World Wide Web,2016,2
Political Discourse on Social Media: Echo Chambers; Gatekeepers; and the Price of Bipartisanship,Kiran Garimella; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis; Michael Mathioudakis,Abstract: Echo chambers; ie; situations where one is exposed only to opinions that agreewith their own; are an increasing concern for the political discourse in many democraticcountries. This paper studies the phenomenon of political echo chambers on social media.We identify the two components in the phenomenon: the opinion that is shared ('echo'); andthe place that allows its exposure ('chamber'---the social network); and examine closely athow these two components interact. We define a production and consumption measure forsocial-media users; which captures the political leaning of the content shared and receivedby them. By comparing the two; we find that Twitter users are; to a large degree; exposed topolitical opinions that agree with their own. We also find that users who try to bridge the echochambers; by sharing content with diverse leaning; have to pay a'price of bipartisanship'in …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.01665,2018,1
The effect of collective attention on controversial debates on social media,Kiran Garimella; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis; Michael Mathioudakis,Abstract We study the evolution of long-lived controversial debates as manifested on Twitterfrom 2011 to 2016. Specifically; we explore how the structure of interactions and content ofdiscussion varies with the level of collective attention; as evidenced by the number of usersdiscussing a topic. Spikes in the volume of users typically correspond to external events thatincrease the public attention on the topic-as; for instance; discussions about'guncontrol'often erupt after a mass shooting. This work is the first to study the dynamic evolutionof polarized online debates at such scale. By employing a wide array of network and contentanalysis measures; we find consistent evidence that increased collective attention isassociated with increased network polarization and network concentration within each sideof the debate; and overall more uniform lexicon usage across all users.,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Web Science Conference,2017,1

Inferring venue visits from GPS trajectories,Qihang Gu; Dimitris Sacharidis; Michael Mathioudakis; Gang Wang,ABSTRACT Digital location traces can help build insights about how citizens experiencetheir cities; but also o er personalized products and experiences to them. Even as dataabound; though; building an accurate picture about citizen whereabouts is not alwaysstraightforward; due to noisy or incomplete data. In this paper; we address the followingproblem: given the GPS trace of a person's trajectory in a city; we aim to infer what venue (s)the person visited along that trajectory; and in doing so; we use honest Foursquare check-ins as groundtruth. To tackle this problem; we address two sub-problems. The rst isgroundtruthing; where we fuse GPS trajectories with Foursquare check-ins; to derive acollection of detected stops and truthful check-ins. The second subproblem is designing aninference model that predicts the check-in venue given a stop. We evaluate variants of the …,SIGSPATIAL GIS,2017,1
A study on workload-aware wavelet synopses for point and range-sum queries,Michael Mathioudakis; Dimitris Sacharidis; Timos Sellis,Abstract In this paper we perform an extensive theoretical and experimental study oncommon synopsis construction algorithms; with emphasis on wavelet based techniques; thattake under consideration query workload statistics. Our goal is to compare;" expensive"quadratic time algorithms with" cheap" near-linear time algorithms; particularly when thelatter are not optimal and/or not workload-aware for the problem at hand. Further; we presentthe first known algorithm for constructing wavelet synopses for a special class of range-sumquery workloads. Our experimental results; clearly justify the necessity for designingworkload-aware algorithms; especially in the case of range-sum queries.,Proceedings of the 9th ACM International Workshop on Data Warehousing and OLAP,2006,1
Markov Chain Monitoring,Harshal A Chaudhari; Michael Mathioudakis; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract: In networking applications; one often wishes to obtain estimates about the numberof objects at different parts of the network (eg; the number of cars at an intersection of a roadnetwork or the number of packets expected to reach a node in a computer network) bymonitoring the traffic in a small number of network nodes or edges. We formalize this task bydefining the'Markov Chain Monitoring'problem. Given an initial distribution of items over thenodes of a Markov chain; we wish to estimate the distribution of items at subsequent times.We do this by asking a limited number of queries that retrieve; for example; how many itemstransitioned to a specific node or over a specific edge at a particular time. We considerdifferent types of queries; each defining a different variant of the Markov chain monitoring.For each variant; we design efficient algorithms for choosing the queries that make our …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.07722,2018,*
Ad-blocking: A Study on Performance; Privacy and Counter-measures,Kiran Garimella; Orestis Kostakis; Michael Mathioudakis,Abstract Many internet ventures rely on advertising for their revenue. However; users feeldiscontent by the presence of ads on the websites they visit; as the data-size of ads is oftencomparable to that of the actual content. This has an impact not only on the loading time ofwebpages; but also on the internet bill of the user in some cases. In absence of a mutually-agreed procedure for opting out of advertisements; many users resort to ad-blockingbrowser-extensions. In this work; we study the performance of popular ad-blockers on alarge set of news websites. Moreover; we investigate the benefits of ad-blockers on userprivacy as well as the mechanisms used by websites to counter them. Finally; we explore thetraffic overhead due to the ad-blockers themselves.,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Web Science Conference,2017,*
Where could we go? Recommendations for groups in location-based social networks,Frederick Ayala-Gómez; Bálint Zoltán Daróczy; Michael Mathioudakis; András Benczúr; Aristides Gionis,ABSTRACT Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) enable their users to share with theirfriends the places they go to and whom they go with. Additionally; they provide users withrecommendations for Points of Interest (POI) they have not visited before. is functionality is ofgreat importance for users of LBSNs; as it allows them to discover interesting places inpopulous cities that are not easy to explore. For this reason; previous research has focusedon providing recommendations to LBSN users. Nevertheless; while most existing workfocuses on recommendations for individual users; techniques to provide recommendationsto groups of users are scarce. In this paper; we consider the problem of recommending a listof POIs to a group of users in the areas that the group frequents.
