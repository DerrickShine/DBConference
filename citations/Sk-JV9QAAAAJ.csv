A continuous query system for dynamic route planning,Nirmesh Malviya; Samuel Madden; Arnab Bhattacharya,In this paper; we address the problem of answering continuous route planning queries overa road network; in the presence of updates to the delay (cost) estimates of links. A simpleapproach to this problem would be to recompute the best path for all queries on arrival ofevery delay update. However; such a naive approach scales poorly when there are manyusers who have requested routes in the system. Instead; we propose two new classes ofapproximate techniques-K-paths and proximity measures to substantially speed upprocessing of the set of designated routes specified by continuous route planning queries inthe face of incoming traffic delay updates. Our techniques work through a combination of pre-computation of likely good paths and by avoiding complete recalculations on every delayupdate; instead only sending the user new routes when delays change significantly …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,57
Finding the bias and prestige of nodes in networks based on trust scores,Abhinav Mishra; Arnab Bhattacharya,Abstract Many real-life graphs such as social networks and peer-to-peer networks capturethe relationships among the nodes by using trust scores to label the edges. Important usageof such networks includes trust prediction; finding the most reliable or trusted node in a localsubgraph; etc. For many of these applications; it is crucial to assess the prestige and bias ofa node. The bias of a node denotes its propensity to trust/mistrust its neighbours and isclosely related to truthfulness. If a node trusts all its neighbours; its recommendation ofanother node as trustworthy is less reliable. It is based on the idea that the recommendationof a highly biased node should weigh less. In this paper; we propose an algorithm tocompute the bias and prestige of nodes in networks where the edge weight denotes the trustscore. Unlike most other graph-based algorithms; our method works even when the edge …,Proceedings of the 20th international conference on World wide web,2011,52
Vivo: Visual vocabulary construction for mining biomedical images,Arnab Bhattacharya; Vebjorn Ljosa; Jia-Yu Pan; Mark R Verardo; Hyungjeong Yang; Christos Faloutsos; Ambuj K Singh,Given a large collection of medical images of several conditions and treatments; how can wesuccinctly describe the characteristics of each setting? For example; given a large collectionof retinal images from several different experimental conditions (normal; detached;reattached; etc.); how can data mining help biologists focus on important regions in theimages or on the differences between different experimental conditions? If the images weretext documents; we could find the main terms and concepts for each condition by existing IRmethods (eg; tf/idf and LSI). We propose something analogous; but for the much morechallenging case of an image collection: We propose to automatically develop a visualvocabulary by breaking images into n/spl times/n tiles and deriving key tiles (" ViVos") foreach image and condition.

Minimally infrequent itemset mining using pattern-growth paradigm and residual trees,Ashish Gupta; Akshay Mittal; Arnab Bhattacharya,Abstract Itemset mining has been an active area of research due to its successful applicationin various data mining scenarios including finding association rules. Though most of the pastwork has been on finding frequent itemsets; infrequent itemset mining has demonstrated itsutility in web mining; bioinformatics and other fields. In this paper; we propose a newalgorithm based on the pattern-growth paradigm to find minimally infrequent itemsets. Aminimally infrequent itemset has no subset which is also infrequent. We also introduce thenovel concept of residual trees. We further utilize the residual trees to mine multiple levelminimum support itemsets where different thresholds are used for finding frequent itemsetsfor different lengths of the itemset. Finally; we analyze the behavior of our algorithm withrespect to different parameters and show through experiments that it outperforms the …,Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Management of Data,2011,42
Indexing spatially sensitive distance measures using multi-resolution lower bounds,Vebjorn Ljosa; Arnab Bhattacharya; Ambuj K Singh,Abstract Comparison of images requires a distance metric that is sensitive to the spatiallocation of objects and features. Such sensitive distance measures can; however; becomputationally infeasible due to the high dimensionality of feature spaces coupled with theneed to model the spatial structure of the images. We present a novel multi-resolutionapproach to indexing spatially sensitive distance measures. We derive practical lowerbounds for the earth mover's distance (EMD). Multiple levels of lower bounds; one for eachresolution of the index structure; are incorporated into algorithms for answering rangequeries and k-NN queries; both by sequential scan and using an M-tree index structure.Experiments show that using the lower bounds reduces the running time of similarity queriesby a factor of up to 36 compared to a sequential scan without lower bounds.

A Plant Identification System using Shape and Morphological Features on Segmented Leaflets: Team IITK; CLEF 2012.,Akhil Arora; Ankit Gupta; Nitesh Bagmar; Shashwat Mishra; Arnab Bhattacharya,Abstract. Automatic plant identification tasks have witnessed increased interest from themachine learning community in recent years. This paper describes our (team IITK's)participation in the Plant Identification Task; CLEF 2012; organized by the Combined LabEvaluation Forum (CLEF) where the challenge was to identify plant species based on leafimages. We first categorize the different types of images and then use a variety of novelpreprocessing methods such as shadow and background correction; petiole removal andautomatic leaflet segmentation for identifying the leaf blobs. We next use complex networkframework along with novel tooth detection method and morphological operations tocompute several useful features. Finally; we use a random forest for classification. Based onthe proposed approach; we achieved 2nd rank on the overall score in the competition.,CLEF (Online Working Notes/Labs/Workshop),2012,32

For such content-modelingpurposes; transformation of numeric data into symbols and the modeling of resultingsymbolic sequences can be achieved using statistical models---Markov Chains (MCs) andHidden Markov Models (HMMs). We consider the problem of distributed indexing andsemantic querying over such sensor models. Specifically; we are interested in efficientlyanswering (i) range queries: return all sensors that have observed an unusual sequence ofsymbols with a high likelihood;(ii) top-1 queries: return the sensor that has the maximumprobability of observing a given sequence; and (iii) 1-NN queries: return the sensor (model)which is most similar to a query model.

These feature vectors arethen combined and indexed using a novel multi-dimensional index structure. For a givenquery; we employ this index structure to find candidate matches from the database.

However; the molecular mechanismsmediating these deleterious effects remain unclear. Among the most characterized activitiesof Tau is the ability to regulate microtubule dynamics; known to be essential for proper cellfunction and viability. Here we have tested the hypothesis that Tau mutations causingneurodegeneration also alter the ability of Tau to regulate the dynamic instability behaviorsof microtubules. Using in vitro microtubule dynamics assays to assess average microtubulegrowth rates; microtubule growth rate distributions; and catastrophe frequencies; we foundthat all tested mutants possessing amino acid substitutions or deletions mapping to eitherthe repeat or interrepeat regions of Tau do indeed compromise its ability to regulate …,Journal of Biological Chemistry,2008,26
Querying spatial patterns,Vishwakarma Singh; Arnab Bhattacharya; Ambuj K Singh,Abstract Spatial data are common in many scientific and commercial domains such asgeographical information systems and gene/protein expression profiles. Querying fordistribution patterns on such data can discover underlying spatial relationships and suggestavenues for further scientific exploration. Supporting such pattern retrieval requires not onlythe formulation of an appropriate scoring function for defining relevant connectedsubregions; but also the design of new access methods that can scale to large databases. Inthis paper; we propose a solution to this problem of querying significant sub-regions onspatial data provided as raster images. We design a scoring scheme to measure thesimilarity of subregions. All the raster images are tiled and each alignment of the query anda database image produces a tile score matrix. We show that the problem of finding the …,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2010,14
On low distortion embeddings of statistical distance measures into low dimensional spaces,Arnab Bhattacharya; Purushottam Kar; Manjish Pal,Abstract In this paper; we investigate various statistical distance measures from the point ofview of discovering low distortion embeddings into low dimensional spaces. Morespecifically; we consider the Mahalanobis distance measure; the Bhattacharyya class ofdivergences and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We present a dimensionality reductionmethod based on the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma for the Mahalanobis measure thatachieves arbitrarily low distortion. By using the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma again; wefurther demonstrate that the Bhattacharyya distance admits dimensionality reduction witharbitrarily low additive error. We also examine the question of embeddability into metricspaces for these distance measures due to the availability of efficient indexing schemes onmetric spaces. We provide explicit constructions of point sets under the Bhattacharyya …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2009,12
Aggregate skyline join queries: Skylines with aggregate operations over multiple relations,Arnab Bhattacharya; B Palvali Teja,Abstract: The multi-criteria decision making; which is possible with the advent of skylinequeries; has been applied in many areas. Though most of the existing research isconcerned with only a single relation; several real world applications require finding theskyline set of records over multiple relations. Consequently; the join operation over skylineswhere the preferences are local to each relation; has been proposed. In many of thosecases; however; the join often involves performing aggregate operations among some of theattributes from the different relations. In this paper; we introduce such queries as" aggregateskyline join queries". Since the naive algorithm is impractical; we propose three algorithmsto efficiently process such queries. The algorithms utilize certain properties of skyline sets;and processes the skylines as much as possible locally before computing the join …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1206.6646,2012,11
Hybrid hbase: Leveraging flash ssds to improve cost per throughput of hbase,Anurag Awasthi; Avani Nandini; Arnab Bhattacharya; Priya Sehgal,Abstract Column-oriented data stores; such as BigTable and HBase; have successfullypaved the way for managing large key-value datasets with random accesses. At the sametime; the declining cost of flash SSDs have enabled their use in several applicationsincluding large databases. In this paper; we explore the feasibility of introducing flash SSDsfor HBase. Since storing the entire user data is infeasible due to impractically large costs; weperform a qualitative and supporting quantitative assessment of the implications of storingthe system components of HBase in flash SSDs. Our proposed Hybrid HBase systemperforms 1.5-2 times better than a complete disk-based system on the YCSB benchmarkworkloads. This increase in performance comes at a relatively low cost overhead.Consequently; Hybrid HBase exhibits the best performance in terms of cost per …,Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Management of Data,2012,9
Minimum spanning tree on spatio-temporal networks,Viswanath Gunturi; Shashi Shekhar; Arnab Bhattacharya,Abstract Given a spatio-temporal network whose edge properties vary with time; a time-sub-interval minimum spanning tree (TSMST) is a collection of minimum spanning trees whereeach tree is associated with one or more time intervals; during these time intervals; the totalcost of this spanning tree is the least among all spanning trees. The TSMST problem aims toidentify a collection of distinct minimum spanning trees and their respective time-sub-intervals. This is an important problem in spatio-temporal application domains such aswireless sensor networks (eg; energy-efficient routing). As the ranking of candidatespanning trees is non-stationary over a given time interval; computing TSMST ischallenging. Existing methods such as dynamic graph algorithms and kinetic data structuresassume separable edge weight functions. In contrast; we propose novel algorithms to find …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2010,9
Mining statistically significant substrings using the chi-square statistic,Mayank Sachan; Arnab Bhattacharya,Abstract The problem of identification of statistically significant patterns in a sequence ofdata has been applied to many domains such as intrusion detection systems; financialmodels; web-click records; automated monitoring systems; computational biology;cryptology; and text analysis. An observed pattern of events is deemed to be statisticallysignificant if it is unlikely to have occurred due to randomness or chance alone. We use thechi-square statistic as a quantitative measure of statistical significance. Given a string ofcharacters generated from a memoryless Bernoulli model; the problem is to identify thesubstring for which the empirical distribution of single letters deviates the most from thedistribution expected from the generative Bernoulli model. This deviation is captured usingthe chi-square measure. The most significant substring (MSS) of a string is thus defined …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,8

Caching stars in the sky: a semantic caching approach to accelerate skyline queries,Arnab Bhattacharya; B Palvali Teja; Sourav Dutta,Abstract Although multi-criteria decision making has emerged with the advent of skylinequeries; processing such queries for high dimensional datasets remains a time consumingtask. Real-time applications are thus infeasible; especially for non-indexed skylinetechniques where the datasets arrive online. In this paper; we propose a cachingmechanism that uses the semantics of previous skyline queries to improve the processingtime of a new query. In addition to exact queries; such special semantics allow acceleratingrelated queries. We achieve this by generating partial results guaranteed to be in the skylinesets. We also propose an index structure for efficient organization of the cached queries thatimprove the efficiency. Experiments show the efficiency and scalability of our proposedmethods.,International Conference on Database and Expert systems Applications,2011,6
Most significant substring mining based on chi-square measure,Sourav Dutta; Arnab Bhattacharya,Abstract Given the vast reservoirs of sequence data stored worldwide; efficient mining ofstring databases such as intrusion detection systems; player statistics; texts; proteins; etc.has emerged as a great challenge. Searching for an unusual pattern within long strings ofdata has emerged as a requirement for diverse applications. Given a string; the problemthen is to identify the substrings that differs the most from the expected or normal behavior;ie; the substrings that are statistically significant (ie; less likely to occur due to chance alone).To this end; we use the chi-square measure and propose two heuristics for retrieving the top-k substrings with the largest chi-square measure.

Finding top-k similar pairs of objects annotated with terms from an ontology,Arnab Bhattacharya; Abhishek Bhowmick; Ambuj K Singh,Abstract With the growing focus on semantic searches; an increasing number ofstandardized ontologies are being designed to describe data. We investigate the querying ofobjects described by a tree-structured ontology. Specifically; we consider the case of findingthe top-k best pairs of objects that have been annotated with terms from such an ontologywhen the object descriptions are available only at runtime. We consider three distancemeasures. The first one defines the object distance as the minimum pairwise distancebetween the sets of terms describing them and the second one defines the distance as theaverage pairwise term distance. The third and most useful distance measure—earth mover'sdistance—finds the best way of matching the terms and computes the distancecorresponding to this best matching.

Our method can also be used for the multiple alignment of more thantwo proteins. It is superior to the existing methods that depend on the order of proteins sincewe consider all the proteins at once. Our motif finding method consists of the following steps:1. Protein subsequences are mapped to points in a multi-dimensional space. 2. Spatially tightclusters of these points are found such that most or all of these proteins are represented in eachcluster. 3. A dependency graph is constructed with the clusters as vertices and directed edgesbetween the non-conflicting vertices. 4. The longest path in the graph is chosen as the motif.Our multiple alignment algorithm adds another step: 5.

Prediction of Growth Parameters of In Vitro Microtubules in Association with Different Isoforms of Tau,Arnab Bhattacharya; Ambuj K Singh,ABSTRACT Microtubules are cellular organelles that are important for many cellularprocesses including cell shape and cell division. Microtubules grow and shorten by aprocess called the dynamic instability. The dynamics of microtubules can be regulated bydifferent microtubule associated proteins such as tau. Predicting the behavior ofmicrotubules for a hitherto unseen condition of tau from a database of already performedexperiments with other conditions of tau will guide the biologists in performing futureexperiments and exploring unusual values. We employ two different methods of prediction–nearest neighbor and surface fitting. The nearest neighbor method first looks at theneighbors of a condition and its relationship with them. It then applies the average change ofall similar relationships in the database to the neighbors to predict. The surface fitting …,*,*,*
