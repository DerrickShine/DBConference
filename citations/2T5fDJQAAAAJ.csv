To this end; a functional magneticresonance imaging workflow was defined; which participants had to either simulate or run inorder to produce some provenance representation; from which a set of identified querieshad to be implemented and executed. Sixteen teams responded to the challenge; andsubmitted their inputs. In this paper; we present the challenge workflow and queries; andsummarize the participants' contributions.

Querying and creating visualizations by analogy,Carlos E Scheidegger; Huy T Vo; David Koop; Juliana Freire; Cláudio T Silva,While there have been advances in visualization systems; particularly in multi-viewvisualizations and visual exploration; the process of building visualizations remains a majorbottleneck in data exploration. We show that provenance metadata collected during thecreation of pipelines can be reused to suggest similar content in related visualizations andguide semi-automated changes. We introduce the idea of query-by-example in the context ofan ensemble of visualizations; and the use of analogies as first-class operations in a systemto guide scalable interactions. We describe an implementation of these techniques inVisTrails; a publicly-available; open-source system.,Visualization and Computer Graphics; IEEE Transactions on,2007,135
Tackling the provenance challenge one layer at a time,Carlos Scheidegger; David Koop; Emanuele Santos; Huy Vo; Steven Callahan; Juliana Freire; Cláudio Silva,Abstract VisTrails is a new workflow and provenance management system that providessupport for scientific data exploration and visualization. Whereas workflows have beentraditionally used to automate repetitive tasks; for applications that are exploratory in nature;change is the norm. VisTrails uses a new change-based provenance mechanism; whichwas designed to handle rapidly evolving workflows. It uniformly and automatically capturesprovenance information for data products and for the evolution of the workflows used togenerate these products. In this paper; we describe how the VisTrails provenance data areorganized in layers and present a first approach for querying this data that we developed totackle the Provenance Challenge queries.

These techniques are implemented in VisTrails; an open-source provenance-enabled scientific work flow system that can be combined with a widerange of tools; libraries; and visualization systems. We will show di erent scenarios wherethese techniques can be used to simplify the notoriously hard tasks of creating and refiningwork flows.,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,110
Viscomplete: Automating suggestions for visualization pipelines,David Koop; Carlos E Scheidegger; Steven P Callahan; Juliana Freire; Cláudio T Silva,Building visualization and analysis pipelines is a large hurdle in the adoption of visualizationand workflow systems by domain scientists. In this paper; we propose techniques to helpusers construct pipelines by consensus-automatically suggesting completions based on adatabase of previously created pipelines. In particular; we compute correspondencesbetween existing pipeline subgraphs from the database; and use these to predict sets oflikely pipeline additions to a given partial pipeline. By presenting these predictions in acarefully designed interface; users can create visualizations and other data products moreefficiently because they can augment their normal work patterns with the suggestedcompletions.

noWorkflow: Capturing and analyzing provenance of scripts,Leonardo Murta; Vanessa Braganholo; Fernando Chirigati; David Koop; Juliana Freire,Abstract We propose noWorkflow; a tool that transparently captures provenance of scriptsand enables reproducibility. Unlike existing approaches; noWorkflow is non-intrusive anddoes not require users to change the way they work–users need not wrap their experimentsin scientific workflow systems; install version control systems; or instrument their scripts. Thetool leverages Software Engineering techniques; such as abstract syntax tree analysis;reflection; and profiling; to collect different types of provenance; including detailedinformation about the underlying libraries. We describe how noWorkflow captures multiplekinds of provenance and the different classes of analyses it supports: graph-basedvisualization; differencing over provenance trails; and inference queries.,*,2014,61

Bridging workflow and data provenance using strong links,David Koop; Emanuele Santos; Bela Bauer; Matthias Troyer; Juliana Freire; Cláudio T Silva,Abstract As scientists continue to migrate their work to computational methods; it is importantto track not only the steps involved in the computation but also the data consumed andproduced. While this provenance information can be captured; in existing approaches; itoften contains only weak references between data and provenance. When data files orprovenance are moved or modified; it can be difficult to find the data associated with theprovenance or to find the provenance associated with the data. We propose a persistentstorage mechanism that manages input; intermediate; and output data files; strengtheningthe links between provenance and data. This mechanism provides better support forreproducibility because it ensures the data referenced in provenance information can bereadily located. Another important benefit of such management is that it allows caching of …,*,2010,36

The advantages scientificworkflows offer include rapid and easy workflow design; software and data reuse; scalableexecution; sharing and collaboration; and other advantages that altogether facilitate“reproducible science”. In this context; provenance–information about the origin; context;derivation; ownership; or history of some artifact–plays a key role; since scientists areinterested in examining and auditing the results of scientific experiments. However; in orderto perform such analyses on scientific results as part of extended research collaborations; anadequate environment and tools are required.

This year; we have been in charge of reproducing theexperiments provided by the authors (repeatability); and exploring changes to experimentparameters (workability). In this paper; we assess the SIGMOD repeatability process in termsof participation; review process and results. While the participation is stable in terms ofnumber of submissions; we find this year a sharp contrast between the high participationfrom Asian authors and the low participation from American authors. We also find that mostexperiments are distributed as Linux packages accompanied by instructions on how to setupand run the experiments.

Using provenance to support real-time collaborative design of workflows,Tommy Ellkvist; David Koop; Erik W Anderson; Juliana Freire; Cláudio Silva,Abstract Because designing workflows is a notoriously difficult task; it often requires multipleusers to collaborate. In such scenarios; sharing workflow evolution provenance in a timelymanner is critical. We present an environment where collaborating users can see eachother's changes in real-time. The synchronization of workflow evolution provenance isautomatic; immediate; and unobtrusive; allowing users to see collaborators' changes as theyare made. This enables a richer and fuller method of collaboration. We present the interfaceand algorithm for the synchronization and discuss common scenarios where this mechanismhas been utilized.,*,2008,25

It contains information that is key topreserving the data; to determining their quality and authorship; and to reproduce as well asvalidate the results. In complex experiments and analyses; where multiple tools are used toderive data products; provenance captured by these tools must be combined in order todetermine the complete lineage of the derived products. In this paper we describe amediator-based architecture for integrating provenance information from multiple sources.This architecture contains two key components: a global mediated schema that is generaland capable of representing provenance information represented in different model; anddescribe a new system-independent query API that is general and able to express complexqueries over provenance information from different sources.

With a growing volume of data representedas graphs; the problem of understanding and analyzing the variations in a collection ofgraphs is of increasing importance. We present an algorithm to compute a single summarygraph that efficiently encodes an entire collection of graphs by finding and merging similarnodes and edges. Instead of only merging nodes and edges that are exactly the same; weuse domain-specific comparison functions to collapse similar nodes and edges which allowsus to generate more compact representations of the collection. In addition; we havedeveloped methods that allow users to interactively control the display of these summarygraphs.

Examining statistics of workflow evolution provenance: A first study,Lauro Lins; David Koop; Erik W Anderson; Steven P Callahan; Emanuele Santos; Carlos E Scheidegger; Juliana Freire; Cláudio T Silva,Abstract Provenance (also referred to as audit trail; lineage; and pedigree) capturesinformation about the steps used to generate a given data product. Such informationprovides documentation that is key to determining data quality and authorship; andnecessary for preserving; reproducing; sharing and publishing the data. Workflow design; inparticular for exploratory tasks (eg; creating a visualization; mining a data set); requires aninvolved; trial-and-error process. To solve a problem; a user has to iteratively refine aworkflow to experiment with different techniques and try different parameter values; as sheformulates and test hypotheses. The maintenance of detailed provenance (or history) of thisprocess has many benefits that go beyond documentation and result reproducibility.Notably; it supports several operations that facilitate exploration; including the ability to …,*,2008,16
The provenance of workflow upgrades,David Koop; Carlos E Scheidegger; Juliana Freire; Cláudio T Silva,Abstract Provenance has become an increasingly important part of documenting; verifying;and reproducing scientific research; but as users seek to extend or share results; it may beimpractical to start from the exact original steps due to system configuration differences;library updates; or new algorithms. Although there have been several approaches forcapturing workflow provenance; the problem of managing upgrades of the underlying toolsand libraries orchestrated by workflows has been largely overlooked. In this paper weconsider the problem of maintaining and re-using the provenance of workflow upgrades.

The provenance information recorded can be used; eg; totrace the lineage of a particular result by identifying the data inputs and the processing stepsthat were used to produce it. By and large; the provenance information captured for scripts isfine-grained in the sense that it captures data dependencies at the level of script statement;and do so for every variable within the script.

Designing a provenance-based climate data analysis application,Emanuele Santos; David Koop; Thomas Maxwell; Charles Doutriaux; Tommy Ellqvist; Gerald Potter; Juliana Freire; Dean Williams; Cláudio T Silva,Abstract Climate scientists have made substantial progress in understanding Earth's climatesystem; particularly at global and continental scales. Climate research is now focused onunderstanding climate changes over wider ranges of time and space scales. These effortsare generating ultra-scale data sets at very high spatial resolution. An insightful analysis inclimate science depends on using software tools to discover; access; manipulate; andvisualize the data sets of interest. These data exploration tasks can be complex and time-consuming; and they frequently involve many resources from both the modeling andobservational climate communities.

Using workflow medleys to streamline exploratory tasks,Emanuele Santos; David Koop; Huy T Vo; Erik W Anderson; Juliana Freire; Cláudio Silva,Abstract To analyze and understand the growing wealth of scientific data; complexworkflows need to be assembled; often requiring the combination of loosely-coupledresources; specialized libraries; distributed computing infrastructure; and Web services.However; constructing these workflows is a non-trivial task; especially for users who do nothave programming expertise. This problem is compounded for exploratory tasks; where theworkflows need to be iteratively refined. In this paper; we introduce workflow medleys; a newapproach for manipulating collections of workflows. We propose a workflow manipulationlanguage that includes operations that are common in exploratory tasks and present a visualinterface designed for this language. We briefly discuss how medleys have been applied intwo (real) applications.,*,2009,10

Managing Provenance for Knowledge Discovery and Reuse,David Allen Koop,Abstract Serving as a record of what happened during a scientific process; oftencomputational; provenance has become an important piece of computing. The importance ofarchiving not only data and results but also the lineage of these entities has led to a varietyof systems that capture provenance as well as models and schemas for this information.Despite significant work focused on obtaining and modeling provenance; there has beenlitte work on managing and using this information. Using the provenance from past work; it ispossible to mine common computational structure or determine differences betweenexecutions. Such information can be used to suggest possible completions for partialworkflows; summarize a set of approaches; or extend past work in new directions.

Reorganizing Workflow Evolution Provenance,David Koop; Juliana Freire,Abstract The provenance of related computations presents the opportunity to betterunderstand and explore the differences and similarities of various approaches. As usersdesign and refine workflows; evolution provenance captures the relationships betweenworkflows as actions that mutate one workflow to another. However; such provenance maynot always be the most compact or intuitive. This paper presents algorithms to update andtransform workflow evolution provenance to achieve a representation that better exposes thecorrespondences between computations. We evaluate these algorithms based on theefficiency of the representation as well as the speed of the transformation.,6th USENIX Workshop on the Theory and Practice of Provenance (TaPP 2014),2014,2
Data Management Challenges in Species Distribution Modeling.,Colin Talbert; Marian Talbert; Jeff Morisette; David Koop,Abstract An important component in the fields of ecology and conservation biology isunderstanding the environmental conditions and geographic areas that are suitable for agiven species to inhabit. A common tool in determining such areas is species distributionmodeling which uses computer algorithms to determine the spatial distribution of organisms.Most commonly the correlative relationships between the organism and environmentalvariables are the primary consideration. The data requirements for this type of modelingconsist of known presence and possibly absence locations of the species as well as thevalues of environmental or climatic covariates thought to define the species habitat suitabilityat these locations.

Dataprovenance is an important form of metadata that explains how a particular data productcame about; eg; how and when it was derived in a computational process; which parametersettings and input data were used; etc. Provenance information provides transparency andhelps to explain and interpret data products. Other common uses and applications ofprovenance include quality control; data curation; result debugging; and more generally;'reproducible science'. Scientific workflow systems (eg Kepler; Taverna; VisTrails; andothers) provide controlled environments for developing computational pipelines with built-inprovenance support. Workflow results can then be explained in terms of workflow steps;parameter settings; input data; etc. using provenance that is automatically captured by the …,AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,2013,1
DEFOG: A System for Data-Backed Visual Composition,Lauro Lins; David Koop; Juliana Freire; Claudio Silva,Abstract: As users analyze data; visualization is important for both generating insight duringexploration and displaying information for presentation purposes. While visualizationsystems have been very successful at the latter; their full potential as an aid for dataexploration has yet to be realized. Existing systems have often focused on techniques fordisplaying information; requiring data to conform to specific file formats or allowing verylimited manipulation of the data. In addition; most systems that provide a stronger linkbetween data and visualization sacrifice the freedom of arbitrary composition. In this paper;we present DEFOG; a system that aims to more tightly integrate data exploration andvisualization. DEFOG was designed to manipulate objects and as such; it is able to handle awide range of data types. In addition; it allows flexible data manipulation through both …,*,2011,1
Versioning Version Trees: The Provenance of Actions that Affect Multiple Versions,David Koop,Abstract Change-based provenance captures how an entity is constructed; it can be usednot only as a record of the steps taken but also as a guide during the development ofderivative or new analyses. This provenance is captured as a version tree which stores a setof related entities and the exact changes made in deriving one from another. Version treesare generally viewed as monotonic–new nodes may be added but none are modified ordeleted. However; there are a number of operations (eg; upgrades) where this constraintleads to inefficient and unintuitive new versions. To address this; we propose a version treewithout monotonicity where nodes may be modified and new actions inserted. We alsopropose to track the provenance of these tree changes to ensure that past version trees arenot lost. This provenance is change-based; it links versions of version trees by the actions …,International Provenance and Annotation Workshop,2016,*
Facilitating Scientific Research through Workflows and Provenance on the DataONE Cyberinfrastructure,B Ludaescher; V Cuevas-Vicenttín; P Missier; S Dey; P Kianmajd; Y Wei; D Koop; F Chirigati; I Altintas; K Belhajjame; S Bowers,Abstract Provenance data has numerous applications in science. Two key ones are 1)replication: facilitate the repeatable derivation of results and 2) discovery: enable thelocation of data based on processing history and derivation relationships. The followingscenario illustrates a typical use of provenance data. Alice; a climate scientist; hasdeveloped a VisTrails workflow to prepare Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) data. Afterverifying that the workflow generates data in the desired form; she uses the ReproZip tool tocreate a reproducible package that will enable other scientists to re-run the workflow withouthaving to install and configure the particular libraries she is using. In addition; she exportsthe provenance information of the workflow execution and customizes it through a tool suchas the ProvExplorer; in order to eliminate the information she regards as superfluous.

IDCC14| Practice Paper,Víctor Cuevas-Vicenttín; Parisa Kianmajd; Bertram Ludäscher; Paolo Missier; Fernando Chirigati; Yaxing Wei; David Koop; Saumen Dey,Abstract Scientific workflows and their supporting systems are becoming increasinglypopular for compute-intensive and data-intensive scientific experiments. The advantagesscientific workflows offer include rapid and easy workflow design; software and data reuse;scalable execution; sharing and collaboration; and other advantages that altogetherfacilitate “reproducible science”. In this context; provenance; information about the origin;context; derivation; ownership; or history of some artifact plays a key role; since scientists areinterested in examining and auditing the results of scientific experiments. However; in orderto perform such analyses on scientific results as part of extended research collaborations; anadequate environment and tools are required. Concretely; the need arises for a repositorythat will facilitate sharing scientific workflows and their associated execution traces in an …,*,*,*
