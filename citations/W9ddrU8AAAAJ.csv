Rhythm: Harnessing data parallel hardware for server workloads,Sandeep R Agrawal; Valentin Pistol; Jun Pang; John Tran; David Tarjan; Alvin R Lebeck,Abstract Trends in increasing web traffic demand an increase in server throughput whilepreserving energy efficiency and total cost of ownership. Present work in optimizing datacenter efficiency primarily focuses on the data center as a whole; using off-the-shelfhardware for individual servers. Server capacity is typically increased by adding moremachines; which is cheap; though inefficient in the long run in terms of energy and area. Ourwork builds on the observation that server workload execution patterns are not completelyunique across multiple requests. We present a framework---called Rhythm---for highthroughput servers that can exploit similarity across requests to improve server performanceand power/energy efficiency by launching data parallel executions for request cohorts.

Exploiting accelerators for efficient high dimensional similarity search,Sandeep R Agrawal; Christopher M Dee; Alvin R Lebeck,Abstract Similarity search finds the most similar matches in an object collection for a givenquery; making it an important problem across a wide range of disciplines such as websearch; image recognition and protein sequencing. Practical implementations of HighDimensional Similarity Search (HDSS) search across billions of possible solutions formultiple queries in real time; making its performance and efficiency a significant challenge.Existing clusters and datacenters use commercial multicore hardware to perform search;which may not provide the optimal performance and performance per Watt. This workexplores the performance; power and cost benefits of using throughput accelerators likeGPUs to perform similarity search for query cohorts even under tight deadlines. We proposeoptimized implementations of similarity search for both the host and the accelerator …,ACM SIGPLAN Notices,2016,5
Artist Identification for Renaissance Paintings,Jonathan Jou; Sandeep Agrawal,Abstract Current work in author identification is primarily directed towards musicclassification. Identification of artists by analyzing features of their work has recently gainedinterest. As a multiclass classification problem; potentially applicable machine learningapproaches to the problem are numerous. We propose to extend present work in this area;which uses Naïve Bayes classifiers and multi-class SVMs; by picking a more unique set ofpaintings across prolific artists. We initially use a histogram of colors as our features; andthen we analyze more advanced features like the histogram of gradient orientations (HOG).Due to the large number of features as compared to the number of paintings; we use PCA tocondition features based on the highest variance. We apply several multi-class classificationtechniques like Naïve Bayes; Linear Discriminant Analysis; Logistic Regression; K-Means …,*,2011,2
A many-core architecture for in-memory data processing,Sandeep R Agrawal; Sam Idicula; Arun Raghavan; Evangelos Vlachos; Venkatraman Govindaraju; Venkatanathan Varadarajan; Cagri Balkesen; Georgios Giannikis; Charlie Roth; Nipun Agarwal; Eric Sedlar,Abstract For many years; the highest energy cost in processing has been data movementrather than computation; and energy is the limiting factor in processor design [21]. As thedata needed for a single application grows to exabytes [56]; there is clearly an opportunity todesign a bandwidth-optimized architecture for big data computation by specializinghardware for data movement. We present the Data Processing Unit or DPU; a sharedmemory many-core that is specifically designed for high bandwidth analytics workloads. TheDPU contains a unique Data Movement System (DMS); which provides hardwareacceleration for data movement and partitioning operations at the memory controller that issufficient to keep up with DDR bandwidth. The DPU also provides acceleration for core tocore communication via a unique hardware RPC mechanism called the Atomic …,Proceedings of the 50th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture,2017,1
Harnessing Data Parallel Hardware for Server Workloads,Sandeep R Agrawal,Abstract Trends in increasing web traffic demand an increase in server throughput whilepreserving energy efficiency and total cost of ownership. Present work in optimizing datacenter efficiency primarily focuses on using general purpose processors; however thesemight not be the most efficient platforms for server workloads. Data parallel hardwareachieves high energy efficiency by amortizing instruction costs across multiple data streams;and high throughput by enabling massive parallelism across independent threads. Thesebenefits are considered traditionally applicable to scientific workloads; and common servertasks like page serving or search are considered unsuitable for a data parallel executionmodel.,*,2015,1
Big Data Processing: Scalability with Extreme Single-Node Performance,Venkatraman Govindaraju; Sam Idicula; Sandeep Agrawal; Venkatanathan Vardarajan; Arun Raghavan; Jarod Wen; Cagri Balkesen; Georgios Giannikis; Nipun Agarwal; Eric Sedlar,Contemporary frameworks for data analytics; such as Hadoop; Spark; and Flink seek toallow applications to scale performance flexibly by adding hardware nodes. However; wefind that when the computation on each individual node is optimized; peripheral activitiessuch as creating data partitions; messaging and synchronizing between nodes diminish thespeedup obtainable from adding more hardware. We analyze workloads which distributeoperations on correlated data—such as joins and aggregation found in SQL; text similaritysearches; and image disparity computations. After optimizing computation on efficient;custom processors; we discover challenges in scaling the applications to hundreds of nodeson a high-bandwidth network. We then describe techniques to overcome these challengestowards prototyping a 512-node system which is able to execute SQL queries offloaded …,Big Data (BigData Congress); 2017 IEEE International Congress on,2017,*
A Performance and Power Evaluation of Speculative Dynamic Vectorization,Alexandru Dutu; Sandeep Agrawal,Abstract With the end of Dennard scaling; processor clock frequencies are are no longerunbounded. Under such conditions; speculative approaches based on repetition ofinstructions in loops present an attractive solution to increase IPC. We consider two suchapproaches in this paper; speculative dynamic vectorization of all instructions; andspeculative dynamic vectorization of loads only; based on load speculation; and analyze thepower penalties that come as a logical trade-off to the increased performance. We find thatthe first approach increases power by almost 125% for a modest performance increase of8% in IPC; whereas the second approach increases power by about 97% for a 10%increase in performance. These penalties primarily arise from the number of history tableaccesses that are needed for prediction; and the vector register file that is used to store …,*,2010,*
